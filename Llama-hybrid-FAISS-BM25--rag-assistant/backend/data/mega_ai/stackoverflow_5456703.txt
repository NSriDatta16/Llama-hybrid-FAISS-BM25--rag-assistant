XXX , along with FIXME and TODO , is known in Eclipse as a task tag, and is indexed by the IDE to let you find the spots marked with those tags easily. You can edit such tags in the Eclipse Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Task Tags. As to where it comes from: it probably emerged form the "tags" that programmers spontaneously wrote in their code to quickly mark a given line. While FIXME and TODO are explicit enough, the reason XXX was used could be a combination of these reasons: The string "XXX" does not usually occur in regular source code and is easy to look for with tools such as grep or a simple text search in an editor; Traditionally, "X marks the spot" which needs attention; triple X even more so; The X key is very close to the Command/Alt/Windows keys and is easy to reach, being on the lower row of the keyboard. I can't think of anything else...
