Decision trees are actually made for what you call "related features" (and, since random forests are just ensembles of decision trees, it holds true for them, too). Another name for "related features" would be "nested features", and trees are the very structures that are made for describing nesting. So, when you ask for recommended articles, I think any article on decision trees should make this clear. Just think of a decision tree that first "decides" about the height of a person and then, nested, for each of those height decisions, it makes a decision about weight. And there you have your "related features". But the question then is, why don't those models work for you? To find the reason, I would suggest debugging that gets you step by step from a trivial situation to your actual problem. First, apply random forests (RF) to some standard dataset that is known to work with RF; just use one from any of the many tutorials and examples online. Then you see whether your installation works at all. Then use a very simple version of your dataset with a very simple version of your RF so that you still can see what is going on. Then gradually increase the complexity of both the data and the model until you arrive at your current setting. This should help you isolate the problem.
