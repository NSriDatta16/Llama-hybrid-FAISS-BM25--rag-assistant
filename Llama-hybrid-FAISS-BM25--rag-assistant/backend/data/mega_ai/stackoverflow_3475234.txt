Flex code doesnot(only sometimes) compiles in java+flex (+ BlazeDS+Tomcat ) combined project.a

i am working on a flex+java combined project. My IDE and computer configuration is as follows: Windows 7 Professional, 64-bit, Core2Duo 2.1GHz, 2GB Ram Eclipse (helios) with Flash Builder Premium v4.0 Eclipse plugin Flex=javaEE combined project with BlazeDS v4.0.0.14931 and Apache Tomcat 6 using BlazeDS remote object--RPC for flex+java communication. My Problem is : Any change in java code is compiled immediately and appeared on output when i run the project on server. When i make a small change in Flex code (eg, reposition of a button...anything), and run the project on server, it does make any change on output. Actually it depends on my luck... because it makes change in output randomly. what is is happening??? i tried rebuild, republish, clean , restart server, restarting the IDE, restarting the computer..... all available feature i could think. Also, i created a simple flex project on IDE and compiled it..... everything is compiled and displayed on output. Please HELP ME. Ganesh Tiwari IOE, Pulchowk Campus, TU Nepal
