Why does doing LDA on a outer product of input matrix gives same result as doing PCA of the input matrix?

Why does doing Linear Discrimenant Analysis (LDA) on a outer product of input matrix gives same result as doing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the input matrix? Not exactly sure where this came from and why it works, but the outer product of the input matrix $X^T X$ In PCA they use it to make the matrix square, so they can perform linear discrimant analysis on that matrix. It's also used in Normal equation as the first step, for solving the regression coefficient in linear regression. A geometric interpretation would be very helpful.
