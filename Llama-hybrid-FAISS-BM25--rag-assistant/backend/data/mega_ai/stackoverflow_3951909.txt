specify identity value in linq-to-sql

I am trying to set an identity field's value before inserting the new record into the database, I am trying to save having to needlessly re-map all of the FK fields when I know the destination tables are empty already. I had hoped that this question: How do I MANUALLY set an Identity field in LINQ-To-SQL (IDENTITY INSERT) would answer my problem however having looked it, the accepted answer still doesn't seem to provide a straight forward answer. The field definition is: [Column(Storage = "_ID", AutoSync = AutoSync.OnInsert, DbType = "BigInt NOT NULL IDENTITY", IsPrimaryKey = true, IsDbGenerated = true)] public long ID { get {} set {} } All this does however is ignore any set value and just use the next value in the database. I have found that changing the IsDbGenerated to false only succeeds in having the application thrown an "Cannot insert explicit value for identity column in table 'Project' when IDENTITY_INSERT is set to OFF." exception. Even using the following doesn't help: newDb.ExecuteCommand("SET IDENTITY_INSERT Contact ON"); newDb.SubmitChanges(); newDb.ExecuteCommand("SET IDENTITY_INSERT Contact OFF");
