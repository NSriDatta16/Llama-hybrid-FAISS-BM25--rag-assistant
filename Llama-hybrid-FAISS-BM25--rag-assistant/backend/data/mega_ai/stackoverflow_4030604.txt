You don't, there's nothing to keep track of. Placement new means putting an object at a memory location. The storage for it has already been allocated. You don't call any form of delete on the object itself because that's the job of where you got the storage from. That is, in this: void* memory = operator new(sizeof(int)); // A new (memory) int; // B operator delete(memory); // C A and C are what you should be tracking, not B.
