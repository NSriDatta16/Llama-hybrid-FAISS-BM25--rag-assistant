I know you say you want to install gems from source and all that fun stuff, but I would highly recommend (if you are starting out especially) to go through the following and start using rvm, as it indirectly helps you keep your gems organized. $ bash and rvm install 1.9.2 -C --with-readline-dir=/opt/local,--build=x86_64-apple-darwin10 (presuming you are setting up all your localhost etc on a MacPro) - still not met a windows RoR guy yet ;) then rvm use --create 1.9.2@rails3 for good measure you could do this: $ gem install sqlite3-ruby $ env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config $ gem install rails then if you like rvm 1.9.2@rails3 --default Phewww after all that, when you now install gems they are related to a ruby build.See rvm docs for more info. To test this has worked and you can now manage all your gems nicely: try gem list then rvm system to revert to what you had then rvm 1.9.2@rails3 then gem list This is a nice way to keep your gems organized. Sorry for turning this into a RVM answer, but if you use more than 1 machine rvm helps you stay sane ;) PS: Saves cd'ing into dir with sudo etc etc like Mike suggested...that's not needed if you do it this way.
