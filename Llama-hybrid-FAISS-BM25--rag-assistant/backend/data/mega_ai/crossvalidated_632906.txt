LMM for Repeated Measures tree ring chronology

Having my first go at R and stats. I sampled and analyzed tree rings for different measures (width, density, etc.). There are 3 treatments, 3 plot per treatment, and 5 trees per plot. The ring time series is 2000-2020, and treatment begun in the middle. I would like to test whether there are differences between the 3 treatments in each year. The data looks like this (showing only 'width' as the dependent variable here): 'data.frame': 1197 obs. of 13 variables: $ trtmnt : Factor w/ 3 levels "Control",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ... $ plot : Factor w/ 9 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ tree : Factor w/ 57 levels "3006","3015",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ year : Factor w/ 21 levels "2000","2001",..: 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 ... $ width : int 61 70 74 54 100 100 80 137 121 76 ... I would like to account for the repeated measurements of the individual annual rings of each tree. Especially since the treatment was applied continuously after since it began, until 2020. For that, I tried a LMM in nlme (as well as similar code in glmmTMB, adjusted) with different approaches: Mon_0 So trying to account for the repeated measures, first added year as a random slope with the random tree, then as an autoregressive term. Then both. Each gave a better AIC than the previous. Also, glmmTMB gives better AIC than nlme overall. Mon_tmb0 After the LMM, a pairwise with Tukey in emmeans . I was not able to completely figure how to compute properly an autocorrelation test (to understand if it is even appropriate to use an AR term). acf.1 This appears too simple. Do I need to separate each tree and perform individually? What would be the right code considering my ar1 and random slopes models? Or a different approach completely? Wanted to get some input on whether I am on the right path or not. Any comments suggestions would be valuable. Thanks!
