Sqlite / SQLAlchemy: how to enforce Foreign Keys?

The new version of SQLite has the ability to enforce Foreign Key constraints, but for the sake of backwards-compatibility, you have to turn it on for each database connection separately! sqlite> PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON; I am using SQLAlchemy -- how can I make sure this always gets turned on? What I have tried is this: engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo=True) engine.execute('pragma foreign_keys=on') ...but it is not working!...What am I missing? EDIT: I think my real problem is that I have more than one version of SQLite installed, and Python is not using the latest one! >>> import sqlite3 >>> print sqlite3.sqlite_version 3.3.4 But I just downloaded 3.6.23 and put the exe in my project directory! How can I figure out which .exe it's using, and change it?
