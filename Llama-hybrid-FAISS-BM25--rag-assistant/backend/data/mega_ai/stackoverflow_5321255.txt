Storing Many Booleans in Android

I have a known number of checkboxes (e.g. 100). I want to be able to store these so that I can read them at runtime (and repopulate the checkboxes). I would prefer using SharedPreferences for the storage. What is the best way to store/retrieve these boolean values?
