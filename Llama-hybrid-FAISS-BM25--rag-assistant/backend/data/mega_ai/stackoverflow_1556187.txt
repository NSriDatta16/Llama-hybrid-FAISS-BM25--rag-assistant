Java Desktop.open(File f) reference file within JAR?

It is possible to for Desktop.open(File f) to reference a file located within a JAR? I tried using ClassLoader.getResource(String s) , converting it to a URI, then creating a File from it. But this results in IllegalArgumentException: URI is not hierarchical . URL url = ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader().getResource(...); System.out.println("url=" + url); // url is valid Desktop.getDesktop().open(new File(url.toURI())); A possibility is the answer at JavaRanch , which is to create a temporary file from the resource within the JAR â€“ not very elegant. This is running on Windows XP.
