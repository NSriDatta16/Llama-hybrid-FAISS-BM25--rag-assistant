What is this type of plot called?

Often times in simulation studies, we need to display the various settings in a coherent, well-organized way. I came about such a plot This plot displays 5 characteristics which were varied for a total of $3 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 2 = 72$ total simulation scenarios comparing 4 methods. What is the name for this plot?
