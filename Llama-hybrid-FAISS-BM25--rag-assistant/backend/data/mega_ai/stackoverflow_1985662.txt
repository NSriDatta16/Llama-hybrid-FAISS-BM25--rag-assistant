How to make a generic redirect when accessed to a / declared in the routes.rb on Ruby on Rails

I have several urls declared in the routes.rb, such as aaa/index.html aaa/bbb.html bbb/index.html bbb/ccc/index so it looks like a non-rails site. I want it so that when a user accesses aaa/ or bbb/ccc/ they would automatically be redirected to the action routed to the index.html of the corresponding directory. currently I am writing an additional entry to the routes.rb, for ex aaa/index.html :controller=> 'aaa', :action => 'index' aaa/ :controller=> 'aaa', :action => 'index' but find it quite redundant to do so. Is there a more elegant way to do this?
