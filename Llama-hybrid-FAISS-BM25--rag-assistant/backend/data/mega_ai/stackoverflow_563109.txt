What is the most elegant way to cast a variable you just received as an argument?

More specifically, what's the most elegant way to cast the Graphics object in a paint() call up to a Graphics2D object? public void paint(Graphics g) { // How do I convert/cast/etc the g variable to a Graphics2D object? } Or am I missing the point here? Is there a better way to handle this in general?
