Ok, so I've done my best to simulate your data. I'll be doing the analysis in R. Here is a sample # A tibble: 10 x 4 temps id times y 1 warm 6 before 3 2 warm 6 before 5 3 warm 6 before 3 4 warm 6 later 5 5 warm 5 later 4 6 warm 8 later 2 7 warm 9 before 3 8 warm 5 before 1 9 warm 4 before 0 10 cold 2 before 0 The rooms have been sampled multiple times, before and after under both warm and cool temps. Because the data are counts and because rooms are measured several times, we can use a generalized mixed effects model. It is a bit technical, but from what you've told me I think this is the best approach. The model essentially assumes that the effect of temperature and time are fixed; they effect the outcome in the same way regardless of room. However, each room has their own baseline average number of bacteria. Here is how I might fit my model. model = glmer(y~temps + times + (1|id), data = dd, family = poisson()) If you are interested in the effect of temp, we just look at the coefficient. The coefficients can be found by using the summary function.

Cold rooms in the before period have an average count of $\exp(0.76)=2.13$ , so that means warm rooms in the before period have a count of $2.14\cdot 1.63 = 3.48$ . I can help you implement this if you like. I know the details can be kind of tricky. Just let me know
