The main reason is to 1) prevent overfitting and 2) ease interpretation. To understand 1), compare two cases; in one case we only use pre-period averages and in another case we use every individual time period. Both cases have very good pre-treatment fit of the dependent variable of interest between the synthetic control and our treated unit. We will be much more trusting in our synthetic control that uses averages because then we have essentially shown that there is co-movement in the outcome of interest across the control units and treated unit, without directly targeting this co-movement to fit on . If we included all time periods, we are ex-ante forcing the model to choose a synthetic control that fit all of the pre-period well, i.e., we at risk of overfitting. That doesn't mean that by fitting all time periods always overfits, but it could be and thus isn't very credible. For 2), note that subject context is extremely important when doing synthetic controls. With enough varied controls we can get a perfect pre-treatment fit but that synthetic control would be garbage. The only time we can use synthetic controls is if we have a case where we don't have a perfect control but rather have a pool of similar non-treated units to compare to. For a credible synthetic control exercise we need to show that the weights/controls make sense logically. The clarity of the exercise is stronger when we have fewer measures. Synthetic controls is not magic, we need to really believe in the validity of the synthetic control we create. There is absolutely no mathematical reason why you could not include every period instead of taking the average! We can treat each time period as a completely separate piece of data (i.e., then the canned code would take a mean over a singleton). For this reason I disagree with Marti's answer.
