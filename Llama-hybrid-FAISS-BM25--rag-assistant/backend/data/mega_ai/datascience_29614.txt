The weight matrix $W_1$ for input (document) and weight matrix $W_2$ for output (words) do not need to be of the same dimension. Say you have $M$ documents and $V$ words, then $W_1$ would be of dimension $M \times H$ and $W_2$ would be of dimension $H \times V$. $H$ is the dimension for embeddings. In other words, as long as the input and output of the neural network shares the same embedding dimension, then the model can work.
