That file is very specific to using a database. However, using a file is not difficult. I would suggest that rather than using a plain file, consider using a database like sqlite which uses files rather than a fully fledged database. If you are set on using files, you can manipulate files very easily in php. Some examples are below: $file = fopen('path/to/file', 'r+'); fputs($file, 'email@domain.com'); // fputs() is an alias for fwrite, they are interchangable This page details the different modes for opening a file with fopen() . You will want to pay extra special attention to whether the mode opens the file pointer at the start or end of a file. If you wrote some emails to the file, then later opened the file again with the file pointer at the start to write more emails, you would overwrite the existing data. This is a good reason to use a database as it requires a bigger screw up to delete your existing data. fputs() is used to write lines to your file. Obviously you can pass a variable rather than the string I've put hard coded in the example, just make sure the variable is some meaningful string. You can't, for example, pass an array of emails. You would have to loop over the array and call fputs() for each email.
