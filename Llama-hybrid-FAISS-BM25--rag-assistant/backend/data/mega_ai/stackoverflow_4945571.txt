just implement - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint touchLocation = [touch locationInView:self.view]; //your logic } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { //your logic } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { //your logic } in your code..I think rest of the think you can figured out.
