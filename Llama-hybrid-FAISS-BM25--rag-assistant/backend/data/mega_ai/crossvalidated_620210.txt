In R Limma's `normalizeMedianValues` function, why is its operations preceded with a log transformation followed by an exponential transformation?

In the function normalizeMedianValues in the package limma , column counts are normalised such that their column medians are equal to the average of the column medians. What I'd like to understand is why the medians are first log transformed, followed by the subtraction of the mean medians, then reversed with an exp() function. What is the mathematical or statistical reasoning behind this? What happens if you don't do the log or exp transformation? Here is the code: normalizeMedianValues
