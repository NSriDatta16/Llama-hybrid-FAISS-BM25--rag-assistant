Some browsers support downloading of fonts. See Webfonts.info and FontEmbedding.com for everything you could want to know about the subject, including technical and legal issues, and which browsers support which mechanisms . The specification at the W3C includes some examples, like this, but not everyone supports them: @font-face { font-family: OCRB; src: local(OCRB), url(http://site.com/fonts/ocrb.ttf); } p { font-family: OCRB, monospace; }
