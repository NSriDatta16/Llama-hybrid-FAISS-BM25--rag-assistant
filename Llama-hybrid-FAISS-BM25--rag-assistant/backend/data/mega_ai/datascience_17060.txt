Unable to perform Keras Reshape to an input to match convolution output

I am newbie to whole tensorflow and keras. I am trying to implement icGAN in which I feed a conditional vector of length 'ny' after first convolution(I have added network architecture for better insight) . I am having trouble merging the output of first convolution with the condition vector. I tried using reshape but it gave me weird errors. Below is my code snippet. The below code does not give error but I want to know is how should I change the y which will be of shape (batch_dim, 100) to (batchdim, 32,32,100). x = Input(shape=img_dim, name="discriminator_input") y = Input(shape=cat_dim, name="category_input") list_f = [128, 256,512] # First conv x = Convolution2D(64, 3, 3, subsample=(2, 2), name="disc_convolution2d_1", border_mode="same")(disc_input) x = LeakyReLU(0.2)(x) #How to reshape the cat_input. # Next convs for i, f in enumerate(list_f): name = "disc_convolution2d_%s" % (i + 2) x = Convolution2D(f, 3, 3, subsample=(2, 2), name=name, border_mode="same")(x) x = BatchNormalization(mode=bn_mode, axis=bn_axis)(x) x = LeakyReLU(0.2)(x) Any help would be appreciated.
