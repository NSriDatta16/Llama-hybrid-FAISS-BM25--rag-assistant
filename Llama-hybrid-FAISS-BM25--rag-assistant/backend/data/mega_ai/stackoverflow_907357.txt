The byte , sbyte , short and ushort data types do not have designated suffixes. However, integer literal can be assigned to variables of these data types and will be implicitly converted, assuming that the value is appropriate for storage in the variable. Just for the record here are the defined literals in C#: uint: U or u long: L or l ulong: UL or ul float: F or f decimal: M or m
