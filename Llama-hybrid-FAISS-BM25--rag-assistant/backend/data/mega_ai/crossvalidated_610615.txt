Nice data - ugly residuals - too many puzzle pieces

Dear statistics fans, I am absolutely clueless in an analysis and hope you can help because I have nobody else to ask right now and got totally lost in four statistics books and a zillion tutorials over the past five weeks. And here is an overview of what I am trying to do (also see toy graph for visual aid): I try modelling a continuous response variable as function of a whole bunch of predictors along a land use gradient (ie a succession of typical anthropogenic land use classes like agriculture, meadow... to unused, protected landscape) I got observation plots in five land uses (A-E in the graph) along that land use gradient, replicated in two different ecosystems; the ecosystems got equal numbers of observations, only some land uses are underrepresented/unbalanced there is some spatial autocorrelation as within ecosystems and land uses the oberservation plots are clumped in the landscaped the two ecosystems generally have a different baseline level in the response var (orange vs darkred solid line), but the overall pattern is the same; only when plotting histograms of the response vars their distribution always looks bimodal (red solid line in small inset) I would like to include the two ecosystems as a fixed factor (same for the five land uses) as I am interested in their difference, not seeking generalization across these the predictors along the land use gradient are of two types: i) the ones that follow the same trend all across the gradient, some increasing, others decreasing (blue dashed lines), and ii) the ones that only have a non-zero trend across half of the gradient and are often zeros or close to zero in the other half of the gradient (green dotted lines) What has happened so far: a predecessor of mine tried modelling the whole gradient with linear models, but got no significant results because the response var is decreasing to either end hence I set out and separated the dataset in two halves (using the land use ‘C’ in both sets) and tried modelling this with linear and linear mixed models; it is a pity though, as that separation also decreases the number of observations drastically for each subset also, this complicates matters in so far, that in order to interprete the gradient as a whole I was advised to use the same set of predictors in both models, even so some of them got a lot of zeros or close to zero in 2 out of 3 land use locations of a half gradient anyways, I tried starting with data visualizations and plotting, did anovas between land uses that were promising followed by extensive correlation checks and PCAs of all predictors, compiled some nice predictor sets that have no correlation greater |0.75| (although I had to drop some nice predictor vars in the process, unfortunately) I started out with lm() and stepAIC(), then added interactions for a few hand-picked ecologically meaningful term combinations then moved over to lmer() to include the nestedness of land use within ecosystem, but then I got confused if that is correct, as that means both factors are introduced in the random part of the model, but I wanted to keep them as fixed factors ... ? then I tried lme() ans stepAIC() and also doodled around with a variance structure to allow for different variances per ecosystem and land use but I ain’t sure what I am doing there and if I do it correctly, as the same factors I used the variance structure for are also my main fixed effects of interest then I took the book by Zuur & Ieno ( Mixed effects models and extensions in ecology with R, 2009 ) an tried to work through their stepwise model construction process with gls() and lme() but checking residual plots of the models is not really fun, I believe partly because of the zeros in predictors, and some oddballs like in one particular ecosystem-land use combination having all residuals turning to zero variance I then tried standardizing and transforming the hell out of predictors and even response variables, but nothing really helps much, plus I bet you people know a way nicer method than that My Goal: get together a data analysis in R that adequately deals with the data I have (n find a proper way of identifying the most important predictors and their effect sizes on my response variable in such a way that the outcomes are still interpreteable in ecologically meaningful terms (e.g. no four-way-interactions please etc) I need to get this done with my limited understanding of statistical mathematics, yet I am eager to learn and understand new things (just not all at once) I would be really grateful if one of you could hint me to the right kind of analysis, as right now I ain’t even sure what I should look for and in which order I should implement a zillion bits and pieces of advice into one stringent analysis. I feel like I get a lot of suggestions, yet lack the understanding to meaningfully add them together and am often not sure if adding more things just messes everything else up. Thank you so very much in advance!
