What is `Multi-scale` in Multiscale Convolutional Network?

I was reading an article on Deep Learning and came across this term called Multi-scale Neural Network . I fully understand the concepts of convolutional neural network but it is a bit difficult to understand the multi-scale part in it. Could anyone please help me? Thanks in advance!
