@Mark White mentioned the link already but for those of you who do not have much time to check the link, here's the exact properly referenced answer: Origin of 'regression' The term "regression" was coined by Francis Galton in the 19th century to describe a biological phenomenon. The phenomenon was that the heights of descendants of tall ancestors tend to regress down towards a normal average (a phenomenon also known as regression toward the mean) (Galton, reprinted 1989). For Galton, regression had only this biological meaning (Galton, 1887) , but his work was later extended by Udny Yule and Karl Pearson to a more general statistical context (Pearson, 1903).
