What about We assume that the sepal length of these three species of iris flowers depends on petal length and petal width in a somwhat similar way. Thus, it makes sense to learn from one species to better understand the relationship in the other two species. If you want to further go into implied assumptions like exchangeability (there's of course also the linearity of the relationship, normality of random effects and so on), perhaps We assume that we know nothing up-front about whether we would expect one of these three species to have a higher average sepal length, or a sepal length that depends more strongly on the petal length and width. Of course, in the particular example things are especially tricky, because you only have three species so estimating the between species standard deviation is difficult. Additionally, you can know a lot from the literature without looking at the data that would make exchangeability questionable.
