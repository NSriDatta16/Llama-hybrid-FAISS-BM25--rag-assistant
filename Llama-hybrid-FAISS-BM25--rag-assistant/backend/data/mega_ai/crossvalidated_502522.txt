Sklearn Average_Precision_Score vs. AUC

Can someone explain in an intuitive way the difference between Average_Precision_Score and AUC? I read the documentation and understand that they are calculated slightly differently. But what is the real difference? Also Average_Precision_Score is calculated - if I am correct - in terms of Recall over Precision. Not sure I understand. Thanks in advance.
