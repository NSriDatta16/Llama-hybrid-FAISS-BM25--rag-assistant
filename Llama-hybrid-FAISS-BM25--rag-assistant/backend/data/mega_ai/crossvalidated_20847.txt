What I would do is to use day-of-the=wekk averages for the 4 months surrounding the "missing month" to obtain initial estimates of the daily vales for the "missing month". I would then entertain a model that used day-of=the-week and week-of-the-year indicators. I would then detect anomalies which would then allow me to replace the "current values" for the "missing month" and re-iterate until some convergence was reached.
