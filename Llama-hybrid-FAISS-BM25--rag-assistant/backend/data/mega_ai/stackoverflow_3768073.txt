Well, actually you can do it in different ways. The best solution is some script which checks the UserAgent first. I kow, its not that save, 'cause its easy to change the agent but why should someone do it and with which benefit of it ;) So this should be your solution. Also you can optimize the websites to the specfic target device/browser. For example, for devices like iPhone, Android or WinMob you ould use Javascript Frameworks to work withthe website content. I made a little post on another question which could help you aswell: Is there an equivilent of jQTouch that covers iPhone, Android, WebOS and Blackberry OS?
