Well not sure this answers you well but i would use PDF Sharp or Migra doc to genereate pdf file from your data and print from there, this way i would not have to do Printer DMP settings (I guess) The easiest and quickest solution is to use the Visual Basic PowerPack's PrintForm control (You can use it in C# projects as well). http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/bb735936.aspx Just drag the control on to your form then from code call printForm1.Print(); This will print whatever is on the form, so just design your report on a form then call that code, and you're done. look at Print the form (Visual C #) you can also use VB power Pack
