Dirichlet Process vs Hierarchical Dirichlet Process: coupling among transitions on infinite HMM

I'm new to nonparametric Bayesian, and I am reading a paper about beam sampling for the infinite hidden Markov model . In the paper, it is mentioned that since there is no coupling among the transitions if one uses the Dirichlet process, we need to have a hierarchical Dirichlet process instead of a Dirichlet process for the hidden Markov model. I am having a hard time understanding the intuition behind the need for the coupling and how the hierarchical process introduces this coupling. I went on and read some other papers ( Dirichlet Process , Hierarchical Dirichlet Proces ), but still, I cannot grab the concept it yet. Any reading suggestions or explanations will be helpful.
