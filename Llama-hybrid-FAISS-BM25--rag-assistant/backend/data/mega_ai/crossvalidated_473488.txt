Neural network to find a linear equation representing the data points

Is it possible to use a neural network to do linear regression? Like can you use a neural network to output coefficients/weights (a1, a2, ..., an, and b) of a linear equation representing the features (x1, ..., xn)? y = a1 * x1 + a2 * x2 + .... + an * xn + b
