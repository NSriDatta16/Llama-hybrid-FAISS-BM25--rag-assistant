Is the variance between the data and the curve bigger than the variance between the two curves, averaged over patients? If you want a p-value I suppose you could assume normality of errors and use the F-test on ratio of variances. The loess fit isn't a formal fit, so this is not a formal test. Could you use a formal fit? Have a look at the graphs. Do they look the same across patients?
