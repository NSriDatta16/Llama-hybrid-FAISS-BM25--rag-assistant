I don't follow all of your question, but it sounds like you're looking for a plot that is often used for the opposite problem: seeing how a class predicts a feature. JMP uses a means diamond plot by default for that question: The width is proportion to the counts and the heights reflect the confidence intervals . To show how the probably changes with the feature, you can plot the fitted logistic regression with points jittered to show density (vertical position is meaningless except for being above or below the curve). It's pretty boring for your data which makes a perfect split, but if I add in a couple misclassifications, it gets more useful.
