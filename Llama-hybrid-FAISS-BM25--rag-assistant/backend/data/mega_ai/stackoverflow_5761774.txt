As you are a self-professed "not strong" programmer, I think it would be helpful to point out a couple of other things. Even in the best of circumstances, this is going to involve testing (on average) half of the values in the hash table. If the value is not there, then it will test all of them. If there are many entries in the map, this will be expensive. Bear in mind that equality of Lists is defined to be based on pair-wise testing the list elements using the Object.equals(Object) . If you are actually trying to find "value2" in one of the lists, then this approach won't work. You need a nested loop; e.g. @kingdavies solution. But the point is that that will be even more expensive. There is a hint of "code smell" about this code snippet. I can't be sure without looking at the real application, but a mapping from a String to a list of Objects smells of "object denial"; i.e. trying to use generic collection types to avoid creating a custom class.
