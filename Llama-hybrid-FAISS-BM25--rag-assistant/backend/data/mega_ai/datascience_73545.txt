Has anyone tried to search for new basic machine learning operations like convolution and pooling?

From Neural Architecture Search: A Survey , first published in 2018: Moreover, common search spaces are also based on predefined building blocks, such as different kinds of convolutions and pooling, but do not allow identifying novel building blocks on this level; going beyond this limitation might substantially increase the power of NAS. I wonder now if somebody tried that since this was written or if anybody has some thoughts about the feasibility of this idea.
