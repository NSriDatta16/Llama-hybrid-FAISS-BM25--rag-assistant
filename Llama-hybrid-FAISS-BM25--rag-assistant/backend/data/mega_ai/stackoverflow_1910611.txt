Short answer? No. But the question uses English-language ideas that don't lend themselves to computer programming. What does "encourage" mean? What is "good programming practice"? Syntax highlighting and auto-indent? Surely any language can do that. Lint-style warnings? Not terribly hard. Style policing? Well, we'd had to admit C if that was the criteria. Good programming practice arises naturally from good design. It's quite hard for clever coders to write bad code in any language if the design is clean and simple. Conversely bad practice follows from bad design. The tricky part is working out where a design stops being good and starts being bad. This is the #1 question in software design and sadly there is no silver bullet. Those lovely Design Patterns start looking awfully ugly once you have several of them implemented in your app.
