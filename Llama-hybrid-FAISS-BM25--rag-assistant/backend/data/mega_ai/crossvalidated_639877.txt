$\rho( A, B ) = 0.9999$, $\rho( X, Y ) = 0.9999$, $\sigma_A = \sigma_X$, $\sigma_B = \sigma_Y$, but $\rho( A - B, X - Y) = 0.88$

I have four time series $A,B,X,Y$ . I found that somehow, $\rho( A, B ) = 0.9999$ , $\rho( X, Y ) = 0.9999$ , I have also validated that $\sigma_A = \sigma_X$ , $\sigma_B = \sigma_Y$ In other words $A$ and $X$ , $B$ and $Y$ are really almost just two pairs of near-identical time series. However I observe that $\rho( A - B, X - Y) = 0.85$ [EDITED after Alex's answer] I defined a "modified correlation coefficients" $\phi(X, Y) = \frac{X \cdot Y}{ \sqrt{X \cdot X} \sqrt{Y \cdot Y } } $ here $\cdot$ means a dot product. I still observe that $\phi( A, B ) = 0.9999$ , $\phi( X, Y ) = 0.9999$ . so I think I can really conlude that they are near-identical time series ... But I still observe that $\rho( A - B, X - Y) = 0.85$ . $\phi( A - B, X - Y) = 0.87$ slightly higher but not much. What could be the cause that there is such big drop in correlation (or modified correlation) after I subtract them?
