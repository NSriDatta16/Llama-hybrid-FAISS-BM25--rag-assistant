To reduce the number of columns produced by onehot encoding one solution might be target encoding . That is, if you have the following table : Alice Bob Dave Other_features Target 0 1 1 0 X1 0 1 1 1 0 X2 1 2 1 1 0 X3 0 3 1 1 1 X4 1 4 1 1 1 X5 1 5 1 1 1 X6 1 6 0 0 1 X7 0 7 0 0 1 X8 0 You can create a table : Group Group_Avg_target Alice,Bob 0.333 Alice, Bob, Dave 1 Dave 0 Then replace the values in your dataset : Group_Avg_target Other_features Target 0 0.333 X1 0 1 0.333 X2 1 2 0.333 X3 0 3 1 X4 1 4 1 X5 1 5 1 X6 1 6 0 X7 0 7 0 X8 0 That way you'll end up with one column. That mainly works if you have enough instances to have meaningfull averages by groups of people. I would not recommand using that in general as you would lose a lot of interactions betweeen people, which might be bad to explain what happened. Note : to use this solution you need to make sure that there is no 'target leak', ie use the average calculated on train to encode your test dataset.
