I assume you're trying to do this because you want to see where the change in value came from. You already stated the way I've always done it: create a property, and break on the set accessor (except that you must then always use that set accessor for this to work). Basically, I'd say that since a private field is only storage you can't break on it because the private field isn't a breakable instruction.
