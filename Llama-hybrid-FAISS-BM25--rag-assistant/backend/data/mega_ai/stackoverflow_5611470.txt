Convert Core Data to NSString

I want to create a backup function in my app iCollege ( App Store ). The data should be sended via email to any email address. I'm able to send it as attachement but I want to send it as a link. Is it possible? I tried to load the Core Data file in NSData and then to NSString but it doesn't work. I don't if it's important but I use a persistent store with the storage type NSBinaryStoreType. Is it possible? And how can I do this? EDIT: Ok. I try it with the attachement. First I registered a file type but in the email the file is shown with a questionmark and I'm not able to open it. I attache my file like this: NSData *archievedData = [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:[NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:path encoding:NSISOLatin1StringEncoding error:nil]]; [mailViewController addAttachmentData:archievedData mimeType:@"application/icollege" fileName:@"iCollege.ccd"]; This is my Info.plist: CFBundleDocumentTypes CFBundleTypeMIMETypes application/icollege CFBundleTypeName iCollege Backup Document CFBundleTypeRole Editor LSItemContentTypes com.fischer.ccd ... UTExportedTypeDeclarations UTTypeConformsTo public.data UTTypeDescription iCollege Backup Document UTTypeIdentifier com.fischer.iCollege UTTypeTagSpecification public.filename-extension ccd public.mime-type application/icollege
