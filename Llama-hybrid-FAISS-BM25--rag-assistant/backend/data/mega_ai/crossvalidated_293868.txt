Is a Logistic Regression appropriate?

I have some questionnaire responses that are in the form of a likert scale (1 = Excellent, 2 = good, 3 = unsure, 2 = not good, 5 = Bad etc.). I have 12 different questions in this format and a respondent number of 81. I have many factors that I want to check for significance with regards to the above 12 outcomes. For example: profession, workplace, research area, as well as some binary yes/no responses. One example is: is there a difference between PhD students' and Professors' opinions with regards to animal research (1-5 likert response). Is a Logistic Regression the right way to go about analysing this data? Because I have so many different outcomes I want to test, I was not sure if this would generate too many P-values and thus create too much room for error. Thank you.
