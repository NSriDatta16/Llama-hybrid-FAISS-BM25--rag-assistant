Machine learning guy here -- as much as I love the stats folks ML usually wins the day in real-world applications, and heteroscedasticity is one such common occurrence. A more general solution that is non-parametric and works for this and other (even highly) nonlinear regression problems is to just use quantile regression with a bagged decision tree. You can follow some links at Matlab to learn more (their examples are easily transferable to Python or R).
