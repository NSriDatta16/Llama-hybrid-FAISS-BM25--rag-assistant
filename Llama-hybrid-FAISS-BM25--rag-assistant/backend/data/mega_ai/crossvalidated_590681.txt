Is it acceptable to create a dummy variable out of a quantitative variable?

I have a variable that takes the value of 5% or 10% throughout the data set. Is it okay to transform this variable into a dummy variable such that 10% (high) = 1 and 5% (low) = 0. I am running a logistic regression (binary response variable) and I want to know if the probability of event success i.e. y=1 decreases when the variable X increases. Is it acceptable to code 10% (high) = 1 and 5% (low) = 0. I ran a regression with this variable as a quantitative variable, but the output (coefficient) seemed to be unordinary. Default | Coefficient Std. err. z P>|z| [95% conf. interval] x | 15.46885 .2556751 60.50 0.000 14.96773 15.96996
