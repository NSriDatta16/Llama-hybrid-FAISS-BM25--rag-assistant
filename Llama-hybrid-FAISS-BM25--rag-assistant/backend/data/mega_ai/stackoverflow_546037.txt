My thoughts (I haven't checked all the others, so I don't know if it's novel) Dealing with swarming: Convert the front-page matter for each day's stuff to be a flash/flex object. Yes, some people will complain, but we're looking for the common case here, not the ideal. You should also randomize the name of your flash objects, so they aren't in any predictable pattern of names. Using Akamai or another CDN, deploy this flash object in advance to the outside world. Akamai produces what appears to be random URLs, so it makes it hard to predict. When it is time for a new sale, you just have to change your URL locally to refer to the appropriate object at Akamai, and people will go fetch the flash object from them to discover if the deal is a BoC or not. End-of-the-day - you now have Akamai handling your swarms of midnight traffic Dealing with auto-buy Each of the flash objects you create can have lots and lots of content hidden inside - images, links, arbitrary ids, including 'bag of crap' in a thousand places. you should be able to obfuscate the flash as well. When the flash object "goes live", people will start to attack it. But there are so many false positives that a simple string scan is useless - they'll have to simulate running the flash locally. But the flash doesn't write text. It draws lines and shapes. Shapes in different colors, all connected to timers that make them appear and disappear at different times. If you've seen the Colbert Report, you know how the intro has hundreds of words describing Colbert. Imagine something like that for your intro, which will always include Bag O Crap. Now, imagine that the intro takes an arbitrary amount of time - sometimes a few seconds, sometimes as long as a minute or more (make it funny) Meanwhile, "Bag O Crap" is constantly showing up, but again, clearly as part of the intro. Finally, the actual deal of the day is revealed, with an active 'shimmer' effect that makes it difficult for any single snapshot of the canvas to reveal the actual product name. This is floating above an animated background that still says 'bag O crap' and is constantly in motion again, all of this is handled with lines and shapes, not with text strings End result - your hacker is forced to take lots of image snapshots of the deal, figure out how to separate all the false positives and identify the actual deal. Meanwhile, humans just look at it, and between eye fatigue and our ability to fill in gaps in the text, we can read the deal as is. This won't work forever, but it would work for a while. Another idea is to simply restrict people from buying BoCs unless they've bought something before with that account, and to never let them buy a BoC again.
