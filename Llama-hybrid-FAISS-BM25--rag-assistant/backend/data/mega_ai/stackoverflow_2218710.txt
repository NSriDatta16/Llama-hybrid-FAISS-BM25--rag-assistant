I believe you are looking for Custom Resource Factory , you can code your factory to create javax.sql.DataSource object or a DBCP (or such) based connection pooling facade object, and have your custom code for getting and setting the username/password for the connection. Do note that if you're looking for extra security -- the pragmatic way would be to use filesystem security for securing your context.xml file, as adding extra layers (such as your custom implementation for the resource factory), won't make the system more secure, as you still need the password for the secure password store configured somewhere -- you'll end up getting the chicken or the egg problem.
