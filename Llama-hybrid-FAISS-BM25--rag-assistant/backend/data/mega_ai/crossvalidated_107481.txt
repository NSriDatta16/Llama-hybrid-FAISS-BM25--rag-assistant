SPSS Amos Binary Outcome - Model Fit

I was just wondering if anybody could help me, I'm conducting a path analysis in SPSS Amos with a binary outcome. I've specified the variable as binary using Tools>Data Recode, I've then calculated the variable estimates using MCMC. My question is: how do I know calculate overall model fit? The model is as follows, with all variables except psychosis (binary) being continuous. Esteem Intrusion Intrusion PsychosisRisk PsychosisRisk Many thanks.
