From my reading, it sounds like you are talking about the argmin instead of the minimum (the value $x$ which minimizes $f(x)$, where $x$ is in your case the penalty parameter). The argmin of $(x-1)^2$ is $x = 1$ and argmin of $3(x+1)^2$ is $x = -1$. So the average of the argmins is $0$. But the average of those two functions is $2x^2+2x+2$, which has an argmin at $-0.5$. So the argmin of averages isn't the average of argmins.
