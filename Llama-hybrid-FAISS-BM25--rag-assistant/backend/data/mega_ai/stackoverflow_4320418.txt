HTML Calculated Column Formula Help!

I'm trying to use a HTML calculated column so that I can display a RAG status bar for my tasks in SharePoint. I had it working until I added the IF containing % complete. Can you tell me where I'm going wrong please? Understand there is a 30,"red",IF(AND(Slippage>=-7,Slippage =-7,Slippage " Thanks - Rob
