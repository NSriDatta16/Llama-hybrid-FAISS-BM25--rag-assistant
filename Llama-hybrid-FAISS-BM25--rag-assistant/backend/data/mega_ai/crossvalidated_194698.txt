Covariance of two time series driven by a restricted VAR(1) model

Suppose that I have two time series $X_n$ and $Y_n$ where: $$ X_n = \rho_x X_{n-1} + \epsilon_n $$ and $$ Y_n = \rho_y Y_{n-1} + \rho_{xy}X_n +z_n $$ Here, $z_n,\epsilon_n$ are independent random variables, and the $\rho$'s can be thought of as the correlations. Now, I am trying to find a recursive relationship for $Cov(X_n, Y_n)$, and then take the limit. However, I am finding too many terms to deal with. Is there a simpler way than to go straight by the definition? What I have so far is to start with $Cov(X_1,Y_1) = Cov(\rho_x X_0 + \epsilon_1, \rho_y Y_{0} + \rho_{xy}X_1 +z_1) = \rho_{xy}$ due to $X_0, Y_0$ being constants. Then, $Cov(X_2,Y_2) = \rho_x \rho_y Cov(X_1,Y_1)+ \rho_x^2 \rho_{xy}+ \rho_{xy}$. Then, $Cov(X_n,Y_n) = \rho_x \rho_y Cov(X_{n-1},Y_{n-1})+ \rho_x^2 \rho_{xy}+ \rho_{xy}$. However, this still gives me a mess I cannot rewrite in terms of any known summation formula. Did I do it correctly?
