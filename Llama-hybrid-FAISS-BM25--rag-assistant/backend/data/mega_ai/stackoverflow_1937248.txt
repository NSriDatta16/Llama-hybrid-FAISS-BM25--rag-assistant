HTML Tidy has options for this: word-2000 , bare and clean . FCKEditor and similar try to clean up code pasted from Word. There's (rather old now) demoroniser . However don't expect miracles. It's unlikely that Word document will have decent structure (it theoretically could, but no Word user bothers with this). These programs can't add semantic information if it's not there. As for semantic editing in Word – use styles. It supports headers properly (sadly not much else). You can check that in outline view. You don't need – and shouldn't use – spaces or line breaks for indentation or space adjustment. Word has ability to explicitly control paragraphs' padding.
