Schema question for owner of an object

I have a user_id colunm in the user table. Next I have a brand_id in the brand table. The usecase is each has their own page: The user has a profile and the brand has a brand page. (NOTE: Thgere are more relationships like this. A company has a company page, city has city page, etc). So when users upload photos I need to reference it to the owner. Owner can be brand, user, city, organization, etc. For user's it is straightforward, photo_id belongs to user_id where user_id is a FK to user table. But to add the brand_id as the owner of the photo, do i require a seperate colunm or can it be done in the user_id colunm itself if i rename it as owner_id which will reference (userid or brand id)?
