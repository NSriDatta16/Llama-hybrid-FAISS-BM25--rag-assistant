Why not extend Composite instead of extending Widget? public class Cell extends Composite { private Label label; private TextBox textBox; private SomeContainerWidget container; ... } Just add/remove the label or the textBox widget to the container as needed. Using composite is the more elegant way as you do not expose the entire Widget interface, but only the methods needed for your spreadsheet cell. Checkout this section from GWT docs for building custom widgets for more information.
