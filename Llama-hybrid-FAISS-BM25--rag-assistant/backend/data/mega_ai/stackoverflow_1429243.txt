EDIT: responding to the OP's edit up top to make it easier to find: There are a variety of ways to make gnuplot render directly to a file (scroll down to "Terminal") which you can then read in for analysis. For example, you can output to portable bitmap format which is strikingly easy to read and write (if not small and elegant). Note that, by definition, PBM will give you an array of blacks and whites. For example, check out this use of the "set terminal" and "set output" commands to render to a series of Unix pipes that produce a pbm and then a png file. End EDIT: Gnu Octave defaults to using gnuplot for plotting and it happens that gnuplot is quite good at producing filled polygons. Here are some helpful demonstrations of exactly that sort of thing. For example, here are some filled polygons : # set terminal png transparent nocrop enhanced font arial 8 size 420,320 # set output 'fillcrvs.4.png' set grid nopolar set grid xtics nomxtics ytics nomytics noztics nomztics \ nox2tics nomx2tics noy2tics nomy2tics nocbtics nomcbtics set grid front linetype 0 linewidth 1.000, linetype 0 linewidth 1.000 set key outside right top vertical Right noreverse enhanced autotitles nobox set title "The red bat: abs(x) with filledcurve xy=2,5" plot abs(x) with filledcurve xy=2,5 Here's another demonstration script that draws the crazy face at the bottom of the filled curves page: # set terminal png transparent nocrop enhanced font arial 8 size 420,320 # set output 'fillcrvs.6.png' unset border set dummy t,y set grid nopolar set grid xtics nomxtics ytics nomytics noztics nomztics \ nox2tics nomx2tics noy2tics nomy2tics nocbtics nomcbtics set grid layerdefault linetype 0 linewidth 1.000, linetype 0 linewidth 1.000 unset key set label 1 "gnuplot" at 0, 1.2, 0 centre norotate front nopoint offset character 0, 0, 0 set label 2 "gnuplot" at 0.02, -0.6, 0 centre norotate front nopoint offset character 0, 0, 0 set arrow 1 from -0.1, 0.26, 0 to 0.18, -0.17, 0 head front nofilled linetype 5 linewidth 4.000 size first 0.100,40.000,90.000 set parametric set size ratio 1 1,1 set noxtics set noytics set title "Let's smile with parametric filled curves" set xrange [ -1.00000 : 1.00000 ] noreverse nowriteback set yrange [ -1.00000 : 1.60000 ] noreverse nowriteback plot [t=-pi:pi] sin(t),cos(t) with filledcurve xy=0,0 lt 15, sin(t)/8-0.5,cos(t)/8+0.4 with filledcurve lt 3, sin(t)/8+0.5,cos(t)/8+0.4 with filledcurve lt 3, t/5,abs(t/5)-0.8 with filledcurve xy=0.1,-0.5 lt 1, t/3,1.52-abs(t/pi) with filledcurve xy=0,1.8 lt -1
