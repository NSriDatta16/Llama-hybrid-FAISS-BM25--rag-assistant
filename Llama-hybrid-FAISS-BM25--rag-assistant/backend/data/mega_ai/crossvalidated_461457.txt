Keep in mind that $ES_i$ are random variables, in your case $ES_{combine}$ is just a linear combination of random variables. $$ ES_{combine}=\sum_i^n w_i ES_i $$ Where $n=2,w=1/2$ . So, $$ \begin{align} mean(ES_{combine})=\sum_i^n w_i \ mean(ES_i) \\ sd(ES_{combine})=\sqrt{\sum_i^n w_i^2 \ var(ES_i) + \sum_{ij\in n} 2 w_i w_j cov(ES_i ES_j)} \end{align} $$ Also, its interesting to point out that by taking average you are assuming the effective sizes play the same importance. But in reality some information source might be more reliable than others. There are some truth finding models that can help you calculate the reliabilities of the information sources.
