Problem on Class Specific Shifting distribution

Consider a classification problem where we have 2D data and there are 3 classes. We train a model on the data, and obtain a parameter w. Now, lets consider a target scenario, where we know that the data distributions have shifted. I know that the shifting is such that the class means (i.e. mean of all data in each class) have shifted in different directions in the feature space from mu_i to mu_i' for i=1,2,3. How can I leverage this information to adapt my input, parameter or ouput(which is probabilistic classification) for the target scenario? Is there pertaining literature on such class specific shifting ?
