It's not a machine learning problem and it is a bad idea. First, it is ethically dubious to have black-box software to make career decisions that would potentially influence the future of those employees. There are tons of research and real-life examples showing how machine learning algorithms can make biased decisions. Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil is a nice start to learning more. Second, the choice needs to be based on past performance data. So if you have relevant data on the performance of candidates A and B, you just need to pick the one that performed better. If you don't have the data, you cannot make such a decision. So you need to come up with good metrics (relevant, measurable, etc) and make decisions based on them. You also need to give both candidates an equal chance to prove their worth. If you don't have such data, you don't have grounds for making the decision. If you have the data, you don't need machine learning. If you instead just threw some random data to the algorithm, you are risking getting a biased, useless, garbage in, garbage out result. If you had such data, you could use some simple, explainable algorithm like linear regression that could help you to find out how much should you weigh each of the criteria used for making the decision, but anything above that is dubious. Finally, if you had such an algorithm, it may be bad for your organization in the long run. As noticed above, you risk legal and reputational costs if the algorithm ends up biased. You also risk that your employees get demotivated if they knew that career decisions are made by an "unpredictable" black-box algorithm. In such a case, people would not know what is expected of them to succeed, what is demotivating. They will not know how the decision is made, but this wouldn't stop them from gaming the system and doing all the crazy things that they perceive that the algorithm considers as advantageous for them. I agree with you that arbitrary career decisions are not a good thing, but "AI" is not a solution here. I guess that the decisions are arbitrary because you don't have relevant data to make the decision. Whatever machine learning algorithm you pick, it would use the same crappy data available to people who made the decisions in the past. It would also need to learn from the data of "arbitrary" career decisions made by humans and it will end up repeating those decisions because this would be the only reality that it would know from the data. You rather need an organizational change, not machine learning.
