I have the same problem. This may be because a sub view in your view become first responder from parent view. So If the view contains any element, such as a UITextField, that might become first responder itself, ensure that element resigns first responder at some point. With a UITextField, for example, the UIViewController would need to implement the UITextFieldDelegate protocol, and actually be the delegate. Then, in textFieldShouldReturn: - (BOOL)textFieldShouldReturn:(UITextField *)theTextField { // Hides the keyboard [theTextField resignFirstResponder]; // Returns first responder status to self so that shake events register here [self becomeFirstResponder]; return YES; } motionBegan: Not Working
