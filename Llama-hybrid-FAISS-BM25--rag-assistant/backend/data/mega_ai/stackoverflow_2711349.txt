I understand what you are trying to do. If I were you, I'd do the following: Provide 2 downloads - 1 for client and 1 for server. Forget about MS SQL Server and perhaps go with MySQL, since it really is open source. You could probably get away with using MS SQL Server Express Edition, but if your data set gets gigantic large (which is common with help desk databases), you'd be stuck. As other people pointed out, on very first run (or at setup time), I'd have the client app locate the server.
