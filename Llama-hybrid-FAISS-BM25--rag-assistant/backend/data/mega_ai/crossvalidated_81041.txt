Since it's a Youtube/Google policy, we can't know the true answer unless a Google representative speaks up. My guess is that they are referring to statistics that compare the likelihood of a typical person/family viewing their own videos against what the tracker reported. And they do the same thing for bots. If most people sharing their videos with family (thus have the same IP address) results in an average of say, 10 views, and the tracker shows 100 views from that IP address, then something's up. If the user has GoogleAdSense installed, they could earn money by just replaying their own videos over and over again or installing a bot to do that for them. Obviously Google doesn't want to pay these people money for "fake" page views. As for why they picked the number 301 over another lower figure, I'm guessing that the 300 mark is where the AdSense dollars kick in. I'm not an AdSense user, so I don't know if that's factually true. In short, I think they use statistics because they don't want to use computing power to match IP addresses. It's cheaper and easier to go by stats and just spend computing resources on detecting bots.
