SVG for images in browsers with PNG fallback

I'm looking to use SVG versions of a company logo on a website. At present, all current versions of major browsers (IE, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera) support SVG, so this doesn't seem crazy. However, old browsers are still out there, so I need to fall back to PNG support. The obvious solution is to put the SVG content in an object tag like so (forgive the inline styles...): Which in theory should render the object if possible, or else render the img . However, Chrome doesn't like this and applies the height style to the object itself but not the SVG, so I end up with a little iframe-like box with scrollbars, showing a huge logo. Another solution would be to use the PNG as the img source, and then swap it out at render time with the SVG source with javascript, if I think I'm running on a SVG-capable browser. This is not ideal because the PNG will still get downloaded, and I'm not confidant I can properly detect SVG support. Unfortunately, jQuery doesn't seem to have a SVG-detect feature. Finally, since my website is deployed with ASP.NET, I could inspect the user agent string before serving the page, and specify the img source depending on whether I think it will support SVG. But this also has the potential problem that I am not confidant I can make the right call. What is the preferred way of doing SVG for images?
