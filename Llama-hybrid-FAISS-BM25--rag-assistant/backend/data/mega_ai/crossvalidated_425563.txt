Here's what I understand: a) Distributions with heavy tails may have infinite variance, or mean (Ex: cauchy distribution) b) Heavy tailed means that there are a few outliers that are very different from the most of the samples. And these outliers have non-negligible impact on the future statistic procedures. c) Log-normal or exponential distributions have heavy tails Here's the question: Are my understandings (a, b, c) right? Can Bootstrapping be used to estimate confidence interval of mean or variance of lognormal, or exponential population? Why does Bootstrapping fail in case of heavy tail? 1)a) They can have an undefined mean or variance. Under some specifications, that is represented as infinite. 1)b)It depends upon the procedure being used. If you have a Cauchy distribution and you are using the sample mean to estimate the center of location then the answer is yes. If you have a Cauchy distribution and a large enough sample and are using a Bayesian method or Rothenberg's estimator then the answer is 'no.' It could but it need not. 1)c)Most definitions of heavy tails are those greater than the exponential distribution so the exponential is not a heavy-tailed distribution see Bryson, M. (1974). Heavy Tailed Distributions: Properties and Tests. Technometrics 16(1):61-68 (February 1974). 2) Yes, bootstrapping can be used for either. However, it somewhat begs the question as to why you would use it for either. If you really believed those were the distributions, then there are good parametric tools for both. 3) Yes, sort of. An example of where resampling is used would be Theil's regression across two Cauchy variables. There is a special limited sampling case for Theil's regression that is basically a bootstrap. The issue is that you are not seeking a mean as none exists. You would be seeking the median of the joint set. There is nothing intrinsic to bootstrapping that prohibits its use with heavy tails but you cannot use it to find something that does not exist, such as a variance or a mean. As with any problem where you have fewer good properties, the usefulness of bootstrap will be greatly reduced.
