Finding all classes containing a method in C#

I want to search through all classes in a namespace for those containing a certain method. If a class contains a method then I want to create an instance of the class and run the method. Obviously I have to start with reflection but I'm stuck on where to go. Edit: Interfaces are not the way I want to do this. What I'm looking for is embedding testing functions into the code but a single calling interface. If there's a self-test function, call it. If there isn't, ignore it.
