What are the standard hypothesis tests in any type of regression?

In general, what the the standard hypothesis tests in all types of regression? We get some coefficients and then test the hypotheses that these coefficients are significant (i.e not equal to $0$)? For example, in logistic regression the p-value indicates that the regression coefficients are significant or not? Likewise with linear regression? Question: Suppose coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are significant in linear regression. Can we deduce anything about the significance of $\beta_0+\beta_1$? What about $\beta_0= \beta_1$?
