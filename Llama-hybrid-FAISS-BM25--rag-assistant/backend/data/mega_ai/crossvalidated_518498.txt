There is no hard limit on the number of classes. It depends on the specific problem and in other factors like the amount of data you have, regularization method etc. There are many works that uses neural network, for example, to classify much more than 65 classes. Here is one article, out of many, that uses neural network and collaborative filtering techniques, to output classification probabilities for more than 20k different classes. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05814.pdf
