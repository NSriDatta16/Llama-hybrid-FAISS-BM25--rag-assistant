GARCH forecasting in R: constant mean forecast!

I'm trying to forecast a time series of a stock option using ARMA-GARCH modelling in R. First I determine the ARMA order using AIC and I found (0,1) to be the best one. But when I run garchFit(formula=~arma(0,1)+garch(1,1),data=XX,trace=FALSE,include.mean=TRUE) I get constant mean forecasts. Whereas when I use ARMA(1,1): garchFit(formula=~arma(1,1)+garch(1,1),data=brentlog1,trace=FALSE,include.mean=TRUE) I get variables mean forecasts. Does anyone know why is that? How do I forecast the actual prices of the stock (not its variance)?
