No. The sizeof char is by definition 1. But this does not mean that it occupies 32-bits/8-bits always. $3.9.1/1- "Objects declared as characters (char) shall be large enough to store any member of the implementationâ€™s basic character set." There appears to be a confusion that a byte is 8-bits. The C++ Standard does not mandate this however. Here's how byte is defined in the Standard $1.7/1 The fundamental storage unit in the C + + memory model is the byte. A byte is at least large enough to contain any member of the basic execution character set and is composed of a contiguous sequence of bits, the number of which is implementation-defined . As is clear, a byte need not be always 8-bits.
