If I understood you correctly, you are asking whether the conditional probability P(A|B&C) can be calculated according to the following formula: P(A|B&C) = P(A|B)P(C|A)/p(C) In general case, this formula does not hold true. Let us derive when this equality is true. According to Bayes formula, P(A|B&C) = p(B&C|A)P(A)/P(B&C) We want this to be equal to P(A|B)P(C|A)/P(C) = P(A)P(B|A)p(C|A)/(P(B)P(C)) So, your formula can only be applied under the following condition: P(B|A)P(C|A)/(P(B)P(C)) = P(B&C|A)/P(B&C) Here is an example where this is not true: For a point (x,y) uniformly distributed in a unit square [0,1]x[0,1], let B = {x 1}. Then P(B|A) = 0.25, P(C|A) = 0.25, P(B&C|A) = 0, so the sides are not equal.
