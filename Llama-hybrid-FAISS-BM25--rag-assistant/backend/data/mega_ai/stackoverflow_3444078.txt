Identity Information over HTTP?

If a person clears their cookies and changes their IP address, is there ANY way for a website to identify that computer as a computer that has "been here before"? In other words, no identifiable information like MAC can ever be known over HTTP, right? (I've looked through the list of headers and only see cookies and user-agent). Also - same goes for a mobile device. If the mobile clears cookies, is there any way to identify it as a repeat visitor? Thanks! Chad
