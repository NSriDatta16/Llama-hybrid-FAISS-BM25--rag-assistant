When you create a new reference type object in .NET you are automatically "registering" it with the CLR and its GC. There is no way to inject random value types into this process. In other words: The CLR does not maintain some large, disorganized heap of pointers mixed with value types. It just tracks CLR-created objects (for garbage collection purposes anyway.) Any value type will be short-lived on the stack or be a member of a class instance. There is no potential for confusion the GC.
