Decision Theory: Principles and Approaches by Giovanni Parmigiani and Lurdes Inoue sounds like what you are looking for. For depth on the Bayesian side, I would recommend The Bayesian Choice by Robert. Unfortunately, I do not do enough work on the Frequentist side to need a deeper book on the Frequentist side. There is an overwhelming argument for the use of Bayesian methods in my work, so even though I am trained primarily on the Frequentist side, I use it much less frequently and never in a decision-theoretic framework. Hopefully, someone will post a deeper Frequentist work because while you are violating the likelihood principle (which is itself controversial) you are not required to make strong distributional assumptions in order to determine what behaviors you should engage in.
