Strategies for predicting values of a time-dependent CDF, given covariates

I've got data that looks like this: id month progress x1 x2 1 1 1 0.0000000 -1.292681937 A 2 1 2 0.0000000 0.148379515 D 3 1 3 0.0000000 -0.377641741 C 4 1 4 0.0000000 -1.733460409 B 5 1 5 0.1368025 -2.536271182 C 6 1 6 0.3729237 0.246897737 D 7 1 7 1.0000000 -1.486625810 A 8 1 8 1.0000000 0.762212659 E 9 1 9 1.0000000 0.139405785 A 10 1 10 1.0000000 -0.199510442 B 11 1 11 1.0000000 0.023842425 C 12 1 12 1.0000000 -1.498720539 D 13 2 1 0.0000000 -0.448647036 C 14 2 2 0.0000000 1.152180009 B 15 2 3 0.1299298 -0.753947848 E 16 2 4 0.5229756 0.338629784 B 17 2 5 0.7506691 0.540268370 D 18 2 6 1.0000000 0.766976334 D 19 2 7 1.0000000 0.927866060 D 20 2 8 1.0000000 0.311370647 A 21 2 9 1.0000000 -0.118382759 A 22 2 10 1.0000000 -1.275606521 A 23 2 11 1.0000000 -1.274525301 D 24 2 12 1.0000000 -0.002151246 C 25 3 1 0.0000000 0.249371755 B 26 3 2 0.0000000 0.820863808 E 27 3 3 0.2492407 1.054430344 E 28 3 4 0.6452163 -0.734227013 E 29 3 5 0.8568588 0.613731243 A 30 3 6 1.0000000 0.129128763 C 31 3 7 1.0000000 -0.651546878 D 32 3 8 1.0000000 1.529601850 C 33 3 9 1.0000000 -0.101137325 A 34 3 10 1.0000000 -0.049928413 E 35 3 11 1.0000000 -0.114480189 B 36 3 12 1.0000000 -0.431910505 C Given a training set with a label of progress features x1 and x2 , I want to predict whole sequences of progress in new data where I don't observe it, but where I do have x1 and x2 . I'm not entirely sure what the best way to go about this is -- nothing seems perfect. Here's what I've considered so far: Survival models. These have the advantage of explicitly modeling the time until progress crosses some threshold. But survival models have the drawback of having no straightforward way of encoding my pre-event data. So, say I know that progress gets to 1 in month 8 , and that the value of progress for month 7 is .56 . Survival models would have me put 8 as the DV. Maybe I could just use lags of the DV, as well as lags of all of the covariates? That's another problem with survival models: if I put in a lot of lags, I'll (a) get a lot of covariates and need model selection, and (b) will start to get NA values because of the heterogeneity in start time. Finally, the predictions would all be in terms of probabilities of reaching 1. Really my outcome isn't that -- it's a proportion completed. There may be cases where the two phenomena follow quite different processes. So survival models aren't straightforward. Ordinal logistic regression. I know that I can put proportion data into a basic glm in R, but the polr function in MASS is old and janky, and can't handle non-factor outcomes. I could think about hand-coding something, but that doesn't seem worthwhile. Model the first difference of progress, perhaps using a tweedie GAM or the zero values pre-and post-growth. I'd need lags of the DV to deal with the fact that change will depend on levels. This has the drawback that there is nothing to enforce predictions of the overall curve falling between zero and 1. Parametric approximation: fit the closest gaussian mean and variance to the CDFs that I have, and model those. This is probably the easiest, but the parametric approximation will be really coarse given that this is monthly data. None of these are great. Suggestions?
