How can I use an index on a partitioned table in postgresql 8.3.7

I have situation, where running a query that filters by an indexed column in a partitioned table, performs a full table scan. Apparently , this is a known issue in postgresql, and it's explained in detail here . Is there a more elegant way around this other than performing a query on each partition, and then performing a UNION on all of the results?
