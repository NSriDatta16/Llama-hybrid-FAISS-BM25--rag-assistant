Event bubbling and the onblur event

I'm writing a form validation script and would like to validate a given field when its onblur event fires. I would also like to use event bubbling so i don't have to attach an onblur event to each individual form field. Unfortunately, the onblur event doesn't bubble. Just wondering if anyone knows of an elegant solution that can produce the same effect.
