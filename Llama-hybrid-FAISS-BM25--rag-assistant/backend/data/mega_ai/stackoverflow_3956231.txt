Based on review of the current Adium sourcecode and a search for current and past items in the Adium bug tracker and wiki which contain both "applescript" and "message" as substrings, this does not appear to be possible when using only AppleScript in Adium 1.0 through 1.3.10 (latest at time of writing). It seems to have been possible with plain AppleScript in Adium 0.89.1, but the volunteer developers are not yet convinced that adding this feature back is worth the effort. To access the message content in AppleScript right now probably requires writing an Adium Xtra to forward the information. Examples of Xtra plugins that access the text of last message include Challenge/Response or SpamFilter . The sourcecode for SpamFilter is available on BitBucket, so you could conceivably modify it to send message contents to an AppleScript. EDIT: Since I posted my response, user 'zostay' has spotted a new Adium Xtra called " Pipe Event ". It allows sending the text of an event to a script in exactly the manner I envisioned when I wrote my second paragraph, so I'm up-voting zostay's answer. Sourcecode is also available.
