Using strong predictor in Model training?

I am trying to build a Disease predictor based on symptoms. I am using data scraped from Symcat website. After sampling the data we have symptoms to disease mapped for training purpose.Data looks like these: X --> S1,S2,S4... Y --> D1,D2,D5. The problem is some symptoms are strong predictors for a particular disease. Say S1 is a strong predictor for D1. So basically model should predict higher probability score for D1 compared to others due to presence of S1. How to imbibe the information that S1 is strong predictor for D1 so that it can be used in model training Tried oversampling those strong predictor to disease combination. But dont think that is right as I have a multi label data set. results are not reflecting either Dataset looks like this: ![Symptoms D1 D2 D3 S1,S2,S4 0 1 1 S3,S4,S5 1 0 0 S1,S4,S6 1 0 1] 1 Symptoms are features. We are using symptoms definition embeddings. Y is 1 hot vector.
