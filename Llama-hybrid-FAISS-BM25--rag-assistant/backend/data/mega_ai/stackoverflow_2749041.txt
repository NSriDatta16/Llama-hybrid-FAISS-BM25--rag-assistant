It might be a little big, but Magento is based on the Zend Framework and is very modular. The Zend classes in there are slowly being replaced by Magento-specific ones, but they still hold on to a lot of Zend Framework stuff like controllers, helpers, models. They offer configuration for each module to hook into the router system, the admin, the templates (you may not even have to edit the template file). You can also override models, controllers, and other from the modules using the module config. To be honest, I haven't looked that much, but when it comes to extendability: Magento is tough to beat. To use it as a base for some other system, there'd need to be improvements in other areas like Performance, Scalability, Bugs, Complexity, and Compatibility.
