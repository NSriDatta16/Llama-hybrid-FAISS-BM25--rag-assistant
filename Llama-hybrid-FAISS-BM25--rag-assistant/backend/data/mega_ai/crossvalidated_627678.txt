Interpretation of multiple logistic regression (continuous variables) with interaction term

I have two independent variables, distance and light intensity (continuous variables) that I want to understand their relationship on a human response (response or no response) . Here, light intensity represents the stimulus and distance represents how far people are from it. Initially, I carried out a t-test of independent means, which indicated a difference in distance and light intensity between response (group 1) and no response (group 2). I then performed a bivariate logistic regression, to better understand the effect size of distance and light intensity on the response (0 = no response, 1 = response). Note, I performed a linear correlation prior which indicated a weak negative correlation between distance and light intensity (r = -0.18, p = 0.000059). Bivariate logistic regression results indicate that distance has a larger effect compared to light intensity (see below). So, for every 1-unit increase in distance (meters), the likelihood of a response decreases by 66.9% (exp(-1.1065) - 1 x 100) (or, the closer in distance a person is, the likelihood of a response increases by 33.1%). In contrast, for every 1-unit increase in light intensity (lux), the likelihood of a response increases only by 0.045% (exp(0.0004569)- 1 x 100). Bivariate logistic regression (light intensity) Call: glm(formula = response ~ light.intensity, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = df) Coefficients: Estimate Std.

After reading, including responses by @Marrtin Buis and @Dave regarding interaction terms, my interpretation of the result is that: The likelihood of a response increases by 46.3% for every 1-unit decrease in distance , when light intensity is 0. While the effect size of light intensity is small, it does not contribute significantly to this model (p-value = 0.14) However, as an interaction term, the interaction effect of light intensity on distance approaches significance (p-value = 0.093162) but the effect is very small. So, for every unit increase in light intensity , the effect of distance decreases only by 0.03% (exp(-0.03) - 1 x 100). Call: glm(formula = response ~ distance + light.intensity + distance:light.intensity, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = df) Coefficients: Estimate Std.
