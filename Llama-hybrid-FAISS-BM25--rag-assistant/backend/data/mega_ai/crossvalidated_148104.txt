There are a lot of different types of classification algorithms. You mentioned neural networks, but there are also: decision trees (e.g. J48), probabilistic classifiers (e.g. Naive Bayes) and support vector machines (with different kernels - linear, nonlinear, soft margin etc.) Usually , the best all-round algorithm is SVM, but it really depends on the problem itself - some problems are best solved using neural networks, some by decision trees and so on. It also depends on what you are willing to achieve. If you would like to be able to interpret the classification rules, then decision trees are the most straightforward way to do this. On the other hand, neural networks are the most difficult to understand/interpret. I can see from your question that you don't seem to know exactly how to execute this, therefore I can recommend Weka . It is a free and open source tool for machine learing and data mining. With it you can import your data in various formats (CSV etc.) and can quickly benchmark various machine learning algorithms with various settings (parameters). This way you can find the machine learning algorithm, which suits your problem most.
