That seems awfully high. 10,000 pageviews per day means you get less than 1 pageview per 10 seconds on average. It would depend on your database server, but I doubt it can effectively perform 100 queries at the same time. Even if it can, it's not likely to ever occur, so setting the minimum pool size to 100 makes no sense. If you're running out of connections in your pool, you should check if you're disposing your connections properly.
