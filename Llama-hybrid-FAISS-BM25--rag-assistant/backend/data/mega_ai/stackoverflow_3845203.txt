If you're using MySQL version 5.1, and the InnoDB storage engine, you may want to use the InnoDB Plugin 1.0 , which supports a new feature called Fast Index Creation . This allows the storage engine to create indexes without copying the contents of the entire table. Overview of the InnoDB Plugin: Starting with version 5.1, MySQL AB has promoted the idea of a “pluggable” storage engine architecture, which permits multiple storage engines to be added to MySQL. Currently, however, most users have accessed only those storage engines that are distributed by MySQL AB, and are linked into the binary (executable) releases. Since 2001, MySQL AB has distributed the InnoDB transactional storage engine with its releases (both source and binary). Beginning with MySQL version 5.1, it is possible for users to swap out one version of InnoDB and use another. Source: Introduction to the InnoDB Plugin Overview of Fast Index Creation: In MySQL versions up to 5.0, adding or dropping an index on a table with existing data can be very slow if the table has many rows. The CREATE INDEX and DROP INDEX commands work by creating a new, empty table defined with the requested set of indexes. It then copies the existing rows to the new table one-by-one, updating the indexes as it goes. Inserting entries into the indexes in this fashion, where the key values are not sorted, requires random access to the index nodes, and is far from optimal. After all rows from the original table are copied, the old table is dropped and the copy is renamed with the name of the original table. Beginning with version 5.1, MySQL allows a storage engine to create or drop indexes without copying the contents of the entire table. The standard built-in InnoDB in MySQL version 5.1, however, does not take advantage of this capability. With the InnoDB Plugin, however, users can in most cases add and drop indexes much more efficiently than with prior releases. ... Changing the clustered index requires copying the data, even with the InnoDB Plugin. However, adding or dropping a secondary index with the InnoDB Plugin is much faster, since it does not involve copying the data. Source: Overview of Fast Index Creation
