I've been testing myself (not in F but it doesn't really matter) and I can confirm that the site reads the User Agent string and depending on its value it either returns the site contents or the "DOS" text. Curiously, they provide a feed service (both RSS and Atom) and they also filter out requests to it. Although the User Agent information can be easily faked, my advice is that you try to get their permission to grab contents; at least from the XML feed!
