Scrolling text using a toolstriplabel on a c# winform

I am currently working on a little app that scrolls a message across the top of the form - nothing complex however i have ran into a issue where i can not get it to work with a toolstriplabel on my c# winform. I currently have it working by the following method using a normal label but toolstriplabels dont appear to have the .Left option i require to make it scroll. This is the code i am currently using in a timer. private void timer1_Tick(object sender, System.EventArgs e) { this.label1.Left = this.label1.Left - 1; if (this.label1.Left + this.label1.Width Does anyone know how i can make this work with a toolstrip label as i would really like this scrolling text on a toolstrip so the user can drag it to where there require? Thanks
