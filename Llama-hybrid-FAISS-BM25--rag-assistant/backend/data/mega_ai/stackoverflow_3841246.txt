I'll admit that this is a bit of a guess, but I'll give it a shot. You have id -- the first field -- as the primary key. I'm not 100% sure how MySQL does clustered indexes as far as lookups, but it is reasonable to suspect that, for any given ID, there is some "pointer" to the record with that ID. It is relatively easy to find the beginnings of fields when all prior fields have fixed width. All your BIGINT(20) fields have a defined size that makes it easy for the db engine to find the field given a pointer to the start of the record; it's a simple calculation. Likewise, the start of the first VARCHAR(255) field is easy to find. After that, though, because the fields are VARCHAR fields, the db engine must take the data into account to find the start of the next field, which is much slower than simply calculating where that field should be. So, for any fields after txtProperty1, you will have this issue. What would happen if you changed all the VARCHAR(255) fields to CHAR(255) fields? It is very possible that your query will be much faster, albeit at the cost of using the maximum storage for each CHAR(255) field regardless of the data it actually contains.
