Is the user of the iPhone app also the owner of the storage account? If so, go for it (though sorry, I have no advice on how to do this in Objective C). If not, consider the security model. If you're going to give users access to storage, you'll either need to use blobs with Shared Access Signatures (in which case this should be trivial... you don't need to mess with signing the requests), or you'll need to give users the key to your storage account, which is generally a bad idea. (This would allow them to read/write/delete anything they find there.)
