You're probably checking out the wrong directory. Usually you check out either trunk , or a subdirectory of branches or tags . Otherwise you could end up checking out dozens of copies of the code, in slightly different versions. As for the document root, that depends on how the project is organized. It could be the same as the directory you checked out, or it could be a subdirectory. The latter is more likely, since the project will probably contain some code that shouldn't be accessible from the web.
