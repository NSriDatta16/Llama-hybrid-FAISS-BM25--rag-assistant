(too long for a comment) http://www.aaas.org/aaas-affiliates lists the Parapsychological Association as an affiliate, confirming that the American Association for the Advancement of Science regards parapsychology as a valid field of study, though that doesn't mean they accept it as truth. Your question is fairly basic (no offense) and could've been asked without the first paragraph. In general, you'd expect 33.33... correct with a variance of 100*(1/3)*(2/3) or 200/9 for a standard deviation of about 4.7. 0.05 requires 2 SDs, so if you got 33.333+2*4.7.. rounded up to 43 or more correct, you'd have 0.05. However, there are many other factors to consider before claiming success.
