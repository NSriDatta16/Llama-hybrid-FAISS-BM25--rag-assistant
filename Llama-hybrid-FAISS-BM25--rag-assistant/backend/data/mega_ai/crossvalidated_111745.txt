Differing p values (significant and insignificant) for the same predictor variable in different AIC models

I'm looking at a multinomial logistic regression analysis of deer behavioural responses to camera traps. The levels of the response variable are no reaction , reaction and strong reaction . I've selected a number of models based on their AIC values. However, I've found that the p values gain and lose significance within differing models. For instance, with only season as a predictor: Season Summer Winter Coefficient r 0.8 0.03 Coefficient sr 0.4 0.5 P value r 0.041 0.925 P value sr 0.18* 0.024 AIC 1005.023 * P value of interest With species , camera model , and season as predictors: Species, Camera model and Season Muntjac Roe Sika Bushnellb Reconyx Summer Winter Coefficients r 0.94 .43 -0.56 0.76 0.71 1.6 0.5 Coefficients sr 1.11 .19 -0.19 0.28 0.77 0.95 0.8 P value r 0.1 0.4 0.4 0.13 0.1 0.008 0.3 P value sr 0.005 0.6 0.6 0.4 0.01 0.03* 0.02 AIC 1006.618 * P value of interest Am I right to assume that this may be due to collinearity inflating the significance of this p value, and therefore when analysing the probability of the predictor variable summer influencing the response variable sr , using the p value from the first model? Is it correct to assume that the p value from the 2nd model is due to collinearity and thus not representative of the actual significance of this variable (or level?) summer? Thanks!
