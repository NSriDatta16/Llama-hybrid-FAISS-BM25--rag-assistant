It depends on what exactly you are trying to do. Since the temperature for one location is a univariate time series you could fit an ARIMA model for each one and discard the geo-coordinates (given the time series at each point are long enough). However, with the geo-coordinates at hand you could e.g. build features that include the distance between points in the model. Close-by points will have similar changes in temperature and including a measure of proximity might improve predictions. I can imagine here to use modelling techniques from Panel data analyis where one has repeated measurements of the same entities/locations.
