You may use the Spearman correlation, which handles ordered values. It would work if you have smoking categories like none, 1 pack, 2 packs etc. The correlation coefficient's sign tells you if the association is positive or negative. Note that it only tells you if there is a monotonic increasing/decreasing relationship between the two variables. Unlike the Pearson correlation, Spearman won't tell you how linear it is. Spearman correlation is often used for Likert scales, which are ordinal data. If you wanted to calculate effect size and handle covariates, you can use Ordinal Logistic Regression: https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/ordinal-logistic-regression/ Example code for Spearman Correlation, where I've purposely created more males for smoker and fewer females for non-smoker: import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import random from scipy.stats import spearmanr import seaborn as sns sns.set(style='white') smoker_data = (['s']*50 + ['ns'] * 50) gender_data = \ random.choices(['m','f'], k=50, weights=[3,1]) \ + random.choices(['m','f'], k=50, weights=[1,3]) df = pd.DataFrame([smoker_data, gender_data], index=['smoker', 'gender']).T corr, p = spearmanr( smoker_data, gender_data, ) print(p) # 7.044e-14 print(corr) # 0.66 fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1) sns.stripplot( x=df['smoker'], y=df['gender'], jitter=0.3, ax=ax, ) fig.savefig('plot.png')
