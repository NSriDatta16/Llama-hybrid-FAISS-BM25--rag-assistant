I think you've misunderstood what the document is talking about. It doesn't say the algorithms are weak. It says that the equipment is not strong enough to protect top secret information. This doesn't mean, though, that AES is not secure anymore. Actually, some weaknesses of AES were known from the very beginning although they were not disclosed widely. It's just a question of time and efforts needed to attack the information. Often rubber-hose cryptanalysis proves to be much more effective, than cracking the algorithm. And this is exactly why the same document says "All DES/AES radio equipment in storage or maintenance channels must be zeroized of all key codes. If not equipped with a zeroize feature, a randomly produced key code must be loaded in order to overwrite the mission's actual operational code." . I.e. the point is to protect the keys from being extracted from portable hardware, not to claim weakness in AES.
