I have no idea what you have and what you'd like to end up with, but I see at least one major mistake in the code. In this line if((this.Time.substring(this.Time.length() - 2) == "am")||(this.Time.substring(this.Time.length() - 2) == "pm")) you're comparing String by reference, not by value. You should be using Object#equals() whenever you want to compare two different objects. A String is namely an object, not a primitive like int , boolean , etc, for which the == would work as intented and expected. if((this.Time.substring(this.Time.length() - 2).equals("am"))||(this.Time.substring(this.Time.length() - 2).equals("pm"))) However, I'd suggest to use the String#endsWith() method instead. That's not only more concise, but also makes the code more self-explaining: if (this.Time.endsWith("am") || this.Time.endsWith("pm")) Having said that, there's undoubtely a more elegant way for whatever you'd like to achieve, but since the functional requirements are unclear, it's impossible to give you a kickoff example of that.
