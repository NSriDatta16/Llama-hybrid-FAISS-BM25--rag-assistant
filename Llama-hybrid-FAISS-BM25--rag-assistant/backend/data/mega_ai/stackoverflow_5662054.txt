You've hit the 'Outlook 2007 page break bug'. Basically, because Outlook 2007/10 use the Word rendering engine, they organise it for printing instead of the screen. If you hit something that Outlook can't insert a page break between, it just inserts a massive space above it to where it can insert a page break. It's really annoying - the only way around it is to completely close off the rows above at the same place, insert something that's 100% wide (can be a transparent 1px high line), and then start the tables again underneath.
