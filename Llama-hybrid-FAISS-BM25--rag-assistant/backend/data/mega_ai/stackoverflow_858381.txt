Cannot load external ResourceDictionary

I'm trying to load an external XAML file using this code: Opening reflector on the "OfficeStyle" DLL gives: alt text http://robbertdam.nl/share/p3.png Running the app gives this error: alt text http://robbertdam.nl/share/p4.png The error pops up and the XAML code I've placed at the beginning of this post. What am I missing? The XAML file I'm trying to load contains a bunch of Styles etc. I want to reuse in my application.
