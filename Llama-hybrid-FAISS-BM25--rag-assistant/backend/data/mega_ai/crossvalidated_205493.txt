How to handle interruptions (0 values) over a certain period in time series analysis?

Is there a way that I can combine two models for time series? I am trying to predict the production of tomatoes per week per $m^2$ (black line), based on light (orange) and temperature (magenta). At the beginning of each year, the production is 0 roughly until week 13. I am using a categorical predictor to specify whether the production is 0 or not (the predictor has value 1 in weeks 1-13 and 0 elsewhere). I am modeling the series using ARIMA, but I would want the prediction to be 0 over weeks 1-13. Is there a way that I could specify that in a certain period $y_t = 0$ and in other periods $y_t = \beta X_t + \eta_t $ where $\eta_t$ follows an ARIMA model? I also see a problem with the variability in the black time series: since there's no variability in the beginning of the year, do I have to account for that by GARCH modeling or some other method? Just in case, I have put the data here
