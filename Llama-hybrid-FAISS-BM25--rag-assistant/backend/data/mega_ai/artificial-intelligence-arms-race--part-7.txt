elligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. The Ukrainian military uses Palantir's MetaConstellation software to monitor the movement of Russian troops and supplies (highlighting the blurring of boundaries between state military and commercial AI use). It aggregates data from various commercial civilian providers of satellite imagery Ukraine also uses its own Delta system which aggregates real time data from drone imagery, satellite photos, acoustic signals, and text to construct an operational picture for military commanders. AI is used to prioritise incoming threats, potential targets and resource constraints. AI is also being used to process intercepted communications from Russian soldiers, to process, select, and output militarily useful information from these intercepted calls. Israel Israel has made extensive use of AI for military applications specially during the Gaza war. The main AI systems used for target identification are the Gospel and Lavender. Lavender developed by the Unit 8200 identifies and creates a database of individuals mostly low-ranking militants of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and has a 90% accuracy rate and a database of tens of thousands. The Gospel in comparisons recommended buildings and structures rather than individuals. The acceptable collateral damage and the type of weapon used to eliminate the target is decided by IDF members and could track militants even when at home. Israel's Harpy anti-radar "fire and forget" drone is designed to be launched by ground troops, and autonomously fly over an area to find and destroy radar that fits pre-determined criteria. The application of artificial intelligence is also expected to be advanced in crewless ground systems and robotic vehicles such as the Guardium MK III and later versions. These robotic vehicles are used in border defense. United Kingdom In 2015, the UK government opposed a ban on lethal autonomous weapons, stating that "international humanitarian law already provides sufficient regulation for this area", but that all weapons employed by UK armed forces would be "under human oversight and control". South Korea The South Korean Super aEgis II machine gun, unveiled in 2010, sees use both in South Korea and in the Middle East. It can identify, track, and destroy a moving target at a range of 4 km. While the technology can theoretically operate without human intervention, in practice safeguards are installed to require manual input. A South Korean manufacturer states, "Our weapons don't sleep, like humans must. They can see in the dark, like humans can't. Our technology therefore plugs the gaps in human capability", and they want to "get to a place where our software can discern whether a target is friend, foe, civilian or military". Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia entered the AI race relatively late, beginning in the early 2020s. The country announced its Vision 2030 initiative—a multi-trillion dollar plan to diversify its oil-dependent economy—under the leadership of the Public Investment Fund (PIF). A key turning point in U.S.-Saudi relations came during President Donald Trump's first foreign trip in 2017, when he visited Riyadh and signed hundreds of billions of dollars in agreements spanning defense, energy, and technology. This visit laid the groundwork for deeper U.S.-Saudi cooperation in areas like AI and tech infrastructure. In the years that followed, Saudi Arabia formed major partnerships with U.S. firms like NVIDIA, AMD, and Cisco, investing billions in semiconductors, cloud computing, and AI research. Saudi-backed startup Humain also partnered with several American firms, further strengthening the Kingdom's ties with Silicon Valley as it pushed to become a global leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. United Arab Emirates The United Arab Emirates has been expanding its role in artificial intelligence and technology through investments in infrastructure and partnerships. One major initiative is MGX, a UA
