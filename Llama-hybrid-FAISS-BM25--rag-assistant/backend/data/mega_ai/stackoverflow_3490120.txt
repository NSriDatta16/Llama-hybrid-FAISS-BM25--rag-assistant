If I get your meaning it seems like you want the thumb to move at variable speed with the relative y position of the touch. I haven't used the scrubber control. The UISlider control inherits from UIResponder so you can subclass it and add your own – touchesBegan:withEvent: – touchesMoved:withEvent: – touchesEnded:withEvent: touchesMoved will be of special interest since it will give you the y coordinate. Don't forget to call super and pass the events up the responder chain. If you still get no events - maybe the thumb is in front and is intercepting them. Place a regular transparent UIView subclass over the slider, intercept touches and get coordinates there and again pass events up the chain. I used this code once: int progressAsInt = ((int)((completionSlider.value + 2.5f) / 5.0f) * 5); [sender setValue:progressAsInt animated:YES]; in the slider's action function to make a UISlider set its thumb to discrete values only, like a volume control with detents. You could use different values decided by the y position of the touches you have detected to vary the granularity you allow, or to influence the amount of movement represented by actual touch events.
