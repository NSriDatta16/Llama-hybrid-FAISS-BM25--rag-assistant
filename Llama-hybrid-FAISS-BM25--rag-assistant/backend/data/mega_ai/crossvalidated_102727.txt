Here are some thoughts: If you only want to identify relevant variables (e.g., you don't want to test pre-existing hypotheses, and you aren't trying to build the optimal model for predicting favorability later), you might try either CART, or combining logistic regression with LASSO penalization. There is no assumption of 'linearity' in logistic regression. In general, people consider LR to be a non-linear model. There is some sense in which any model assumes it is properly specified, and it is possible (with a continuous variable) that you could need a squared term (e.g.) for the model to be reasonably well specified, but even that isn't true with only dichotomous variables. It is often best to try to reduce your independent variables first. However, you still won't have to worry about 'linearity'.
