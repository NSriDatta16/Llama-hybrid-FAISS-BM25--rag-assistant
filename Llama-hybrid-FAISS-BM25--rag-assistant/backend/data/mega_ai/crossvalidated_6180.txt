Statement of result for binomial confidence intervals

Confidence intervals for binomial proportions have irregular coverage over the range of possible population parameters (e.g. see Brown et al. 2001 Link >). How can I formally and usefully describe the properties of the confidence intervals? Say I toss a coin ten times and obtain seven heads. Are the following statements accurate? For the Clopper-Pearson method: The interval 0.3475–0.9333 has been generated by a method that will on at least 95% of occasions, for any true population proportion, contain the true population proportion. The long-run frequency with which this method would yield confidence intervals containing the true population proportion pertaining to this particular experiment is at least 95%. For the Wilson's scores method: The interval 0.3968–0.8922 has been generated by a method that will on 95% of occasions, averaged over all population proportions, contain the true population proportion. The long-run frequency with which this method would yield confidence intervals containing the true population proportion pertaining to this particular experiment may be more or less than 95%.
