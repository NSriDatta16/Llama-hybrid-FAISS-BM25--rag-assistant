SQLite not inserting into

I have the following code block SQLiteConnection cnn = new SQLiteConnection("Data Source=" + getDBPath()); cnn.Open(); SQLiteCommand mycommand = new SQLiteCommand(cnn); string values = "'" + this.section + "','" + this.exception + "','" + this.dateTimeString + "'"; string sql = @"INSERT INTO Emails_Pending (Section,Message,Date_Time) values (" + values + ")"; mycommand.CommandText = sql; mycommand.ExecuteNonQuery(); cnn.Close(); When I execute it , nothing happens, no errors are produced, but nothing gets inserted, what am I doing wrong? Path to DB is correct! Insert statement works, tried it in a SQLLite GUI (no problems there) Here is the SQL Snippet: "INSERT INTO Emails_Pending (Section,Message,Date_Time) values ('Downloading Received Messages','Object reference not set to an instance of an object.','04.12.2009 11:09:49');"
