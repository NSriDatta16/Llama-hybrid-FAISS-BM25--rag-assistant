The simple and pragmatic approach to enforcing a particular sequence of steps in any API is to define a collection of classes (instead of just one class) in such way that every next valid step takes as a parameter an object derived from the previous step, i.e.: Fuel coal = CoalMine.getCoal(); Cooker stove = new Cooker (gas); Filling apple = new AppleFilling(); Pie applePie = new Pie(apple); applePie.bake(stove); That is to say that to bake a pie you need to supply a Cooker object that in turn requires some sort of a suitable fuel to be instantiated first. Similarly, before you can get an instanse of a Pie you'd need to get some Filling ready. In this instance the semantics of the API use are explicitly enforced by its syntax. Keep it simple.
