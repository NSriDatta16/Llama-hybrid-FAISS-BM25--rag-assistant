it hardly matters, since you are using 1 byte in both cases. but long story short, varchar is variable size & char is fixed size. in large quantities this can make a difference in storage space as well as affect computation time. performance wise, use char if data is going to be fixed length. if you are flexible with varying length of your data then use varchar.
