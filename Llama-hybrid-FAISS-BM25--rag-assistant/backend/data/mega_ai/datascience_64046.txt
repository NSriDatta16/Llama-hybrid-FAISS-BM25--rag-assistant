You probably need to re-design the problem in a way which takes time into account (time series), and maybe use a specific model for that. Currently each of your instances is for a single month, so the algorithm tries to predict the number of passengers based only on this individual month and year. Logically the main information that the system would need is the number of passengers in the past few months for this airport, and it doesn't have it. A simple way to start would be to format the data so that one instance contains features providing information about the last N months.
