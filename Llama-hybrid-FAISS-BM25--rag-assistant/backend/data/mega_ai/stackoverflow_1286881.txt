As your own research has shown, and as all the other answerers have mentioned, using a GUID as the clustered index on a table is a bad idea. However, having a heap also isn't really a good choice, since heaps have other issues, mostly to do with fragmentation and other things that just don't work well with a heap. My best practice advice would always be this: do use a primary, clustered key on any data table (unless it's a temporary table, or a table used for bulk-loading) try to make sure the clustered key is a INT IDENTITY or BIGINT IDENTITY I would argue that the benefits you get by adding a INT/BIGINT - even just for the sake of having a good clustered index - far outweigh the drawbacks this has (as Kim Tripp also argues in her blog post you cited).
