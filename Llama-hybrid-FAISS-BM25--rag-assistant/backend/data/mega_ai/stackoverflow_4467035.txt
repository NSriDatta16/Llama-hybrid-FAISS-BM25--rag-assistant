EdgeCast storage supports Rsync/sFTP configuration to automatically sync content from a storage server. EdgeCast also supports "reverse-proxy" or "Customer Origin" configuration to pull content from another web-server into cache automatically. You can use S3 as this Customer-origin location or use EdgeCast's own Cloud Storage service or any other Web-server outside the EdgeCast network.
