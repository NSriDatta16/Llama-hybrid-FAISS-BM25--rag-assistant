Conjugate prior for parameter W when the likelihood is normal with mean and variance both functions of W

Suppose that $x$ is an observable scalar variable and $$ x \thicksim N(W\mu_0,W^2\sigma_0^2) $$ Where $W$ is a parameter that must be estimated from data, and $\mu_0$ , $\sigma_0$ are known constants. I want to solve the problem in Bayesian framework, so I consider $W$ as a random variable, and I have to choose a prior probability distribution for it. What is a suitable conjugate prior for W in my problem? (I prefer the priors which belong to a known family of distributions).
