pin/unpin draggable div in scriptaculous

I'm using a draggable effect on a css div for a shopping cart (prototype+script.aculo.us). I want to insert a link into this div which allows the users to toggle between fixed and absolute positioning. Does script.aculo.us has any simple way of doing it? (So far i found nothing)
