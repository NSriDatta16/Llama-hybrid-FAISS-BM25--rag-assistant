On 1., I would say the main advantage is maintainability -- making a little change to the language just means making a correspondingly-small change to the grammar, rather than minutely hacking through the various spots in the code that may have something to do with what you want changed... orders of magnitude better productivity and smaller risk of bugs. On 2. and 3., I can't suggest much beyond what you already found (I mostly use Python and pyparsing , and could comment from experience on many Python-centered parse frameworks, but for C++ I mostly use good old yacc or bison anyway, and my old gnarled copy of the Dragon Book -- not the latest edition, actually -- is all I keep at my side for the purpose...).
