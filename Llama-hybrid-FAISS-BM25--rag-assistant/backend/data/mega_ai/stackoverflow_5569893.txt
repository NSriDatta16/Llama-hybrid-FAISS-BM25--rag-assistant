Since assets are part of your apk, it's not possible to separate them or move them to the sdcard. You can enable "Move to SD Card" for your app, but that doesn't help with the 50 MB market limit. One solution would be to store the data files on the web and not include them in the apk. When your app is launched for the first time after installation, you would kick off a one-time process that downloads them to the sdcard. Once the files are on the sdcard, you can access them with: file:///sdcard/ Or to get a File reference to the sdcard root directory: File sdCard = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory();
