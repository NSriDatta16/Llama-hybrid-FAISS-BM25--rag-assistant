Others have already noted that browser sniffing is not ideal, but there are cases where a bug only happens in a browser and it can be hard to detect. In that case, you can do browser sniffing and hope the user agent string is valid. Here's what Ext-JS does. var ua = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); var isChrome = /\bchrome\b/.test(ua); var isSafari = !isChrome && /safari/.test(ua); Line 62 of view-source:http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/source/Ext.html has all of Ext's browser detection in an easy to read format. This is brittle and will probably not work as new versions and browsers come out. Tell us why you're testing for safari, so we can make sure there isn't a better way to achieve what you want.
