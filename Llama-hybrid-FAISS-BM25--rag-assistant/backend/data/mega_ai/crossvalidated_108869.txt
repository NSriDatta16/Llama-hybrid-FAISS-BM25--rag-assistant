VIsualizing the effect that only one predictor has on the outcome (R)

So I have performed a logistic regression on a data set with multiple predictors. I want to graphically represent the relationship between the outcome and only one of the predictors. What would be the best way of doing this? I am having a hard time figuring out how to graphically show the effect that predictor X has on Y independent of the other predictor terms. I read something about partial residual plots but I do not know how to implement this in R or how it would apply to data with a binary outcome. Any input is appreciated. Thanks,
