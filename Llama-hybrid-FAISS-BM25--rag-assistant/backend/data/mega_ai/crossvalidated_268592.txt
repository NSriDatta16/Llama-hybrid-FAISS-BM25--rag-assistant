Testing for absence of patterns in a time series does not generally require that the time series be generated in a particular way (e.g. be residuals of an ARMA process). For example, the Ljung-Box test applies perfectly well on raw data or residuals from, say, a regression model. (There has been some discussion whether it can be applied on residuals from an ARMA model, with my impression that it cannot; see "Testing for autocorrelation: Ljung-Box versus Breusch-Godfrey" .) I cannot tell whether and how the Ljung-Box test could be applied on the residuals of your model as I am not sure about the degrees of freedom calculation in your instance. Alternative tests for particular time series patterns in the data are, for example, the Breusch-Godfrey test ; the ARCH-LM test ; the Brock, Dechert & Scheinkman (BDS) test ; among other.
