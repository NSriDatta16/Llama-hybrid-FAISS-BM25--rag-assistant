This is how I do it in VBScript. Might not be very useful for you but might get you started. You need to have a PDF maker (adobe acrobat) as a printer named "Adobe PDF". 'PDF_WILDCARD = "*.pdf" 'PrnName = "Adobe PDF" Sub PrintToPDF(ReportName As String, TempPath As String, _ OutputName As String, OutputDir As String, _ Optional RPTOrientation As Integer = 1) Dim rpt As Report Dim NewFileName As String, TempFileName As String '--- Printer Set Up --- DoCmd.OpenReport ReportName, View:=acViewPreview, WindowMode:=acHidden Set rpt = Reports(ReportName) Set rpt.Printer = Application.Printers(PrnName) 'Set up orientation If RPTOrientation = 1 Then rpt.Printer.Orientation = acPRORPortrait Else rpt.Printer.Orientation = acPRORLandscape End If '--- Print --- 'Print (open) and close the actual report without saving changes DoCmd.OpenReport ReportName, View:=acViewNormal, WindowMode:=acHidden ' Wait until file is fully created Call waitForFile(TempPath, ReportName & PDF_EXT) 'DoCmd.Close acReport, ReportName, acSaveNo DoCmd.Close acReport, ReportName TempFileName = TempPath & ReportName & PDF_EXT 'default pdf file name NewFileName = OutputDir & OutputName & PDF_EXT 'new file name 'Trap errors caused by COM interface On Error GoTo Err_File FileCopy TempFileName, NewFileName 'Delete all PDFs in the TempPath '(which is why you should assign it to a pdf directory) On Error GoTo Err_File Kill TempPath & PDF_WILDCARD Exit_pdfTest: Set rpt = Nothing Exit Sub Err_File: ' Error-handling routine while copying file Select Case Err.Number ' Evaluate error number.
