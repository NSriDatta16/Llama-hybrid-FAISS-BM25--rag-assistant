Besides XML configuration, Spring ActionScript also supports MXML configuration. The type of config (XML, MXML) depends on the use cases your application needs to support. For the reasons you mention, it makes perfect sense to configure most of the context in MXML, but I would encourage you to externalize the config of service endpoints in every case. In a past project we opted for XML config since the configuration was generated at runtime when a user logged on to the application. Depending on the user credentials, different endpoints and various different settings were used. We could not have done this elegantly with static MXML configs. Both config types have their strengths and weaknesses, and it's up to you to decide what type you want to use. I think we could even support a mixture of MXML and XML quite easily actually if that would make sense. As soon as we have Dynamic Proxies and class loading, XML config will make a lot more sense.
