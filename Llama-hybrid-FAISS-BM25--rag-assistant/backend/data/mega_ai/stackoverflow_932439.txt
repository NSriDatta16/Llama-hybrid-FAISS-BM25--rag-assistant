I have written this kind of code before, but I have never tried to pass a server object to another server object in this way. I'm not a security expert, but I can sense why this might not be allowed. You should obtain the message directly from Server1, rather than asking another remote server to return it. In other words, your message retrieval logic needs to be in the client.
