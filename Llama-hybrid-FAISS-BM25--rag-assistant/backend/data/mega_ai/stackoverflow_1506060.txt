Nhibernate/Domain Objects generate test objects with random data from factory

We are doing some DDD at work and I am trying to find a good utility for generating Domain Objects with random data, or predefined data, and populating dependent objects. Example Usage: var user = DDDObjectFactory.CreateUser(); user.Name = "TestUser"; In our world, a user can not exist without a organization, so if there is no organization we need to create on of those too. For a specific test, i may not care about any property other than the username, so that is the only one that I specify real data for, all others should have random data.
