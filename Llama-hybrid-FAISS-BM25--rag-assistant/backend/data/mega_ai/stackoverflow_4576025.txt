Web site backup in PHP?

Does anybody know a clean PHP-based solution that can backup remote web sites using FTP? Must haves: Recursive FTP backups Possible to run through a cron job Easy to configure (easy adding of multiple sites) Local storage of backup files is sufficient Would be nice: Backed up sites are stored as zip files A nice interface to manage things Provides notification when backup has succeeded or failed Does incremental backups Does MySQL Database backups I need this to be PHP based because it's going to be used on shared hosting packages that do not allow usage of the standard GNU/Linux tools.
