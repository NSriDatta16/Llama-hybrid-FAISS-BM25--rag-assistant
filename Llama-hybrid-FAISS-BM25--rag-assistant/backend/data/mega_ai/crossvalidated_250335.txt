What order statistic is the median for a even-numbered sample?

I am calculating a Chakraborti-Desu test statistic from information available in Nonparametric Statistical Inference, 5th Edition by Gibbons and Chakraborti (hmm...). This statistic is for determining if at least one of k-1 samples is stochastically larger than the control sample. Part of the calculation requires counting the number of elements in each sample that are smaller than the $i$th order statistic of the control sample. Now, suppose that the control sample has 24 elements and we want to check for elements that are smaller than the median. The median is the average of the 12th and 13th order statistic. Does that make median the 12.5th order statistic? I've never seen a non-integer order statistic. What is the correct value of $i$?
