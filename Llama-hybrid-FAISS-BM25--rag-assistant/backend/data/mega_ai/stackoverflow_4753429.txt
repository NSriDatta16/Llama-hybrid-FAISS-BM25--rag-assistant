All the javascript work you can do only by functional scripting can be done by oop scripting and vice versa. In most cases, using javascript as an OOP language is more elegant and powerfull, but not necessarily more efficient. When I started to put toghether the javascript OOP basics , I was so fascinated by the prototipical inheritance , that i used objects everywere... until I realized that I was complicating everything (ex: instead of a normal 2-line image preloader script, I started coding ImgObjects that were much more complex than my original task required). From the little code you provided, I can't really tell if OOP would bring major improvements on your project, but i suggest you take a peak at prototipal inheritance and maby some design patterns ( this book is amazing), but don't forget that javascript is a fully functional language!
