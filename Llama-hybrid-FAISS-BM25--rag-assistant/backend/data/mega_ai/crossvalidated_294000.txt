Logistic regression may potentially not be of much help here. I can guess why it was suggested but there's a good chance that won't be appropriate for such a scenario. This is a time series problem and you need to use a time series technique, preferably one with external regressors such as ARIMAX, regression with ARMA errors, or neural network autoregression (just to name a few). If you're using R, you can find most of these in package 'forecast'.
