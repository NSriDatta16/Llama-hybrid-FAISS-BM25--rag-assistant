If you have only standardised the predictor variables (and it is hard to see how you standardise the outcome for logistic regression) then assuming you have the original standard deviations you can back calculate the OR on the raw scale. Suppose for concreteness that the original standard deviation was 10. Your current OR is therefor for a unit increase on the standardised scale which corresponds to 10 units on the original scale. So if you divide by 10 you are back where you started on the raw scale.
