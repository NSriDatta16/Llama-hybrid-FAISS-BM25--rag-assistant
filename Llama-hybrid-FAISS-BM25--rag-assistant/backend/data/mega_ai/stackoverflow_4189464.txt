Database type and engine for medium scale user content website

Using MySQL for basic storage of system/user data. I need to store/search messages (adding webmail functionality), and have analytic (on the fly reports/graphs from current and historical data, so kind of a data wearhouse) + this means i need to store historical data. So the question is: 1) Do I use MySQL for everything or use separate databases for messages, analytics/historical data/user data? There is also live feeds on the site which I heard MySQL isn't very good with. 2) For tables that use MySQL is InnoDB good enough or do i need more advanced engines like TukoDB? For messaging a friend mentioned to use a non relational database instead of MySQL. But if i use separate datbase types then that adds int he headache of keeping them all in sync and given this is a 24-7 user content site, I cant have any downtime. -- Website is a high traffic user content website, lots of reads/writes but no money so I need to depend less on servers/hardware and more on the database/software to keep me afloat, hence open to only free/open source databases and database engines.
