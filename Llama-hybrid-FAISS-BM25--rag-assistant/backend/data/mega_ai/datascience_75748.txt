You should limit the number based on judgment or any other info. General case - When you want to know the interest of user - In this case, You should use the user's interaction level with the Handle instead of following or not. \begin{array} {|r|r|r|} \hline Most-Interacted &2nd-Most &....... &N^t-Most&Label \\ \hline handle-1 &handle-2 &....... &handle-N&Gamer \\ \hline ...... &..... &..... &.....&Footballer \\ \hline handle-M1 &handle-M2 &....... &handle-MN&Actor \\ \hline\end{array} I am not sure, how will you do the encoding. Maybe you can embed the list of the handles using some approach which catches similarity e.g. Cosine. Special case - When you want to know If he is a Gamer or not - In this you should pick 100 ( or any good number based on judgement/basic data analysis ) Handle which generally people follow. You may get a list from related website \begin{array} {|r|r|r|} \hline Handle-1 &Handle-2 &....... &Handle-N &Label \\ \hline follow(1) &Not(0) &....... &Follow(1)&Gamer(1) \\ \hline ...... &..... &..... &.....&Gamer(1) \\ \hline Not(0) &Not(0) &....... &Follow(1)&Not-Gamer(0) \\ \hline\end{array} In this case encoding is already there. You may start with a big number too and later reduce the dimension based on variance towards Handles(PCA)
