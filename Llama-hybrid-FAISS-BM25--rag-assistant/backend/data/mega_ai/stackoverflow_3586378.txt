Everything is fixed when I remove this code from parent pom.xml (...) The problem looks similar to MJAVADOC-161 and more generally MJAVADOC-137 . Could you be using a buggy version of the maven-javadoc-plugin like 2.3 (sadly, you're not showing it)? If yes, try with version 2.4 or another more recent version. And if you are using a version greater than 2.4, try with the version 2.4 to see if a regression was introduced at some point. And in this case, please open a new issue. I'm using version 2.5. When I'm trying to reverse back to 2.4 I'm getting: 'aggregate' was specified in an execution, but not found in the plugin. Looks like 2.5 is my only option? You think I need to file a bug report? I didn't pay attention to the goal, javadoc:aggregate has been introduced in version 2.5 so it won't be in 2.4 indeed and the issues mentioned above aren't relevant. But I took a second look and I saw some others like MJAVADOC-275 or MJAVADOC-276 . I'm not sure to understand the exact status (and the bug might be not fixed) but before opening an issue, be sure to try with versions 2.7 and version 2.6 (some people mention a regression introduced in 2.6.1).
