Key-value db that serves only reads very fast?

We are doing a project in Scala and I need a key-value database (like a map) that is required to mainly serve read operations and do so really fast: No exotic query support or complex retrieval logic in any ways, just give the key and get the value, just like a map. no conditions, no joins, nothing. Key -> Value The value ,by the way, is itself a map of some list of some strings or something like that. meaning it's a little lengthy (if matters at all) We use it just for reading. No writing expect for the initial populating of the db or some very rare updates or perhaps that can be handled outside of the db ... I've been directed towards MangoDB and memcachedDB but Mango is good at queries (which adds no value to me) and memcacheDB is all about distribution (not a concern in my project). So far I'm thinking of leveraging a RDBMS (e.g MySQL) but perhaps there are better options in the land of NoSQL ?
