Depends on what Application you are trying to write. If its a simple service / data provider I would use HTML and CSS via a framework like jqTouch, jQuery Mobile, or http://www.sencha.com/ as these will run on mostsmart phones and you can package them into a binary app using something like http://www.phonegap.com/ this will allow for sliding, GPS, local file storage using HTML5 If you need to a database, motion sensing, bluetooth, game type application then you could look at http://monotouch.net/ http://monodroid.net/ That lets you write c# .net code and deploy onto any platform do you should be covered for windows mobile, android and iPhone. There is also http://rhomobile.com/ that lets you write applications for all mobile platforms using Ruby.
