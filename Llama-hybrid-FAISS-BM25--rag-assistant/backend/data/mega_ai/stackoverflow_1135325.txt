Did you put the code on a layer or on an invisible button? That code needs to go on an invisible button, and the button needs to go over all the elements of you page. To create an invisible button, create a new button symbol and don't put anything on any of the frames except the 4th (hit) frame. Drag this button to the topmost layer and put it above everything else. Click on the button, open the actions window, and paste your code in there.
