If you know the type of the window you want to block, you can simply subclass it and handle the destruction in your own WndProc . Use GetClassLongPtr() with GCL_WNDPROC on the tooltip class, use SetClassLongPtr() with GCL_WNDPROC to set your own WndProc and have it call DestroyWindow() on WM_CREATE and call the old WndProc for the rest..
