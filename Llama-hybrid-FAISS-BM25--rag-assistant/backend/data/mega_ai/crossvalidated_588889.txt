You might be confusing models with estimators. ARIMA and VAR are models. A neural network or a decision tree (or forest) can also be interpreted as a model. Meanwhile, maximum likelihood or ordinary least squares are estimation techniques. They are used to estimate a model's parameters. (And then there are optimization routines like gradient descent or simulated annealing. They facilitate estimators by providing a numerical solution to an estimator's equation.) You seem to be interested in models. Indeed, you can model $Y_t$ as a function of its lags $Y_{t-1},Y_{t-2},...$ . An autoregression provides a linear model with a finite number of lags. An ARIMA can in many cases be represented as an autoregression with an infinite number of lags (but still linear). A neural network or a tree-based model is a nonlinear model (normally with a finite number of lags). You can absolutely try that. There is no reason for a linear model to necessarily outperform a nonlinear one on all time series; there are certainly cases where nonlinear models can do better. Regarding your second question, it is quite distinct from the first one, so I suggest you cut it from this post and post it separately on a new thread.
