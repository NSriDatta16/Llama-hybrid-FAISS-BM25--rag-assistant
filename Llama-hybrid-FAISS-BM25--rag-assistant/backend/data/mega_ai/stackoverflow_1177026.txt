I actually dispare sometimes, there really arn't many of us real programmers left in the world any more who see the machine for what it is and love shifting bits around. A bit off topic I know, but I like to know exactly what's going on and definatly don't want any lame ass garbage collector going around the the background desperatly trying to sort out sloppy programmers messy heaps. I mean, how hard is it to match calls to free() with calls to malloc()/strdup(), how hard is it to make sure you have allocated enough buffer space in order to know you can call memcpy() saefly? Answer: Not very, but 99.9% of programmers really don't care what they are doing because they're just in it for the money, not the passion of writing a beutifully elligant piece of code. End Rant.
