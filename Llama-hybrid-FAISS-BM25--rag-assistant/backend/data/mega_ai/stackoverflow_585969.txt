Is this an example of LINQ-to-SQL?

I made a little WPF application with a SQL CE database. I built the following code with LINQ to get data out of the database, which was surprisingly easy. So I thought "this must be LINQ-to-SQL". Then I did "add item" and added a "LINQ-to-SQL classes" .dbml file, dragged my table onto the Object Relational Designer but it said, "The selected object uses an unsupported data provider." So then I questioned whether or not the following code actually is LINQ-to-SQL, since it indeed allows me to access data from my SQL CE database file, yet officially "LINQ-to-SQL" seems to be unsupported for SQL CE. So is the following "LINQ-to-SQL" or not? using System.Linq; using System.Data.Linq; using System.Data.Linq.Mapping; using System.Windows; namespace TestLinq22 { public partial class Window1 : Window { public Window1() { InitializeComponent(); MainDB db = new MainDB(@"Data Source=App_Data\Main.sdf"); var customers = from c in db.Customers select new {c.FirstName, c.LastName}; TheListBox.ItemsSource = customers; } } [Database(Name = "MainDB")] public class MainDB : DataContext { public MainDB(string connection) : base(connection) { } public Table Customers; } [Table(Name = "Customers")] public class Customers { [Column(DbType = "varchar(100)")] public string FirstName; [Column(DbType = "varchar(100)")] public string LastName; } }
