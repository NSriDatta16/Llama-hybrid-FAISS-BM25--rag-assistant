Can you perform a PERMANOVA analysis on nested data?

I've found no answer in the papers I have read regarding PERMANOVAs or on the web so I'm really hoping someone could help me answer this question. An example would be testing PERMANOVA on dissimilarity matrix Y by effects C, B, and A, wherein C is nested in B, and B is nested in A. I'm using the adonis function in the R vegan package. Thank you
