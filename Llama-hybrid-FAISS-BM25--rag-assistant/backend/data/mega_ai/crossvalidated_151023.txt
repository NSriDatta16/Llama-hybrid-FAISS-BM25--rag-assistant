(I'm the creator of lavaan.survey) As Stas already indicated, the combination (multiple imputation * complex sampling) can be tricky business. The main papers are Kott (1995) and Kim, Brick & Fuller (2006) . Here are some considerations: As mentioned by Stas, all the usual best practices of MI apply. Considering the below, I would probably not use quickpred() initially. There is a risk it will discard things that you actually need. It might help to make some reasonable subselection though. If you have weights , these need to be included in the imputation model as a covariate (Kim et al. 2006, p. 518). Since you are doing multiple group analysis ("domain estimation"), you also need to include the interaction between the group dummies and the weights in the imputation model (p. 519). If you have strata and clusters , things become more complicated. The imputation model needs to account for the resulting correlation between the observations. If not you will get the wrong standard errors (Kim et al. 2006: p. 514). A model-based way of doing this might be to include strata as fixed effects and clusters as random effects in a Bayesian imputation model. A more survey-like approach would be to follow Stas' suggestion and use a resampling procedure that respects the strata and clusters. For example, in bootstrapping and with just the clusters, you would sample a random cluster (PSU) with replacement and then individuals (2SUS) with replacement within the sampled clusters. Another advantage of Stas' resampling suggestion, even without strata and clusters, is that you will account for the uncertainty about the parameters of the imputation model including that caused by the weights. I am not sure if mice does this accurately by default. This is usually a relatively small additional term in the variance but it might make a difference. Once you have the multiply imputed datasets, you can just pass these as an imputationList to lavaan.survey (see the JSS lavaan.survey paper). lavaan.survey will then do all the usual MI pooling calculations for you. So you don't need to manually fit a model separately for each imputation! Hope this helps, All the best, Daniel P.S. Thanks to Stas and @Gaming_dude who brought this post to my attention. I would be happy to continue the conversation (here, lavaan Google discussion group, twitter, email..)!
