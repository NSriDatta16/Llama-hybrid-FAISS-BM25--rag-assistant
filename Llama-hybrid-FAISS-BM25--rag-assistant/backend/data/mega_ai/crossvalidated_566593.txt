How to compare the random forest performance using R-Squared?

I've trained a random forests for a regression problem. Now, I want to check if the model is not overfitted. I have tuned the parameters and then compared the R-Squared of Train and Test dataset as below test_predict % predict(test_data) %>% predictions R2_test % predict(train_data) %>% predictions R2_train The R-Squared on train dataset is significantly higher (close to 0.9) which made think the model is overfit. Then I came across to this question Random Forest - How to handle overfitting . It is saying that predict(model, newdata=train) "treats your training data as if it was a new dataset, and runs the observations down each tree. This will result in an artificially close correlation between the predictions and the actuals, since the RF algorithm generally doesn't prune the individual trees, relying instead on the ensemble of trees to control overfitting." I don't know what would be the best way to compare the performance of model between train and test dataset.
