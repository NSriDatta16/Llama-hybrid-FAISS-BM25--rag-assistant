If the time aspect is very important then you may want to consider some type of structured dependency model that can deal with a time series, but if I'm understanding your question correctly here's my answer. The problem with conducting those standard statistical tests repeatedly is called alpha inflation or the problem of multiple comparisons . Analysis of Variance is a procedure that allows conducting those standard tests simultaneously. The most basic version is a generalized t-test. There are variations of ANOVA like Kruskal-Wallis which is nonparametric. ANOVA is discussed thoroughly on this site. Here is an example of how to do it in SAS , SPSS , and R . Since you're measuring the same individual repeatedly you'll want to use a repeated measures design . If you're testing multiple hypotheses you'll want to also use a correction factor like Bonferroni , but as far as your question seems to be concerned this may not be the case so this last part may be unnecessary. rANOVA can be sensitive to assumption violations though so if you see your data violates them you may need to consider some other linear model. I hope this helps. More information about your problem would be useful to give more specific of an answer. Feel free to follow up if this leads to other questions.
