Suggestions for Neural Network Structure for Time-Series prediction with constant covariates

I've been working on a time series prediction problem and wondered if someone has run across a similar problem structure & can make a suggestion on how to structure the training data, network, or similar to yield reasonable regression performance. My data is structured as follows: I have a time series of outputs y(t) which I am trying to predict. I have a series of (constant) covariates say: {a,b,c} that contain information about the time series. The time series are different lengths (is usually a function of the covariates). The covariates result in non-linear effects in the outcome, which may manifest at different times, and there can be interaction effects between covariates. An example (of made-up data) to show the general data structure is below: t a b c y 0 17.5 3.3 0.3 0.0 1 17.5 3.3 0.3 -0.8 2 17.5 3.3 0.3 -1.0 3 17.5 3.3 0.3 -0.6 4 17.5 3.3 0.3 0.5 5 17.5 3.3 0.3 2.2 6 17.5 3.3 0.3 4.6 7 17.5 3.3 0.3 7.6 0 20.3 3.6 0.3 0.0 1 20.3 3.6 0.3 -1.1 2 20.3 3.6 0.3 -1.4 3 20.3 3.6 0.3 -0.9 4 20.3 3.6 0.3 0.4 5 20.3 3.6 0.3 2.4 0 16.0 2.6 0.3 0.0 1 16.0 2.6 0.3 -0.6 2 16.0 2.6 0.3 -0.8 3 16.0 2.6 0.3 -0.7 4 16.0 2.6 0.3 0.0 5 16.0 2.6 0.3 1.0 6 16.0 2.6 0.3 2.4 7 16.0 2.6 0.3 4.3 8 16.0 2.6 0.3 6.5 9 16.0 2.6 0.3 9.2 10 16.0 2.6 0.3 12.3 11 16.0 2.6 0.3 15.8 12 16.0 2.6 0.3 19.7 I am able to train individual models for each time-step (e.g. many models with y1=f(t=1,a,b,c), y2=f(t=2,a,b,c) ), and this does generally work; however, I'm looking for an alternative to this which would allow for training, QA/QC and prediction using a single model. In my real-world example, I actually need to predict several time series that are related, and depend on the same covariates (but different & inter-related physical processes) - e.g. y1(t), y2(t), ... yn(t) I've been tempted to use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). These are generally what I'm looking for, except I'm unsure of how to feed constant covariates into the model in an effective manner. What model types / structures should I be considering for this type of time series prediction problem? (I'm working in either R or python, so references with respect to either of those would be particularly helpful.)
