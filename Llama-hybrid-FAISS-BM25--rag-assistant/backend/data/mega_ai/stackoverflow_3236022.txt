Generally speaking, your servlet container will have its own session manager, which is responsible both for maintaining the lifecycle of the sessions, and associating incoming requests with the appropriate session (via cookies, anchor parameters, whatever strategy it wants). The elegant way to do this would be to hook into this session manager in whatever way it allows. You could subclass the default one, for example, to allow you to get access to arbitrary sessions. However, it sounds like what you're doing belies an underlying problem with your architecture. The data contained within a session should be specific to that session, so in general you shouldn't need to look up an arbitrary one in order to provide the standard logic of your web application. And administrative/housekeeping tasks are usually handled for you by the container - so again, you shouldn't need to interfere with this. If you gave an indication of why you want access to arbitrary sessions, chances are that an alternative approach is more suited to your goals.
