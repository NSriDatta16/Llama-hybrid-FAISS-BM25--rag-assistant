I have a similar need for portability of a vb.net project. It doesn't work well to be working off of removable media (such as a pen drive) for vb.net projects. What you will want to do is copy the directory for your project onto the pendrive for storage only. When you/your client wants to work on the project, you will need to copy it to the hard drive of whatever computer you're working on before opening it in Visual Studio (or whatever IDE you use). Furthermore, if you're working with a database, it cannot be run off of removable media. So, again, same solution. As to wanting to copy your files using a form...while plausible in theory, it isn't really practical for the sheer mass of code you would have to have. You'd have to compensate for an number of situations, and in the end, you'd waste more time than you would save your client. Standard copy and paste in Windows Explorer is pretty simple, so perhaps you could show your client how to do that. Hope that helps!
