Convert categorical data with large number of levels to numeric data and what kind of mapping to use

I have a dataset with 20,000 rows and 11 columns. Out of the 11 columns 10 are categorical. Out of the 10, three have very large number of levels. i.e. levels >60. One of the variable is basically phone model names(for eg. SonyEricssonK700c ,GT-I9192,etc.), hence a simple alphabetical order mapping may not make sense. The problem here is random forest then cannot be used for categorical variables with levels greater than 53. Additionally, I also wanted to try K-means clustering on the data, hence, I would need to convert these variables to numerical. So far what I thought of doing was using :scale(as.numeric(x),center=TRUE,scale=TRUE) #where x is the column I want to convert to numeric.
