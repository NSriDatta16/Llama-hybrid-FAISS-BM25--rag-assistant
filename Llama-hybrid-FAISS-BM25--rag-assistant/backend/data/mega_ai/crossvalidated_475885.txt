Diary study: Should I model time with very unbalanced time-points? (Multilevel analysis)

I have a data set from a diary study in which daily stress during the current pandemic was assessed for 30 days. However, participants began their diary period at different time points, leading to an overall data collection period of 60 days. I want to build multilevel regressions to investigate the effect of different predictors on stress. However, due to the way the data was collected I am unsure of whether it makes sense to include time as a predictor: Day X/30 should be meaningless regarding stress, whereas day X/60 may be relevant due to the ongoing pandemic/lockdown. However, the sample is very unbalanced in this regard: Only about a fifth of participants answered the questionnaire in the last two weeks of the 60 days, with the numbers declining even more towards the very end. I know that multilevel models can handle unbalanced data to some regard, but I am wondering whether this is too extreme and would be problematic. Does anyone have any insights? Thank you in advance!
