Like any "discussion" about coding styles there is no correct answer. I prefer to apply these considerations: Does the code work as expected in all situations. (Principle of least surprise) Can the next developer (myself or someone else) understand what it is doing and why. How fragile is the code with respect to change. Is is simple as it needs to be and no more. I.e. no over or under engineering. Once I'm happy that I have satisfied the above, the rest generally just falls falls into line.
