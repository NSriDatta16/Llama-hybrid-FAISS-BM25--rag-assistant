It sounds like you have good data - 50 columns and 100,00 rows! I would do exploratory data analysis (EDA) and look for variables (columns) that are correlated with the response variable (re-offending) but NOT correlated with each other. If you can find a handful (~10) of these then you can build an excellent regression model. Other techniques to try could include random forests and cluster analysis. Both can be done really quickly in Python so you can compare lots of different hyperparameter iterations.
