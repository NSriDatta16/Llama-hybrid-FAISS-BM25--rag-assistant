This answer is from David Stiller of quip.net In AS2, the Video class doesn't feature any depth-related properties or moethods (contrast this, for example, with the MovieClip.swapDepths() method). For this reason, if you want to change a video's depth with AS2, you'll have to wrap the video object inside a movie clip. You'll have to give that wrapper movie clip an instance name, so you can change its depth with swapDepths(). That'll also change your reference for the attachVideo() method. e.g. // instead of this ... _root.flashVid.attachVideo(ns); // ... you'll have to use this ... _root.wrapperMC.flashVid.attachVideo(ns); ... where "wrapperMC" stands for whatever instance name you've given the wrapper movie clip. Does that make sense? The other thing to note is that movie clips dragged to the stage by hand are always lower, depth-wise, than movie clips attached to the stage by attachMovie() or createEmptyMovieClip(). So make sure to attach them all with code, or drag them all to the stage by hand. Otherwise, you'll have to "force" the manually dragged movie clip into the higher depths of the attached/created clips by using swapDepths() on it first. // Declare a reusable variable to manage the // attachment of three movie clips // Here's the first usage (note the depth of 3) var mc:MovieClip = this.attachMovie("contentAbove", "upperSquare", 3); // Here's the second (the video wrapper, depth of 2) mc = this.attachMovie("wrapper", "videoWrapper", 2); // move this one down a tad mc._y = 80; // Here's the third (depth of 2) mc = this.attachMovie("contentBelow", "lowerSquare", 1); // move this one down even more mc._y = 160; // Now wire up the video var nc:NetConnection = new NetConnection(); nc.connect(null); var ns:NetStream = new NetStream(nc); videoWrapper.flashVid.attachVideo(ns); ns.play("http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/295386/Stormpulse/my.flv");
