I suggest html like this: one two three Look it's a content-paragraph. bother bother bother bother bother bother bother bother bother bother bother bother bother bother bother bother bother bother bother With CSS like this: #menu { border: dashed gray 1px; } #menu ul { margin: none; padding: none; text-align: center; } #menu li { list-style-type: none; display: inline; } #contents { border: solid blue 1px; } If you see it on JSFiddle and resize the "Result" quadrant (bottom-right one) so that the text doesn't fit, you'll see that it lets the text stretch down and then gains scroll. Isn't this what you want?
