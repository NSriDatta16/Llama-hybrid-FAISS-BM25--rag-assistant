Average marginal effects by hand?

I'm having trouble calculating average marginal effects by hand. I have the coefficients from Latent Gold (so if anyone knows how to get AMEs from that program, that would be helpful!). Otherwise, I have a spreadsheet with the coefficients from the logit output, but I'm not sure how to calculate the average marginal effect by hand. I've seen several sites (i.e. Calculate Marginal effect by hand (without using packages or Stata or R) with logit and dummy variables ) that indicate that the formula is: $$p(y=1)*p(y=0)*\beta$$ . Say I'm interested in the average marginal effect of years of education on the outcome. Is $p(y=1)$ calculated by plugging in the mean of all the variables, including education, into the logit equation? And then multiplying by $\beta$ education? Or do I calculate $p(y=1)$ without holding education at it's mean, since it's the coefficient of interest? Thanks so much!
