Trend test on historical stock prices, where to start?

I am a beginner on statistic but come across an urgent situation that I have to work with statistics of stock prices data. I have learned that ones can do a hypothesis test that rejects the Random Walk hypothesis in order to show that the data have trends. I have tried to understand it but that seems impossible for me as a completely beginner. (beside simple concepts like probability and linear regression, I have just learned about the hypothesis test along the way!) I have tried finding if there are easier alternative ways that I can understand but am feeling lost as there are too many terms that I don't know such as parametric-nonparametric thing, t-statistics, residuals etc.. Not to mention that I can't randomly pick a test strategy to do the work, could I? In fact, I am not doing any deep analysis at all. All I want to do is to prove that a subset of my data is statistically increasing or not (in fact it is, visually), as follows. I have a time series of historical prices, $\{p_0, p_1, p_2,...,p_n\}$. And I have an algorithm to pick 2 points $p_{t1}$ and $p_{t2}$ (with $ {t2} > {t1}$) such that $p_{t1} Please guide me to do that or advise a learning path that leads straight to the topic. Thank you. Additional Information The picture below shows examples of the case where the prices between the two points are increasing and the case where not. My algorithm involves the use of MACD and fuzzy logic but it's just a trial-and-error thing and may looks basically like nothing more than asking a person to pick two points as mentioned. My intention is that the algorithm chooses $p_{t2}>p_{t1}$ due to that the data have the increasing trend from $t1$ to $t2$, not by chance
