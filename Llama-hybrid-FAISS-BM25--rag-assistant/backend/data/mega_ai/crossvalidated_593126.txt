Principal component vs. Exploratory Factor Analysis

Problem: Which method should I use to observe whether there is one common factor/component explaining six different measures (i.e., face and objects)? Study: In this study, we have four measures of faces and two measures of objects. Of the 6 measures, half were measuring memory, and half were measuring perception. We want to determine if the underlying mechanism of these six measures is related to (1) faces or objects, and (2) memory or perception. It would be great if anyone could provide some insights into which is a better method (PCA or EFA, maybe even CFA).
