extern is needed because it declares that the symbol exists and is of a certain type, and does not allocate storage for it. If you do: int foo; In a header file that is shared between several source files, you will get a linker error because each source would have its own copy of foo created and the linker will be unable to resolve the symbol. Instead, if you have: extern int foo; In the header, it would declare a symbol that is defined elsewhere in each source file. One (and only one) source file would contain int foo; which creates a single instance of foo for the linker to resolve.
