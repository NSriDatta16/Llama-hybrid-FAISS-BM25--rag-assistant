Mulitple Logistic Regression for count data using glm

I am having some difficulties fitting a multiple logistic regression model for my data which looks like this, As you can see from the screenshot above there are 4 explanatory variables, age , gender , disability and race taking the binomial form as 1 and 0. The data can be presented as count data, where Y is the binary response variable (1 for Yes and 0 for No). Data reproducible example : set.seed(10) age $age), table(dat$ gender), table(dat $disability), table(dat$ race)) colnames(m) % select(Age, Gender, Disability, Race, Y) new_dt This seems like a very simple problem but I still can't figure out an appropriate solution to fit a multiple logistic model using glm() for this type of data specifically. Sources Logistic regression in r for aggregated counts This doesn't work since it can only be applied to contingency table Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!!
