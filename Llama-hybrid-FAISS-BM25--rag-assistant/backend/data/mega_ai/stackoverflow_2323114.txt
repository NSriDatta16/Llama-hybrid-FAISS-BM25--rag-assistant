In php is there a reason to use a static method on a class instead of an independent method?

We're having this discussion here. Which is better and why? 1) a php file that just includes a function... function bar(){} called like this bar(); 2) a php that contains a class with a static method. class foo{ static function bar(){} } called like this foo::bar(); Are there any performance reasons to do one or the other? For code organization purposes the static method looks better to me but there are a few programmers here who see no reason to declare classes.
