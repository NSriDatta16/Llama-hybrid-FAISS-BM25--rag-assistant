Is there any Flex dataGrid implementation which has features similar to XtraGrid?

I am looking for a Flex datagrid component that has features like grouping, sorting, master/detail display, etc. I am having an application in C# that uses XtraGrid suite to achieve the required datagrid features. I am planning to migrate this application to Flex. If there is no flex component readily available with XtraGrid features, then I have to create one on my own. Please let me know if you know any? Thanks, Nirmal
