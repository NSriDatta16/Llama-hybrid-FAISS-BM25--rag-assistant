How does the $\phi(x_i)$ function look for Gaussian RBF kernel?

I am trying to write programs for simple SVM cases. And what I am stuck at is that I am unable to find $\phi(x_i)$ functions for given kernels. For example there is Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel: $$K(x_i,x_j)=\mathrm{exp}\left( \|x_j-x_i\|^2\right),$$ but to compute SVM's weights I also need $\phi(x_i)$, as $$w=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{SV}} \alpha_i d_i \phi(x_i).$$ Is there something I am missing, as in not even one book I have found $\phi(x_i)$ for a given $K$?
