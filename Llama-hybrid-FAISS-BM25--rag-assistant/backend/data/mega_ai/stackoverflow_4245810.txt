ICMP Ping packet is not generating a reply when using Scapy

I recently began exploring Scapy. A wonderful tool indeed! I have a problem... When I monitor my network card using Wireshark and I do a regular ping from the systems command prompt with the standard PING installation, wireshark pops up with "Ping request" and then "Ping reply" indication that it sent a reply. But when i do it manually in Scapy, it sends no reply back.. How can this be? I spent alot of time trying to figure this out so i really hope someone can shed some light on this issue of mine... Here is the code i used: >>> from scapy.all import IP, ICMP, send >>> IP = IP(dst="127.0.0.1") >>> Ping = ICMP() >>> send(IP/Ping) The packet is sent successfully and Wireshark shows a Ping request received, but not that it has sent a reply back.
