How do I change a shell scripts character encoding?

I am using Gina Trapiani's excellent todo.sh to organize my todo-list. However being a dane, it would be nice if the script accepted special danish characters like ø and æ. I am an absolute UNIX-n00b, so it would be a great help if anybody could tell me how to fix this! :)
