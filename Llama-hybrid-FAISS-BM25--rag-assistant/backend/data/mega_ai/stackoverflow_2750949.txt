iPhone app works hundreds of times, then crashes from memory error on startup, then never works until restart - why?

I have a Cocos2d/openGL iPhone game. It's a universal app and I'm dealing with an occasional but nasty error on the iPad. We are loading a lot of textures up front (3 2048x2048 textures). I'm working on reducing this up front load, but what worries me is I really don't understand the root cause of this crash that permanently breaks the app. This is the deal: 1. App works fine for hundreds of plays on the iPad 2. Eventually (I'm guessing due to other programs using up some memory and not letting go or whatever) the app starts crashing on startup. It just closes again in the middle of loading. 3. The App will now never work again on that iPad, closing immediately every time, until the iPad is restarted. Obviously my app is demanding too much memory up front to work reliably every time, I get that. What I don't get is why when it fails once, it has failed forever until the iPad is restarted. Can anyone explain what is going on here? EDIT: forgot to add organizer crash lags just say low memory, like this every time (I changed my app name to MyAppName below). Again, I know it's low memory, but why does it stay low memory until restart?: Incident Identifier: E7A2507C-3FB1-4E3B-B315-09F094236541 CrashReporter Key: 0fda9d667f2c6073f20a76809aa25438b6854d15 OS Version: iPhone OS 3.2 (7B367) Date: 2010-04-30 16:59:44 -0400 Free pages: 437 Wired pages: 17228 Purgeable pages: 0 Largest process: MyAppName Processes Name UUID Count resident pages MyAppName 22385 (jettisoned) (active) mediaserverd 242 DTMobileIS 5826 notification_pro 67 syslog_relay 66 notification_pro 67 notification_pro 67 afcd 72 ptpd 181 syslogd 81 lsd 130 iapd 204 notifyd 71 BTServer 108 CommCenter 181 SpringBoard 5339 (active) configd 373 fairplayd.K48 84 locationd 599 mDNSResponder 108 lockdownd 303 MobileStorageMou 69 launchd 98 **End**
