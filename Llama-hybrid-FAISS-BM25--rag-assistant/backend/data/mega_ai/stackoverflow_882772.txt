Capturing stdout when calling Runtime.exec

When experiencing networking problems on client machines, I'd like to be able to run a few command lines and email the results of them to myself. I've found Runtime.exec will allow me to execute arbitrary commands, but Collecting the results in a String is more interesting. I realize I could redirect output to a file, and then read from the file, but my spidey sense is telling me there's a more elegant way of doing it. Suggestions?
