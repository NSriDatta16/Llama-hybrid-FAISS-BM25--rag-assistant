Best Javascript drop-down menu?

I am looking for a drop-down JavaScript menu. It should be the simplest and most elegant accessible menu that works in IE6 and Firefox 2 also. It would be fine if it worked on an unnumbered list ( ul ) so the user can use the page without JavaScript support. Which one do you recommend and where can I find the code to such a menu?
