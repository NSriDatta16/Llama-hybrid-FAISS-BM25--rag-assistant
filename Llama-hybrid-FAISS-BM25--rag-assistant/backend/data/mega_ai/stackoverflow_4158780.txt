In javascript you can always ask for the navigator and check diferent properties like navigator.userAgent that will give you something like this User-agent header: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/7.0.517.44 Safari/534.7 That string you can search deviceIphone, deviceIpod for mac devices and so on for the different browsers. You can use something like this http://detectmobilebrowser.com/ to avoid checking manualy each diferent movile provider, but sometimes is good to make especific pages for some devices. You can also check diferent browsers serverside and make a redirect before.
