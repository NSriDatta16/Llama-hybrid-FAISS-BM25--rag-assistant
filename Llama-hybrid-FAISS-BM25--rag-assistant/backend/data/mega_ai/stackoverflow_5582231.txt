ASP.net Viewstate and Ports

In reviewing logs for several sites, I noticed that several of them reported Viewstate errors. While I was able to diagnose solutions for these, one thing I kept seeing is that in the exception logs it kept reporting port numbers: ViewStateException information: Exception message: Invalid viewstate. Client IP: 1.2.3.4 Port: 10189 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729) From what I can see, the port numbers are usually high. My question is - what is this being used for? What is the relationship between viewstate and these ports? Does the client use these ports or is this something internal within the ASP.net pipeline?
