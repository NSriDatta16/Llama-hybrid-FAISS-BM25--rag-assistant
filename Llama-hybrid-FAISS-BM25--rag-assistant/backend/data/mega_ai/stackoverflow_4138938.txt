You should really be using checkboxes if there will be an instance where something isn't selected. according to the W3C If no radio button in a set sharing the same control name is initially "on", user agent behavior for choosing which control is initially "on" is undefined. Note. Since existing implementations handle this case differently, the current specification differs from RFC 1866 ([RFC1866] section 8.1.2.4), which states: At all times, exactly one of the radio buttons in a set is checked. If none of the elements of a set of radio buttons specifies `CHECKED', then the user agent must check the first radio button of the set initially. Since user agent behavior differs, authors should ensure that in each set of radio buttons that one is initially "on".
