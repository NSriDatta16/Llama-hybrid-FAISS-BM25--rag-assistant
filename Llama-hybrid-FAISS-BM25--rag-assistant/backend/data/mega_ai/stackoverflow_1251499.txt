Why is the asp.NET profile designed in such a horrible way?

In the current project I'm working on, we are using the asp.NET profile to store information about users, such as their involvment in a mailing list. Now, in order to get a list of all the users in the mailing list, I cannot simply do a database query, as the asp.NET profile table is, simply put, awful. For those who do not know, the profile table has two main columns, the 'keys' column, and 'values' column, and they are organised as so: Keys: Key1:dataType:startIndex:endIndex:key2:dataType . . etc. Values: value1value2value3... This is pretty much impossible to query using SQL, so the only option to find users that have a specific property is to load up a list of ALL the users and loop through it. In a site with over 150k members, this is understandably very slow! Are there specific reasons why the Profile was designed like this, or is it just a terrible way of doing dynamically-generated data?
