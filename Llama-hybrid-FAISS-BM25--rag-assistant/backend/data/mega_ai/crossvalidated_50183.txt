Global warming testing

I'm very interested in weather. I use data from weather-stations. Here are 2 examples of changing average annual temperature in Vienna and Moscow. (I've got more, but only 2 links allowed (( LinearModelFit method from Mathematica have been applied (blue lines). YearTemp1 YearTemp2 Well we can see, that in model $y=a\cdot x+b$, $a$ is small, but always positive number. Is it so called global warming, I wonder? There is a great scatter of data, from year to year. So the question to community is: are there additional criteria (exept just the fact that $a>0$) for someone can say: "Yes, with probability 50% (20?...90?) we have global warming". Mathematica has a lot of stats methods so the problem is just "what of them to use". UPD There is similar question, What is the best test for validating trends in time-series data? but I do not see any real answers.
