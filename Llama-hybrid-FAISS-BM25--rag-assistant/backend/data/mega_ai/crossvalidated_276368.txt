Basic concept of utility

I'm new to the concept of utility and I'm struggling to understand an important idea. Say we have some bet. I don't understand how the utility of the expected value of the bet differs from the expected value of the utility of the bet. In my mind, both correspond to what I would expect to get out of the bet on average, scaled to take in account my preferences for different monetary values. Perhaps a simple example showing how exactly the two ideas are different would help. Thanks!
