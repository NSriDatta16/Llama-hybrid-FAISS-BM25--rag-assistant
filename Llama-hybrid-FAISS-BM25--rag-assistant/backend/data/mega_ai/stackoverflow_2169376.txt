Encrypting Scripts for Embedding in Text Files

I'm working on a closed-source game that uses a scripting language for automation. Almost all of the game logic is handled by scripts. Scripts can be compiled to a bytecode format, but due to the nature of the language, identifiers must be preserved. Compiled scripts can be embedded in other text-based resource formats using a binary-to-text encoding. I want to encrypt the compiled scripts to protect the source during distribution, but because the language, bytecode format, and binary-to-text encoding scheme are all proprietary, do I need to worry about encryption at all? If so, should I simply perturb some bytes and call it a day, or should I make use of a fully featured encryption solution? Encryption should not increase the size of the executable unduly, because scripts can be large and load times are important.
