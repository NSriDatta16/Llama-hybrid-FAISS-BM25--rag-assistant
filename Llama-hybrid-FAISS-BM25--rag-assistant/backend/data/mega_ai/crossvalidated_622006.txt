Multiclass Classification using Binary Representation and Sigmoid Activation in Neural Network

I am currently working on a multiclass classification problem where I have categorical variables that I've encoded using binary representations as follows: 0 -> 00 1 -> 01 2 -> 10 3 -> 11 My approach involves using a neural network with two output neurons, each having a sigmoid activation function. I use Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function during training. At inference time, I assign 0 as the output when the activation is less than 0.5; otherwise, I assign 1 for both neurons. I am wondering if this approach is appropriate for a multiclass classification problem. The only advantage I can see now is fewer weights between the last and second last layer.
