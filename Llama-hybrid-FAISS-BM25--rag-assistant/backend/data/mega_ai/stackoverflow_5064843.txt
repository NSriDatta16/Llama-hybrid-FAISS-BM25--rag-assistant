Averaging columns in a table - ignoring certain columns

I've the following code which successfully makes an average for all the columns from a table. What I need to do though is ignore certain columns in this equation. Dim totalNumber as Double = 0 Dim count as Integer = 0 For x = 0 To xyz123.Tables(0).Columns.Count - 1 Dim current as Double = 0 If Double.TryParse(xyz123.Tables(0).Rows(0)(x).ToString(), current) AndAlso current <> 0 Then count += 1 totalNumber += current End If Next Dim averageRating as Double = totalNumber / count
