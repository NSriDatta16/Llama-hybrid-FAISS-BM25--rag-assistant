As you have a target (column 93: "is_subscriber"), why not opt for a regression or classification method? Clustering is more beneficial for situations where you want to extract "common features" out of your dataset but you have no information on that dataset or the dataset implication, i.e., target. Moreover, if you want to predict future customers as "potential subscribers" or not, a regression will provide you with the prediction formula. Then you can apply that formula to future customers to predict their behavior. You can obtain such result with Logistic Regression or, if you prefer a classifier, a Random Forest.
