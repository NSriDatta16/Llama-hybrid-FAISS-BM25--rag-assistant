MCMC efficiency and nonlinear reparametrizations

The efficiency (e.g., effective sample size per density evaluation) of most MCMC methods depends on the parametrization. However, so far I have come across little work in the MCMC literature that deals specifically with semi-automatically choosing a good parametrization, aside possibly of linear transformations that decorrelate the variables. As an application, consider that most authors suggest to have some warm-up or burn-in period (with recommendations that go from 0% to 50% of the total number of samples). However, if an algorithm can use the information gathered during burn-in to re-parametrize the density and make the sampling more efficient, it might be even worth spending 80% of the time in multiple refined burn-in steps (see e.g. the Stan reference guide about multiple burn-in steps). Do you know of any work that proposes methods to choose (automatically or semi-automatically, i.e. with some human guidance) a nonlinear model re-parametrization at the end of burn-in? For a linear transformation, for example, an algorithm could realign the axes according to the covariance of the points sampled towards the end of the warm-up phase. Also, I specify "at the end of burn-in" because nonlinear adaptive methods will easily mess up with the Markov property and ergodicity, so let's keep things simple for the moment.
