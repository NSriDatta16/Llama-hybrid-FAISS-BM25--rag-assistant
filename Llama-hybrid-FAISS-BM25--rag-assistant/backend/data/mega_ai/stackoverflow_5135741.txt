You need to set your form to have no title and also to, as you say, hide the control box. You can change both of these in the Properties panel for your form. Or, in code: public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); ControlBox = false; Text = ""; } Note that this will cause your form to be undraggable (if it's not already resizable), and you need to add your own control to handle closing the form. EDIT: one way to prevent the window from being resizable and prevent the cursor from changing to the resize handles is to override the WndProc() handler for the form and intercept WM_NCHITTEST . Place this method in your form class, and keep the FormBorderStyle as FormBorderStyle.Sizable or FormBorderStyle.SizableToolWindow : protected override void WndProc(ref Message message) { const int WM_NCHITTEST = 0x0084; if (message.Msg == WM_NCHITTEST) { return; } base.WndProc(ref message); }
