You really need to investigate the source of the data, files, print outs, local gandolphs etc. Even if someone can find something with a stab in the dark it's likely to be wrong in some tiny detail. Where did the pair of coordinates come from? A text file? An email? Were there any auxiliary files? With the same file name, but different extension? In the same folder? Attached to the email? Who gave it to you? What sort of computer do they use? Are they alive? Etc. There's simply not enough information in this question to answer it - tell us at least how you know that they are "geo coordinates" - how do you know that they must be in the Honduras? Unfortunately this level of cultural metadata is quite often about the best we have. As a massive stab in the dark they might be projected coordinates in km, rather than metres - but they could be in feet - or anything, there's really only educated guesses that can improve on this as it stands.
