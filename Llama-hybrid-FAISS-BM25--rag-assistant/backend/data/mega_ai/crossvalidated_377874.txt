I can't say I know the standard procedure for your field but I think the standard in statistics more broadly would be to use the probabalistic framework of your model, which I imagine is cross-entropy. That is $$P(Y|X)=E[Y|X]=f(X)$$ and this follows from the fact that $Y$ is binary. Note the assumption is that $f$ models the expectation exactly. Therefore, if we want to know that marginal expectation $$E[Y]=\int_X f(X)P(X) dX \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{x\in X} f(x)$$ You might also want to quantify the uncertainty in this point estimate. One way to do this is to model $f$ as a random function i.e. treat the parameters of your network as random variables as in Bayesian analysis. Then one could look at the distribution of expectations. Finally, if you suspect that your training set under-represents the data space, you might want to model $P(X)$ and calculate all expectations using samples from the estimated density function instead. As a general note, accurate point estimates on (a limited number of) test datasets with known porportions isn't necessarily the best way to evaluate success. Since this is a classic inverse inference type problem, finding a way to express certainty/uncertainty about your prediction on a given dataset is of much greater practical value. For example, you could treat the confusion matrix as a random variable produced by variation in the function $f$ . Even though any particular estimator might yield values closer to a particular ground truth, in the absence of this knowledge, estimator uncertainty is much more informative in deciding whether or not to trust a value.
