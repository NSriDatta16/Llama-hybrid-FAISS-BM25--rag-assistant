Automation testing tool for Regression testing of desktop application

I am working on a desktop application which uses Infragistic grids. We need to automate the regression tests for same. QTP alone does not support this, we need to buy new plug in for same which my company is not very much interested in. Do we have any open source tool for automating regression testing of desktop application? Application is in Dot net but i do not think it makes much of a difference. Please suggests, i have zeroed in for test complete but again it is licensed one. I need some open source.
