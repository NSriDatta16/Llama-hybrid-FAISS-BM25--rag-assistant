We really need more information about your goals to answer this question. Regressions are used for two main purposes: Prediction Inference Prediction is when your goal is to be able to guess at values of the outcome variable for observations that are not in the sample (although usually they are within the range of the sample data–otherwise, we sometimes use the word "forecasting"). Prediction is useful for advertising purposes, finance, etc. If you are just interested in predicting some outcome variable, I have little to offer you. Inference is where the fun is (even if it is not where the money is). Inference is where you are trying to make conclusions about specific model parameters–usually to determine a causal effect of one variable on another. Despite common perception, regression analysis is never sufficient for causal inference. You must always know more about the data generating process to know whether your regression captures the causal effect. The key issue for causal inference from regressions is whether the conditional mean of the error (conditional on the regressors) is zero. This cannot be known from p-values on regressors. It is possible to have regression estimators that are unbiased or consistent, but that requires far more effort than just throwing some obvious controls into the regression and hoping you got the important ones. The best coverage I have seen of approaching causal inference with observational data is in two books by Angrist and Pischke ( Mastering 'Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect and Mostly Harmless Econometrics ). Mastering Metrics is the easier read and is quite cheap, but be warned that it is not a treatment of how to do regressions but rather of what they mean. For a good coverage of examples of good and bad observational research designs, I recommend David Freedman's (1991) "Statistical Models and Shoe Leather", Sociological Methodology , volume 21 (a short and easy read with fascinating examples). Aside: the obsession with statistical technique over good research design in most college courses is a pedagogical peeve of mine. Second aside to motivate the current importance of this issue: the difference between prediction and inference is why big data are not a substitute for science.
