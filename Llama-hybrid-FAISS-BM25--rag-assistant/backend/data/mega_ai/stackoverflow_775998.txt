By default the tabs in NetBeans are ordered acording to when they were opened. I don't think there's a way how to change it right in NetBeans and don't know about any plugin neither. I think this behaviour is just a matter of taste - I was used to NetBeans behaviour and when I'm using Eclipse, I always get confused about shuffled tabs. But as Kevin said you can drag the tabs to change their order. When you press CTRL + TAB , the documents in the popup window are ordered acording to last used. This might be usefull for you. Another (partial) solution might be docking a documents window (Window -> Documents) which contains opened documents and where documents are ordered alphabetically. It's better than re-openenig the files (as you wrote) especially if youre files are spread in different packages and you can't see them in projects/files view on one screen.
