This raises an under-appreciated point about the scope of "time-series analysis" I think you have hit on an under-appreciated point in time-series analysis here, which is that mathematically these models can also legitimately model data indexed by some other variable that does not represent "time" in the real world. If we step back from the terminology used in the field and just look at the bare bones of the mathematics of the models, we see that the field of "time-series analysis" uses statistical models with the following general features: There are data values $x_t$ indexed by an index $t$ , and this latter index can be either an integer (for "discrete-time" models) or a real number (for "continuous-time" models). Models in this field may incorporate deterministic effects on the index $t$ (e.g., a linear trend, a polynomial trend, a sinusoidal wave, etc.). Models in this field may incorporate "auto-regressive" statistical relationships, whereby we can write an equation for $x_t$ that depends on one or more values $x_r$ for $r and random error (and possibly also some exogenous variables). Although models can often be manipulated into other forms, the defining form of the model never involves effects that reference larger values of the index $t$ . So, for example, in the defining equation for the data value $x_t$ we would not include any effect referencing $x_r$ for any $r>t$ . In this sense, the definition of the model treats the index $t$ as an ordering where effects can only reference "previous" values (or "current" values of other variables). In more complicated models, we may have multiple series of data values $x_t$ , $y_t$ , $z_t$ , etc., and we incorporate cross-referencing effects between them. Again, these models obey the general rule that their defining forms only reference "current" or "previous" values. Now, it is entirely possible that models obeying the above properties might be useful in describing phenomena where we have data $x_t$ referenced by an index $t$ that does not represent time . In this case, we would model the data using a "time series model" even though the dataset is not actually a time-series --- i.e., the index referencing the data does not refer to time. In theory, it is possible that $t$ might represent a spatial variable, or a temperature variable, or something else that is not time. Obviously the models in time-series analysis are only really applicable when indices that are "directional" in the sense that they the requirements above, so some kinds of spatial models (which have effects that operate in both directions in space) would not meet these requirements. In any case, as you can see, the scope of "time-series analysis" is technically larger than just models for data indexed by time. This is one of the points that I try to get across to students when teaching time-series analysis, but it is often forgotten through the force of repetition of the time-based terminology used to describe the models. It is a nice thing to bear in mind, in case you encounter statistical problems where you have data indexed by another directional variable, where you want to use a model with the above properties. In this case you can use "time-series analysis" even though your data does not vary with time. To be sure that I answer your title question, please note that any dataset containing a series of observations indexed by time is ---by definition--- a time-series. This is a contextual question regarding the meaning of the variable $t$ , not a mathematical question. This means that you will need to look at context and the meaning of your variables to determine whether or not your dataset is a time-series. However, the relevant issue for whether or not the field of "time-series analysis" is applicable is whether or not the model forms developed in that field are appropriate to the data. The vast majority of actual time-series datasets can be dealt with fruitfully by the models in "time-series analysis" or regression, but other datasets not involving time can sometimes be dealt with using these models.
