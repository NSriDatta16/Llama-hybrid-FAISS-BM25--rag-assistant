How do I browse an old revision of a Subversion repository through the web view?

I know how to browse my project's Subversion repository through its web front-end, but it seems that I can only browse the latest revision of the trunk. Is there a way to browse an older revision of the trunk through the web UI? I know how to do this from the command-line, but I need to know how to do this using URLs, because I'm embedding these URLs into a document. I also know I could create an svn-style tag of the trunk, but I would prefer not to do that.
