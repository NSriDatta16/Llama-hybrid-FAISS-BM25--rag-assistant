The Bias-Variance Trade-Off

I'm reading "An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R". In the Paragraph 2.2.2 The Bias-Variance Trade-Off , the authors say: I'm not able to understand why the bias tends to initially decrease faster than the variance increases. Can you help me ? Both rigorous and intuitive explanations are greatly appreciated
