Why not RSL? Keeping the flex framework separate as an RSL seems the only option worth considering in your case. The RSL gets cached between requests. The optimizers won't dramatically reduce the size if it's already as low as 178k. Also, looking at that size, I presume you are not embedding any images or other resources. If you are, taking them out and loading them dynamically will help too, but at the cost of making more HTTP requests.
