"Not enough storage" Error When Trying To Select Destination Table in SSIS

I am building an SSIS package and getting an error when setting "Name of the table or the view" in the OLE DB Destination editor. SSIS Error Code DTS_E_OLEDBERROR. An OLE DB error has occurred. Error code: 0x8007000E. An OLE DB record is available. Source: "Microsoft SQL Native Client 10.0" Hresult: 0x8007000E Description: "Not enough storage is available to complete this operation.". Failed to open a fastload rowset for "[dbo].[MyTable]". Check that the object exists in the database. Exception from HRESULT: 0xC0202040 (Microsoft.SqlServer.DTSPipelineWrap) But, the table is definately there. What could be causing this error?
