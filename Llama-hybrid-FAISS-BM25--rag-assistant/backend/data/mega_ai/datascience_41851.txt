Can random forest algorithm provide customer churn prediction probability at each customer instead at class level?

I have customer training data set from telecom industry along with its test data set containing churn values 0 & 1 for each customer. I also have customer data set whose churn value is to be predicted ie 0 & 1. It is also required to get the churn prediction probability at individual customer level so that they can be arranged in descending order of the propensity to churn For brevity, showing limited features cust_train.xls cust_id Account Length VMail Message Day Mins Eve Mins Night Mins Intl Mins CustServ Calls cust_train_output.xls cust_id churn (0/1) I want to know if it is possible to get the churn prediction probability at individual customer level & how by random forest algorithm rather than class level provided by: predict_proba(X) => Predict class probabilities for X. Goal is to arrange the customer in descending order of the propensity to churn. Alterntively, is this possible with Logistic Regression Model? Thanks
