but i ll recommend Overwriting the VISIT function of your Layer you want to Scale, and handle the Scaling by either glOrthof or glScalef I wouldn't overwrite the visit function... just add your layer to the touch dispatcher: [[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher] addStandardDelegate:self priority:0]; And implement the delegate functions: - (void)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)ccTouchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)ccTouchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)ccTouchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; inside this functions if you notice that the user is panning/zooming, just update the scene position / scale properties. To find if the user is panning or zooming, check this InputController helper class here: https://github.com/caxaria/LoopingMenu Hope it helps,
