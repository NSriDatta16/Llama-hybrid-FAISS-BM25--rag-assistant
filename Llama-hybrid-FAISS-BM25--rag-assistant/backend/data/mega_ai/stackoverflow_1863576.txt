For this I would try to go with a more formal Dynamic SQL solution, something like the following, given your defined input parameters DECLARE @SQL VARCHAR(MAX) SET @SQL = ' SELECT FROM database.dbo.table T WHERE T.deleted = ''n'' ' --Do your conditional stuff here IF @searchf1 <> '' THEN SET @SQL = @SQL + ' AND fieldf1 = ' + @searchf1 + ' AND fieldr1 = ' + @searchr1 + ''' ' --Finish the query SET @SQL = @SQL + ' ORDER BY xxx' EXEC(@SQL) DISCLAIMER: The use of Dynamic SQL is NOT something that should be taken lightly, and proper consideration should be taken in ALL circumstances to ensure that you are not open to SQL injection attacks, however, for some dynamic search type operations it is one of the most elegant route.
