How can I best determine the Signal/Noise of a pulsed signal?

I have this pulsed signal, and I would like to quantify the signal to noise ratio. Is there a preferred way to do this? My current approach is to filter the points that are obviously part of the background noise, and find their deviation value. That's my noise value. My signal value is the average of the max peak values. I then find the ratio between these two. I feel like this approach is wrong and I'm wondering what is the best way to do this? Edit: I also feel like signal/noise might not be the correct measurement, it seems something like signal strength / background noise.
