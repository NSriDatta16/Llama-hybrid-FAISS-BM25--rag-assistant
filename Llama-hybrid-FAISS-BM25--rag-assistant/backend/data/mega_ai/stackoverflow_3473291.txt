Actually, I would say that passing $this to ClassB is fine - I think it's a totally reasonable way to recursively nest class instances. More importantly, is there a reason you are nesting recursively like this? If you could reorganize the classes to not depend on one another in this way at construction, you could simplify the whole problem. (I can't really say for sure without seeing code, and I'm not 100% sure I understand the problem)
