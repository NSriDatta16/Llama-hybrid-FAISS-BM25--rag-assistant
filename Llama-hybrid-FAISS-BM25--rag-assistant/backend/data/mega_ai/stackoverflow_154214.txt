Marshalling is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format that could be stored or transmitted. It's also called serialization (although it could be different in certain contexts). The memory representation of the object could be stored as binary or XML or any format suitable for storage and/or transmission in a way that allows you to unmarshal it and get the original object back. For an example of usage, if you have some online game with a client and server components and you wanted to send the player object containing player stats and world coordinates from the client to the server (or the other way around), you could simply marshal it at the client, send it over the network, and unmarshal it at the other end and it would appear for the server as if the object was created on the server itself. Here's a ruby example: srcplayer = Player.new # marshal (store it as string) str = Marshal.dump(srcplayer) #unmarshal (get it back) destplayer = Marshal.load(str)
