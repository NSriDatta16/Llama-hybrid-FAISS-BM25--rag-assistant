What is difference between creating a file with fopen and generating file with headers

One Way am creating an xls with fopen("test.xls") . Using fwrite i write xls and readfile give me the file. Second Way I generating xls with putting header('Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate'); // HTTP/1.1 header('Cache-Control: pre-check=0, post-check=0, max-age=0'); // HTTP/1.1 header ("Pragma: no-cache"); header("Expires: 0"); header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: none'); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"test.xls\""); header("Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel"); foreach () { echo contents to the file } Is there any difference between these 2 ways of generating file. What is difference.
