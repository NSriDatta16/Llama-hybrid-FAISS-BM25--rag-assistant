A decrease in AIC corresponds to an improvement in the model fit. Based on your results the model with an AR(1) component has improved over the one without, since for the AR(1) fit the AIC is smaller. I suggest that you look into distributed lag models (aka transfer function models ) since those are specifically designed for problems with input-output relationships, such as yours. Your output is the market share while inputs are the rest of the variables (predictors). Before putting the variables into a distributed lag model you should first identify the relationship of each input (predictor) with the output ( market share ). Since you are dealing with time series, a simple scatter plot will not suffice for that purpose, since the relationships between time series (e.g. between market share and retail price ) can be distributed over time instead of being contemporaneous. Cross correlation functions (ccf, which can be obtrained from the R tseries package) can be of great help when appropriately used. For more information on how to build distributed lag models and study input-output relationships, you may find the following two articles helpful (they provide a hands-on guidance on how to build those models): Bisgaard, S., & Kulahci, M.
