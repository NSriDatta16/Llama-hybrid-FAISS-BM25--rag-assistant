Applying common categorical labels to words is typically called Named-entity recognition (NER) . NER can be done by static rules (e.g., regular expressions) or learned rules (e.g., decision trees). These rules are often brittle and do not generalize. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are often a better solution because they are able to model the latent states of languages. Current state-of-the-art performance in NER is done with a combination of Deep Learning models . The Stanford Named Entity Recognizer and spaCy are packages to perform NER.
