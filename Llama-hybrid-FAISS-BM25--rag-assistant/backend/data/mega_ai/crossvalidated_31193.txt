In econometrics, many applied papers start with the assumption that $$ E[g(X,\theta)] = 0 $$ where $X$ is a vector of data, $g$ is a known system of $q$ equations, and $\theta \in \Theta \subseteq \mathbb{R}^p$ is an unknown parameter, $q \geq p$. The function $g$ comes from an economic model. The goal is to estimate $\theta$. The traditional approach, in econometrics, for estimation and inference on $\theta$ is to use generalized method of moments: $$ \hat{\theta}_\text{GMM} = \text{argmin}_{\theta \in \Theta} \; \bar{g}_n(\theta) 'W \bar{g}_n(\theta) $$ where $W$ is a positive definite weighting matrix and $$ \bar{g}_n(\theta) := \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n g(X_i,\theta). $$ Empirical likelihood providers an alternative estimator to GMM. The idea is to enforce the moment condition as a constraint when maximizing the nonparametric likelihood. First, fix a $\theta$. Then solve $$ L(\theta) = \max_{p_1,\ldots,p_n} \; \prod_{i=1}^n p_i $$ subject to $$ \sum_{i=1}^n p_i=1, \qquad p_i \geq 0, \qquad \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \cdot g(X_i,\theta) = 0. $$ This is the `inner loop'. Then maximize over $\theta$: $$ \hat{\theta}_\text{EL} = \text{argmax}_{\theta \in \Theta} \; \log L(\theta). $$ This approach has been shown to have better higher order properties than GMM (see Newey and Smith 2004, Econometrica ), which is one reason why it is preferable over GMM. For additional reference, see the notes and lecture by Imbens and Wooldridge here (lecture 15). There are of course many other reasons why EL has garnered attention in econometrics, but I hope this is a useful starting place. Moment equality models are very common in empirical economics.
