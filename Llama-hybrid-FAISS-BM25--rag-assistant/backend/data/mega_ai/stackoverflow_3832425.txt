Stating the problem: We want to find the index of the last non-digit character Reflexion: This implies that we check that each character after this point is a digit, which means we will need to perform at least O(k) comparison where k is the number of digits at the end of the string Implementation: Linear backward search, possibly involving bitwise trickery to "vectorize" the operations (comparing multiple characters at once) or leveraging a multithreading effort.
