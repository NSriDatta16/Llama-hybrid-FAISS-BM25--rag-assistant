GARCH parameters sum to greater than one

I am applying GARCH(1,1) to a time series but my parameters sum to greater than one, so that volatility explodes over time. What does this mean, is my series a series than simply can't be modelled by GARCH, or maybe that that $(p,q)=(1,1)$ is inadequate? If $\{a_t\}$ is a GARCH process then $\{a_t^2\}$ is an ARMA process; if I try R's auto.arima function (package "forecast"), it actually suggests that ARMA(1,1,2) would be best. So, should I use some other variant of GARCH (IGARCH?), or what's going on?
