It's been a decade or so, but I did exactly this for my senior capstone (Well, I built a back-propogating neural network in C, and used a scheme program to teach it). The version of Scheme I was using had a compiler as well as an intepreter, and I was able to build it as a .o file. I don't know the version of scheme I was running, but it appears the RScheme will turn your scheme code into C.
