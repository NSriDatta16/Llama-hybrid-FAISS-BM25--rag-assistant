How should I build a gaming community

I've been wanting to build my own gaming community site (like http://fragbite.com ) for a long time. I have started many times but just quit after a couple days because it gets very messy. I've been playing around with PHP and MySQL off and on for 3 years, but I've never gotten in to OOP. I have tried, but I usually end up with the "old PHP". I usually build my pages so that I include a file on top of all pages with necessary functions, html head etc. and I mix php and html together which I don't mind, but if I eventually would get a designer he would not like it I think. I have tried both phpcake and codeigniter and all those popular mvc's but it's just too much, like they do all the work. I want to do it myself, but I don't know where to start. What would you do if you were me? Is there maybe some non-oop mvc? (Sorry for my English)
