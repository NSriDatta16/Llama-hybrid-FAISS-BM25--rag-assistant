Custom implementation of KNN regression

I'm attempting to implement KNN from first principles. Given the dataset with training values where the format is training features -> training outputs and contains dataset : 1,1 -> 1 2,2 -> 2 3,3 -> 3 Are my steps below correct? Calculate all distances between each of the points in the dataset: Distance between [1 1] and [1 1] : 0.0 Distance between [1 1] and [2 2] : 1.414 Distance between [1 1] and [3 3] : 2.828 Distance between [2 2] and [1 1] : 1.414 Distance between [2 2] and [2 2] : 0.0 Distance between [2 2] and [3 3] : 1.414 Distance between [3 3] and [1 1] : 2.828 Distance between [3 3] and [2 2] : 1.414 Distance between [3 3] and [3 3] : 0.0 To determine which class a new instance belongs to take the average of the nearest K neighbors. For example, if a new instance is [3,5] then: Distance between [3, 5] and [1, 1] : 4.472 Distance between [3, 5] and [2, 2] : 3.162 Distance between [3, 5] and [3, 3] : 2.0 As K=2 the nearest K points are [2, 3] and [3, 3]. The classifications for [2, 3] and [3, 3] are [2, 3]. Taking the average of [2,3] = 2.5. Therefore for [3,5] it's predicted values is 2.5
