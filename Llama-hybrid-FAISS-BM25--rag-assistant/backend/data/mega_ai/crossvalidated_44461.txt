"Ties" in Bayesian Survival Analysis

I have been reading about Bayesian methods for performing survival analysis. One of the things that struck me is that in the three or so books that I have read, there is no mention of handling ties between events, e.g. Efron, Breslow, or exact. Is this complication limited to frequentist statistical treatments?
