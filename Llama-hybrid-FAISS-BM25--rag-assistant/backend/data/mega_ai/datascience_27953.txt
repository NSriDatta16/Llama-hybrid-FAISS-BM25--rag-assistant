Difference between explicit and implicit density with and without the relation to neural network

I have a lack of understanding about this issue. Could anybody explain it or give an advice to a good literature regarding it? I don't understand what is a explicit density model and how it differs from an implicit density one. Could anyone exemplify the difference between these two kinds of models? Here is the picture source .
