I can see that setting up the 404 page in the web.config is a nice clean method, BUT it still initially responds with a 302 redirect to the error page. As an example, if you navigate to: https://stackoverflow.com/x.aspx you'll be redirected via a 302 redirect to: https://stackoverflow.com/404?aspxerrorpath=/x.aspx What I want to happen is this: http://www.cnn.com/x.aspx There's no redirect. A request for the missing URL returns a 404 status code with a friendly error message.
