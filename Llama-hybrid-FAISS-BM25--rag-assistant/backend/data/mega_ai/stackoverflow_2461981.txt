There is no need to split clients into two tables (dimensions). Simply put all clients, active and prospects into the same dimension table. You could then introduce an IsActive attribute (column) to distinguish between paying clients and prospects. Sooner or later you will use a data mining tool to learn more about clients and what distinguishes people who are willing to pay for your service from those who are not. In order for the algorithm to work, you have to supply data for both groups of people -- those who are paying and those who are not paying. To summarize, prospects belong to the same table as paying clients. With this, you can use your model No 1. Make sure that measures in the fact table make sense. For example if a call_id =123 had 10 people participating, then sum(cost_of_connection) from factAudience where call_id = 123; should return the total cost of the call, not something meaningless -- like 10x the real cost. EDIT A "paying client" and a "prospect client" are both a type of a client, therefore belong to the same dimension table -- dimClient. Somewhere in the DW there is a factSale (or similar) with FK to the dimSale. Even if you do not have a column in dimClient to differentiate between paying and prospects -- you can still get paying clients by joining factSale and dimClient. "Who is a customer?" is a common debate when introducing a DW in an organization. In order to be able to analyze client acquisition, retention, conversion, etc., prospects have the same treatment as paying customers -- at least in the DW. Keep in mind that acquiring and creating new customers is on the top of the list for (almost) any CEO.
