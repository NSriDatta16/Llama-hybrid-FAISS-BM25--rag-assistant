That's pretty secure. Spoofing an IP address at the router level is pretty hard and is a common security approach for banks. By locking it down by ip adress at the router, you are pretty certain you know which organizations will be accessing your web service. It sounds like a two factor authentication scheme, but to say that it is "air tight", I'd have to hear more about the guid key and how that is going to be implemented. Is everyone going to use the same key, or will it be different for each person/application accessing the web service? Their approach actually seems pretty sound. The IP Address acts as a "user name" and the guid represents the "password" in a traditional user name / password model. IP Address at that level of the stack are very hard to spoof, because the IP address is essentially verified by the ISP. Spoofing an IP address on the upstream to cause a DOS might be possible for someone less experienced, but actually spoofing the IP to open between your service and a "rogue" client is extremely hard. The most secure approach would be to combine the two by using IP filtering at the router, and force the use of a user name and password all through SSL.
