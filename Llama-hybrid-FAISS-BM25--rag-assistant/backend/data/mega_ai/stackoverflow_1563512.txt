I don't think creating 500+ tables is a way to go. It looks to me that your structure is "schema-less" rather than purely relational. I'd consider a dedicated document-oriented dbms (Mongodb, Tokyo Cabinet) or roll out your own, using mysql as low level data storage (look here http://bret.appspot.com/entry/how-friendfeed-uses-mysql for an excellent example).
