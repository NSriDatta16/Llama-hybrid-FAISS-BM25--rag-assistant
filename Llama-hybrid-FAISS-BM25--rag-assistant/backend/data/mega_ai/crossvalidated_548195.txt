number and size of eigenvectors in PCA

As I understand, the size of eigenvector produced in PCA should be min{n,N}, where N=number of samples and n=dimension of each sample (Right?). However, I have seen in couple of cases that this size is max{n,N}, not min. Why? And the next relevant question is, Are number of produced eigenvectors equal to their size (I know we pick the first couple of them in PCA, but I am talking about the produced ones)? It should be, as the number of eigenvectors is always equal to size of each eigenvector.
