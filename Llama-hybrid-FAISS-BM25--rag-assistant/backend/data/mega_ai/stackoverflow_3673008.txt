download apk from own Webserver

I am having problem with download my android application from my own web server. First I sent a html content with java script to ask Android phone to open my download link window.onload=function() {{ window.location = "downloadURL"; }} " Android phone revice this java script will open the downloadURL On my server end, I am using .Net ASP I've set up the MIME content Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.ContentType = "application/vnd.android.package-archive"; Response.AppendHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=" + "MyApp.apk"); Response.AppendHeader("Content-Length", "" + response.Application.Bytes.Length); Response.BinaryWrite(response.Application.Bytes); The apk file which is MyApp.apk is about 1.5MB How ever, when I used Android emulator to download the app, the file size is only 4.25 KB, and the name is not MyApp.apk. It contains the name of my download link. When I use Firefox to download my app, Firefox successfully download it with correct name and size. Please help me out!! Thanks When I debug my server, my server did sent out the application bytes with Response.BinaryWrite(response.Application.Bytes); I don't understand why, andorid emulator can not receive, intead it seems create its own apk file from the html content.
