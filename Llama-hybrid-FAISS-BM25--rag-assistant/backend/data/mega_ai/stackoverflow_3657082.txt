Identify the View that triggered a touch-event

I am trying to drag a view over the screen FrameLayout main = (FrameLayout) findViewById(R.id.main_view); final Ball bigball; bigball = new Ball(this,50,50,25, 0xFFFF0000); main.addView(bigball); This draws a red circle on my screen. How and where do I need to implement my touchscreen-handling, if I want it only to trigger if someone touches the red circle rather than the remainder of the screen? Ball.Java is a separate class: public class Ball extends View I know I could check the coordinates where the user touched the screen and then compare that to where the circle is, but there must be a way to simply check the ID or some other reference of the circle, right? Everything I have looked at and tried so far would run my code regardless of where the touch started or stopped on the screen. (So I can move the ball, I can draw lines on the screen with my finger and everything. But I cannot tell if I touched the red circle.) Can anyone expain this to me in simple words, please? (And forgive me for using equally simple words in my question. I no longer feel I have a clue what I'm doing here, and I by now I would just not use big words like "Listener" or "Event" correctly anymore. Thanks.
