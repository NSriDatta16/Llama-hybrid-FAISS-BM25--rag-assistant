The Label can't contain the element it's labeling, it's simply wrong. (Thanks erKURITA :)) Try something like this first and see if it works fine: ">Some description here.. As far as I know Label is an inline element so to have it contain other elements add display: block; CSS to it although it's not very elegant and probably against standards.
