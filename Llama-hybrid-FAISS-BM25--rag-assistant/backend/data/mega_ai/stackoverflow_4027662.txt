Static Binding to Singleton Mysteriously Fails

I have the following singleton class which contains the following property: public class Manager : INotifyPropertyChanged { public bool IsOnline ... public static Manager Instance ... } In the mark-up I am trying to change the color of a button based on this online property: This binding fails with the exception: Cannot convert the value in attribute 'Source' to object of type 'System.Windows.Markup.StaticExtension'. I have quadruple-checked the "storage" namespace; I know it is both referenced and correct. The Instance property is static, so I do not understand why this binding would fail. I have similar bindings to static properties all over that work just fine. Any ideas?
