The distribution usually follows from what you know about your data. If your data is about successes and failures, then it immediately follows that you need Bernoulli distribution for it, if you have data about counts of successes and failures, then you need binomial distribution, etc. Besides knowing your data, you need to be familiar with the distributions. To learn more about them you can check the Statistics 110 (lectures and materials available freely online) course by Joe Blitzstein, from Harvard University, who introduces the "stories" behind probability distributions that give intuitions on what kind of data generating process do they describe. If your data is something strange, then you usually know something about it, e.g. that it is continuous and non-negative (so maybe gamma distribution would work for it?) and this should lead you to appropriate distribution. If you cannot define the likelihood, you can always use Approximate Bayesian Computation , that does not need explicit likelihood function and instead it needs only some kind of summary statistic, plus assumptions about the data generating process.
