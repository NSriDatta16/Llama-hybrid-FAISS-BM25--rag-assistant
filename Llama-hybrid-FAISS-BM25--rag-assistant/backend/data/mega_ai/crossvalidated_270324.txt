What is a hypothesis class in SVM?

This is a followup to the answers here and here . I have not seen this term in any textbooks I have or many online resources. It is not, for example, present on the SVM wikipedia page . What is a hypothesis class in the context of SVM? How do the support vectors relate to the hypothesis class(es)?
