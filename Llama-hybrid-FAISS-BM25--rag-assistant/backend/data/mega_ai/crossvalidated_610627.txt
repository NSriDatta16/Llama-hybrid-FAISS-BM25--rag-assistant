The ratio of interest to you is a ratio of two random variables. That is, a count of survivors divided by a count of original cases. This often occurs in biological measurements. These could be counts made in the field or in a petri dish or other places. Both the components of a ratio appear to be random. (The denominators don't seem to be fixed by the design of the experiment.) Ratios of this sort are often highly variable. Most rates are close to zero, but some can have long tails to the right. Ratios of this sort are often analyzed on a log scale. (Sometimes there is a biological basis for this.) You can do this by computing the log of each ratio to start. Then calculate the average of these logs and finally the antilog of the average. Use this as an estimate of the rate. A standard error and confidence interval can also be calculated on the log scale, eg, a 95% interval. The antilogs of these lower and upper values can be used as a confidence interval for the rate above, that is, the antilog of the average of the logs of the ratios.
