If you have iid random variables $G_1, \dots, G_n \sim F$ then $\sum_j r_j G_j$ is a very different thing from $G \sum_j r_j$ where $G \sim F$ too, and $G_j \sum_j r_j$ is not meaningful notation since $j$ is not defined outside of the summation. You can only factor out $G$ if $G_1 = \dots = G_n = G$, i.e. they're all actually the same RV. But that is very different from being iid. As an example, suppose that the $G_i$ are iid $\mathcal N(0,1)$ and let $r_i = \frac 1n$ for all $i$. Then $\sum G_i r_i = \bar G \sim \mathcal N(0, \frac 1n)$ while $G \sum r_i \sim \mathcal N(0, 1)$. There's a reduction in variance from averaging $n$ iid RVs, but not from averaging the exact same RV $n$ times.
