DrawString to Rectangle, how to manually jump to new line?

When you DrawString to a Rectangle it wraps the text nicely within those bounds. What I want however is to be able to jump to the next line within those bounds at will. So I could write: This is the content of a larger rectangle. An alternative would be to just use multiple DrawStrings (representing one line each, from a split string or similar) but I'm looking for a simpler more elegant way if possible.
