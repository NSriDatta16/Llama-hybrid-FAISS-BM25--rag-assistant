From perldoc chomp : chomp remove the newline from the end of an input record when you're worried that the final record may be missing its newline. When in paragraph mode ($/ = "" ) , it removes all trailing newlines from the string. When in slurp mode ( $/ = undef ) or fixed-length record mode ( $/ is a reference to an integer or the like, see perlvar) chomp() won't remove anything. you can remove leading and trailing whitespace from strings like, $string =~ s{^\s+|\s+$}{}g
