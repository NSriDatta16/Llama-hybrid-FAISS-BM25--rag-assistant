The main reason to unit test code in the first place is to validate the design of your code. It's possible to gain 100% code coverage, but not without using mock objects or some form of isolation or dependency injection. Remember, unit tests aren't for users, they are for developers and build systems to use to validate a system prior to release. To that end, the unit tests should run very fast and have as little configuration and dependency friction as possible. Try to do as much as you can in memory, and avoid using network connections from the tests.
