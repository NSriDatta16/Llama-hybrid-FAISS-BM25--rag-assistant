Machine Learning to flag records that are high-risk of failure?

Let me preface the following by saying I have very little knowledge of the ins and outs of machine learning but I am familiar with statistics and programming. I am working on a project that considers multiple variables to help predict whether an ID is "high-risk", that is, a high chance they will terminate their contract with us. Is this something machine learning could solve? I have read and watched a few videos on Support Vector Machines and they seem to be a possible solution, but again I don't know if I'm just force-fitting SVMs into my project or if there is a more elegant solution to my problem. Assuming ML is the correct approach, how do I go about the system recognizing a high-risk, not yet terminated ID? Do I load the data of IDs that have already terminated and once it understands the variables that contribute it can then predict for the ones that aren't yet terminated? In my head I have this idea of the model being able to take all variables, spit out a single value indicating the likelihood of termination so that we can then target those to retain. Examples/key words to search for/YouTube links are all appreciated. My main problem at this point is I don't know what to even search for to start gaining traction.
