How to learn a neural network based on a cost function in an unsupervised way?

I need to learn a neural network that predicts L (see equation below). So based on three points from a discrete trajectory I want to learn L by minimizing the equation below, which is a physical equation that has some properties I want to ensure they are conserved. $$D_1L(q(k-1), q(k)) + D_2L(q(k),q(k+1)) = 0$$ Here $D$ is the derivative with respect to ith argument of L. This can be obtained via automatic differentiation and it is fully compatible with backpropagation. Here is the concrete problem I am trying to solve: 1 - q(k-1) , q(k) and q(k+1) are the inputs of the neural net L. 2 - Note that the cost function we are trying to minimize is not a direct consequence of the target value. Is this solvable using neural networks? Can I learn L by minimizing the cost function above?
