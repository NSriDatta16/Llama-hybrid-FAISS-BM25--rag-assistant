Just a comment: CVS is a centralized VCS, meaning all your projects can fit within one CVS repository: you can checkout any sub-part. Git is a DVCS, and in the Distributed world, one repository = one "component" (or "module" or "project", ...). You can use submodules to aggregate several Git repository under one "umbrella" one. If you clone a Git repository, you will get all the history (unless you limit the depth of the cloning). So the organization of your projects will be different with Git, and I am not sure if the vision of one "CVS-like" Git server will still apply.
