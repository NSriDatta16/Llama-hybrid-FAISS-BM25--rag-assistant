I am no expert on time series, but I am pretty sure what you are missing is not about time series, but about null hypothesis testing. You wrote A random walk with trend doesn't have unit root. So, null hypothesis will be rejected. This is not necessarily so. It depend on how big the trend is and how big the sample is. And also what level of significance you select.
