Adding these templates to your stylesheet: Produces this output: Mr. Title This is one paragraph. Another paragraph. An item paragraph. Another item paragraph The template with match="*/text()[normalize-space()]" will match text() nodes if the string returned from normalize-space() has some value. An empty string from an all whites-space text() would evaluate to false() and not be matched. The other template matches the opposite condition, and since it is an empty template, will eliminate the white-space only text() from the output.
