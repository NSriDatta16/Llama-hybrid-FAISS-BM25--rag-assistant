There are a number of potential approaches to your question, all of which I've seen done in practice: Often, as @mdewey mentions, there is a tendency not to do variable selection at all. I'm actually slightly opposed to this, as if you're not paying attention it's easy to induce collider stratification bias. Many people use a "10% change in estimate" approach, where any variable that causes, as the name suggests, a 10% change in the effect estimate of interest is included in the multivariate model. There's also the use of causal models, such as DAGs, to provide a theoretical underpinning for what models you choose - these should identify the variables that you can control for to yield a theoretically unbiased estimate (with the usual caveats about unmeasured confounding). In practice, I tend to use #3, and then to use #2 to narrow that set if there's too many variables for the size of the data set.
