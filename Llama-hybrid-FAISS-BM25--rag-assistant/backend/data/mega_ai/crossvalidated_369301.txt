There are two extra points: Because youâ€™re using a mixed effects Poisson regression with a log ( nonlinear ) link function, the coefficients you obtain have an intepretation conditional on the random effect. I.e., an interpretation conditional on site. This seems to be different than the plot you produce where you average over sites. Hence, it is a bit as comparing apples with oranges. Another potential reason for the differences is missing data. Namely, the mixed model will provide you correct inferences when the missing data mechanism is missing at random. Whereas, typically, plots on the observed data are only valid under missing completely at random.
