Different randomForest results via caret and randomForest package using seeds on train control

After following the questions Different results from randomForest via caret and the basic randomForest package Fully reproducible parallel models using caret Below there is a reproducible example using IRIS dataset where I can't reproduce the random forest model when not using caret's train function. library(doParallel); library(caret) #create a list of seed, here change the seed for each resampling set.seed(123) seeds ... >[1] TRUE ... # using the same seed as for model 2 set.seed(seeds[[11]]) model3 ... >[1] "Component “versicolor”: Mean relative difference: 0.3006435" >[2] "Component “virginica”: Mean relative difference: 0.2400822" What am I missing ? Is it possible to reproduce the random forest model returned by caret's train function? If not, can we train the final model in caret with different parameters ? such as importance and proximities flags to true ?
