Forecasting formula in mathematical notation help please:

Question: is what I have correct? If not what is correct? I am not sure how to correctly write this forecasting model in proper mathematical notation. My attempt is at the bottom, please help fix or change my mistakes. Model Information: This is a forecasting model that is being used to predict the open value of stocks and crypto currencies. This model is loosely based on the X-11 model (this is a simpler version due to time constraints to create): https://www.census.gov/ts/papers/Conference1983/Wallis1983.pdf This model was chosen because it takes into account seasonality for the prediction and then I added an additional smoothing ratio based on testing observations. If there was a high error, it was reduced by adding in the smoothing ratio. Reason for question/request of help: I'm working on a masters thesis and would like to provide an accurate mathematical representation of the model that i built. My attempt is below but i am not sure if it is correct and would like assistance regarding the mathematical notation structure. (ex: am i using the correct sub/hyper scripts?) Background and Formula: To create the forecasting model, an average of the previous 7 days exchange rates are taken from the current year and again from the previous year. The previous year is to create a basis of what is to be expected in the future and the current year average is used to capture the increase or decrease over time. Current = average of previous seven days in current year Previous = average of previous seven days in previous year The ratio of the current average over the previous average is used to create a prediction ratio. For the prediction, based on the forecasting date, the exchange rate of the previous year is multiplied by the the ratio to create an initial prediction. There was also a smoothing event added that takes a ratio of the current prediction ratio over the previous ratio and multiplies the prediction to reduce error. Some variables: n: number of days in prediction range d: date My Formula: $$ {P\left(d\right)}_i\ \ =open\ price\ of\ date\\ \mu_c=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=d-n-1}^{d-1}{{P\left(d\right)}_i\ \ \ current\ year\ average} \\ \mu_p=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=d-n-366}^{d-366}{P\left(d\right)}_i\ \ previous\ year\ average\\ R\ =\mu_c/\mu_p\ \ \ seasonality\ ratio\\ {I(d)}_0\ \ =R(d)/P(d-365)\ initial\ prediction\\ {S\ =\ I(d)}_0/{I(d-1)}_0\ \ \ smoothing\ ratio\\ {I\left(d\right)}_1=S\ast I\left(d\right)_0 \ \ \ Smoothed\ prediction $$
