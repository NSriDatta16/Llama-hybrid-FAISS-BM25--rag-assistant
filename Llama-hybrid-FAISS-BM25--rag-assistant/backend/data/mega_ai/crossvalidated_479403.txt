You are trying to classify images and using a linear classifier without using any sort of image descriptor or feature extractor. Do not use this approach for any image classification problem. You can try following approaches: With images, your first choice of model should be convolutional neural networks since they can extract abstract features from the images and then you can use a fully connected layer as a classifier. If you do not want to use CNN, then you can either use a descriptor like Histogram of gradients to encode the features of images and then use a linear/non-linear classifier like SVM to classify the images to improve your accuracy.
