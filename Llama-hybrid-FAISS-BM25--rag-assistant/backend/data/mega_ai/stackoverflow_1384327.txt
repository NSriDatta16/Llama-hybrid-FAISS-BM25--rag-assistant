Jquery UI sortable, store location and size?

I am new to Jquery and am trying to store the location and size of the elements on a page which are being sorted using the Jquery UI plugin. I want the user to "save" the current layout, and the data to be stored in a database using php/mysql so when they re-visit the elements will be the same size and location? $(function() { $("#sortable").sortable({ revert: true, axis: 'y', opacity: 0.9, tolerance: 'pointer', }); $("#draggable").draggable({ connectToSortable: '#sortable', helper: 'clone', revert: 'invalid' }) $("#sortable").resizable({}) }); Above is part of my script which basically allows boxes to be sorted and dragged using a list. Many Thanks. EDIT: Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 I am trying to use div tags alone without having to get them in a list also? Without having to include the divs inside a list. Thanks again.
