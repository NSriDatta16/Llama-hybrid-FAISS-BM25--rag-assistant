Kernel PCA is a dimensionality reduction/visualisation algorithm, it isn't really suitable for vector-quantization. For a kernel approach to vector quantisation, see the paper by Tipping and Scholkopf. . The example where you can still read the registration number of the car for the kernel algorithm, but not with the LBG algorithm (similar to k-means), is really neat (figure 2).
