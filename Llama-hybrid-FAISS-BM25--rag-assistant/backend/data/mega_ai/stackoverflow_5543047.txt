Note: This is an alternative to the current class hierarchy you have. Define a intermdeiate class called UnitTypeBase which extends from XmlObject . Something like public class UnitTypeBase extends XmlObject{ public String getName(){ //Some implementaition or you can mark it as abstract } } then derive * DepartmentType and OrganizationType * from UnitTypeBase //class XmlObject is part of org.apache.xmlbeans public class DepartmentType extends UnitTypeBase; // getName method is defined in this class public class OrganizatiopnType extends UnitTypeBase; // getName method is defined in this class UnitTypeBase department = null; if (a == 1) department = (DepartmentType) order.getDepartment(); // returns DepartmentType else department = (OrganizationType) order.getOrganization(); // returns OrganizationType department.getName(); // ... and do some other complex stuff using methods which are defined in both classes ...
