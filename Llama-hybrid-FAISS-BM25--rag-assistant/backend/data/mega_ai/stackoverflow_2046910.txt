It is impossible using JavaScript (nor Flash). It depends on your constraints, and there are some workarounds. You can take advantage of browser extensions (such as a Firefox add-on), but I guess it does not fit your requierments. The best option I can think of is to construct the DOM tree on the client side, and then post it to remote server. On the server side nothing really holds you from doing generally anything. Using WebKit or even launching Internet Explorer or Firefox, you can create the snapshot server-side. It's far from elegant, but possible.
