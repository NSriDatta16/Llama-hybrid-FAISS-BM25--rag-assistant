Using Cython to expose functionality to another application

I have this C++ code that shows how to extend a software by compiling it to a DLL and putting it in the application folder: #include #include /** A helper function to convert a char array into a LPBYTE array. */ LPBYTE message(const char* message, long* pLen) { size_t length = strlen(message); LPBYTE mem = (LPBYTE) GlobalAlloc(GPTR, length + 1); for (unsigned int i = 0; i Is is possible to make a plugin this way using Cython? Or even py2exe? The DLL just has to have an entry point, right? Or should I just compile it natively and embed Python using elmer ?
