what machine learning isn't statistical?

If I understand correctly, statistical learning theory is just one approach to machine learning, What machine learning isn't statistical? Based on my very limited understanding, I thought that things like PAC-learning or Empirical Risk minimization pretty much cover everything. Isn't statistics involved in all of this? Is there any good source that clearly explains this? EDIT my comment below shows the answers I was looking for.
