See my answer to this question This wouldn't be easy; it may be impossible. There are issues with timers and running AIR/Flash Player minimized. Things slow down so it is less of a drag on computer performance. AIR in the background may not respond the same way as an Active AIR application would. In theory, you can write a Proxy in AIR using sockets and set the local browser to route all requests through the proxy. That probably isn't practical for wide use. If you have control over the web page that you want to use to trigger your AIR app, you might be able to put a SWF on your web page and then use a LocalConnection to communicate between the browser SWF and the AIR app, forcing the AIR app to pop up.
