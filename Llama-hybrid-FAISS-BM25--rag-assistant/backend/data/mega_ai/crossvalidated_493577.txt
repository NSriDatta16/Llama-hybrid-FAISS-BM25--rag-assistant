Your model includes too many predictors for the number of observations. A rule of thumb for logistic regression is to have no more than 1 predictor for each 15 or so members of the minority class . With about 60 total cases (based on the null degrees of freedom), you have no more than 30 members of the minority class. So anything over about 2 or 3 predictors is likely to lead to an overfit model. So you can seem to fit your data with a large number of predictors and get a "significant" p-value overall while no single predictor shows a significant association with outcome. You've basically just contorted your set of predictor values to fit this particular data set. Your model would probably not work well on another sample from the population. You should use your knowledge of the subject matter to select (without looking at outcomes) a subset of predictors or to combine multiple related predictors into single combined predictors. Alternatively, look into penalized regression methods like ridge regression or LASSO, which can help with this type of situation with too many predictors for too few data points.
