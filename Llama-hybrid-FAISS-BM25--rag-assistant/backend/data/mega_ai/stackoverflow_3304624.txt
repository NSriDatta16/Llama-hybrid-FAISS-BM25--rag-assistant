Cancel an MSI without showing the "installation interrupted" dialog

I am wondering if it is possible to have the "Cancel" button on my welcome screen completely quit the installer without showing the final "Installation interrupted" dialog. I consider this redundant when the user hasn't even begun the installation yet. I still want the dialog to be shown if the user cancels an installation that has already been started , but not if the installation hasn't been started (which is the case if the Cancel button is hit on the welcome screen). I have tried various things but I lack a proper understanding of how Windows Installer works to fathom a solution. Update: Got it to work! I ended up using a combination of the two suggestions--I wish I could give you both the answer, but I'll give it to ray as he has the lowest rep. But I'll upvote them both. Here's how I did it (I'm still surprised it works): I used the Publish element as ray suggested, but instead of invoking an event (there's no event called "Finish"), I set a property, "AbortInstall" to 1 : 1 I did this in my custom set file WixUI_Simple.wxs under Wix/Fragment/UI Then, inside UserExit.wxs I modified the InstallUISequence as follows: NOT AbortInstall = 1 ...which is the idea suggested by Christopher. Thanks to you both!
