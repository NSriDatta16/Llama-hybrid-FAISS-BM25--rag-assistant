Examples of intractable prior distribution

I am curious if there are some known examples of Bayesian models where the prior distribution chosen is itself intractable. That is, suppose we have the data distribution $Y | \theta \sim F(\theta)$ and $\theta \sim \pi(\theta)$ with $$ \pi(\theta) = c \tilde{\pi}(\theta)\, $$ where $\tilde{\pi}(\theta)$ is known, but $c$ is unknown. This will obviously result in the posterior distribution being doubly intractable. But doubly intractable posterior distributions are often so due to the intractability of the likelihood. This makes me curious if there is known work for when we must assume a prior distribution that is intractable.
