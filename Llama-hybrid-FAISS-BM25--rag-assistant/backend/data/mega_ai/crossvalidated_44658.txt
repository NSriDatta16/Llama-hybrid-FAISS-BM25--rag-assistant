Logistic regression discrimination threshold with cross validation

I'm using logistic regression to perform binary classification with training, CV, and test sets. When is the most appropriate time to pick a discrimination threshold to balance positive and negative error rates? Should I use the CV set to determine a desired threshold, and then apply the fixed threshold to the test set to assess classification performance? Or should I determine the threshold using only the test set?
