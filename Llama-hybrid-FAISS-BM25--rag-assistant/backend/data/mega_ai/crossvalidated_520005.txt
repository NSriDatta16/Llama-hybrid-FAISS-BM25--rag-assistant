Variable Importance Plot & Hypothesis Testing

I am trying to predict whether client would take up a promotion or not using the random forest model. From the variable importance plot output, it is shown that the number of days pass the day of contact(which I bin in days of 5) is the most important variable in the predictive modelling. However, when I put this into a hypothesis testing, chi square test, the p-value is greater than 0.05. How do I reconcile these two facts or if there is a better way of testing that the number of days in relation to whether client would take up a promotion?
