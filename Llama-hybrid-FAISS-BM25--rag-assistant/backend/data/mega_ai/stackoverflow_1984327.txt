Django: Running site on many languages

I want to run an article site on several languages, I already translated translation strings, so my templates are ready. I only have a questions how to store articles in many languages? Should I create a database for each translation or it works in different way? If I have for example this basic model: class Article(models.Model): models.TextField() And want to store data in many languages, how do I do it? How to organize redirects between one article on different languages
