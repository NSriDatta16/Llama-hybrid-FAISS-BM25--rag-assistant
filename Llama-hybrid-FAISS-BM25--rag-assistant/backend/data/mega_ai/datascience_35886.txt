Using neural networks to solve polynomials

Is it possible to train a neural network to solve a polynomial equation? What about any non-linear single variable equation? Here are possible methods that I am thinking of trying: Training a neural network to model some polynomial $P(x)$ and setting the output to $0$ then maybe devising some sort of algorithm with produces an approximation of the corresponding input. Doing (1) but make a new NN which is the inverse function of the first NN. Then finding the root from inputting $0$ into the second NN. I thought this might be an interesting science fair topic with many applications and possibilities for future study but I would like to know if it is doable. I will first attempt cubics, then successively higher degree polynomials.
