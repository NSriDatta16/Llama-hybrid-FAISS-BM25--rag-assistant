Let $X$ be the number of boys in a family. As soon as they have a girl, they stop, so \begin{array}{| l |l | } \hline X=0 & \text{if the first child was a girl}\\ X=1 & \text{if the first child was a boy and the second was a girl}\\ X=2 & \text{if the first two children were boys and the third was a girl}\\ \text{and so on}\ldots &\\ \hline \end{array} If $p$ is the probability that a child is a boy and if genders are independent between children, the probability that a family ends up having $k$ boys is $$\mbox{P}(X=k)=p^{k}\cdot (1-p),$$ i.e. the probability of having $k$ boys and then having a girl. The expected number of boys is $$ \operatorname{E}X=\sum_{k=0}^\infty kp^k \cdot (1-p)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty kp^k-\sum_{k=0}^\infty kp^{k+1}.$$ Noting that $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty kp^k=\sum_{k=0}^\infty (k+1)p^{k+1}$$ we get $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty kp^k-\sum_{k=0}^\infty kp^{k+1}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty (k+1)p^{k+1}-\sum_{k=0}^\infty kp^{k+1}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty p^{k+1}=p\sum_{k=0}^\infty p^{k}=\frac{p}{1-p}$$ where we used that $\sum_{k=0}^\infty p^k=1/(1-p)$ when $0 geometric series ). If $p=1/2$, we have that $\operatorname{E}X=0.5/0.5$. That is, the average family has 1 boy. We already know that all families have 1 girl, so the ratio will over time even out to be $1/1=1$. The random variable $X$ is known as a geometric random variable .
