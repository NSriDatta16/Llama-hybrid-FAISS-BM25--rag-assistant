Python and R good tutorials?

I would like to learn both Python and R for usage in data science projects. I am currently unemployed, fresh out of university, scouting around for jobs and thought it would be good if I get some Kaggle projects under my profile. However, I have very little knowledge in either language. Have used Matlab and C/C++ in the past. But I haven't produced production quality code or developed an application or software in either language. It has been dirty coding for academic usage all along. I have used a little bit of Python, in a university project, but I dont know the fundamentals like what is a package , etc etc. ie havent read the intricacies of the language using a standard Python Textbook etc.. Have done some amount of coding in C/C++ way back (3-4 years back then switched over to Matlab/Octave). I would like to get started in Python Numpy Scipy scikit-learn and pandas etc. but just reading up Wikipedia articles or Python textbooks is going to be infeasible for me. And same goes with R, except that I have zero knowledge of R. Does anyone have any suggestions?
