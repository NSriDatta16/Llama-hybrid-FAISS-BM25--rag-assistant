You should mostly always use an asynchronous Ajax Request, in fact I know only about one place where a synchronous Ajax Request should be used which is if you're in an Ajax Request embedding a new JavaScript file on the client and then referencing types and/or objects from that JavaScript file in the return from the original Ajax Request. Then the fetching of this new JS file should (or can sanely) be included through using a synchronous Ajax Request... Other then that you should always use asynchronous Ajax Requests. The most important reason is that a synchronous Ajax Request makes the UI (browser) unresponsive...
