Getting disabled checkboxes in Grid for a custom admin module in Magento

I am working on a custom module in magento admin that uses the ‘sales/order_grid_collection’ class to show the grid of all orders. The grid appears fine. However, the first column of the grid is of ‘increment_id’, unlike the actual orders grid where the first column has checkboxes for mass action. I am getting this in spite having copy-pasted almost all the code for the _prepareColumns method from the original order module. So I tried adding a first column of checkboxes manually inside the _prepareColumns method as follows $this->addColumn('order_id', array( 'header_css_class' => 'a-center', 'header' => Mage::helper('sales')->__('Assigned'), 'type' => 'checkbox', 'width' => '20px', 'field_name' => 'orders[]', 'align' => 'center', 'renderer' => new Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Grid_Column_Renderer_Checkbox(), 'index' => 'order_id' )); Upon doing this, the chekboxes do appear but they are disabled. What am I missing here ? Thanks
