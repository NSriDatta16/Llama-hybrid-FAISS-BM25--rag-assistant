Model averaging is one way to go (an information-theoretic approach). The R package glmulti can perform linear models for every combination of predictor variables, and perform model averaging for these results. See http://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops/glmulti Don't forget to investigate collinearity between predictor variables first though. Variance Inflation Factors (available in R package "car") are useful here.
