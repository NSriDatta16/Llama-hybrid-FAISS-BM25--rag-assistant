Descriptor data for Neural Network Classifier: how to handle site effects?

I have input data which I want to feed into a neural network for classification. The data contains observations which were measured at 5 different sites (on 5 different scanners), and I know that the scanner has an influence on the data (there are random site effects). How should I handle this? My ideas so far would be to add the site ID as a categorial (1-hot encoded, so then numerical) variable to the descriptors. Is there anything else I can do?
