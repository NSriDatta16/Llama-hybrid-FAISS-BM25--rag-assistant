Is it possible to see the source code of the violating files in Hudson with Violations and Pylint?

I'm using Hudson CI with a Python project. I've installed the Violations plugin and configured it to run the code against pylint. This works, but I only see a list of violations without linking to the source code. Is it possible to setup Violations and pylint to load and highlight the violating source files (something similar to the Cobertura Coverage Reports)? Better yet, can Violations integrate with pep8.py?
