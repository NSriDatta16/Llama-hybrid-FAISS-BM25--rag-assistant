Correlation of categorical data to binomial response in R

I'm looking to analyze the correlation between a categorical input variable and a binomial response variable, but I'm not sure how to organize my data or if I'm planning the right analysis. Here's my data table (variables explained below): species data table explanation I have individual species listed, and the next columns are their annotated feeding types. A 1 in a given column means yes, and a 0 means no. Some species have multiple feeding types, while some have only one feeding type. The response variable I am interested in is "loss," indicating loss of a trait. I'm curious to know if any of the feeding types predict or are correlated with the status of "loss." thoughts I wasn't sure if there was a good way to include feeding types as one categorical variable with multiple categories. I don't think I can organize it as a single variable with the types c("scavenge","dung","pred", etc...) since some species have multiple feeding types, so I split them up into separate columns and indicated their status as 1 (yes) or 0 (no). Examples I find don't quite have comparable data... and I'm happy for suggestions. Any help or pointing in the right direction is much appreciated! edit: I was recommended to re-post this question here from the original StackOverflow post ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58903067/correlation-of-categorical-data-to-binomial-response-in-r )
