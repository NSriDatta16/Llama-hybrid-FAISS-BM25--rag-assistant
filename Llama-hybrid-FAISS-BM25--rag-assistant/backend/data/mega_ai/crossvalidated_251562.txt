Both OLS and quantile regression (QR) are estimation techniques for estimating the coefficient vector $\beta$ in a linear regression model $$ y = X\beta + \varepsilon $$ (for the case of QR see Koenker (1978), p. 33, second paragraph). For certain error distributions (e.g. those with heavy tails), the QR estimator $\hat\beta_{QR}$ is more efficient than the OLS estimator $\hat\beta_{OLS}$; recall that $\hat\beta_{OLS}$ is efficient only in the class of linear unbiased estimators. This is the main motivation for Koenker (1978) that suggests using the QR in place of OLS under a variety of settings. I think that for any moment of the conditional distribution $P_Y(y|X)$ we should use the one of $\hat\beta_{OLS}$ and $\hat\beta_{QR}$ that is more efficient (please correct me if I am wrong). Now to answer your question directly, QR is "worse" than OLS (and thus $\hat\beta_{OLS}$ should be preferred over $\hat\beta_{QR}$) when $\hat\beta_{OLS}$ is more efficient than $\hat\beta_{QR}$. One such example is when the error distribution is Normal. References: Koenker, Roger, and Gilbert Bassett Jr. "Regression quantiles." Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society (1978): 33-50.
