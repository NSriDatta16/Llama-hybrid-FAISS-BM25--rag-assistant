By your definition, you have $16$ cards ($10$, $\text{J}$, $\text{K}$, $\text{Q}$) that are worth $10$ points, so with probability $16/52$ you get $10$ points in a single draw. Since $9+\text{anything}=10$, then if we take into consideration that there is $4$ nines, than we instantly know that with probability greater than $20/52$ you finish in two draws. However, return of two draws is simple to obtain by enumerating all $52 \choose 2$ combinations of card pairs and summing their scores. unique_cards what gives $79\%$ probability of obtaining score of at least $10$ in two draws > sum(colSums(comb) >= 10)/choose(52, 2) # accepted / all combinations [1] 0.7888386 Lazy solution for more than two draws can be obtained by a simple simulation, where whole deck is shuffled and then cards are drawn until their total score is at least $10$. set.seed(123) sim = target) # take first score >= 10 c(sum = res[n], n = n) } R and the result is that on average you have to draw two cards and the average total score is $12.77$ > apply(res, 1, summary) sum n Min. 10.00 1.000 1st Qu. 10.00 1.000 Median 12.00 2.000 Mean 12.77 1.946 3rd Qu. 15.00 2.000 Max. 19.00 6.000 Moreover, as expected, with approximately $30\%$ probability you finish with one draw, but with $79\%$ probability you finish with two draws and you rarely get over three draws: > cumsum(table(res[2,])/R) 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.3006 0.7910 0.9653 0.9968 0.9999 1.0000
