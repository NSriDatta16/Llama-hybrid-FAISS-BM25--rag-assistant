How to know whether a file was processed before

How can I be sure if a file was processed before? There is a remote storage location which is a file source for my application. My program gets files from this location and processes them in a scheduled way. How can I be sure that the next time I fetch only non-processed files? I'm thinking about using file attributes. The archive and modified date can be a solution. But I learned that two bits of file attributes are not used. How can I use these fields in Java? By the way I don't want to use a database.
