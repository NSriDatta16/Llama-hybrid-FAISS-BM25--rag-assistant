Hearing an echo while playing mp3

I'm currently having problems while playing mp3 files on a website. I'm using the following code to play an mp3 sound: function playSound(url){ var userAgent = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); var appVersion = navigator.appVersion.toLowerCase(); var appName = navigator.appName.toLowerCase(); var isOpera = (userAgent.indexOf('opera') != -1); var isIE = (appName.indexOf('internet explorer') != -1) && !isOpera; switch(true) { case isIE : $("#soundSpan").html(" "); break; default : $("#soundSpan").html(" "); } } This works fine for me and most of the users, but some users are complaining about hearing an echo. Meaning they are hearing the same sound multiple times(more than twice). The sounds are very short varying from 1 to 6 seconds. According to some users the echo is sometimes so bad they can't understand what is being said (the mp3 files are spoken sentences). The echo usually stops after 2-3 seconds. I'm sure I'm playing the sound only once and the echo has appeared in different browsers. Does anyone have an idea how this can happen?
