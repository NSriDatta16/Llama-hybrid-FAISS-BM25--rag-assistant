In the context of VAE, you have two moving parts - $q_\phi(z|x)$ and $p_\theta(x|z)$ . You only increase the evidence by optimizing the $\theta$ 's (the weights of the decoder) - basically doing maximum likelihood. You do this without any regard to VI, or to $\phi$ . You then find the encoder by doing VI, and optimizing the encoder weights. So, does evidence change or not during the training process ? It does, but it's done regardless of VI. So, the above video explanation does not relate to it at all. The evidence is a function that depends on the data. For a given dataset it will be a normalizing constant / number.
