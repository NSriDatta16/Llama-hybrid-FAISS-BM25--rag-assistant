It doesn't seem very useful to try and debate which of these two approaches is "right" in the abstract. Rather, different ways of analyzing race help answer different questions, and you should use whatever approach is answering the question you are trying to answer. The standard approach you lay out - leaving "white" as the reference category and including dummies for each non-white racial category, is useful if you want to answer the following types of questions "Are Black respondents significantly different from white respondents?" "Are Hispanic respondents significantly different from white respondents?" etc. These are often really important questions. For example, if you wanted to study whether "white supremacy" is causing Black, and Hispanic drivers to get pulled over more than white ones, then THIS is probably the approach you want - not because you are treating white as "normal" in some sort of moral sense, but because the theory of "white supremacy" argues that America treats "white" as normative in American society, and thus non-white Americans are oppressed/discriminated against relative to white Americans. Note however, that this approach will not help you answer the question of whether (due to the particulars of anti- black racism) Black drivers are pulled over more than Hispanic drivers. If that was your research question (and it's a potentially interesting one!) then you would need to change the reference category to either Black or Hispanic so you can test if those two groups are different from each other. Thus, you shouldn't just treat the biggest group as the reference by default, but you should choose the reference category that allows you to answer the question you are trying to answer. If that happens to be the biggest category, then so be it. It doesn't reflect your views on the normativity of whiteness or anything like that. You are just trying to answer a particular question. The alternative approach - comparing each group to "the mean" - might be better if the question you were investigating involved looking at how each racial group differed from "the average across all racial groups." This is a trickery question (partly because the overall average depends on the relative prevalence of each group), and I'm having trouble coming up with a situation in which it's actually the thing we would care about (which is why I tend not to use that approach when analyzing race). But if someone can articulate a research question that does ask how different racial groups compare to the overall average, then this is the method you should use to try and answer it. In short - when deciding how to treat "race" in a regression model, the key question is not which approach reflects our moral view about the nature of race and racism, but which approach allows us to actually answer the question we're trying to answer. That all being said, none of this really matters very much if you are just treating race as a control variable. If you are interested in some other variable, then doing any of these different approaches will prevent race from confounding your results in the same way, so you are free to use whatever approach you find the most aesthetically or morally pleasing.
