Every time I run a statistical test, my n-value is doubled

I just finished collecting data for a small study with a within-subject design looking at caching behaviour and how it can be affected by a bird's surroundings. My study had three experimental conditions and each bird (n = 5) participated in each condition twice. I was planning on running a Friedman ANOVA because my data is non-parametric and doesn't meet the assumptions for a repeated measures ANOVA. The first image is a screenshot of my SPSS data. It's extremely simplified because I took out any extraneous data. The values shown are the number of caches made by each bird (listed on the rows) in each condition (listed on the columns). Here is where I run into an issue: whenever I try to run a Friedman ANOVA, the output keeps showing a doubled n-value (for example: n=10 instead of n=5). I think I understand why it is doing this, it's just that I don't know what to do about it. I done some research online and the main two answers I've been able to find (at least without going into a bunch of detail about my study like I am now) are either: a) take the average of any individuals that were tested more than once or b) run the test as usual and substitute out the incorrect n-value for your correct sample size. I really have no idea if either of those are right. The other possibility I have been thinking is that I might have my data set up incorrectly or that there could be a setting or function on SPSS that might help me. I'm open to any help or suggestions and I hope that I helped explain my question/dilemma a little more this time around. Please let me know if anything else isn't clear and I will gladly add more explanation.
