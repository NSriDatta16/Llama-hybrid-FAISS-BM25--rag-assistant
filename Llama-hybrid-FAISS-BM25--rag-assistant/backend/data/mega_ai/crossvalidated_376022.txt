How to compute the probability a non-deterministic crash being fixed

A problem I encountered a few times and I always had problem answering my boss's question:"Are you sure it is fixed?" I would really like to be able to give an answer along the lines : "Before the fix, the app would crash after an average time of 5 minutes over 10 run. I ran 5 tests of 10 minutes without crash, so I am 99.99% confident that I fixed it" I would prefer to have hard data than gut feeling... How can I compute such a statement? Context I had an app crash after 1-5 minutes sitting idle. I found and fixed a race condition causing a pointer to be freed twice. How long and how many times should I run my app to be pretty sure that I fixed the problem and not that I'm just being lucky.
