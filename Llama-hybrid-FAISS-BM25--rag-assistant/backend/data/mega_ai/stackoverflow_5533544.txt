Implementing Double Exponential Smoothing, aka Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA)

If I have time series data -- a list of {x,y} pairs -- and want to smooth it, I can use an Exponential Moving Average like so: EMA[data_, alpha_:.1] := Transpose @ {#1, ExponentialMovingAverage[#2, alpha]}& @@ Transpose@data How would you implement double exponential smoothing ? DEMA[data_, alpha_, gamma_] := (* unstub me! *) If it figured out good values for alpha and gamma by itself, that would be extra nice. Related question about how to handle the case that there are gaps in the time-series, ie, the samples are not uniformly spread out over time: Exponential Moving Average Sampled at Varying Times
