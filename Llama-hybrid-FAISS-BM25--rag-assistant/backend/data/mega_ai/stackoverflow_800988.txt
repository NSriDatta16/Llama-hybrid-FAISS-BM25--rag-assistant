A continuous integration server might help encourage people to check in their code. If everyone gets on board with checking in code for nightly builds/unit test runs, I think everyone will start to see the benefits. I agree with previous answers that forcing people to check in might not be the best approach - it's probably better to encourage that behavior using something that will benefit the group.
