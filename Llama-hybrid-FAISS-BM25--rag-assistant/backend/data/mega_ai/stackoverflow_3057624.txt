After somethings retain count is decreased to 0, the object gets deallocated. This is not the same as setting it to nil. It will not be nil. Whilst you can send messages to nil, sending a message to a released object will result in an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error. If you post some of the code where it is created and used, maybe we can help you debug it. Try retaining it twice at the beginning. it's nit an elegant solution, but it might work as a quick fix.
