To quote John Tukey: The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data. That is, there does not exist a statistical method that is a simple as causal_effect y x, int_validity="high" ext_validity="high" If any one claims to have something like this, it's most likely snake oil. In some special settings, you can occasionally learn something about some types of causal effects from a cross-section, but your description is much too vague to recommend a particular course of action. To start down this road, I would take a gander at: Lance, P., D. Guilkey, A. Hattori and G. Angeles. (2014). How do we know if a program made a difference? A guide to statistical methods for program impact evaluation . Chapel Hill, North Carolina: MEASURE Evaluation. Morgan, Stephen L. and Christopher Winship. 2015. Counterfactuals and Causal Inference: Methods and Principles for Social Research (Second Edition, Revised and Enlarged). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The first is an accessible free pdf, the second is a more challenging book.
