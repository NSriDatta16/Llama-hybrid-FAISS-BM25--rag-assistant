What is the "horseshoe effect" and/or the "arch effect" in PCA / correspondence analysis?

There are many techniques in ecological statistics for exploratory data analysis of multidimensional data. These are called 'ordination' techniques. Many are the same or closely related to common techniques elsewhere in statistics. Perhaps the prototypical example would be principal components analysis (PCA). Ecologists might use PCA, and related techniques, to explore 'gradients' (I am not entirely clear what a gradient is, but I've been reading a little bit about it.) On this page , the last item under Principal Components Analysis (PCA) reads: PCA has a serious problem for vegetation data: the horseshoe effect. This is caused by the curvilinearity of species distributions along gradients. Since species response curves are typically unimodal (i.e. very strongly curvilinear), horseshoe effects are common. Further down the page, under Correspondence Analysis or Reciprocal Averaging (RA) , it refers to "the arch effect": RA has a problem: the arch effect. It is also caused by nonlinearity of distributions along gradients. The arch is not as serious as the horseshoe effect of PCA, because the ends of the gradient are not convoluted. Can someone explain this? I have recently seen this phenomenon in plots that re-represent data in a lower dimensional space (viz., correspondence analysis and factor analysis). What would a "gradient" correspond to more generally (i.e., in a non-ecological context)? If this happens with your data, is it a "problem" ("serious problem")? For what? How should one interpret output where a horseshoe / arch shows up? Does a remedy need to be applied? What? Would transformations of the original data help? What if the data are ordinal ratings? The answers may exist in other pages on that site (e.g., for PCA , CA , and DCA ). I have been trying to work through those. But the discussions are couched in sufficiently unfamiliar ecological terminology and examples that it is harder to understand the issue.
