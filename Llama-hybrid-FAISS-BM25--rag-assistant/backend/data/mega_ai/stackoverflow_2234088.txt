By default, in the STL, two iterators from two different container are not comparable. This means, the behavior is unspecified. So you do whatever you want, nobody should even try. edit After looking carefully at the standard, section 24.1, paragraph 6 states: An iterator j is called reachable from an iterator i if and only if there is a finite sequence of applications of the expression ++i that makes i == j. If j is reachable from i, they refer to the same container. Which means that if you allow i == j with i and j in two different container, you really consider both container as being the same. As they are immutable, this is perfectly fine. Just a question of semantic.
