Much of the answer to your question is included on the page you link. Your question becomes how to apply the principles outlined there. @AdamO notes: A competing event is formally any event that "curtails the incidence" of a particular outcome. For each of your scenarios, you have to answer the question: does this "event" affect the probability of the outcome of primary interest (e.g., overall survival)? For the benign contralateral pathology "known not to have any impact on breast cancer patient survival" that occurs after entry into the trial for Drug X, there would seem to be no "competing risk" under that definition. In a pre-planned randomized trial (which is the situation you seem to be considering), any unexpected effect of that benign pathology on outcome would ideally be averaged out between treatment groups. As this "event" (under your assumptions) doesn't "curtail the incidence" of the outcome of interest, there is no need to censor such patients. You might include development of that pathology as a time-varying covariate for further control, or evaluate it with a multi-state model to test your assumption that it has no impact on survival or on the efficacy of Drug X. A treatment-induced skin cancer that occurs before entry into the trial of Drug X is a bit more complicated. It's not clear to me whether such an event occurring before the trial would be considered strictly as a "competing event" if the starting point for survival analysis were the start date of the Drug X trial. As you note, however, that can't just be ignored. A trial design in practice would probably either exclude such individuals or use prior development of such skin cancer as a factor in the randomization. Analysis that stratifies on prior skin-cancer status or includes it as a covariate could be considered. Things get much trickier if such a skin cancer develops after entry into the Drug X trial (even if it was caused by radiation therapy prior to the Drug trial). Then (1) it certainly is a competing event and (2) the skin cancer might affect other therapies received by the patient during the trial, potentially interacting with Drug X. Censoring or a formal competing-risks could help deal with this problem. If there is confounder-treatment feedback, traditional covariate-adjustment methods might not work. For example, what if Drug X affected the probability of developing radiation-induced skin cancer, and therapy for the skin cancer then affected how well Drug X works? Hern√°n and Robins provide an accessible reference for how to deal with such complications in both randomized trials and observational studies.
