I believe that Shu might be what you're looking for. It costs money, but its an API and bundler for AIR applications that gives them additional functionality. To quote their site: Shu provides you the developer with a toolkit of commands to extend the system capabilities of your AIR application, features include, controlling external applications, opening external files, database connectivity and control, system path retrieval and screen capture functionality. I believe that its cross platform as well.
