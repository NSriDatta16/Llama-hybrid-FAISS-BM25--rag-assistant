Depends on the size of the functions, your visitors' access patterns, your cache settings and other circumstances. The speed of downloading a file depends on how many TCP packets the server has to send. (Packet sizes tend to be around 1,5K.) Increasing the file size only matters if means the file needs to be broken into more packets (the client-size delay of processing a script which needs not be run is negligible), so if your scripts are short (you should of course minify them first), its best to alwaays bundle them. If you expect the average visitor to need all scripts eventually, it's again best to send them in one file. If, however, the average visitor won't need some of the larger scripts (for example one part is only needed at upload, and only 0,1% of the visitors ever uploads something), it might be better to send them separately.
