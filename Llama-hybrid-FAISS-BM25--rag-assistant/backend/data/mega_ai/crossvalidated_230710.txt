Howlers caused by using stepwise regression

I am well aware of the problems of stepwise/forward/backward selection in regression models. There are numerous cases of researchers denouncing the methods and pointing to better alternatives. I was curious if there are any stories that exist where a statistical analysis: has used stepwise regression; made some important conclusions based on the final model the conclusion was wrong, resulting in negative consequences for the individual, their research, or their organisation My thought on this if stepwise methods are bad, then there should be consequences in the "real world" for using them.
