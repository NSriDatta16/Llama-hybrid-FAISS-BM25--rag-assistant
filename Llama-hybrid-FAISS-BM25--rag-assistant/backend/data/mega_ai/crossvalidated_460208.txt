Data. If, as @StupidWolf suggests, 'Back and Neck' injuries are a category of injuries, so that the rest of 'Total Injuries' can be considered as a complementary category, then your data table looks like this: Inj Type \ Occup CyO HTO TOTAL ------------------------------------------- Back/Neck 1 34 35 Other 3 216 219 ------------------------------------------- TOTAL 4 250 254 Chi-squared test of independence. Then, supposing that there were 254 randomly chosen injuries altogether, such a table might potentially be analyzed using a chi-squared test of independence. We enter the data into a matrix in R, and check totals for validity. DTA = matrix(c(1,34, 3,216), byrow=T, nrow=2); DTA [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 34 [2,] 3 216 rowSums(DTA); colSums(DTA); sum(DTA) [1] 35 219 [1] 4 250 [1] 254 However, as you say, a chi-squared test is not valid because the expected number of counts in one of the four cells is far below 5, required for the chi-squared statistic to have approximately an chi-squared distribution. Fisher Exact Test. By contrast, Fisher's Exact Test (as implemented in R) is valid. However, it does not find significance of association between Occupation and Injury Type variables. fisher.test(DTA) Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data data: DTA p-value = 0.4495 alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1 Notes: (1) If the 1:3 ratio of Back/Neck injuries to Other injuries were to hold up with a larger number of subjects in the CyO occupational category, then you'd find significance. Consider the fake data table below. P-values are shown below for both Fisher and chi-square tests: DTA.2 = matrix(c(15,34, 45,216), byrow=T, nrow=2); DTA.2 [,1] [,2] [1,] 15 34 [2,] 45 216 fisher.test(DTA.2) $p.val [1] 0.04669228 chisq.test(DTA.2)$ p.val [1] 0.04807218 (2) You have enough data for HTO to make a reasonable 95% confidence interval for the proportion of HTO total injuries that are back/neck injuries. The point estimate is $\hat p = 34/250 = 0.126$ one of several kinds of 95% confidence intervals for $p$ is the Jeffries Interval $(0.098, 0.183),$ based on a Bayesian method. But for CyO you don't have enough data to make a useful interval estimate. qbeta(c(.025,.975), 34.5, 216.5) [1] 0.09777243 0.18259443
