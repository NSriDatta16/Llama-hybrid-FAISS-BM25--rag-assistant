Off the top of my head (and without seeing your code): I'm assuming you're building your lists from the database - what does that SQL look like? Have you optimized the query/queries? Are the table indexes set up properly? Also, something as simple as a with (nolock) where appropriate could make a huge difference. The site takes a while to initially load for me, so I'm assuming that slow down is in your data retrieval.
