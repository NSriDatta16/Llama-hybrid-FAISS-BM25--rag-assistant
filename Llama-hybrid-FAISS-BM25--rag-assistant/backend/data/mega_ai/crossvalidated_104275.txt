Good news! You've allready calculated the loadings. The loadings are the weight each observation gets in the principal components. What you call 'factors' are the 'factor loadings'. Rotations are performed on these 'loadings'=='eigenvectors'. The method to do this is dependent on the type of (ortoghonal) rotation you intend to do. The stats package has pca() and rotatefactors() (link) methods it that package is available to you. Sidenote: I see that you calculated the eigenvectors with the covariance matrix, this assumes that all data is in the same scale. That is variations in Hours have the same impact as variations in Price. It might be more informative to use the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix corrcoef() . I also see that a lot of your coding is "reinventing the wheel" maybe thats intentional to learn but for example covariance matrices are built in in base via var(X) (link) . Good luck!
