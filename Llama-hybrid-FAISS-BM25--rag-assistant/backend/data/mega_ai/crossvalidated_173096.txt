How to formulate data for neural network with "class" inputs and a numerical output

I'm just starting to play with neural networks (via PyBrain ). I've got some questions about problem formulation. I've taken a bunch of rugby data (very topical), which consists of a list of match results i.e. two team names, and the points difference ( Team A score - Team B score). I'm really not sure how to represent this information as a dataset suitable for training my neural network. So far I've tried: Two inputs, representing unique number IDs for each team, and a points diff output A boolean array, with teams not playing set to zero, Team A set to 1 and Team B set -1, and a points diff output Adding each match twice, but expressed from the point of view of the other team i.e. Team A vs Team B , points diff 10; and Team B vs Team A points diff -10. Have I completely misunderstood how to represent the data? I've seen training datasets which take a numeric input and a classification output e.g. ClassificationDataSet in PyBrain , but ideally I think I might want the other way round i.e. two class inputs (i.e. the two team names) and a numeric output. I should be clear, I'm not expecting tonnes of skill here, but I would expect it to learn things like: The predicted point difference between Team A vs Team B is -ve that of Team B vs Team A . New Zealand vs Algeria should really be a win for NZ
