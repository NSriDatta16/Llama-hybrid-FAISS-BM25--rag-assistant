Is there a way to increase the size of localStorage in Google Chrome to avoid QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR: DOM Exception 22

I've written a webapp that allows you to store the images in the localStorage until you hit save (so it works offline, if signal is poor). When the localStorage reaches 5MB Google Chrome produces an error in the javascript console log: Uncaught Error: QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR: DOM Exception 22 How do I increase the size of the localStorage quota on Google Chrome?
