Flash CS5 Dynamic Text Incorrect Values

I did not have any problems on CS4 but I encountered this error below when I used CS5. Fonts should be embedded for any text that may be edited at runtime, other than text with the "Use Device Fonts" setting. Use the Text > Font Embedding command to embed fonts. I managed to solve the line of error after help from Rup, Fox and Stephen. Now that the line of error is cleared. However, I am still having problems with my dynamic text fields which worked with correct values in CS4 but gave the incorrect values in CS5. Help anyone? Thanks in advance.
