Definition of Regressor

Hi i have been learning Machine Learning for over six months, and I started to see the term Regressor and can 't really google it out for an exact definetion. I fully understand logistic regression and linear regression..but just can't figure out this term,..(and sometimes so many terms coming out from ML but they more or less refers to similar things..) I just got this answer from wiki: The independent variables, also known in a statistical context as regressors, represent inputs or causes, i.e., potential reasons for variation or, in the experimental setting, the variable controlled by the experimenter. Is this correct - the learning of ML, to me, really is so much slightly varying terminologies... (which can be completely absent in one course or framework, and suddenly they appear elsewhere..)
