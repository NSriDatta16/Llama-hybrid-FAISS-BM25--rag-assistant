The only resource I could find so far : https://github.com/williamFalcon/DeepRLHacks For my specific case, I made a few errors : Frozen some part of the network that shouldn't be frozen Wrong learning rate Even if I could overfit a small dataset, it didn't mean anything : while training on the whole dataset, the average reward was not going up. You should look for a reward going up. I'm not accepting this answer as I believe it is not complete : it lacks general and systematic guidelines to debug a Reinforcement Learning algorithm.
