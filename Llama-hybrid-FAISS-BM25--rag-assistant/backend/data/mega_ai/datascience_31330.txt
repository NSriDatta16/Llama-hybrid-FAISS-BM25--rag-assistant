MemoryError for np.array

I was trying the Keras CNN Stater Code on Ubuntu 16.04, from the below link: https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/competitive/deep-learning-3/machine-learning/predict-the-energy-used-612632a9/#c144537 I get “MemoryError:” for X_train = np.array(train_img, np.float32) / 255. Any idea, what should I be doing?
