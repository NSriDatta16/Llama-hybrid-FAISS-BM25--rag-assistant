Creating one static library for iOS and simulator for distribution

If you create a static library for iOS do you have to distribute the header file(s) with it or is there another way to get it to work? Currently I have a single my_lib.a file for both device and simulator but when I drag it into another test app to use it, it says it can't find the header and that all the places I'm using it in the code are undeclared. So I figure I'm either doing something wrong, or I have to also send the appropriate header files with it. Background to my process: I've seen two guides for creating a static library for both device and simulator. One on this site: Build fat static library (device + simulator) using Xcode and SDK 4+ and one here: http://mark.aufflick.com/blog/2010/11/19/making-a-fat-static-library-for-ios-device-and-simulator I used the second site to just try it out. I'm also a bit curious if I did it correctly. I just went into the Release-iphone(os|simulator) folders and found the .a in the ios one and the .o in the simulator one.
