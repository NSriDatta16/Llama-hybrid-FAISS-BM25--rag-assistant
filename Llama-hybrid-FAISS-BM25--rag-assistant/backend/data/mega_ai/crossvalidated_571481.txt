You can define your population in a way that you can collect all of the observations. In the example give, one can argue that even for a rare disease you are not only interested in current people who suffer from the disease but also in people from the past and future. But for an example suppose you are interested in the cord length of cords found in my house, that is a finite number of observation which you can collect all of them. Suppose you collect all of the cords in my house, and measure them taking the average, then yes that is the expected value of my house length cord distribution. It is not wrong as long as he collected a random sample of the population. A negative example, taking cords specifically from my room in the house. I think most introduction to statistics books have a section about sampling distribution and population.
