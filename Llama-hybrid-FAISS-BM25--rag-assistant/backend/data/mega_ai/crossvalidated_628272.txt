In comments, OP clarifies that the model is predicting the class labels and also is using the class labels as features. This is entirely tautological. If we have the label information, then there's no reason to build a model at all -- just use the label to achieve whatever task that needs to know the label. If your model uses the label as a feature, then you also won't be able to use the model to make predictions, except in cases when you already have the label information. So in this sense, the model exhibits circular logic . In the specific case of the data in OP's question, we could paraphrase the machine learning task as "The label is H . Can you predict the label?" We don't need to do any work at all to answer this question, because you told us that the label is H . In the usual setting, the reason to build a model is that the class label information is not available when we would like. If we want to know the price of a share of stock 6 months in the future, we will either have to wait 6 months, make an educated guess, or use a model to make a prediction. If we want to read the addresses on all pieces of mail, either we pay hundreds of humans to read those addresses and route the mail accordingly, or we can use a model to read pictures of the address labels. So when you ask "Is this a valid technique?" and "Am I achieving anything really useful?" the answer to both is NO . The bounty asks for a authoritative reference. I'm not aware of one that explicitly addresses this. But I think Hastie et al.'s Elements of Statistical Learning makes it clear that the purpose of the supervised model is to estimate some quantity that we don't already know . Statistical learning plays a key role in many areas of science, finance and industry. Here are some examples of learning problems: Predict whether a patient, hospitalized due to a heart attack, will have a second heart attack. The prediction is to be based on demographic, diet and clinical measurements for that patient. Predict the price of a stock in 6 months from now, on the basis of company performance measures and economic data. Identify the numbers in a handwritten ZIP code, from a digitized image.
