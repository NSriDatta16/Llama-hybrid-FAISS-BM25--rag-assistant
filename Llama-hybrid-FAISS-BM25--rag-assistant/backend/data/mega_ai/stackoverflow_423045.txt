If you just want to copy existing files into your application bundle's Resources folder (which on iPhone is just the inside of the .app bundle), do the following: Drag the folder you want copied into the Files and Folders listing of your xcode project. From the sheet that pops up asking you if you want to add the files to a target, change the radio button to "Create folder references for any added folders'. The folder you dragged in and all of its contents will be copied verbatim during building.
