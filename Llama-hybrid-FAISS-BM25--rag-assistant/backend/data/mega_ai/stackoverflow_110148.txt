This is just off the top of my head: Content organization should be one of your primary concerns. How are you going to organize all the disparate pieces of content? Security, and what levels? do you need to only secure the ability to edit any content? certain pieces of content? How about viewing of content, does that need to be secured in any way? Versioning of content? Multilingual? What kind of content? Simple text? images? videos? blog postings? That should at least get you started in thinking in the right direction.
