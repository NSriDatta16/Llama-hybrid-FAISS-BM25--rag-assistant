Interpreting moderated quadratic effect in mixed effect models

I study the effect of the same stimulus ( $X$ ), displaced in 4 different conditions (categorical $M$ , categories=High, Medium, Low, in addition there is "Control" condition, as a reference level) on participants. The variable $Y$ is measured for the whole time. Since $Y$ is repeatedly measured, I decided to introduce time as a variable, and observe how $Y$ changes overtime, and whether the way it changes varies from one condition to another (basically, whether $M$ moderates the change of $Y$ ). A quick plot indicates that there may be nonlinearity in the way $Y$ changes, mostly U-shape. Upon comparison (informed by AIC), I conclude that the following model performs the best: model1 And the summary of the model shows: Update: per Robert's suggestion, I centered the Time variable before introducing its quadratic term and interaction terms. Here's the updated result from the model -- it did improved slightly. Background: I know that positive coefficient for Time_quadratic means the data is U-shape, while a negative coefficient indicates inverted U-shape. However, I am not entirely sure how to interpret the coefficient for the interaction term. Questions: For example, M_High:Time_quadratic has a coefficient of -4.855e-05. Does that mean the data in the High condition is inverted U-shape, or it is still U-shape, but -4.855e-05 less U-shape than the control, given the Control condition is the reference level? A smaller coefficient in quadratic effect means a larger parabola. That means, compared with the "Controlâ€œ condition, the high, low, and medium conditions all have larger parabolas, thus flatter U-shape curves, which is supported by visualization. Note: I'm modeling data in T2. Red=Control, Blue =Low, Green=High, Violet=Medium Thank you for your time.
