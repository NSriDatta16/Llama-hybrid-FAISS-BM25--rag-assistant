RMSE and MAE do have units. In fact, they have the same units. (Determining why that’s the case is a useful exercise.) You determine those units by considering the units of your $y$ . If $y$ is measured in dollars, euros, kilometers, or days, each of those metrics will be measured in dollars, euros, kilometers, or days, respectively. There are times when you do want to consider the units on those metrics, such as, “Boss, we’re crushing it! The model only misses house prices by an average of a few cents,” or, “No, lazy subcontractor, we’re not paying you for developing a model that misses commute times by an average of three days.” In the material you’re reading, however, I can think of two reasons why the units are omitted. The units are implied by the units of $y$ , so there is no ambiguity, and omitting the units saves space. Models of the same $y$ are being compared, so no matter the units, the model with the lower loss value is superior (assuming proper validation, which is a topic for a separate question or a textbook ).
