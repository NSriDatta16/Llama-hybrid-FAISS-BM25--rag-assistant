One XPath expression that selects the first element in a document is: (//img)[1] Do note that a frequent mistake -- as made by @Oded in his answer is to suggest the following XPath expression -- in general it may select more than one element: //img[1] (: WRONG !!! :) This selects all elements in the document, each one of which is the first child of its parent. Here is the exact explanation of this frequent mistake -- in the W3C XPath 1.0 Recommendation : NOTE : The location path //para[1] does not mean the same as the location path /descendant::para[1] . The latter selects the first descendant para element; the former selects all descendant para elements that are the first para children of their parents. A further problem exists if the document has defined a default namespace, which must be the case with XHTML. XPath treats any unprefixed name as belonging to no namespace and the expression (//img)[1] selects no node, because there is no element in the document that belongs to no namespace and has name img . In this case there are two ways to specify the wanted XPath expression: (//x:img)[1] -- where the prefix x is associated (by the hosting language) with the specific default namespcae (in this case this is the XHTML namespace ). (//*[name()='img'])[1]
