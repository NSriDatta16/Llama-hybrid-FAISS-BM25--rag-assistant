HWND is a "handle to a window" and is part of the Win32 API . HWNDs are essentially pointers (IntPtr) with values that make them (sort of) point to a window-structure data. In general HWNDs are part an example for applying the ADT model. If you want a Control's HWND see Control.Handle property. It is an IntPtr which value is an HWND. Since HWND are not a .Net entity, they need to be released manually. This is done with Control.DestroyHandle() . Pay close attention to creation and destruction of HWND. Responsibility for object destruction is unusual in .Net and is in general a source for bugs and memory leaks.
