Perl implements its own modulo operator, but you can get to the one from your C compiler by using the integer pragma. perlop says Note that when use integer is in scope, "%" gives you direct access to the modulo operator as implemented by your C compiler. This operator is not as well defined for negative operands, but it will execute faster. That is, you have to be careful when you are using integer because the modulo might give you different answers.
