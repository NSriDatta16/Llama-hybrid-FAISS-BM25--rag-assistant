Sorry, no. WSE 2.0 is dead. WSE3.0 is dying too. Microsoft is encouraging everyone to upgrade to WCF. You can write a WCF service that calls your WSE 2.0 service though. I would suggest you extract your business logic out of your service to make the transition to WCF just for the performance improvement.
