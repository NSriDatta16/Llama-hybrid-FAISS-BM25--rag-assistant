Bookmarks are used when you want a mnemonic (foo_feature) that points to a changing commit id as your work progresses. They're more light-weight that regular Mercurial branches, and somewhat similar to the way git branches work. Tags generally point to fixed commit ids. They can be reassigned manually, but this is discouraged.
