Legal protections are your friend here. Get a lawyer to draw up a contract for you, including protective clauses and penalties for violations. Also, if you need enough freelance help, it might make sense to look at a company to provide the services which could be a bit more secure than the freelance angle. Failing that, Rony's first point is good--get a second, non production account. You honestly should have one anyhow for staging and testing as you probably don't want untested code playing with production data. The real expense with AWS is in bandwidth rather than purely in storage, so it shouldn't cost too much. Another angle, depending on how much of the service's API you are using and your skills as a coder, would be to abstract the S3 bits behind your own storage interface. Provide the developers with a non-S3 backed implementation while keeping your s3-backed implementation in a separate repository they don't have access to, then switch to the s3-backed option when appropriate. This has long-term advantages like making it easy to switch storage providers should the need arise.
