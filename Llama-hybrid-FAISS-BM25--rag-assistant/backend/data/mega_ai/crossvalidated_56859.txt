Point hypothesis are not common(reasonable) in a Bayesian framework since their probability, under a continuous model, is zero. Something that seems to fit in your context is the calculation of the posterior stress-strength coefficient $$\theta=P(\lambda_1\lt \lambda_2) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{l_2}\pi_{\lambda_1\vert{\bf x}}(l_1)\pi_{\lambda_2\vert{\bf x}}(l_2)dl_1 dl_2.$$ The posterior densities involved in this expression can be approximated using a kernel density estimator and the posterior simulations. However, note that this is only quantifying the uncertainty about $H:\lambda_1\lt \lambda_2$ and that $P(\lambda_1=\lambda_2\vert \text{Observations})=0$. Then, you may want to think what is the question of interest that you want to answer.
