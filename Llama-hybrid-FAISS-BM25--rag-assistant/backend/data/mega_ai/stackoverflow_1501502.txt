What's the difference between a double? and a double and why can't I implicitly convert them?

Visual studio is yelling at me, in the database it is a float, and in my class it is a double. Why can't I assign it and why does it think it's a 'double?' ? LINE THREE BELOW Confirmation confirm = new Confirmation(); confirm.order = theOrder; confirm.totalPrice = theOrder.BillingAmount; HERE IS Confirmation DEF public class Confirmation { public Order order; public List allProducts; public double totalPrice; } HERE IS BillingAmount DEF from code I think generated from .dbml draggy-droppy... [Column(Storage="_BillingAmount", DbType="Float")] public System.Nullable BillingAmount { get { return this._BillingAmount; } set { if ((this._BillingAmount != value)) { this.OnBillingAmountChanging(value); this.SendPropertyChanging(); this._BillingAmount = value; this.SendPropertyChanged("BillingAmount"); this.OnBillingAmountChanged(); } } }
