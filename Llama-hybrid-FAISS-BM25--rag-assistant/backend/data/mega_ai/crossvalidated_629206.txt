The Y axis for ALE is always on the scale of the predicted values of the Y outcome variable . For numeric outcome variables, this is the same original scale as the Y outcome variable. So, if you were predicting Sepal.Length, for example, then the unit of Y would be centimetres. The 0 point means the average value of predictions for the ALE dataset. Positive values are above average and negative values are below average. In the case of binary or categorical variables, as in your example, the unit of the ALE Y axis is still the scale of the predicted values of the Y outcome variable . In your example above, the key is type = "prob" Predictor$new(rf, data = iris, type = "prob") . So, the Y outcome in your case is the probability of Species . The zero value means the average probability of the predictions of the decision tree rf . Since these are probabilities, the range from the lowest Y to the highest Y value cannot be greater than 1.0, which is the case here, ranging from approximately -0.5 to 0.5. (As an aside, I'm not sure why the result of rpart is called rf ; dt would make more sense to me.) The results can be interpreted as: Petal.Width has no measured effect on the probabilities of setosa , which is no doubt because it is the reference class against which the other two classes are compared. The model assigns Petal.Width from 0 to 1.6 cm or so higher than average probability of being versicolor ; Petal.Width from 1.6 to 2.5 cm has below average probability of being versicolor . The model assigns Petal.Width from 0 to 1.6 cm or so lower than average probability of being virginica ; Petal.Width from 1.6 to 2.5 cm has above average probability of being virginica .
