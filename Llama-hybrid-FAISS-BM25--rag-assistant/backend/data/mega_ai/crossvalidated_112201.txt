You don't need to have a reason to name a parameter. They could have called it "r", too. The intuition probably is that epsilon will usually be a rather small value - much smaller than the data set diameter or average distance. It's not just some arbitrary radius, but a small non-empty radius. Probably the naming was just inherited from earlier work; likely in data indexing. Data indexes to accelerate radius queries can work in $O(\log n)$ - but only if the query is selective, i.e. only selects a small part of the data set. If the result is of size $O(n)$, no index will help enumerating the result (nor will DBSCAN yield interesting clusters). I've seen the range queries been called "epsilon range queries" for that reason - they should be used with a small radius to be fast. But they could have named it $\chi$, $\xi$, $\zeta$, $\Upsilon$, $\Xi$, $\ddagger$, $\heartsuit$, $\Im$, $\hbar$, $\mho$ if they were in the mood to fool around ...
