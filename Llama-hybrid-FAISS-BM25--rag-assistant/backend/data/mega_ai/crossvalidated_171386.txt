What are Bayesian p-values?

I'm looking for an answer that would satisfy a reader who understands frequentist p-values but only understands the rudiments of Bayesian approaches to statistics. At present google searches do not reveal a definition either on a Wikipedia page or any other commonly accepted resource. This question seems related but isn't really since it transpired that the user was not actually calculating Bayesian p-values. However, the accepted answer links to this Gelman paper in explanation of what Bayesian p-values are.
