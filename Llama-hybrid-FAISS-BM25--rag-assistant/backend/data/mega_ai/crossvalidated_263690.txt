cv parameter in GridSearchCV doesn't change accuracy

Here is some simple code to illustrate my point. Using GridSearchCV with cv=2, cv=20, cv=50 etc makes no difference in the final scoring (48). Even if I use KFold with different values the accuracy is still the same. Even if I use svm instead of knn accuracy is always 49 no metter how many folds I specify. This is just a toy example, but in the case of big, real world data sets I face the same probem . cv parameter in GridSearchCV never makes any difference. Am I doing something wrong or is GridSearchCV 'broken'? from sklearn import svm from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier as knn from sklearn import datasets from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV from sklearn.utils import shuffle from sklearn.model_selection import KFold iris = datasets.load_iris() X, y = shuffle(iris.data, iris.target, random_state=0) X_train, y_train = X[:100], y[:100] X_test, y_test = X[100:], y[100:] knn_param_grid = {'n_neighbors': [5, 2]} # svm_param_grid = {'shrinking': [True, False]} # cv = KFold(30) grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=knn(), param_grid=knn_param_grid, cv=20) grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train) predictions = grid_search.predict(X_test) print sum(predictions == y_test) # prints 48 for every value of cv
