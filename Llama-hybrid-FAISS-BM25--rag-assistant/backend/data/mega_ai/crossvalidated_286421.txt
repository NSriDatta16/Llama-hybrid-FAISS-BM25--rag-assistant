Can't recover correct Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) parameters from simulated data (R)

I'm trying to estimate the parameters of a discretized time series that I think may be described by an OU process. To do so, I am using the methodology described here: https://www.sitmo.com/?p=134 Specifically, I am using least squares to regress the n-th term of the time-series against the (n-1)-th term, and am using the regression coefficients to estimate the parameters. However, I find that I am not able to recover the parameters I simulate from. Here is my code for simulation: ornstein_uhlenbeck This is the same code used here . Here is my code to estimate from the simulated data ss = matrix(0, 500, 3) for (k in 1:500){ nn1 = 500 d = ornstein_uhlenbeck(TT, nn1, 0, 1, 1, x0) #theta = 0, kappa = 0, sigma = 0 cal_ou = lm(d[2:(length(d)+1)] ~ d[1:(length(d))]) coefs = summary(cal_ou)$coefficients theta_cand = coefs[1] / (1 - coefs[2]) kappa_cand = - log(coefs[2]) / (TT/nn1) B2 = summary(cal_ou)$sigma sigma_cand = sqrt(2*kappa_cand/ (1 - exp(-2*kappa_cand*del_t)))*B2 ss[k,] = c(theta_cand, kappa_cand, sigma_cand) } theta_est = mean(ss[,1]) kappa_est = mean(ss[,2]) sigma_est = mean(ss[,3]) kappa_sd = sd(ss[,2])/sqrt(500) theta_sd = sd(ss[,1])/sqrt(500) sigma_sd = sd(ss[,3])/sqrt(500) And these are typical values I get for the estimates: > theta_est [1] 0.006430432 > kappa_est [1] 1.583136 > sigma_est [1] 1.010019 The estimates for theta and sigma are fine (long-run mean and volatility, respectively). However, the estimate for kappa is quite far away from what I specified. I'm not sure what the issue is here, and why I can't recover the correct kappa value. Can anyone help?
