Well, I would add at least a class to the element you want the first-letter styling to be applied to. I'm sure you can do a css rule for the first paragraph of the first div; but if you happen to have another div with a paragraph at the beginning, then it is going to be applied to all of them. In other words, without using a class/id in your selector, it will be applied to the first letter of the first paragraph of EVERY DIV (which might not be the behavior you're looking for). So I would recommend this: Once upon a time.. A beautiful princess.. And then in your css: .FirstLetter:first-letter { // styling rules here } But if my intuition is incorrect and you know for sure that this is what you're looking for, then @Demian Brecht's answer should do fine.
