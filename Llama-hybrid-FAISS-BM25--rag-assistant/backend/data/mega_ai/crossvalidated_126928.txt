I would say, that You (as a human) can set (manually set) zero weight on those factors, but machine learning algorithm will not necessarily do so. One problem with additional factors is overfitting. (I think, no further explanation is needed here) To illustrate another problem let us consider a decision tree. As you move down the tree, you get fewer and fewer data points for each node. With some probability it may happen that the irrelevant variable will be chosen for the split. Since this is irrelevant variable, this split is actually wrong and worsens your solution. The fewer data points you have at node, the higher is the probability that this will happen. (I learned about this problem from the book by Witten, Frank, Hall "Data Mining". I tried to find a link now, by without success.) One more problem is that additional factors may be correlated with the existing ones, thus causing multicollinearity These problems are general and not specific for boosting (and also not solved by boosting)
