What is the simplest way to convert a Java string from all caps (words separated by underscores) to CamelCase (no word separators)?

The title pretty much says it all. What's the simplest/most elegant way that I can convert, in Java, a string from the format "THIS_IS_AN_EXAMPLE_STRING" to the format " ThisIsAnExampleString "? I figure there must be at least one way to do it using String.replaceAll() and a regex. My initial thoughts are: prepend the string with an underscore ( _ ), convert the whole string to lower case, and then use replaceAll to convert every character preceded by an underscore with its uppercase version.
