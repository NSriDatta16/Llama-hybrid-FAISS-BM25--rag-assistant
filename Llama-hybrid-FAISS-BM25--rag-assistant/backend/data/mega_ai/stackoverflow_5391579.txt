Upload larger files(200MB) to dropbox

I have a problem. I have a WCF running. The idea is that the service will upload files(200MB) to a DropBox account. I've tried SharpBox and DropNet. Everything works like a charm until I try to upload files. That means that login to dropbox and create a folder works, but upload does not work... This is what I have tried so far: Code sharpBox way 1: ICloudFileSystemEntry file = _storage.CreateFile(_folderEntry, Path.GetFileName(fileToUpload)); using (FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(fileToUpload, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read)) { Int32 length = 1024; int bytesRead = 0; Byte[] buffer = new Byte[length]; using (Stream data = file.GetContentStream(FileAccess.Write)) { using (BinaryWriter writer = new BinaryWriter(data)) { bytesRead = fileStream.Read(buffer, 0, length); // write the required bytes while (bytesRead > 0) { bytesRead = fileStream.Read(buffer, 0, length); writer.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead); } } } } Code sharpBox way 2: _storage.UploadFile(fileToUpload, _folderEntry); Code DropNet way 3: byte[] content = _client.GetFileContentFromFS(new FileInfo(fileToUpload)); _client.UploadFile(_dropBoxFolder, Path.GetFileName(fileToUpload), content); In webconfig: and /GÃ¶ran
