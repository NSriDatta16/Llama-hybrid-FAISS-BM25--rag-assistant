If you compile the two fragments and use reflector to disassemble you will see that they both end up as the practically the same IL. The compiler replaces the if / else with case statement. This kind of micro optimization is highly unlikely to help you if you have performance problems. If you have performance problems then you need to profile the program and find out where the bottlenecks are. If you don't have performance problems, stop sweating this stuff and worry about writing code that is easily understood.
