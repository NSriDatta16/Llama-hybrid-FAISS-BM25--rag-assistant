I'm trying to deploy an application on Azure but I'm facing some problems. on my dev box, all works fine but I have a problem when I'm trying to use the application once it is deployed. on the dev box, I have an action that I do manually wich crates the test tables in my local sql server express. but I do not know how to create the tables on the server ? so when I run my website application, it says TableNotFound. Can sy guide me through this final step ? do I need to make sg additional ? Thx in advance
