This is the relevant documentation: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/Articles/cdNSAttributes.html but essentially, you have to provide a way for Core Data to translate between your non-standard properties and the kinds of things it can store. There are two ways to do it. Either use transformable attributes and value transformers, or use transient properties and do the conversion only when the managed object context is going to be saved. I think in most cases, what you describe (defining custom entities to store the components of something like a CGRect) is overkill.
