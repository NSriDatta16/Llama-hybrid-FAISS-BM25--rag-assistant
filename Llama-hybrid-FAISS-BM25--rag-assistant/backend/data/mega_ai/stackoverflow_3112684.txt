You know I'd be interested if any developers can provide some insight into this. Any Entity Framework examples seem to only consist of about ten to twenty tables, which is small scale really. What about using the EF on a database with hundreds or even a thousand tables? Personally, I know several developers and organisations that were burned by LINQ-to-SQL and are holding off for a year or so to see what direction EF takes.
