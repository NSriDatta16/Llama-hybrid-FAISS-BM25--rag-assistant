iPhone hand crafted views/controllers

I was wondering if anyone knew of any good online resources/tutorials for creating views and controllers programatically rather than via the interface builder. Everything I have looked at uses the interface builder and the created nibs, while the IB is ok I would like to have the option of developing these manually (both for practical reasons and get a good understanding of how it all fits together rather than the superficial one you get from dragging and dropping things). My background is in java and I'm finding it slow and frustrating using the interface builder to develop views the way I would sometimes do them in Java, i.e. either generate the source programatically from a domain model and then tweak the result if requried use some meta-data and/or reflection and dynamically add the controls to the view Also, once I have created a view is there anyway I can add it to the interface builder to make it available to use as a sub view on another view? Thanks, Vic
