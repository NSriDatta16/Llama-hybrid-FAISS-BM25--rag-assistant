Sampler method to choose in Monte Carlo Markov chain estimation

When estimating the posterior via MCMC, are there guidelines on the best sampling method to use depending on the nature of the model? There are a variety of forms of MCMC - the Gibbs sampler, the Metropolis algorithm, and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for example. Gilks et al. (1996) has a nice discussion of the MCMC variations. My particular use-case involves estimating a posterior by mixing observed sample security returns with a prior equilibirum model of security returns. Return series are often heteroskedastic and have cross-sectional correlations and are non-stationary across market regimes.
