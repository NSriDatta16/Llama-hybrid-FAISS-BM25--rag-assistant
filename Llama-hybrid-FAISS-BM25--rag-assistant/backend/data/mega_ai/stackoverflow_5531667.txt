Javascript Regex: Get HTML Tags

I made this regex: /\ +.+\ /gi which matches a full html tag like: this is a paragraph But the problem with this that that it matches all of the elements as one match this is a paragraph But I would like to get all of the HTML elements separated. Note: The HTML tags are in a string not in the DOM. Before the regex solution I tried to create a new div element and I added the string as it's innerHTML. But doesn't worked properly I don't really know why... So I'm looking for a REGEX solution which solves this one match problem. Thanks
