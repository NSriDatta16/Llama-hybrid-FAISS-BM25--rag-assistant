I can't edit David's post but I want to mention something with svn:externals : they are quite dangerous from a release point of view (imo). Here's the nightmare scenario: Let's imagine that you svn:externals some module code inside your application; for the sake of it, let's imagine that the Subversion revision is 1000 for the module. You create a branch, make a release and ship it to the customer. Time goes by and a couple of months/years later the customer asks you to fix a problem in the application. You check out the branch and start svn updating the project. Unfortunately, the linked module has changed widely and has now the version 23456. And now the application doesn't even compile any more. Of course, what you have to do it so change the svm:externals to point the exact version (1000) when you branched. And if you have to change the module's code, than you have to point now to the head of the branch created for the module at the revision 1000. A lot of unnecessary work, that's why I would strongly discourage the usage of externals for any large project. If you have had good experience with svn:externals I am all ears.
