Look at using Tags and LINQ You can utilized the tag object to hold information, then query the controls for that form/application using LINQ. Based on your results you can then set the properties as necessary. This maybe a better approach than the observer model, as if this isn't managed will it may lead to memory leaks and degragation on performance. Just a suggestion.
