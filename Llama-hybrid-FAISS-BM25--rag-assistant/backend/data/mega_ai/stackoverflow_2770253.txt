public static String concatStrings(List strings) { StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); for (String s : strings) { sb.append(s); } return sb.toString(); } Some remarks: Use StringBuilder whenever you need to build a string in a loop + is fine for simple concatenation, but horrible for incremental build Whenever possible, use for-each for readability java.util.Vector is synchronized ; if you don't need this (costly) feature, just use an ArrayList . Don't use raw types JLS 4.8 Raw Types The use of raw types is allowed only as a concession to compatibility of legacy code. The use of raw types in code written after the introduction of genericity into the Java programming language is strongly discouraged. It is possible that future versions of the Java programming language will disallow the use of raw types. Effective Java 2nd Edition: Item 23: Don't use raw types in new code If you use raw types, you lose all the safety and expressiveness benefits of generics.
