I don't know if you are simplifying appropriately or oversimplifying. When you average across periods, you lose information (you always lose information when you average). Is that information important? There's no way for us to know. You'd need to think about what information you are throwing away. To take a simpler case: Suppose you are doing a simple longitudinal study of, say, weight loss on different diets. You assign people to different diets and weigh them, say, every week for 2 months. Now, you could just look at overall weight loss. But then you are throwing away information about the trajectories of loss. I am not sure what you are throwing away in your case.
