How to estimate average user review ratings?

For example, in Amazon Books book A : 1 rating of 5. Average rating of 5 book B : 50 ratings. Average rating of 4.5 If use naive average, then book A is higher than book B. However, we all know that this comes from in-sufficient data. How can we give book A a proper rating, if the data is not enough? I find revalant writings from http://www.evanmiller.org/ranking-items-with-star-ratings.html https://fulmicoton.com/posts/bayesian_rating/ However, both seem a bit complex from my view, and hard to implement. I aggregate data from Amazon, and find there is a distribution of the ratings So I'm thingking a naive-empirical approach Decide after 100 ratings, the avg rating becomes stable For book with (1-w2)*4.6 + w2*rating The w2 should be a function of power-law like distribution, so the ratings number from 1 to 2 will change more as from 99 to 100.
