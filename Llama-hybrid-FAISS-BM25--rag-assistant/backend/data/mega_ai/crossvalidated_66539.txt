Predict near future data from another correlated data source that varies quicker

I'm trying to figure out a way to predict the evolution of some data in the near future by using another data source that is correlated to that one but that varies quicker. For instance, I have the oil barrel prices, and I know that if they increase, soon after the gas prices at auto-pumps are going to increase by a certain amount as well. So I'm trying to calculate the gas prices 7 days in the future, by using the oil barrel prices today (or even the oil barrel prices for the last week or last month). My first approach was to use a Neural Network to solve the problem. It works satisfactorily, but it's very cumbersome and I believe there should be an easier and simpler way.
