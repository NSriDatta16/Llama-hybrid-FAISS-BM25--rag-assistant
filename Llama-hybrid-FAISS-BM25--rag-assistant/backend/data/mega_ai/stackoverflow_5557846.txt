Best way to design data table for unknown number of columns?

I am trying to build a data table structure that will best support the following criteria: 1) I do not know how many columns the table has to have. I might need 6 columns in some cases, or 10 in others. I do not expect this table ever need 20 or more columns, but I also can't guarantee that won't ever be needed. 2) I need to take into account storage space and reporting speed. This table will need to stored millions of records, and reports will be run against this table. I know pivoting out highly normalized tables is difficult from a reporting perspective, so I want to de-normalize for reporting. But, I also don't know if simply defaulting to some large number of columns in order to avoid some normalization is a good idea because I'll probably end up with lots of NULLS in many of the columns on the end of the table, and those will (I think) all take up some amount of storage space. 3) If I have to choose between storage space and report performance, I will side with performance. I am not a Business Intelligence expert, and I am not a T-SQL guru (I'll be using SQL Server), and so I am SURE there are fine points here I have simply overlooked. Thus, I am turning once again to the brilliant SO community for advice, and to have some sense knocked into my thick skull. How would you design the table under these circumstances? What details am I missing and still need to consider?
