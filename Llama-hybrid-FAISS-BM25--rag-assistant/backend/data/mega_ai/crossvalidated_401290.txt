As you note in your question, the important thing to do in this type of analysis is to clearly define what you mean by being "better than chance". The paper discussed in your question (linked in the comments) is not clear on exactly how this was done, and in view of that, my answer is going to give you a simple method by which this form of cross-validation ought to be done . Assessing linear regression via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV): A good way to see if a linear regression is "better than chance", in a predictive sense, is to make a comparison between predictions from the linear regression model with your explanatory variables, and predictions from a null model containing an intercept term, but no explanatory variables. Testing predictive performance on a train-test split is best done by using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), since this form of cross-validation maximises the training data used in each prediction. This method also has the benefit of being able to rely on well-known results for predictive error for leave-one-out analysis in linear regression models (see e.g., here and here ). Prediction errors for regression model: Suppose you have a linear regression model for a dataset with $n$ data points. You want to make predictions for each of the data points, using the remaining data points as your training data in each case. One of the most useful results for this analysis is that the LOOCV prediction error for data point $i$ is: $$r_{[i]} = \frac{r_i}{1-h_{ii}} = \frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sqrt{1-h_{ii}}} \cdot t_i,$$ where $r_i$ is the $i$ th residual in the model using all the data, $t_i$ is the (internally) studentised residual, and $h_{ii}$ is the corresponding leverage of that data point. This result means that you only need to fit your linear model once, to the whole dataset, and you can still easily extract the predictive errors for LOOCV for each data point. For an overall measure of prediction error it is common to use the PRESS statistic : $$\text{PRESS}_\text{ model} = \sum_{i=1}^n r_{[i]}^2 = MS_{Res} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{t_i^2}{1-h_{ii}}.$$ Prediction errors for null model: For the null model with an intercept term, but no explanatory variables, you have predictions $\hat{y}_i = \bar{y}$ and corresponding leverage $h_{ii} = 1/n$ , so you get LOOCV prediction errors: $$r_{[i] \text{ null}} = \frac{y_i - \bar{y}}{1-1/n} = \frac{n}{n-1} \cdot (y_i - \bar{y}).$$ For this case you get an overall measure of prediction error: $$\text{PRESS}_{\text{null}} = \sum_{i=1}^n r_{[i] \text{ null}}^2 = \Big( \frac{n}{n-1} \Big)^2 \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2 = MS_{Tot} \cdot \frac{n^2}{n-1}.$$ Comparison of models under LOOCV: Comparison of the linear regression model with the null model can be undertaken either by comparing the LOOCV prediction errors under the models, or with a hypothesis test on the prediction error in the linear model, under the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the explanatory variables and the response (i.e., that the null model is correct). If you would like to get a measure of the reduction in prediction errors in the linear model, compared to the null model, you have: $$\sqrt{\frac{\text{PRESS}_\text{ model}}{\text{PRESS}_\text{ null}}} = \sqrt{\frac{MS_{Res}}{MS_{Tot}} \cdot \frac{n-1}{n} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{t_i^2}{1-h_{ii}}}.$$ This ratio gives you the proportionate size of the norm of the vector of prediction errors under your linear model, compared to the null model. If this value is substantially smaller than one, this suggests that the linear model is predicting the out-of-sample values substantially better than the null model (i.e., "better than chance"). This can be augmented with formal hypothesis tests that look at the distribution of the PRESS statistic for the linear model under the null hypothesis that the null model is true. If you are using R for analysis, you can calculate the residuals in a linear regression model from the outputs in the base package, and you can obtain the leverage values for the data using the influence function in the stats package. This will give you all the information you need to calculate the LOOCV errors for your model, and the corresponding PRESS statistic. Alternatively, you can calculate the latter measure directly using the CV function in the forecast package in R . Although the linked paper is unclear on exactly how the predictive performance of the model was tested, it appears that this was done via a hypothesis test using the null distribution of the prediction errors. In the case of LOOCV above, under the null model the studentised residuals would have a T-distribution, so the LOOCV prediction errors would have a scaled T-distribution. Presumably the authors of the paper have undertaken some kind of hypothesis test on the prediction errors using this fact (although they did not use the LOOCV prediction errors that I am using here).
