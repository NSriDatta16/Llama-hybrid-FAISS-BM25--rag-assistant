Sufficient number of sample to learn Bayesian network?

I want to construct Bayesian network for a 800 genes(genes are my node/variables). I have only 30 cancer samples and 30 normal sample. So I want to create network for cancer samples and for the normal samples whether my data is reasonable to learn Bayesian network?
