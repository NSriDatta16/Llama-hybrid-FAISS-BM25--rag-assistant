To me that code looks slow. An object-oriented runtime dispatch plus a search on a property list? Why? Sometimes property lists are added to CLOS objects to provide storage for not often used slots or to make them easily extensible (where all kinds of properties could be added without knowing them all before running the program). Generally it might be better to make the properties real slots of the object.
