If I understand the question right, what you're looking for is more a programmable 3D graphics / physics engine sandbox to try out ideas, than anything specifically to do with artificial life. If so, you might want to take a look at fluxus - it's basically that, where the "programmable" part is Scheme. It's designed for interactive programming (draw 3D scenes and animations, then change them in real time), so I'd guess it should be flexible enough for agent-based AI/AL.
