In Java: package somepackage; class SomeClass {} In C++: namespace somenamespace { class SomeClass {} } And using them, Java: import somepackage; And C++: using namespace somenamespace; Also, full names are "somepackge.SomeClass" for Java and "somenamespace::SomeClass" for C++. Using those conventions, you can organize like you are used to in Java, including making matching folder names for namespaces. The folder->package and file->class requirements aren't there though, so you can name your folders and classes independently off packages and namespaces.
