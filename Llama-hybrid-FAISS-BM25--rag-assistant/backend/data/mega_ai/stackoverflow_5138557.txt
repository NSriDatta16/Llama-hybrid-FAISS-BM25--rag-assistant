My biggest worry is indexing, which is taking loooonnnnggg time, and lot of resources!! Take a look at Lusql , we used it once, FWIW 100 GBdata from mysql on a decent machine took little more than an hour to index, on filesystem(NTFS) Now if u add SSD or whatever ultra fast disk tecnnology, you can bring it down considerably
