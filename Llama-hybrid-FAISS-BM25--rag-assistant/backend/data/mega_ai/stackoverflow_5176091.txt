Generalize Method to 'Get' Any Object Property

Say I have a Dictionary object which contains many instances of an object called SomeObject and each SomeObject has properties named Property1 and Property2. Now say I have a method which can return a new Dictionary sorted by Property1. However, I'd like to generalize that method such that I can tell it which property to sort by. For example, to do this, I know I could easily have two separate methods such as: public Dictionary SortByProp1(Dictionary dict) { ... } public Dictionary SortByProp2(Dictionary dict) { ... } But, I'm wondering if it's possible to combine these into one method in which I can give a parameter to identify which method to return? I don't know of a way to generalize a property like that... Note: I do realize I could always use something like an if-statement which could be based on a string of the property name, but that doesn't seem like a very elegant, acceptable answer much better than just having two separate methods to begin with.
