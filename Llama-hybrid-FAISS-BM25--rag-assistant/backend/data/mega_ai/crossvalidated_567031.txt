Random forest (rfsrc) not reproducible despite setting seed

I am not able to reproduce my Random Forest rfsrc results despite setting a seed. Each time I run the code below I see a different ordering to variables listed by order of importance. set.seed(415) fit1sjl What am I doing incorrectly? If it helps the overall variance explained (OOB estimate) is very low.
