Time complexity of memory allocation

What is the time complexity of dynamic memory allocation using new, malloc, etc.? I know very little about how memory allocators are implemented, but I assume the answer is that it depends on the implementation. Therefore, please answer for some of the more common cases/implementations. Edit: I vaguely remember hearing that heap allocation is unbounded in the worst case, but I'm really interested in the average/typical case.
