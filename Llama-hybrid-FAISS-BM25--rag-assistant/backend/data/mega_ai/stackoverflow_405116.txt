Why is the scope of if and delegates this way in c#

Inspired by this question I began wondering why the following examples are all illegal in c#: VoidFunction t = delegate { int i = 0; }; int i = 1; and { int i = 0; } int i = 1; I'm just wondering if anyone knew the exact reason why the language was designed this way? Is it to discourage bad programming practice, and if so why not just issue a warning?, for performance reasons (compiling and when running) or what is the reason?
