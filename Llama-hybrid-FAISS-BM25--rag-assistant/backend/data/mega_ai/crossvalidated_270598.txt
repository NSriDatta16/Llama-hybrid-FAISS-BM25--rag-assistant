The accuracy of the learned model on the validation set is just a proxy for its accuracy in the real-world. It is possible that the accuracy of a learned model in the real-world (for example in the test set), be different than its estimated accuracy during training. If the difference between the accuracy of the model on the validation set and the test set is significant, it means that your validation set and test set comes from two different distributions. It is a common advice for machine learning practitioner that try to choose validation and test sets that are drawn from the same distribution. On the other hand, there is a topic in the machine learning called domain adaptation which tries to develop learning methods that perform well on a different target distribution.
