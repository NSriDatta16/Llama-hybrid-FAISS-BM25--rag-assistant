Is it possible that you could leverage some Core Animation to perform some/all of the animations? For example, rather than redrawing a circle that's changing in size, just render it as one size and animate a scale transform on it? If you only have a couple of objects animating, you could try adding each as a sublayer of your view, and then batching together some Core Animation animations rather than attempting to redraw everything manually. If you look at the blue circles in Apple's Maps app, when they radiate outwards (while getting a fix), you can see that they start out sharp and get a bit blurry as then grow. It works fine for the purpose, and I suspect they are just scaling a small circular image. Would that sort of thing work for your app? It's hard to say what may improve performance without a better idea of what animations you're performing. Is that something you could elaborate upon? (I would have posted this as a comment, but I am just shy of the required reputation for that)
