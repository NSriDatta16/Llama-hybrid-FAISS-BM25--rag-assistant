I would suggest the first approach you described. That's what I was thinking I would do before getting to your suggestions. I would keep the different fields separate. Build a bag-of-words for each of them and then make that your feature space. That is a very good start I think. recognize however that this will cause a very sparse matrix, not all the words will appear in all the examples. Therefore, I would pass some sort of PCA or LDA to get rid of features that will not contain any useful information, these are the words that appear in every single example ('kPag'). I don't think the unit would give you much information about its compliance. So it should be rejected. Make sure to use a shallow machine learning model, don't try something to fancy because it will over-fit very quickly, 1 due to the small dataset I assume this problem will have and also because of the sparsity of the feature matrix.
