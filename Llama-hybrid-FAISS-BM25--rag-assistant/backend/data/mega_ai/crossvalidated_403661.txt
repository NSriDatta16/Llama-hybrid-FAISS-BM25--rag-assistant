I do want to emphasize something that might get lost in the truly excellent answers that precede mine. The question presents something of a false frame: It should not be " why are weakly informative priors a good idea but rather when are weakly informative priors a good idea. One of the main advantages of the Bayesian approach is that you incorporate prior knowledge. So if there have been ten similar studies that suggest a mean somewhere between 10 and 12, with a very small variance, a Uniform(0, 1000) prior wouldn't be a particularly good idea. Weakly informative priors are good when you genuinely don't have much information to work with; if you have additional information, you should use it!
