Language problem with flash embedding

I have a certain problem. I've uploaded a Chatango chat-box on a site of mine, and it worked fine, until I added to make the Chat-box transparent, because it fits nicer to my site. In that case, the browser would take as a default that my Keyboard is set to English, and so I cannot use some characters, while some others are switched, because I'm otherwise using a Slovenian keyboard setting. How do I make the chat-box transparent without the change in my Keyboard language?
