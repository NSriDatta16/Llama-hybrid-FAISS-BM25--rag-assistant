I don't follow your code, you call your data different things in different places, I don't see your function being used anywhere, etc. Setting that aside, I'm not sure there is a big problem with your model other than the fact that you don't have much data (I gather N = 17 , which is pretty small). I don't think your standard errors would be that problematic if you had a more typical sample size. Moreover, your model seems impressively good to me for a logistic regression model with so few data to work with. The reason neither variable is significant is clearly because they are correlated. This will expand your SEs, but wouldn't be bad if you had more data. As it is, your SEs are about one third larger than they would have been if your data were perfectly uncorrelated: 1/(1-.49^2) # [1] 1.315963 That means the model doesn't know which of the two variables should be given credit for predicting the response. Nonetheless, there is good predictive ability amongst those variables somewhere, as can be seen by their combined significance: 1-pchisq(23.508-14.893, 2) # [1] 0.01346718 As far as bootstrapping goes, it is used to get an estimate of the nature of the sampling distribution that doesn't rely on assumptions about normality. It may help you to read this excellent CV thread: Explaining to laypeople why bootstrapping works .
