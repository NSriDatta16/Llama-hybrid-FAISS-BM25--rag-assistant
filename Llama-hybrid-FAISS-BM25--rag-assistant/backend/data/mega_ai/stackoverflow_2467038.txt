I haven't been able to reproduce this on my system (Java 6u18 on Windows 7). However, I suspect that this is a focus issue, where the mouse events aren't being received by the scrollpane when you use the JFrame version of the JDialog constructor and yet they are being received when you use the JDialog version. Several things you can try here: You can try clicking on the dialog and/or the dialog's scrollbar and see if mouse scrolling affects the scrollbar after you have clicked on it. You can programmatically request focus for the scrollpane by calling requestFocusInWindow() . If requestFocusInWindow() fails, try requestFocus() . ( requestFocus() is discouraged because of platform-specific variations in its behavior, but you appear to have a platform-specific problem.) You can add a FocusListener to your scrollpane to track when it gains and loses focus, which should help you confirm whether this problem has anything to do with focus at all. You can add a MouseWheelListener to your scrollpane to see if each MouseWheelEvent is being received by the scrollpane or not. Like I said, I couldn't reproduce this problem on my system, but these are the things I would try if I were troubleshooting a problem like the one you describe.
