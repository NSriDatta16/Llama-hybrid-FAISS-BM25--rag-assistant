NSInteger is a 32 bit signed integer on iPhone and is therefore limited to values between âˆ’2147483648 and +2147483647. You may get the desired result by using NSUInteger which is an unsigned 32 bit integer able to contain values between 0 and +4294967295. You should however pay attention to the number of runs through the loop so you don't wrap the values.
