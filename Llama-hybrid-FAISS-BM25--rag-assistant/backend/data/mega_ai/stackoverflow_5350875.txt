Unable to restore to 3.1.3 in Xcode organizer

I am using Xcode 3.2.1 and I accidentally updated my iPod to 4.2.1 in iTunes. When I open Xcode > Organizer and try to restore my iPod to 3.1.3. http://img195.imageshack.us/i/screenshot20110318at630.png/ It fails with an error message: Unable to preflight personalized install http://img402.imageshack.us/i/screenshot20110318at633.png/ I am using this software image: iPod2,1_3.1.3_7E18_Restore.ipsw And I am quite sure this image is not corrupted since it comes from pfd.apple.com and I have re-downloaded it for several times. My iPod is a registered device in the Provisioning Portal and I have never jailbroken it before. What do you think the problem is? Thanks in advance.
