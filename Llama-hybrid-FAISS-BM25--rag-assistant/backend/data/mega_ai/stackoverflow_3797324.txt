David Dorward appears to be correct as regards to HTML4, but this seems to be backward-compatibility breaking behaviour, so I would expect HTML5 to describe what browsers actually do. And it seems to. It says this: (my emphasis) The value content attribute gives the default value of the input element. When the value content attribute is added, set, or removed, if the control's dirty value flag is false, the user agent must set the value of the element to the value of the value content attribute , if there is one, or the empty string otherwise, and then run the current value sanitization algorithm, if one is defined. See http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/the-input-element.html#attr-input-value Your scenario doesn't describe anything that would set the dirty value flag prior to the setAttribute call, so I believe that the setAttribute call should set the value property and the browser should send myNewValue not defaultValue. So yes, I think it is a IE9 Beta bug.
