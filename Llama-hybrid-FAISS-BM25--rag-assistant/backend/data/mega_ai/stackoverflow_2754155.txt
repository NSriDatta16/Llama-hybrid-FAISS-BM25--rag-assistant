Language-agnostic term for typed things that need memory

Is there an accepted general term that subsumes the concepts of variables, class instances and arrays? Basically "any typed thing that needs memory". In C++, such a thing is called an object , but I'm looking for a more language-agnostic term. ยง 1.8 The C++ object model 1 The constructs in a C++ program create, destroy, refer to, access, and manipulate objects. An object is a region of storage. [...] An object can have a name (Clause 3). An object has a storage duration (3.7) which influences its lifetime (3.8). An object has a type (3.9).
