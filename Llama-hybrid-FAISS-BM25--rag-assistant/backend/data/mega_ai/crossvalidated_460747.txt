How is multiplication same as correlation

In the following link, the summation of x*e is referred to as (in the following paragraph) correlation of the residuals and error term. https://otexts.com/fpp3/regression-evaluation.html I didn't quite understand how multiplication of 2 variables would be the correlation / covariance of the two variables. Can someone please explain. thank you
