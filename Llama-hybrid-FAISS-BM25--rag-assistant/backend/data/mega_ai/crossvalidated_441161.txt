How to prove P(y|D,x)=âˆ«P(y|f,D,x)P(D,f)df

In my probabilistic machine learning notes, it is stated that: \begin{equation} P(y|D,x)=\int P(y|f,D,x)P(D,f) df \end{equation} However I am unsure how to evaluate the right hand equation to prove this. For context: This would be for a classification with y representing each class. D is your test datum and x is the training data set. f is your predictive function, f:x->y The equation is copied correctly from my notes and it is just the math I am struggling with.
