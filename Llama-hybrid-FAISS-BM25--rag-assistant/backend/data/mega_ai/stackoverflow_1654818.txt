EricB, touches are sent down the responder chain only if they have not been handled. UIScrollView obviously handles all the touch events, so it does not send anything to it's nextResponder. Makes perfect sense to me. What you actually want is to “filter” touch events before they are handled by the scrolling logic of UIScrollView. But note that the responder chain is a wrong tool for this job, exactly because it does not allow to intercept the events before they get handled. Probably the best solution in your case is to subclass UIScrollView, override the touch methods (touchesBegan etc) and manually send the events to the delegate before calling [super touchesXxx] .
