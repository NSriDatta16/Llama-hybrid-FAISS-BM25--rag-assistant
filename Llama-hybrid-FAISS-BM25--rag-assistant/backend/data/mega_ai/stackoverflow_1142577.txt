.NET Client Application Services production settings

I am creating a desktop/client application that will be installed on +/- 5 PCs, that will be transacting with a database on a central server machine. This app requires login authentication which I've in past rolled my own (messy, but it worked). Then I thought it would be great to leverage ASP.NET Membership,Roles,Profile...etc.. After some reading up I came across the .NET Client Application Services which suits my purposes. However I have a few concerns that I am hoping some of you out there can answer: When creating the Application Services Host, the article I've linked to above mentions that in development I should create an ASP.NET Web Service Application. Will this be the same for production? I ask this as this article suggests that I should be using a proper ASP.NET website. But then that begs the question as to whether I should'nt use a normal ASP.NET website with membership, roles, profiles in development to begin with, and then copy across to production? In my Winfroms app, will I still be able to leverage functionality like: " if (!User.IsAuthenticated) " and so forth? If the Name of the central server in the office that the web service app or website resides is say: "MYOFFICE_SERVER", what will the production URL be for client machines to connect to? I have also seen this article . Can this be construed as an alternative, or is the Client Application Services the preferred way to go? Finally, are there any other production-specific settings that I should be aware of? I'm sorry. I realise that these are probably very juvenile questions to ask, but I would sincerely appreciate your help as Im heavily confused!! Thank you.
