The individual terms or "main" effects in a model have a completely different interpretation in the presence of an interaction that they do without the interaction. So comparing their p-values with and without the interaction is inappropriate. In the presence of an interaction, the coefficient on one of the predictors is the effect of that predictor on the outcome when the other predictor is fixed at zero . Zero may not even be a meaningful value for the other predictor, rendering the coefficient on the main effect nonsensical. This phenomenon is observed here , for example. Two get an honest p-value for whether the main effect matters in the presence of an interaction, use an ANOVA test. You can also get a more interpretable coefficient by centering both predictors at their means, in which case the main effect of each predictor is the effect of that predictor when the other predictor is fixed at its mean. You can also compute marginal effects to get the average effect of each predictor, collapsing across the other predictor.
