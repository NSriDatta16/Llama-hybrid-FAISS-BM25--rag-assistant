Can not infer the type in C# , have to set it explicitly?

this is my code: The code worked with the first+second parameters, when I added the 3rd paramter it does not compile anymore, what do I have to change to make it working? /// /// Binds all dataObjects e.g. IPersonList, IDepartmentList, ITopicList... and creates a visual list of elements to display in the ElementTextBox /// /// Type of dataObject in the dataObjects list /// value for the Type specified by the TResult paramter /// entity from database the user wants to show in the ElementTextBox /// The property like FirstName that is shown as the elements text /// The property like SortId that is used to pre-sort the dataObjects so the elements appear in the order before they were saved public void BindElements (IEnumerable dataObjects, Func selectorDisplayMember, Func selectorSortMember) { if (dataObjects != null) { var sortedDataObjects = from d in dataObjects orderby selectorSortMember(d) ascending select d; Paragraph para = new Paragraph(); foreach (T item in dataObjects) { TProperty displayMemberValue = selectorDisplayMember(item); InlineUIContainer uiContainer = ElementList.CreateElementContainer(displayMemberValue); para.Inlines.Add(uiContainer); } FlowDocument flowDoc = new FlowDocument(para); ElementList.Document = flowDoc; } } this worked: ElementUserControl.BindElements(customers, c => c.CustomerId); but when I added the 3rd paramter: ElementUserControl.BindElements(customers, c => c.CustomerId, c => c.SortId); It did not work anymore?
