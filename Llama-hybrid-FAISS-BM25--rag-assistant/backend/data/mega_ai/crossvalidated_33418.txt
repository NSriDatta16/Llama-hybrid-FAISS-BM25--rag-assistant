How do I complete the square with normal likelihood and normal prior?

How do I complete the square from the point I have left off at, and is this correct so far? I have a normal prior for $\beta$ of the form $p(\beta|\sigma^2)\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2V)$, to get: $p(\beta|\sigma^2)=(2\pi\sigma^2V)^\frac{p}{2}\exp[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\beta^T\beta]$ where $\beta^T\beta$ is $\sum\limits_{i=1}^p \beta_i^2$. My likelihood has a normal distribtuion for the data points y of the form $p(y|\beta,\sigma^2)\sim\mathcal{N}(B\beta,\sigma^2I) $ $p(y|\beta,\sigma^2)=(2\pi \sigma^2V)^\frac{n}{2}\exp[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}({\bf y}-{\bf B}{\bf \beta})^T({\bf y}-{\bf B}{\bf \beta})]$ (Note that $\beta$ is a matrix/vector too, \bf does not work.) To get my posterior for $\beta$ I combined the above, took the exponential parts only, and then expanded to get: $\exp[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}({\bf y}^T{\bf y}-{\bf y}^T{\bf B}\beta-\beta{\bf B}^T{\bf y}-\beta^T{\bf B}^T{\bf B}\beta)]\exp[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}({\bf \beta}^T{\bf B})]$. I dropped the $({\bf y}^T{\bf y})$ term, as is not a function of $\beta$. Putting into one expression without the exponential: $-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(-{\bf y}^T{\bf B}\beta-\beta{\bf B}^T{\bf y}-\beta^T{\bf B}^T{\bf B}\beta+{\bf \beta}^T{\bf B})$. I know I need to combine the similar terms and get into the form of the multivariate normal distribution, which is what I am aiming for, but I am unsure how to do this? I probably have to add an extra term to the expression to get it into the correct form? Note: This is not homework, it's a project, but my Bayesian working knowledge is not good at all and so I need to understand the working out. I intend to integrate out the $\beta$ and then the $\sigma^2$ after getting into the multivariate form.
