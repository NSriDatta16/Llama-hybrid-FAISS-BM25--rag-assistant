comparing bipolar scale to unipolar scale

I'm trying to build some surveys and I want to ask the following questions: After 3 weeks, how do you feel about decision to join our company? Very Dissatisfied Moderately Dissatisfied Slightly Dissatisfied Neutral Slightly Satisfied Moderately Satisfied Very Satisfied and How well do you understand the company's vision? Very well Well Somewhat well A little Not at all Question 1 is a bipolar scale, with ratings -3 -> 3 while q2 is a unipolar 1-5. If I wanted to analyze this data and get an "average" rating, it doesn't make sense to me to just do a raw average. Should I focus on just using only bipolar or unipolar or is there a way around my problem?
