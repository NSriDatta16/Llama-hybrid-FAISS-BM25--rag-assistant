Can you choose a binary feature matrix for a binary classification model

This may be a stupid, but, I am new to deep learning (and machine learning for that matter) and I can't seem to find any literature to help with my question. All I can see when Googling many different questions (trying to change keywords to try get a hit on my question) is about binary classification. And also, binary classification where the feature matrix consists of real numbers. I would like to know, is it possible to build a binary classifier with a binary feature matrix? And please can you point me to some literature.
