Notation - stacked vectors

I am trying to self-study Kevin Murphy's book on machine learning. i am trying to be 100% sure that i understand the notation in the book. . I am however struggling to understand what is meant with the line following "similarly, if we...". I read this as a column vector, running verticallly with index j from 1:D (dimensions) and each entry itself being a vector (as the x's are bolded) running with index i from 1:N. However - i am confused - as would this not be a matrix? i am surely not understanding something here - it would be great if someone could be so kind to give an example / visual on this would look in practice.
