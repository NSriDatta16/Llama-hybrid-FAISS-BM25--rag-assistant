Probabilistic inference uses probabilistic models , i.e. models that describe the statistical problems in terms of probability theory and probability distributions. While statistics use probability theory quite heavily, you cannot say that those two disciplines are the same thing (check the discussion in this thread ). Notice that many statistical and machine learning methods do not explicitly use probability theory to define the problems, e.g. many clustering algorithms, or classification methods that work by minimizing some loss function etc. But the distinction is not that straightforward, take as example approximate Bayesian computation -- theoretically it is based on Bayesian (probabilistic!) inference, but it deals with cases where we do not have likelihood function, so instead of it we use a distance measure.
