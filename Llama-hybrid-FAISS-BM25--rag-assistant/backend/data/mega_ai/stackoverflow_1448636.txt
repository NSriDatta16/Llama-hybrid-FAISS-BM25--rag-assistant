(Caveat: I haven't tried this.) If you can leverage a PB-generated COM object under ASP.NET, you can create a COM object that retrieves the DataWindow and then get the HTML representation of the report (Describe ("DataWindow.data.html")), then merge that into an HTML page in scripting. There is a code sample that ships with PB9 called WebDW that was originally intended to be a starting point for people using this technology, but I heard of many people that have used this component straight out of the box. There are a lot of settings that control what the resulting HTML looks like, so you should browse the help files for the HTMLGen properties. Note that there are some limitations to this, like RTF DataWindows and (IIRC) composites. This is not the right code to use, but this code sample gives you a high level overview. Good luck, Terry.
