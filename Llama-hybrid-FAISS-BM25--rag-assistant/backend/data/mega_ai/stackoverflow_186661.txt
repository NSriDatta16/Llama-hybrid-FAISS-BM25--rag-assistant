You need to use the SQL Server Agent, installed as part of SQL Server. This is the background service that's responsible for running scheduled maintenance and backup tasks. Expand the SQL Server Agent node in SQL Server Management Studio, you should see a tree node called "Jobs" Right-clicking this will give you the option to add a new job. Jobs consist of a series of steps to be executed in order, and when you add a new step to your job, you can choose various types of step, including "Transact-SQL Script" Create a new job, add a single T-SQL step, put the queries that you want to run into the step properties, and then use the "Schedule" option in the Job properties to create a recurring schedule that'll run the job every 24 hours (or whenever).
