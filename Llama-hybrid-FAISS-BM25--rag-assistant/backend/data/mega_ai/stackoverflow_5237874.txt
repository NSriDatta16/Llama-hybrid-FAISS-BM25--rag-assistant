Yes, you can override it in another module. Magento combines all XML files into one large XML tree, so individual files are not a problem. You are also right that this isn't really worth an entire module. In projects I complete, it's common to have a project-specific module for odds and ends like this. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
