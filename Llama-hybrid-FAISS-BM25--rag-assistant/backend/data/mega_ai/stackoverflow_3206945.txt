Here's a C++ implementation, but I think the logic is obvious. Just ask if you don't understand something. void letterChain(string stack[5], int k, const vector &words) { if ( k == 5 ) // have 5 words, print solution { for ( int i = 0; i words; words.push_back("CAT"); words.push_back("TOW"); words.push_back("WAR"); words.push_back("RAD"); words.push_back("DOG"); words.push_back("GOD"); words.push_back("RAG"); words.push_back("RAR"); string stack[5]; letterChain(stack, 0, words); } CAT TOW WAR RAD DOG CAT TOW WAR RAG GOD CAT TOW WAR RAR RAD CAT TOW WAR RAR RAG TOW WAR RAD DOG GOD TOW WAR RAG GOD DOG TOW WAR RAR RAD DOG TOW WAR RAR RAG GOD WAR RAR RAD DOG GOD WAR RAR RAG GOD DOG If you can only use a word as many times as it appears in the list, then just use a counting vector subtract the count of that word every time you use it.
