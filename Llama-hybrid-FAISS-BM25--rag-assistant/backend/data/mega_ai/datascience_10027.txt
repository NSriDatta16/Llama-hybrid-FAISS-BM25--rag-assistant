ARIMAX v. ARX Time Series Modeling

I need to build a time series model with explanatory variables, and ARIMAX seems to be the one that comes up most frequently in practice, based on my survey of related work. I know ARX solves a similar problem, but I'm having trouble wrapping my mind around the practical differences in what an ARX representation of my data would have compared with an ARIMAX approach. I know ARX lacks the moving average component, but I'm curious whether anyone can point me toward some best practice for choosing one approach over the other. Are there certain characteristics in my data I should look for to make an informed decision?
