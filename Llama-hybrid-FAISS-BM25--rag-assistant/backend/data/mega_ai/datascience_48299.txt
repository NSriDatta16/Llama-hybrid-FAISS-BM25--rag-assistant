I would say it is not true as Random forests which are made up of decision trees does perform feature selection but they do not perform feature engineering (feature selection is different from feature engineering). Decision trees use a metric called Information gain (which is total entropy minus the weighted entropy) as per which useful features are separated from bad features. Simply to say whichever feature exhibit the highest information gain on this iteration is chosen as the node on which the tree on this iteration is split or you can say which feature reduces the entropy(aka randomness) the most in this iteration is chosen as the node upon which the tree is split on this iteration. So if you data is text, trees are split upon words. If your data is real valued numbers, tree is split upon that. Hope it helps For more details check this
