Years ago I took a look at a program (on the Acorn Archimedes) that was protected with a complex system of encryption (just to see how it was done and learn from it). It was very cleverly done, with the decryption code itself used as part of the decryption key so that any attempt to mess with it would break the decryption and thus leave you with garbage in memory. After 2 days trying to work out how it was done and how you could get around it, a friend visited. Using an operating system tool (a click and a drag to max out the RMA memory allocaton) he limited the available RAM for the process to run in to just slightly larger than the .exe's size. Then he ran it. Immediately after decrypting itself it tried to allocate memory, failed, and crashed. He then saved the decrypted program from memory. Total crack time: about 2 minutes, using only a mouse drag and a command line save command. I learned from this that it isn't worth putting too much time and effort into protecting your software - if someone wants to crack it they will, and probably they'll do it by a simple means that never occurred to you. (Disclaimer: We had both bought legal copies of this program, and never used the cracked code in any way. It truly was just an intellectual programming exercise)
