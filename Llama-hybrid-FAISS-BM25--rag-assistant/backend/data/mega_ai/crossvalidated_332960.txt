What is variable importance?

Searching this site, I see over 1,000 posts triggered by the search term "variable importance", mostly machine learning related. However, I've never encountered the definition before. Is it a term that applies to a specific (set of) model(s)? If so, what does it measure and how is it measured? Furthermore, does it mean "importance" in any broader set of criteria than a statistical result?
