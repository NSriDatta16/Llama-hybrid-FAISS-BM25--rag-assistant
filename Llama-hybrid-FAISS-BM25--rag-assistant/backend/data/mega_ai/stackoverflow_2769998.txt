Current thoughts: Identify the outermost part of the stack associated with the obsolete functionality: the binary script calling it, or the unit tests calling it. Look for methods that are only called by methods associated with the obsolete functionality. I often use git grep for this. In theory, running mutation testing and looking for code that used to be mutation resistant when the old test suite applied, but is now mutation prone might help. It only helps if your code was well-tested in the first place! (Or you can use code coverage tools such as rcov rather than mutation testing) Running test suites will ensure you haven't removed anything you shouldn't have! Using autotest can save you time if you're constantly running tests. If your code was well-structured, it should be easier to find related methods that need to be removed.
