There is no such meta-syntax in the Haskell standard, but there is in GHC. You can make almost any notation you want using the GHC "quasi-quotation" facilities (which are different from GHC's "Template Haskell" facility). The GHC user guide on this is quite short, and mainly points to haskell wiki page on Quasiquotation and the implementor's home page , both of these point to the original publication: "Why Itâ€™s Nice to be Quoted: Quasiquoting for Haskell" . People have used quasi-quotation for embedding XML syntax, regular expressions, special string and text forms, and in "JMacro is a library for the programmatic generation of Javascript code."
