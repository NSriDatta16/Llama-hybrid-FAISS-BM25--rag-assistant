Drag and drop on lattice grid- flex

I am trying to build a visual simple electric circuitry model. Towards that a) I am looking to build a drag & drop functionality, whereby I have items (wires, resistors, battery) that can be dragged and dropped on screen where I have a 10 x10 grid- the dropped items will take line positions on the grid based on where they fall. Should I do this using the mouseX, mouseY and connect them to grid points they fall closest to? The typical drag and drop examples I have seen, don't concern themselves with exact position in destination- which is obviously important here Thanks for pointers...
