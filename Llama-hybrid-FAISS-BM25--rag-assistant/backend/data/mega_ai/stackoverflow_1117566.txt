When you shrink your bitmap image you have a couple of choices. You can do it the slow way where you "blur and subsample" the full sized image so that places where you have one pixel and the source image had 2+ pixels, the new pixel becomes the average. If you don't do that you get a lot faster perforamce, but your image won't be as smooth as you might want. StretchDIBits might be averaging pixels in 2D, meaning that it looks to a 4+ pixel block from the old image to get the average color of the new pixel. If that's the case you can write your own 1D averaging that just averages the pixels same scanline of the old image to get the new pixel. A windows api guru might know a cool option to DrawDIBDraw that does something like this.
