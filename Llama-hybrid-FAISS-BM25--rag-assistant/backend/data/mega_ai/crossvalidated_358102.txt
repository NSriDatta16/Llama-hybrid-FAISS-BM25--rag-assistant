How to compare AIC values from two Bayesian posteriors

I have a simple question about model comparison: Let's say you fit two models using MCMC: Model A and model B, where model B is model A minus one parameter. You want to assess whether dropping the parameter improves the model fit. You calculate the likelihood and AIC for each MCMC sample. So you end up with a distribution of AIC values for each model (e.g., if you take 10,000 MCMC samples for each model, then you have 10,000 AIC values from the posterior for each model). How do I compare the AIC distributions? I know that I could compare means, medians, or do other simple tests, but I don't want to guess wrong. I've seen libraries such as AICcmodavg that automate model comparison, but my model is complicated enough that I'll probably have to write this by hand, and I'm embarrassed to say that I don't know what goes on behind the curtain.
