Binary Data in JSON String. Something better than Base64

The JSON format natively doesn't support binary data. The binary data has to be escaped so that it can be placed into a string element (i.e. zero or more Unicode chars in double quotes using backslash escapes) in JSON. An obvious method to escape binary data is to use Base64. However, Base64 has a high processing overhead. Also it expands 3 bytes into 4 characters which leads to an increased data size by around 33%. One use case for this is the v0.8 draft of the CDMI cloud storage API specification . You create data objects via a REST-Webservice using JSON, e.g. PUT /MyContainer/BinaryObject HTTP/1.1 Host: cloud.example.com Accept: application/vnd.org.snia.cdmi.dataobject+json Content-Type: application/vnd.org.snia.cdmi.dataobject+json X-CDMI-Specification-Version: 1.0 { "mimetype" : "application/octet-stream", "metadata" : [ ], "value" : "TWFuIGlzIGRpc3Rpbmd1aXNoZWQsIG5vdCBvbmx5IGJ5IGhpcyByZWFzb24sIGJ1dCBieSB0aGlz IHNpbmd1bGFyIHBhc3Npb24gZnJvbSBvdGhlciBhbmltYWxzLCB3aGljaCBpcyBhIGx1c3Qgb2Yg dGhlIG1pbmQsIHRoYXQgYnkgYSBwZXJzZXZlcmFuY2Ugb2YgZGVsaWdodCBpbiB0aGUgY29udGlu dWVkIGFuZCBpbmRlZmF0aWdhYmxlIGdlbmVyYXRpb24gb2Yga25vd2xlZGdlLCBleGNlZWRzIHRo ZSBzaG9ydCB2ZWhlbWVuY2Ugb2YgYW55IGNhcm5hbCBwbGVhc3VyZS4=", } Are there better ways and standard methods to encode binary data into JSON strings?
