Using the binomial distribution to identify chance-level responses

I have a subject who was giving 2-alternative forced choice responses for a task consisting of 80 trials. For each trial, there was a 50% chance for each of the two options to be correct. This means chance-level responding would, overall, be linked to a 50% mean accuracy across all trials. But since no subject's average accuracy will typically be precisely 50%, I am wondering what statistical concept allows me decide on a cut-off value for how far from 50% the mean accuracy would have to be to decide the subject was not responding randomly. I know the binomial distribution can be used to model such responses, but I am not sure at which outcome I should look at. For instance, this page computes the binomial and cumulative probabilities associated with an experimental session of a certain Probability of success on a single trial Number of trials Number of successes (x) My subject responded correctly on 51 out of the 80 trials, i.e. 63.75% correct. This gives a Cumulative Probability of P(X Thanks!
