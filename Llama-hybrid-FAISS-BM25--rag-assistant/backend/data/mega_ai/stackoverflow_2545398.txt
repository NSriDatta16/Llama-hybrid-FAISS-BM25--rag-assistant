Your database is not normalized so you should start by changing the heirarchy table to, for example: OrganizationId Parent 1 NULL 2 1 3 1 4 3 To query this you might need to use recursive queries. This is difficult (but not impossible) using LINQ, so you might instead prefer to create a parameterized stored procedure using a recursive CTE and put the query there.
