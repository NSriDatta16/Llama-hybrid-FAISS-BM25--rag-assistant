If I do the same experiment many times then does a 95% credible interval mean 95% of the time the true value lies within that range?

Its common misinterpretation of a 95% confidence interval to say that that 95% of the time the true value lies within that interval. However, in Bayesian statistics, the 95% credible interval contains 95% of the probability from the probability density function. And if I repeat the experiment many times, I'm wondering if I can learn something about my prior? So say I do an experiment to measure a parameter 100 times and I know the true value for each experiment. Then I calculate the credible interval for each experiment. Should expect 95% of the time the credible interval contains the true value? And if its lower, say only 85% of the time the credible interval contains the true parameter, then perhaps the prior is strongly influencing the results and should be changed?
