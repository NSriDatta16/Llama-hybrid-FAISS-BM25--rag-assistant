The Observer pattern (a subset of the publish/subscribe pattern) is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems. This is one of the Gang of Four 's behavioral design-patterns , first published in Gamma et al.'s book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".
