How to calculate composite score with a 2-factor scale

Suppose I have a scale with four items meant to measure, say, happiness. I ran a confirmatory factor analysis and the model fits well with two factors and let's say that the two factors are 1) positive affect and 2) energy. Putting all four items into a standard reliability analysis produces a Cronbach's alpha that is more than acceptable at 0.80. If I wanted to use happiness as a predictor or outcome variable in a linear regression, is it adequate to still just average the four items into one composite score despite it consisting of two factors in the CFA?
