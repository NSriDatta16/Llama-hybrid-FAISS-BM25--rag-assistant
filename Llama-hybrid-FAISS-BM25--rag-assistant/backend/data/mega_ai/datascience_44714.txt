The two answers you have been provided make sense and you should definitely take their advice. But, those make for a long road ahead of you, so I'm going to go the other way with my answer and give you some things you could be doing in the short-term. If you are going to decide to dedicate your data science studies to image recognition (and computer vision in general) then you should get used to images as being "data". That can be a tough mental shift for people new to the industry, so you might as well start right away. Settle on one of the languages you mentioned (I'd recommend Python) and start to manipulate images (any images). Can you take an image apart? Put it back together? Flip it? Color it? Create an augmentation set from them? Transform the data to binary representations? Create single arrays from any number of image sizes? Do you know how to use one of the pre-processing libraries (like the one that ships with Keras) or do you want to do it on your own? You should have answers to all of these questions at some point during your studies and these are certainly things you can start right away.
