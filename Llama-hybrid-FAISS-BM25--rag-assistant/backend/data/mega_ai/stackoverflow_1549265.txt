Java How do you find a complexity class for algorithms?

I have a question to find a complexity class estimate of a algorithm. The question gives recorded times for an algorithm. So, do I just average out the times based on how it was computed? Sorry, I missed a part. ok, so it recorded time like N = 100, Algorithm = 300, next N = 200, Algorithm = 604, next N = 400 Algorithm = 1196, next N = 800 Algorithm 2395. So, do i calculate like 300/100, and 604/200 and find the average. Is that how I'm supposed to estimate the complexity class for the algorithm?
