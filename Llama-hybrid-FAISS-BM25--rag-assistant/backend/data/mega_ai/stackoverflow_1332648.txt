Updated (after 10+ years!): Yes! It's possible to do this more efficiently now, with widespread practical browser support, using the nth-child selector. HTML: foo 1 bar 1 baz 1 bap 1 foo 2 bar 2 baz 2 bap 2 CSS: table td { width: 20em; border: 1px solid black; } table td:nth-child(3) { text-align: end; } https://jsfiddle.net/mv83qszL/ Previously, it was not possible to do this, because browser support used to be inconsistent and hit-or-miss, especially with regard to newer CSS features. This made it impossible to use more elegant, efficient solutions -- and required lots of repetitive markup and class definitions in order to get consistent results across the audience's browser space.
