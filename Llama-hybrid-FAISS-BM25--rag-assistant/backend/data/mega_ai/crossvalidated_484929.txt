The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution defined on the set $\mathbb N$ of natural numbers $0,1,2,\dots$ . We also say that $\mathbb N$ is the support of the Poisson distribution. This distribution is often used to model experiments whose outcomes represent counts. If $X$ is a random variable following a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda$ then for a natural number $k \in \mathbb N$ , $$ \mathbb P(X=k) = e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^k}{k!}. $$ It can be shown that the sum $X+Y$ of two independent Poisson-distributed variables $X,Y$ still follows a Poisson distribution. Now, assume that you have $N$ independent random variables $X_1, \dots, X_N$ each of them following a Poisson distribution. Their sum $X_1+ \dots + X_N$ will be a natural number and by an induction reasonment we can show that $X_1+ \dots + X_N$ also follows a Poisson-distribution. However their average, $\frac{X_1 + \dots + X_N}{N}$ , does not need to be a natural number. For example if $N=3$ and $X_1 = 1, X_2 = 0, X_3 = 7$ then $\frac{X_1 +X_2 + X_3}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67.$ Thus the average of Poisson random variables can take non-integer values (but it also can take integer values) which is against the definition of a Poisson distribution. More precisely, the support of the average is not $\mathbb N$ but rather belongs to $\mathbb Q$ the set of rational numbers (which contains $\mathbb N$ ). This means that the average can't (by definition) follow a Poisson distribution. In the same spirit, the statement above "It can be shown that the sum $X+Y$ of two independent Poisson-distributed variables $X,Y$ still follows a Poisson distribution" is not true if $X$ and $Y$ are not independent anymore. Take for example $Y=X$ (thus $X$ and $Y$ are not independent) then the sum $X+Y=2X$ only takes even values and thus $\mathbb P(2X=1) = \mathbb P(2X=3) = \dots = 0$ which is not in agreement with the definition of a Poisson distribution since the quantity $e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^k}{k!}$ is strictly greater than $0$ for all natural numbers $k$ . I hope this is clear enough to help.
