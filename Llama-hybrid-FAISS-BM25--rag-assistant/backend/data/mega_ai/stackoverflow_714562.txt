To be more specific about your question, yes there are other problems with using GUIDs as primary keys in databases: http://www.sqlskills.com/BLOGS/KIMBERLY/post/GUIDs-as-PRIMARY-KEYs-andor-the-clustering-key.aspx The problem is not so much with using a GUID as primary key, its using a non-sequential GUID as the clustered index for a table. The takeaway here is to either use other fields as the clustered index, or use a sequential GUID to avoid this fragmentation.
