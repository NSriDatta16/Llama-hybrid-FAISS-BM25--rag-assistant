Univariate vs multivariate analysis (p-value)

So I have been looking through some literature/articles, and something I often come across is, that when they do some kind of analysis it's often univariate and multivariate analysis on for example biochemical failure after 5 years. Typically they look at some number of variables (let's say 10), then they run the analysis and a p-value is presented, and sometimes also a hazard ratio. I am just trying to figure out how this is done exactly ? Or maybe it's very different, or not very common ? Like, I understand univariate. You test one independent variable against your dependent variable, and see if they are correlated in some way. But how would a multivariate analysis work ? Do one just test all variables at the same time in a linear regression or logistic regression, and that's that ? Or what is the typical approach ? Some form of step-wise selection maybe ?
