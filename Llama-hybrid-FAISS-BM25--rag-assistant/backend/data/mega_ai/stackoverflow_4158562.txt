how to plot ~~200k of data pairs on a 2D chart ? Is it possible with php?

i have a csv file with data like this: -0.0889 4.53 -0.0449 2.25 -0.013 -3 0.0304 -4.28 0.0669 -2.03 0.1332 -1.72 And it goes on and on. I need a solution to plot it as a not connected points on simple 2D chart and save it as png file to see if data is organized by a clearly visible pattern.
