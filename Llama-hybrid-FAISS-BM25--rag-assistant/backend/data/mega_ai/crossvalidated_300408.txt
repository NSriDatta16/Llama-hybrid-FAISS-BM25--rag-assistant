Determine sample size of a time series with seasonal variation

I have a time series with daily frequency that has a seasonal pattern, with higher values in the summer and lower values in the winter. To create a sample of the data for estimating the mean, median and standard deviation, I'm calculating the sample size using $n = 4\sigma^2/M^2$ with for $M=\sigma^2/10$. I estimated $\sigma^2$ from the history of a similar process. How can I verify if the seasonal aspect and autocorrelation are preserved in the sample, if I can't access the original time series? EDIT : edited the question to (hopefully) make it more clear.
