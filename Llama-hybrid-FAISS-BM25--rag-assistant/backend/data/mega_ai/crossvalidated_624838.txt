In that paper, $x_{t-1}$ the previous latent variable in the sequence. Eq. (1) specifies a factored distribution over the entire sequence: it's a Markov chain. They're modeling the backward direction in the chain: each element depends only on its successor. In other words, they're modeling the answer to the question: "What's the state of the past ( $x_{t-1}$ ), given the current state of the world ( $x_t$ )?"
