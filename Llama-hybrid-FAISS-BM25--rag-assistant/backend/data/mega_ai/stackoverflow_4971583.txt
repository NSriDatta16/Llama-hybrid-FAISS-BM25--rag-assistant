For registering DLLs, it is best to avoid self-registration. We use the HEAT command to generate a WiX fragment which does the registration for us. Use heat file myfile.dll -o myfile.wxs The advantage of this is that the registry entries are installed and removed correctly and there are no problems with whether the file has been installed or not at the time the registration is done.
