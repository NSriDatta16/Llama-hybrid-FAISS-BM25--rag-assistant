a few notes about what you've described :) 1) AdamO is correct that once you calculate the statistic of interest from the weighted NHANES data set, that's the survey's estimate of the population..and if you have a comparison statistic also at the population level, you can just say "yes" or "no" RE whether your MSA's results are inside the nhanes confidence interval. that is: "the BMI of sixth graders in our MSA are/are not statistically significantly different from the average as computed from a nationwide sample." here's some easy-to-use scripts to work with nhanes in the R language 2) if BMI is your most important item, doing what you've described is much better done with the "sample child" component of the national health interview survey than with nhanes. the two-year nhanes file has about 200 records for 11 year olds. using the four-year weights means you've got a weird sample population of 400 11 year olds across the survey years 2007-2010. the 2012 nhis file is already available, and has 600+ respondents who are 11 years old. here's the page with easy-to-use scripts to work with nhis ..and you specifically should modify this script to work with the samchild (instead of samadult ) file on the 2012 data sets.
