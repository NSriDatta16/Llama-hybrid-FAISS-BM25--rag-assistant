You are right in the sense that in Bayesian statistics the space of parameters $\Theta$ is endowed with the structure of a probability space $(\Theta, \mathcal{A},\pi)$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\sigma$ -algebra and $\pi$ a probability (prior) so it make sense to ask questions of the form $$ B\in \mathcal{A},\quad \int_B f(\theta)\pi(d\theta) $$ Where this would not make sense in a frequentist setting.
