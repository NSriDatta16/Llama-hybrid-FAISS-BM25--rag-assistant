Assuming you are referring to full screen as in 'use the whole monitor': Calling stage.displayState = StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN; will set your flash movie to full screen mode (provided that the allowFullScreen parameter has been set to true in the object/embed tags of the embedding html page). Scale up the hbox (change its width/height) so that it occupies the whole space available.
