Interface Builder vs. What's Displayed on iPhone

Hello and thanks for giving this question a gander. It seems that PNG files that I drag/drop into IB do not display in the same manner that they are shown in the iPhone simulator. What gives? For example, if I want to drop in a PNG with rounded corners, IB shows hard rectangular corners but when I build to the simulator, I see the rounded edges. I don't understand the purpose of IB for UI if I can't accurately reflect what will be shown for that view.
