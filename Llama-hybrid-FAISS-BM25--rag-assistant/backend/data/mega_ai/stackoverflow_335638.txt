I need more detail on the problem. If you cannot store the real value of the integers but instead an approximation, that means you are going to reduce (throw away) some of the data (detail), correct? I think you are looking for a hash, which can be an artform in itself. For example say you have 32 bit values, one hash would be to take the 4 bytes and xor them together, this would result in a single 8 bit value, reducing your storage by a factor of 4 but also reducing the real value of original data. Typically you could/would go further and perhaps and only use a few of those 8 bits , say the lower 4 and reduce the value further. I think my real problem is either you need the data or you dont, if you need the data you need to compress it or find more memory to store it. If you dont, then use a hash of some sort to reduce the number of bits until you reach the amount of memory you have for storage.
