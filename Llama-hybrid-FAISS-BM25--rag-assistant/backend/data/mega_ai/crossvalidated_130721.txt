What norm of the reconstruction error is minimized by the low-rank approximation matrix obtained with PCA?

Given a PCA (or SVD) approximation of matrix $X$ with a matrix $\hat X$, we know that $\hat X$ is the best low-rank approximation of $X$. Is this according to the induced $\parallel \cdot \parallel_2$ norm (i.e. the largest eigenvalue norm) or according to the Frobenius $\parallel \cdot \parallel_F$ norm ?
