Element rotation and resizing in IE (jQuery UI + CSS)

I've got a script that performs rotation in all modern browsers using jQuery UI and CSS transform property. But I doesn't work in IE. I've managed to make it rotates as expected (around it's center) but I fails when I resize it again. You can find an example in here http://vremenno.net/examples/jquery-ui-rotation/ If someone could make the same thing for IE (resizing, rotating and dragging) using this (jQuery UI + filter for IE) or another way (raphael js, canvas, etc.) I could also pay for it. Thanks in advance.
