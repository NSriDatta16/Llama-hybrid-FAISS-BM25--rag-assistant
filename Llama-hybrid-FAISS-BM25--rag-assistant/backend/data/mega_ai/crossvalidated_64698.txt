See: By construction, the algorithm does not depend on the normalization constant, since what matters is the ratio of the pdf's. The variation of the algorithm in which the proposal pdf $q()$ is not symmetric is due to Hasting (1970) and for this reason the algorithm is often also called Metropolis-Hasting. Moreover, what has been described here is the global Metropolis algorithm, in contrast to the local one, in which a cycle affects only one component of ${\bf x}$. The Wikipedia article is a good complementary read. As you can see, the Metropolis also has a "correction ratio" but, as mentioned above, Hastings introduced a modification that allows for non-symmetric proposal distributions. The Metropolis algorithm is implemented in the R package mcmc under the command metrop() .
