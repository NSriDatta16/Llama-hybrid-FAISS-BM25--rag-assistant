It seems you are using your fit outside of the expected range. You don't want to extrapolate. Ever. Period. End of story. Anything extrapolated can not be trusted. The extrapolation results will depend on the coefficients you get when you fit and the functional form of the fit (your model). If your extrapolated data do not behave this way, you will get nonsense (or something unexplainable-- as you have seen) Please see: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772415821000110 Section I shows how one can be tricked into thinking their training data cover their desired outcomes. Section II gives an easy algorithm for people to use to quickly determine if their data point is extrapolated and how much of the possible outcome space is an extrapolation (based on training data). Section III shows a great example of a great neural network fit, but what happens when you use it as a prediction and the inputs are out of range. Section IV shows how much data you actually need to fit a deep neural network. I would focus on sections III and IV. Do not trust if out of range!
