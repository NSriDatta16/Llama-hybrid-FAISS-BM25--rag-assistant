How to update Android contact company?

I recently created a Sync adapter for my app, It will sync contacts I am getting via a web request with the contacts in the phone. I have no problem adding the contact, however I cannot get the contact information to correctly update when contact information has changed. For example the Company Name field on the contact. Here is some example queries I have tried that did not work or only partially worked(ie - some contacts updated but not correctly): ContentValues values = new ContentValues(); values.put(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Organization.COMPANY, "New Company"); context.getContentResolver().update(Uri.parse("content://com.android.contacts/data/"), values, BaseColumns._ID + "=?", new String[] { String.valueOf(id) } ); I have also tried doing this in batch as suggested by the android documentation: builder = ContentProviderOperation .newUpdate(ContactsContract.Data.CONTENT_URI); builder.withSelection(BaseColumns._ID + " =?", new String[]{String.valueOf(id)}); builder.withValue( ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Organization.COMPANY, "New Company Name!"); operationList.add(builder.build()); I have read the ContactContracts Documentation and originally was following this tutorial . I also checked into the AuthenticatorActivity example in the api's to no avail. Any help is greatly appreciated.
