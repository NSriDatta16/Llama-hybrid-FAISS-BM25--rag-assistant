This looks like a good start. A couple of points: The credits would be autogenerated by the system at the begining of the year, and debits would be created by employees. Should there be a field to indicate who/what created the transaction? Do you have a mechanism for indicating what kind of time off is requested? I don't know what your company is like but some companies treat vacation and sick time differently. Then there's also caregiver time, time off for compassion grounds (such as a relative dies), time off for civic and statutory holidays, time off for religions holidays, time off for.... well you get the idea. Maybe you want different types of time off to be worth different amounts of credit. Some organizations do that. Do you plan to track these different time-off codes as well? Is it something that you should plan for if you think it will be an issue in the future?
