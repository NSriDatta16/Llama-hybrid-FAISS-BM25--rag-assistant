jQuery selectors performance

I know I'm just being OCD about a few milliseconds worth of performance time, but I was just wondering why the following is true for me. It seems goes against my logic. I currently have a div that has fades out the image inside on hover: $('div.someclass').hover(function() { $(this).children('img').fadeOut(function(){ // do something }); }, function() { // do something }); After some testing, (looping through selectors 1000 times, taking the average of 9 tests) I have used 3 different selectors and concluded that the speed is in this order: $(this).children('img') runs the fastest -avg about 400ms; $('img', this) - avg about 900ms; and $(this).find('img') runs the slowest - avg about 1000ms This goes against the logic that having two function calls would be slower than one. Plus, I have read that internally, jQuery converts the second case to the third case so would the third case be slower?. Any thoughts?
