Your data set not only needs differencing and a log transform BUT also needs to incorporate a marginally significant level shift detectable at 1974/1 period 181 . ARIMA model building/identification should be done in concert with the empirical identification of pulses, level shifts , seasonal pulses and local time trends as has been smartly pointed out by @AdamO not simply assuming no latent deterministic structure Interrupted Time Series Analysis - ARIMAX for High Frequency Biological Data? ..... "The correlograms (acf/pacf) should be calculated from residuals using a model that controls for intervention administration, otherwise the intervention effects are taken to be Gaussian noise, underestimating the actual autoregressive effect." A useful model is here and here with residual acf here
