Your naming convention for ant targets should be very similar to the naming convention for Java methods: namely, simple and descriptive of what the target does. Here's an excerpt from the Sun standard for method naming : Naming a Method Although a method name can be any legal identifier, code conventions restrict method names. By convention, method names should be a verb in lowercase or a multi-word name that begins with a verb in lowercase, followed by adjectives, nouns, etc. In multi-word names, the first letter of each of the second and following words should be capitalized. Here are some examples: run runFast getBackground getFinalData compareTo setX isEmpty Probably the biggest difference is the style for ant targets, which should be all lower cased letters with words separated by dashes. For example, the following targets seem appropriate to me: run-all-tests build clean test-and-release deploy run-code-coverage-metrics In the end, try to use the same good judgment you use when naming methods. If your targets are clear, descriptive, and easy to understand, you are in good shape. For more detailed information on the topic, check out The Elements of Ant Style on the Ant wiki.
