The approach that you have taken is reasonable. If you are new to forecasting, then I would recommend following books: Forecasting methods and applications by Makridakis, Wheelright and Hyndman Forecasting: Principles and practice by Hyndman and Athana­sopou­los. The first book is a classic which I strongly recommend. The second book is an open source book which you can refer for forecasting methods and how it is applied using R open source software package forecast . Both the books provide good background on the methods that I have used. If you are serious about forecasting, then I would recommend Principles of Forecasting by Armstrong which is collection of tremendous amount of research in forecasting that a practitioners might find it very helpful. Coming to your specific example on coil, it reminds me of a concept of forecastability which most textbooks often ignore. Some series such as your series simply cannot be forecasted because it is pattern less as it doesn't exhibit trend or seasonal patters or any systematic variation. In that case I would categorize a series as less forecastable. Before venturing into extrapolation methods, I would look at the data and ask the question, is my series forecastable?In this specific example, a simple extrapolation such as random walk forecast which uses the last value of the forecast has been found to be most accurate. Also one additional comment about neural network: Neural networks are notoriously know to fail in empirical competitions . I would try traditional statitical methods for time series before attempting to use neural networks for time series forecasting tasks. I attempted to model your data in R's forecast package , hopefully the comments are self explanatory. coil Using MAE on the hold out data, I would choose ARIMA for short term forecast (1 - 12 months). for long term, I would rely on random walk forecast. Please note that ARIMA picked a random walk model with drift (0,1,0)+drift which tends to be much more accurate than pure random walk model in these type of problems specifically short term. See below chart. This is based on the accuracy function as shown in the above code. Specific answers to your specific questions: Also one question I had was, before passing to ARIMA or neural net should I smooth the data? If yes, using what? No, Forecasting methods naturally smooths your data to fit model. The data shows both Seasonality and trend. The above data doesnt show trend or seasonality. If you determine that the data exhibits seasonality and trend, then choose an appropriate method. Practical Tips to improve accuracy: Combine variety of forecasting methods: - You could try using non extrapolation methods such as forecasting by analogy , judgmental forecasting or other techniques and combine them with your statitical methods to provide accurate predictions. See this article for benefits of combining. I tried combining the above 5 methods, but the prediction were not accurate as individual methods, one possible reason is that individual forecast are similar. You reap the benefits of combining forecast when you combine diverse methods such as statistical and judgmental forecasts. Detect and Understand Outliers: - Real world data is filled with outliers. Identify and appropriately treat outliers in time series. Recommend reading this post . In looking at your coil data, is the drop prior to 2009 is an outlier ?? Edit The data appears to be following some type of macro economic trends. My guess is the downward trend seen before 2009 follows slump in economy seen between 2008 - 2009 and start to pick up post 2009. If this is the case, then I would all together avoid using any extrapolation methods and instead rely on sound theory on how these economic trends behave such as the one referenced by @GraemeWalsh. Hope this helps
