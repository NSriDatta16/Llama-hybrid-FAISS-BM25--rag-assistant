Is it possible to conditionally "use bigint" with Perl?

I know I can conditionally use a module in Perl but what about the "pragmas"? My tests have shown that use bigint can be much slower than normal math in Perl and I only need it to handle 64-bit integers so I only want to use it when Perl wasn't built with 64-bit integer support, which I also know how to check for using the Config module. I tried various things with eval and BEGIN blocks but couldn't work out a way to conditionally use bigint. I know I can use Math::BigInt but then I can't use a single codepath for both the bigint and 64-bit cases.
