Check your code again. You're using StringToHGlobalAuto to create the string (likely ending up with Unicode). Then, you're calling PtrToStringAnsi, which is not using unicode. If you can't get this solution working, there are several options. You can read about them by looking for IPC (InterProcess Communication.) One method I've used, since it was quick and easy, is to create a well-known file with the needed content. You lock use of that file with named events, and tell the "owner" app that the file has changed by setting another named event. The "owner" checkes the event occasionally, or launches a worker thread to watch for it. Again, IPC has many flavors, if these ideas don't work, keep looking.
