Reinforcement learning by Sutton, Tic tac toe self play

I just started Sutton and Barto's book, Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction , and am curious as to how to think about the answer to Exercise 1.1: Self-Play . Suppose, instead of playing against a random opponent, the reinforcement learning algorithm described above played against itself. What do you think would happen in this case? Would it learn a different way of playing? One could also think of the following related sub-questions, but they haven't made my thoughts any clearer. Would removing the random part of the learning change the situation- i.e. always following optimal policy and not exploring? How would it depend on who is the first mover?
