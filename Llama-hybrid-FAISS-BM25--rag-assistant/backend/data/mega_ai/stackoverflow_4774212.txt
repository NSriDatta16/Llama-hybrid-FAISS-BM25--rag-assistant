I need to keep track of the location of various agents, the amount of resources at different points, and calculate the direction that agents will be moving in based on certain rules. Sounds like a graph to to me, though I try to see a graph in every problem. All the operations you mentioned (move around, store resources, find out where to move to) are very common on graphs. You would also be able to easily change the topology, from a cylinder to a torus or in any other way. The only issue is that it takes more space than other representations. On the plus side you can use a graph library to create the graph and probably even some graph algorithms to calculate where agents go.
