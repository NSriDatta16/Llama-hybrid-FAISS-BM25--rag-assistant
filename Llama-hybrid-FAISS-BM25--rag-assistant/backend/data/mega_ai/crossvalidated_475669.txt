What could be an intutive understanding of a hyperplane?

This "Hyperplane" word gradually becoming more important to understand as I delve deeper into machine learning applications. To explain Hyperplane, the wiki article majorly speaks about one dimension less than the dimension occupied by space. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane However I could not build a intuitive understanding from this. The earlier similar attempts for related questions in SO also could not help much in this aspect. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24432871/what-is-the-difference-between-hyperplane-and-plane-and-why-is-hyperplane-repr and hyperplane in svm It would be of much help if some sort of visual or analytical explanation can be provided from the experts. Thanks for your time.
