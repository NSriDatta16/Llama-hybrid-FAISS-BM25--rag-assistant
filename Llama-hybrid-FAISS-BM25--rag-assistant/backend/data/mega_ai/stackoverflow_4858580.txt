Most email clients organize threads based on the following headers InReplyTo, References, Thread-Index (from Outlook). So if you don't specify those in your email message I think it wont be considered as part of any existing thread (unless a basic Subject based threading is on). Now, GMail also takes into account Subject. So I think if you'd want to change the subject line also. You'll have to experiment some.
