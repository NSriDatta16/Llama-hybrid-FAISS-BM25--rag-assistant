Estimating sample size needed to reach estimate precision (Bayesian CIs)

I want to estimate the required sample size to reach a specified width (precision) of the Bayesian credible intervals of the parameter of interest by using the standard error (posterior standard deviation) returned by the Bayesian regression for that parameter. Does it make sense to use the standard error formula to obtain the (crude approximation of the) required sample size by plugging in the known standard error? For example, if I get a SE = 4 with N = 500, can I calculate the required N to obtain SE = 1 by using $SE = s / \sqrt{n}$ ?
