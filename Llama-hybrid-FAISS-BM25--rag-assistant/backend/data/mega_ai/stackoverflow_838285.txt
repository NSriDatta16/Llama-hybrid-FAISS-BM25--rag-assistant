As others have stated, the length of the feedback loop and isolation of the problem to a specific component are key benefits of Unit Tests. Another way that they are complementary to functional tests is how coverage is tracked in some organizations: Unit tests on code coverage Functional tests on requirements coverage Functional tests might miss features that were implemented but are not in the spec. Being based on the code, Unit tests might miss that a certain feature wasn't implemented, which is where requirements based coverage analysis of Functional testing comes in. A final point : there are some things that are easier/faster to test at the unit level, especially around error scenarios.
