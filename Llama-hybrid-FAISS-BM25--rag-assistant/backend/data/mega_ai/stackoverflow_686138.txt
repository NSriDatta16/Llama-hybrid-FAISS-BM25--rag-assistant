If you're using MySQL, you can do some additional things (beyond tuning your cache values). The table engine can be a factor; for instance, MyISAM is widely held to be faster at SELECTs than InnoDB. If this table is primarily a lookup table, and you were using MySQL, that might be a good thing to do. (InnoDB is pretty good on average; it's better on writes than MyISAM, and also, InnoDB never needs to be repaired.)
