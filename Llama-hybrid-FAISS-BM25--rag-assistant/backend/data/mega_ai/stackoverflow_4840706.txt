AI program to generate paragraph pattern

Is there any software or service or AI program who can rebuild an English paragraph using different set of vocabulary, grammar rules etc. I mean to say, if the source paragraph is “Gwalior is a good tourist place near to Jhansi. Jhansi is very famous due their queen Rani Laxmi Bai (Manikandana)” Any software can generate its version or pattern like “Rani Laxmi Bai (Manikandana) was the queen of Jhansi which is nearer to a good tourist palace Gwalior.” Or something else. I know that 100% correctness is not possible until human intervention.
