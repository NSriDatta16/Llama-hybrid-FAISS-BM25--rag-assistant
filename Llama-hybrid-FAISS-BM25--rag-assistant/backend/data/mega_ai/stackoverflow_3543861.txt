As a general rule, I would strongly suggest writing a module. DataFlow can be a little opaque, and is designed (as stated already) for batch transfers of data, not real-time "transactional" querying which I think is what you're asking for. Writing directly to the database will bypass all the inbuilt business and data layer logic that exists in Magento for good reasons - e.g. updating indexes for performance, checking ACLs, etc. So you should use the Mage::getModel('module/model') approach for your development. It will also provide you with a lot of convenience methods for selecting, filtering, manipulating objects. If you write your own module, you will be much more able to understand what is happening, to debug your code and observe the effect of changes. Using the moduleCreator will give you a great headstart on that. When you write your module, I suggest you follow Joseph's suggestion to add your information as attributes to the related products. This blog post walks you through the process. Good luck! JD
