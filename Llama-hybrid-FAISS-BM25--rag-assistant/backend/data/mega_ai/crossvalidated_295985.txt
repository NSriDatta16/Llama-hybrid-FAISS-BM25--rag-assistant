The Frequentist definition would be that the alternative hypothesis is the logical complement to the null hypothesis. The two hypotheses must be mutually exclusive, jointly cover the parameter space and be complementary. Bayesian methods don't require binary hypotheses. EDIT To respond to comments. There is a tendency among some researchers to use $\mu=k$ as a null and an alternative of $\mu>k$. This might or might not be proper, particularly if the above definition is used. This is usually used when it is implicitly known that $\mu The use of an alternative such as $\mu>k$ is a problem for inference if, for example, in a z test one would find $z=-5$. Clearly, the null is rejected for most standard values of $\alpha$. However the inference and any decision which could follow from a null of $\mu=0$ since it is also clear that $\mu The proper, one-sided, null hypothesis should have been $\mu\le{0}$, with an alternative of $\mu>0$. The role of formal hypothesis declarations in Frequentist inference and decision theory is two-fold. First, it links the probability to a null hypothesis with well-defined frequencies. Second, it links the statements to a probabilistic version of modus tollens. Without a binary nature, that linkage is broken and the implied link between Aristotelean logic, frequencies, and set theory is also broken.
