Does likelihood ratio test control for overfitting?

I have two nested logistic regression models, A and B. A is nested under B. Let's say B has $K$ more features than A. B has a higher log likelihood than A. However the improved likelihood of B is due to the fact that the $K$ features easily overfit the data. If I apply the likelihood ratio test in my case, it suggests that the more complicated model, B, has a significant improvement. So I think that likelihood ratio test is flawed in such a case. How can we determine whether the added features cause the overfitting problem? Does likelihood ratio test always return the correct answer?
