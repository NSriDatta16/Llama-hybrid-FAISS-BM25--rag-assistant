Can you try the following code: Dim avgRanking = (From m in dc.Movies _ Where m.actlist.Contains(actor.Name) _ Select m.ranking).Average(Function(a) Convert.ToInt32(a)) And this should also work: Dim avgRanking = (From m in dc.Movies _ Where m.actlist.Contains(actor.Name) _ Select CInt(m.ranking)).Average() The problem is the type of Movie.ranking . The result of your query is and IEnumerable of tinyint . There is no overload of Average for this.
