I created an app myself and ran into this, though I didn't implement it yet, I plan to leverage JQuery plugins to do a lot of this. You can't embed the JS in the partial view if you load the partial via AJAX because it won't run. JQuery is a very nice framework and easy to build plugins. You just have to start designing your JS so that it's more reusable (not hard-coding element references and such). Alternatively, without JQuery, create separate JS files and design your code using JS classes is a good strategy too. HTH.
