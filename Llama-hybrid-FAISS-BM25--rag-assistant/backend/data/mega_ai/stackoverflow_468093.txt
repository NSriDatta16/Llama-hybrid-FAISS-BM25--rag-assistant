If the problem is in open source libraries, then the best solution is to supply patches to those products for better thread naming. Barring a security manager running, you can rename any thread by enumerating threads (as others have mentioned) and applying an arbitrary name to each, but this is a fragile way of naming threads that are not your own. If the 3rd party library changes their naming, you'll have to change your code. I agree that 3rd party libraries with poorly-named threads make more difficult understanding what is going on in your application. But renaming threads from a 3rd party library is risky. What happens if their next release changes the way they name threads? And how do you handle a 3rd party library that makes no attempt at all to name threads? EDIT: Add back text that somehow disappeared from the end
