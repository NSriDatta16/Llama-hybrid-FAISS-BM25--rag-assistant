What really wrong is: your code is totally insecure . You sanitize POST-Data only using javascript and place it into your SQL query? Anybody can EASILY inject some custom SQL-Code and to really bad things to your database. Never ever rely on any HTTP-Data (be it GET, POST or anything else) to be secure. I know you are new to PHP, so I honestly encourage you, for the sake of your customer, your project or anyone using your code, before you do anything else, sanitize your POST-Data with PHP before using it within SQL-Querys. Please. There is even an article on Wikipedia on it, and it is a huge mistake newbies make with huge consequences which is quite easy to prevent. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/24/10-useful-php-tips-revisited/ (Tip 1)
