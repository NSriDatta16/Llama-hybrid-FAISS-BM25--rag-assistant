I can't really tell you why IE supposedly leaks memory, but this code is pretty darn complicated for what it does. And this line seems highly suspicious and superfluous: try { return p } finally { p = null; } . How about simplifying it a bit and scoping the variables: var fragment = document.createDocumentFragment(); var p, t; for (var i = 0; i ', ' '); fragment.appendChild(p); } params[0].appendChild(fragment); fragment = p = t = null; // likely unnecessary if they go out of scope anyway That's still a lot of DOM operations though, which may take a while on slow Javascript engines.
