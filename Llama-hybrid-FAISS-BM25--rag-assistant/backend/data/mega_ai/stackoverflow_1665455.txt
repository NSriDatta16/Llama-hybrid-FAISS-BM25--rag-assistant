Your question is based on an incorrect premise. The defining property of lvalue in C is that it has a place in storage, i.e it is stored . This is what differentiates lvalue from rvalue . Rvalue is not stored anywhere. That's what makes it an rvalue. If it were stored, it would be lvalue by definition.
