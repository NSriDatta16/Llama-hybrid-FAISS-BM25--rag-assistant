The $n_0$ parameter is a parameter of a prior distribution. It is not estimated but assumed a priori . It serves as a "pseudocount" of the number of observations seen a priori and translates to "how strongly we believe" in the prior ( Murphy, 2007 ). Notice this part of the equation $$ \frac{n\lambda}{n\lambda + n_0\lambda} \overline{x} + \frac{n_0\lambda}{n\lambda + n_0\lambda}\mu_0 $$ where we take the weighted average between the observed $\overline{x}$ and the prior $\mu_0$ . The weights depend on the number of samples you observed $n$ and $n_0$ "imaginary" samples from the prior. The more "imaginary" samples, the more weight goes to the prior. If you want to update sequentially $n=1$ for each step. To choose the $n_0$ you need to consider how many samples would you consider to be enough to overwhelm the prior. Keep in mind that this is just intuition on how to think about it, because how strong the prior is depends on how much information it contains as compared to the data , so it is not only about the sample size. Check "Conjugate Bayesian analysis of the Gaussian distribution" by Kevin P. Murphy for a more detailed description.
