In your case, given that each element is expensive to retrieve, it probably makes sense to take aggregate results and not iterate directly for each element at remove invocation level. You could provide one method which returns a List like this: List getResults(int offset, int maxResults) where offset would be the index of the first element you want to start from and maxresults is the maximum number of elements you want to have in the list. You can then iterate on the list to display in your page. The Java Persistence API also follows the same pattern, the Query interface provides 3 methods that do the above: setFirstResult() setMaxResults() List getResultList() http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/persistence/Query.html
