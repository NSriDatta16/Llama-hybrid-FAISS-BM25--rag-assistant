sql_no_cache usage is to add it ater every select statement (query) you do. Such as: select sql_no_cache * from mytable; You can be sure this would not be cached. However there are a lot of other caches involved in the process of retrieving data from tables, from the harddrives and/or controllers themselves to the operating system caching frequent used files, to the storage engines mysql uses (such as innodb's buffer). Why do you want your queries not to be cached? If it's for benchmarking, I'd suggest restart mysql server before each execution. my.cnf should be located at /etc/my.cnf .
