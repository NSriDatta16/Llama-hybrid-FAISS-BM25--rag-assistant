One hot encoding of a binary feature when using XGBoost

I already asked this question is SO; however, I realized that this may be a better place for this type of question. I am well aware that when using categorical features with tree based models such as random forest and gradient boosting there is no need to drop one level from N-level categorical features. For example, the following color feature with three levels can be made three binary features. Color|| Color_R | Color_B | Color_G ____ ||_________|_________|________ R || 1 | 0 | 0 B || 0 | 1 | 0 G || 0 | 0 | 1 However, what about binary feature (E.g., TRUE/FALSE, MALE/FEMALE)? Should it be kept as a single binary feature (Option I below) or should it also be one-hot encoded into two binary features (Option II below) Option I Gender || Gender | ____ ||_________| M || 1 | F || 0 | M || 1 | Option II Gender || Gender_M | Gender_F ____ || _________|_________ M || 1 | 0 F || 0 | 1 M || 1 | 0
