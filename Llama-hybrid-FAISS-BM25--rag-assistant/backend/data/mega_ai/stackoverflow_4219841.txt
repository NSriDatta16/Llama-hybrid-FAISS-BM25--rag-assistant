The 2nd error is caused by the first one. The Embed Interop Types feature only supports embedding interfaces, not classes. Other than just setting that option on the WIA reference to False and deploy the interop library, you could also fix it like this: WIA.CommonDialog wiaDiag = new WIA.CommonDialog(); Unintuitive but creating COM interfaces with the new operator is allowed. You need to prefix the namespace name because CommonDialog is ambiguous with the Winforms CommonDialog class.
