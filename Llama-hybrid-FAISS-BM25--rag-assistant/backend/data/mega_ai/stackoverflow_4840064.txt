If you're talking about clicking a link, it is probably because there isn't a default behavior to prevent for mousedown and mouseup . The default behavior of clicking a link requires a combination of mousedown plus mouseup on the link. If you mousedown then drag off the link before you mouseup , the link is not followed. The same vice-versa. Only when you mousedown then mouseup is the default behavior activated. That event is represented by the click event. EDIT: I guess I forgot to answer the question. How do you get around it? Add a click() event handler that does e.preventDefault() . $('a.myElement').click(function(e){e.preventDefault()}); If you also want to stop propagation of the event, and if you're using jQuery 1.4.3 or later, you can do this: $('a.myElement').bind('click',false); From the docs for the bind() (docs) method: Setting the third argument to false will attach a function that prevents the default action from occurring and stops the event from bubbling. Again, it requires jQuery 1.4.3 or later.
