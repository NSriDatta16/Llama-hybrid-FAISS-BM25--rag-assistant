Online Learning with Kernels discusses online learning in general kernel settings. Excerpt from the abstract - " Kernel based algorithms such as support vector machines have achieved considerable success in various problems in the batch setting where all of the training data is available in advance. Support vector machines combine the so-called kernel trick with the large margin idea. There has been little use of these methods in an online setting suitable for real-time applications. In this paper we consider online learning in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. By considering classical stochastic gradient descent within a feature space, and the use of some straight-forward tricks, we develop simple and computationally efficient algorithms for a wide range of problems such as classification, regression, and novelty detection.
