This is basically a model selection problem. I encourage you to select a set of physically-plausible models (linear, exponential, maybe a discontinuous linear relationship) and uses Akaike Information Criterion or Bayesian Information Criterion to select the best - keeping in mind the heteroscedasticity issue that @whuber points out.
