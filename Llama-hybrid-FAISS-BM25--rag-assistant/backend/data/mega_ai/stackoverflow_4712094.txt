For a brief summary: HTML 4.01 is the current standard of markup languages for the internet. XHTML 1.0 was forked off from HTML 4.01. It introduced greater strictness in validation, more XML-like syntax (eg. instead of ) and XML namespaces for things like MathML (for embedding mathematical equations in pages.... very infrequently used). In theory XHTML allowed people to define their own tags.... but in practice this never happened. In actuality, the only real different it has from HTML 4.01 are the self-closing tags, a different doctype (the header at the top of HTML documents), and a few attributes on the tag. XHTML 1.1 was a natural progression from XHTML 1.0. It introduced even greater strictness, and enforced things like mime-types for served documents. However, because it declared it was XML instead of HTML, and had to be served to the browser as XML (which Internet Explorer to this day does not support), it never took off. XHTML 2.0 was a draft recommendation that got scrapped along the way. No-one subsequently uses it. HTML 5 is the next evolution from HTML 4.01. It adds a lot of new tags, new functionality such as local storage (meaning more web-app type applications are possible), and some other goodies. It comes in two flavours - HTML 5, which uses HTML-style syntax, and XHTML 5, which uses XHTML syntax with self-closing tags (and is not to be confused with XHTML 2, which is dead remember.) It is 'the next big thing' in web markup languages, but is still in draft stage. Some browsers are introducing support for new HTML 5 tags, but legacy browsers have no support. HTML 5 cannot be safely used in current sites, due to the draft nature of the specification. Some sites are doing so, but those sites can possibly get the whole nature of the language yanked out from under their feet. HTML 5 is not expected to be a formal recommendation until 2022. In summary: The current language of the web is HTML 4.01. HTML 5 expands on that greatly, but is not ready for everyday use. And the differences between HTML 4.01 and any flavour of XML, are minimal at best.
