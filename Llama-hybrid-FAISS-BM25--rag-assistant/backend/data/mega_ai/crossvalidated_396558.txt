Interpolating principal component

In my thesis, I use PCA from a bunch of WVS responses to measure the social capital of a country (aggregating principal components to country averages). However, WVS provides a quite low frequency of data (1 wave in 4-6 years). To compare it with annual World Bank data I intend to interpolate principal components (linearly or quadratically). Is that statistically correct approach? I suspect that this might be not OK since the principal component is sort of synthetic feature and interpolation would be a kind of synthetic procedure over an already synthetic variable. The point is to save the economic interpretation of this feature.
