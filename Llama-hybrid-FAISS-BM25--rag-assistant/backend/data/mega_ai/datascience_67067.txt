Compare Coefficients of Different Regression Models

in my project, I am using asuite of shallow and deep learning models in order to see which has the best performance on my data. However, in the pool of shallow machine learning models, I want to be able to compare the coefficients of each regression model between each other. Example: I have Lasso Ridge ElasticNet AdaBoostRegressor GradientBoostRegressor I am aware that I could get the coefficients of Lasso , Ridge , and ElasticNet from model.coef_ and model.intercept_ from sklearn . However, AdaBoostRegressor does not have this, but rather, it has weights assigned to each of the estimators. Similarly, GradientBoostingRegressor of sklearn does not even have weights at all. How am I to compare the coefficients between each of the regressive models I am using??
