If a permutation distribution is non-normal, what general conclusions can be drawn about it?

To validate a complicated ML (machine learning) model, I am using permutation tests to check whether there are any over-fitting problems. I don't observe a non-normal permutation distribution but I was thinking that if I did, what conclusions could I draw about it? A normally distributed permutation distribution kind of makes a lot of sense: it is a sum of various kinds of errors. If it was non-normal, I would intuitively start thinking about something causing the funny or weird shape. Is my reasoning correct? Is there something I am missing?
