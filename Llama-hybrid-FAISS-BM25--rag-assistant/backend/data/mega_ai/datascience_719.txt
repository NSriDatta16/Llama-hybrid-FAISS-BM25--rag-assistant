nsl- I'm a beginner at machine learning, so forgive the lay-like description here, but it sounds like you might be able to use topic modelling, like latent dirichlet analysis (LDA). It's an algorithm widely used to classify documents, according to what topics they are about, based on the words found and the relative frequencies of those words in the overall corpus. I bring it up mainly because, in LDA it's not necessary to define the topics in advance. Since the help pages on LDA are mostly written for text analysis, the analogy I would use, in order to apply it to your question, is: - Treat each gene expression, or feature, as a 'word' (sometimes called a token in typical LDA text-classification applications) - Treat each sample as a document (ie it contains an assortment of words, or gene expressions) - Treat the signatures as pre-existing topics If I'm not mistaken, LDA should give weighted probabilities for each topic, as to how strongly it is present in each document.
