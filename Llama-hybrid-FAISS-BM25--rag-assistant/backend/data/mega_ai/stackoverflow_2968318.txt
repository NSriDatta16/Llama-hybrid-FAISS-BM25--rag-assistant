Technically, or perhaps I should say, academically, the order in which columns are added to a table, or the order in which they are stored in the database's internal storage model, should not be of any concern to you. You can simply list the columns in the Select clause of your SQL queries to control the order that columns or computed expressions appear in the output of any query you run. Internally the database is free to store the actual data any way it sees fit to optimize storage, and or help align data elements with disk and/or memory boundaries.
