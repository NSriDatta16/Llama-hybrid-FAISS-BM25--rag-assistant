Best practices for measuring and avoiding overfitting?

I am developing automated trading systems for the stock market. The big challenge has been overfitting. Can your recommend some resources describing methods for measuring and avoiding overfitting? I started with training/validation sets, but the validation set always gets tainted. Also, the time series data is always changing because the market is always changing. How do you measure this and determine the likelihood of consistent results on unseen data? Thanks.
