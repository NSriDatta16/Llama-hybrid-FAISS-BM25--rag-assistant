A really good set of free references, IMHO, are: Overall compiler tutorial: Let's Build a Compiler by Jack Crenshaw ( http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/ ) It's wordy, but I like it. Assembler: NASM ( nasm.us ) good for Linux and Windows/DOS, and most importantly lots of doco and examples/tutorials. ( FASM is also good but less documentation/tutorials out there) Other sources The PC Assembly book ( http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/index.php ) I'm trying to write a LISP, so I'm using the Lisp 1.5 Manual . You may want to get the language spec for whatever language you're writing. As far as 1-2KLOC, assuming you use a high level language (like Py or Rb) you should be close if you're not too ambitious.
