Resources for prerequisites to Probablistic Machine Learning Models

I am a self-learner and have done several machine learning courses but diving into Bayesian or Probabilistic Graphical Models I feel like my prior knowledge is inadequate. I have done some Probability and Statistics in high-school and engineering introductory course but I still feel a gap of knowledge, maybe because I have forgotten earlier concepts. Although I can work with the following equation, I still don't intuitively understand it. What are some subjects and their resources that I should study in order to understand them?
