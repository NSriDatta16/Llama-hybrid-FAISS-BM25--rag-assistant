I am facing a similar issue as the OP, reporting coefficients of elastic net. In a comment, he wrote that it is wrong to report coefficients made in Cross Validation, and that one should train a model on all the data and report those. I would argue the opposite: Do several CV folds, and report the average coefficient and the variance. Do this because these are the models with which you achieved your error. If you fit the model on all the data, elastic net can select a certain set of features which might not match what was selected in CV folds. So you can end up reporting an error and coefficients that don't actually match. This is only okay if you see that elastic net selects the same features in every CV fold and the variance is low.
