I know the question is answered, but if anyone is having issues with this and isn't sure where to look for information - I find the following useful: You can also check the status of your provisioning certificates in the provisioning section on the development and distribution tabs. This is useful, as if the certificates have changed or there was a problem with the generation, then the existing application provisioning profile(s) status will be marked as invalid. You'll have to modify them anyway in this case, but I found it useful. Additionally in XCode, the Organizer window under iPhone Development->Provisioning Profiles is a quick way to see any issues, especially with expiration dates.
