Why should we remove seasonality from a time series?

While working with time series, we sometimes detect and remove seasonality using spectral analysis. I am a real beginner in time series, and I am confused why one would want to remove seasonality from the original time series? Doesn't removing seasonality distort the original data? What benefits do we get by constructing a time series by removing the seasonality?
