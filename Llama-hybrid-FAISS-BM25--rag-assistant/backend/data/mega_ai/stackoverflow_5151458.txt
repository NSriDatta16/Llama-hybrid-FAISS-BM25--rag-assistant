It depends heavily on the flow and organization of your application. In a tab bar based application, you should have a tab for handling the notification activity, and place a badgeValue for the corresponding UITabBarItem. You could also show an alert offering the possibility of switching to the "handle notification" area on the other tab. Tab Bars are a good way of having "simultaneous" access to differing flows and switching back and forth between them without having to manage saving and restoring the VC flow yourself.
