Significant predictors become non-significant in multiple logistic regression

When I analyze my variables in two separate (univariate) logistic regression models, I get the following: Predictor 1: B= 1.049, SE=.352, Exp(B)=2.85, 95% CI=(1.43, 5.69), p=.003 Constant: B=-0.434, SE=.217, Exp(B)=0.65, p=.046 Predictor 2: B= 1.379, SE=.386, Exp(B)=3.97, 95% CI=(1.86, 8.47), p but when I enter them into a single multiple logistic regression model, I get: Predictor 1: B= 0.556, SE=.406, Exp(B)=1.74, 95% CI=(0.79, 3.86), p=.171 Predictor 2: B= 1.094, SE=.436, Exp(B)=2.99, 95% CI=(1.27, 7.02), p=.012 Constant: B=-0.574, SE=.227, Exp(B)=0.56, p=.012 Both predictors are dichotomous (categorical). I have checked for multicollinearity. I am not sure if I have given enough info, but I cannot understand why predictor 1 has gone from being significant to non-significant and why the odds ratios are so different in the multiple regression model. Can anyone provide a basic explanation of what is going on?
