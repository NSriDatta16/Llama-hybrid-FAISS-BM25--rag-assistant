After digging for a few weeks, I think I found answers to my questions. I am posting it here for completeness. yes consider, input I=3 channels and you have F=5 filters, then in the hidden layer you have activations A = 5 maps ( 5F X 3I -> for each filter sum filter-responses over all input channels). The activations (A) are the maps that needs to be passed onto next stack as inputs that is wrong, the traditional stacked-autoencoders don't do that.
