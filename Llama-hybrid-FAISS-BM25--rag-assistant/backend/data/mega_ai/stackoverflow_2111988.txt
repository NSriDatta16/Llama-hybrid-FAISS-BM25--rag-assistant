Difference between Model and Model Resource

Im starting a project with Magento. Let me first say, that i come from the MS world, i have never used PHP before, and while im catching up quite rapidly i'm def a php newb. I can't quite seem to grasp the differences between the model, resource model, resource and entity objects and how they are related in the magento architecture. I've tried googling for days now and i have found little info, and what i have found doesn't really explain it!
