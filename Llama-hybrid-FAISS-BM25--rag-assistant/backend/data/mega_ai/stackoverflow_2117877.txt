This seems pretty tight. Min/Max width and Height are accounted for as well as variable borderwidths. The only issue I'm aware of is when the cursor movement is rapid and the size is within 20 pix of the min it sticks somewhat because of refresh rate. Not a huge deal but I'll sort it. alt text http://cartesia.pbworks.com/f/1265489984/Resize.png I can't seem to get the Window tag to display properly...(Just take out the apostrophe and it should be fine.) Anyone have any thoughts?
