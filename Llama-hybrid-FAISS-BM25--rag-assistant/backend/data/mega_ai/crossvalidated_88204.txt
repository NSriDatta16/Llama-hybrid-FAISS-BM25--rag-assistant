Probability puzzle about zombies

I am thinking about writing a simple game about zombies. I got stuck trying to calculate how many people should become zombies. Here are my conditions: We have a small rural town of 700 people. One night 200 zombies come to town. Each zombie has a single 30% contact chance (per day) with 50% chance of infection of one human and turning him into a new zombie. How many people shall become zombies on the first , second and third day? I decided to leverage the chance of infection according to amount of people in town. The more people, the less chance for contact (which may look controversial, yet let it be so). So (200/700)*0.3=0.086 or 8.6% contact chance. Then I started off thinking that one zombie has 8.6% chance of infecting one human and during one day there shall be 200 tries per 200 humans only. I tried to find a number of tries at which the probability of infection is 99.9% and it appears to be 60. Then every ~60th human shall be infected which means 700/60=11.6 people per day. I don't have any background in statistics so I am probably wrong, it would be nice if anyone would help me.
