GAN model with different optimization functions

Building GAN model contains the following steps: Build generator model, and choose optimization function for this model. Build discriminator model, and choose optimization function for this model. Build GAN network: 3.1 Build model with the architecture of the first 2 models ( generator , discriminator ) 3.2 Choose optimization function for this network There are some issues I'm not sure about them: It seems that generator model and discriminator model can have different optimization functions, am I right ? What is the purpose of this choice ? Is it realistic and data scientist use this ? It seems that we can choose different optimization function for GAN model which is not the same as generator or discriminator models. Am I right ? What is the purpose of this choice ? Is it realistic and data scientist use this ?
