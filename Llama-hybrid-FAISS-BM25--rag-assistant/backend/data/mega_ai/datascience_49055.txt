My guess is that since you have more features than obs, there are more chances that there exists an affine subspace which separates each class from the rest. i.e. Your data becomes linearly separable. Since log. regression has a linear boundary, should be easy to find it. I have no explanation for the bad performance of others. Are you using a linear kernel for SVM? If not, try it.
