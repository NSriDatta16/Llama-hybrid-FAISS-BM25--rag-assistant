Determine if Silverlight CAN be installed

I am developing a page that needs to work in a variety of scenarios that is determined using JavaScript. Firstly if Silverlight is installed it should use Silverlight. Simple. if(Silverlight.isInstalled()){ // do stuff } Next I need to be able to determine if Silverlight CAN be installed. This is the hard bit. Basically if I am viewing the on, say for example, an iPad (but could be any non-Silverlight capable device) I want to use plain HTML. But if I am on a desktop machine that doesn't have Silverlight installed but can install it I wan't the usual install Silverlight stuff Silverlight.getSilverlight(); I have seen the Silverlight.supportedUserAgent.js but like most UA sniffing techniques is a bit backwards. Is there a way feature detect such a thing?
