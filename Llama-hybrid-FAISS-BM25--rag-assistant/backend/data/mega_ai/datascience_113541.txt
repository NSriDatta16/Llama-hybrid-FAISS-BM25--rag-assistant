In logistic regression, why not just use the boundary instead of using probabilities to classify?

We know that logistic regression assign probabilities that an object belongs to a binary category, say {0,1}. We also know that if the object is "above" or "below" the boundary, it will be 1 or 0 in that category. Why not just use the boundary to classify such objects? What is the point of introducing the sigmoid if the boundary already classifies our objects.
