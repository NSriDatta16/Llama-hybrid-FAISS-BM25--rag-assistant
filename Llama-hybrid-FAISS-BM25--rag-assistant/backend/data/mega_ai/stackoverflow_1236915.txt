Extracting text fragment from a HTML body (in .NET)

I have an HTML content which is entered by user via a richtext editor so it can be almost anything (less those not supposed to be outside the body tag, no worries about "head" or doctype etc). An example of this content: Header 1 Some text here Some more text here A link here Header 2 Some text here Some more text here A link here The trick is, I need to extract first 100 characters of the text only (HTML tags stripped). I also need to retain the line breaks and not break any word. So the output for the above will be something like: Header 1 Some text here Some more text here A link here Header 2 Some text here Some It has 98 characters and line breaks are retained. What I can achieve so far is to strip the all HTML tags using Regex: Regex.Replace(htmlStr, " ]*>", "") Then trim the length using Regex as well with: Regex.Match(textStr, @"^.{1,100}\b").Value My problem is, how to retaining the line break?. I get an output like: Header 1 Some text hereSome more text here A link here Header 2 Some text hereSome more text Notice the joining sentences? Perhaps someone can show me some other ways of solving this problem. Thanks! Additional Info : My purpose is to generate plain text synopsis from a bunch of HTML content. Guess this will help clarify the this problem.
