Bayesian filter under the markov-chain assumption is the best tool for this kind of question. The basic idea is to use the past sampling to get your prior, then try to predict the current sample. The online detection is done by threshold on the prediction error. Things like Kalman filter or particle filter is fairly easy to implement. Depending on what computer language you are familiar with, there are many parkage you can use out of the box.
