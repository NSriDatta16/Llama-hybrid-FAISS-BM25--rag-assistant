Solution: I needed to add this call: LoadLibrary(TEXT("riched20.dll")); As noted on MSDN : In Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and later, it is possible to add a rich edit control into a dialog template by dragging the control from the toolbox. However, doing this in the dialog editor does not ensure that the required library will be loaded before the control is created. It is necessary to call the LoadLibrary function to load Riched32.dll, Riched20.dll, or Msftedit.dll before the dialog is created.
