Suppose someone told me that I should place equal trust in all values within a CI95 as potential indicators of the population value. (I'm deliberately avoiding the terms "likely" and "probable.") What's special about 95? Nothing: to be consistent I would also have to place equal trust in all values within a CI96, a CI97, ... and a CI99.9999999. As the CI's coverage approached its limit, virtually all real numbers would have to be included. The preposterousness of this conclusion would lead me to reject the initial claim.
