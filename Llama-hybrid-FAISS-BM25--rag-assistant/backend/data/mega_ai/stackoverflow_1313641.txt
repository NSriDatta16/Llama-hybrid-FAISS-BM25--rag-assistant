Well, the center of a city is impossible to calculate exactly, as there are probably as many views on what the center is as there are people... Instead of using just the min/max points of the zip code areas, you could get the average of all positions, that would give you a more weighted position. If you have an approximate number of people for each zip code you could use that as weight for the points, that would give you a "gravital center" of the population.
