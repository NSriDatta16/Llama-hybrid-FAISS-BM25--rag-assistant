Lets see how stackoverflow handles this very obscure question -- answers for which, on Google, are mired in technical specifications and obscure language. I just put When should I close an HTTP 1.1 connection? into Google, and the third hit was HTTP Made Really Easy. In the table of contents, there is a link to a section entitled Persistent Connections and the "Connection: close" Header . This section is three paragraphs long, uses very simple language, and tells you exactly what you want to know. I want a plain-english answer for a non-C programmer :) With all due respect, programming is a technical endeavour where the details matter a great deal. Reading technical documentation is an absolutely essential skill. Relying on "plain English" third-party interpretations of the specifications will only result in you doing a poor job.
