Yes - using the IQR method can find more "outliers" than using the standard deviation (or zscore). It depends on the distribution of the data. Data that's peaked with long tails will have a comparatively low IQR, so the IQR method will find lots of outliers. While both these methods can be used for outlier detection when considering only one variable, using them to detect outliers across multiple variables doesn't work well. In your code, you are flagging any sample that is found to exceed the limit in any one attribute as an outlier. If you've got several independent numeric attributes you will end up flagging quite a high proportion of your dataset as outliers. Is that reasonable? Is having >70,000 (or even only ~7000) outliers what you would expect for your dataset? If you're interested in other methods of outlier detection that may be more appropriate for your dataset, see What is the best way to identify outliers in multivariate data? , the answers suggest a few possible approaches, or Sergen Cansiz's Multivariate Outlier Detection in Python in the "Towards Data Science" blog for an example of how to detect outliers using Mahalanobis Distance .
