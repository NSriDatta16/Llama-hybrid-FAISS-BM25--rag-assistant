Separately execute a section of php code on a web page

This is a best practice type question. I'm dealing with two different frameworks. When I execute a piece of code from one framework on the page of another framework, I'm getting a code conflict. What I'm wondering is how to execute a piece of code on a separate web page and bring in the results AFTER the php on that page has executed and produced its HTML. One Possible Solution Use Curl - I could house the additional code on a curl page and bring it in that way, but that seems to have a lot of overhead associated with it. Is there a lower overhead way of doing this than using curl? More info Specifically in this case I'm trying to use a magento php script in my page, and the autoloader is trying to load in other scripts in the directory that should not be auto loaded.
