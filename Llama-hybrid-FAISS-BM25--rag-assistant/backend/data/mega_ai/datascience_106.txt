There are many overlaps between data mining and datascience. I would say that people with the role of datamining are concerned with data collection and the extraction of features from unfiltered, unorganised and mostly raw/wild datasets. Some very important data may be difficult to extract, not do to the implementation issues but because it may have foreign artifacts. Eg. if I needed someone to look at financial data from written tax returns in the 70s which were scanned and machine read to find out if people saved more on car insurance; a dataminer would be the person to get. If I needed someone to examine the influence Nike's Twitter profile in the tweets of Brazil and identify key positive features from the profile, I would look for a datascientist.
