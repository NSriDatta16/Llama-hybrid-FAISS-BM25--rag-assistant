You may want to take a look at Berkeley DB . It provides a schema-less simple key-value API (ala NoSQL) and is a library that links directly into your application. The nice thing about Berkeley DB is that you can have your cake and eat it too. It provides the simple, flexible, embeddable data storage that developers are looking for, but it's very fast, scalable and reliable as well. In addition to the base key/value pair API, Berkeley DB offers two other developer-friendly APIs: the Java Collections API and the Direct Persistence Layer API (a POJO-like persistence API). Most BDB application developers use the API that fits most naturally with how the application represents the data. C and C++ structures are usually stored as simple, opaque key/value pairs, where as Java collections obviously match up well with that API and Java classes match up well with the DPL API. Good luck with your search.
