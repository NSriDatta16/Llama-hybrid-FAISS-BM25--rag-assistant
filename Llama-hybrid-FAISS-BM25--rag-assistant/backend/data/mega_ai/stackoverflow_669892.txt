getting an insert ID from Webkit's HTML5 database storage

Webkit (on iPhone and Safari, at least) supports HTML5's database storage via SQLite. I'm trying to figure out how best to get the insert ID (there's an autoincrement field 'id' in the database) for the following transaction. db.transaction(function(tx) { tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO teams (name) VALUES (?)", [$('#team_name').val()]); });
