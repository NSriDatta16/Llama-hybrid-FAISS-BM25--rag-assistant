Difference between a bytecode parsed instruction and machine language?

"A bytecode program is normally executed by parsing the instructions one at a time. This kind of bytecode interpreter is very portable. Some systems, called dynamic translators, or "just-in-time" (JIT) compilers, translate bytecode into machine language as necessary at runtime: this makes the virtual machine unportable." A question about this paragraph is that: After the bytecode gets processed, what's the difference between a parsed instruction and machine language (or machine code)?
