What's up with innerHTML and ?

I've isolated the problem to this operation: // body is a tag body.innerHTML = ' '; No fancy code, just Firefox's innerHTML assignment. You should be able to duplicate the error in Firebug like so: >>> document.body.innerHTML = " " " " >>> document.body.innerHTML " " Is there a workaround for this? I need the tag, but I can't justify rebuilding/replacing the entire rich text editor because of one crappy edge case. I can't convert this to something like document.createElement('embed') , because real-world input to this editor can easily include a few paragraphs of text wrapped around the ; innerHTML is, on paper, perfect for this use case, I just can't get it to work with an .
