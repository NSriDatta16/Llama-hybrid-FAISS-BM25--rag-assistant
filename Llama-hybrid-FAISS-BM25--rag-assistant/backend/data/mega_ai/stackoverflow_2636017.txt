After a good night of sleep and further research I found the answer to my own question: When a draggable starts to be dragged it calculates the positions of all the droppables that can accept it. By default the positions are not re-calculated after this. There is a draggable option that forces re-calculation on every "drag" event : refreshPositions , see : http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-refreshPositions There is currently no function or callback to manually fire the calculation only when needed (in my case : when a group is expanded) but it is a registered feature request. See : http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-ui/browse_thread/thread/5a1fbb37ab8ef1a9?pli=1 and http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4911 Examples of worarounds to manuallay recalculate only when needed : http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-make-draggable-execute-refreshpositions-not-on-every-mousemove-but-with-a-specific-callback and http://trycatchfail.com/blog/post/2010/01/15/Work-around-for-jQuery-UI-Draggable-refresh-limitation.aspx
