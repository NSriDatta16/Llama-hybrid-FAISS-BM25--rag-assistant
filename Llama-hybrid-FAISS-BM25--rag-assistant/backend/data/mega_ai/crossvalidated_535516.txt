I would probably try adapting some of the NN architectures used in trajectory prediction to classification by changing the last layer, loss function, and possibly the first layer. To use CNN here, the trajectories will need to be bounded by the picture so it requires you to know a bound for the (x, y) based on the domain. Also, based on the success of RNN in trajectory prediction, there isn't a reason to believe that RNN would not do well here. The model can also be a mixed one where you first use CNN to capture spatial information and pass them to RNN to capture the temporal information (change in spatial information across time).
