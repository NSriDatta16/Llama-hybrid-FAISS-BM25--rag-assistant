What you want to do is mathmatically incorrect. You can't average tax rates that way. You need to know how many people are at each rate to get the average tax rate. This calculation would give a value of 6.67 (rounded and assuming you stored the tax rates in a decimal field and not an integer field (and of course you would never do a calculation of any sort on a float!)). however assume 10,000,000 people are intax rate A, 1,000,000 people are in tax rate B and 100 people are in tax rate c. Now the real average tax rate is 5.09%.
