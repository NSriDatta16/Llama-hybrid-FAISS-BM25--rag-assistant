How can I use Kalman Filter formulation for inferring the probability of system failure?

I want to use the Kalman filter to sense the state of a machine. The machine could be either working or damaged. I'm trying to infer the probability of the machine working, given observations from multiple independent sensors. I'm able to formulate the problem using Bayes' Filter (discrete formulation). I'm curious to see if I can formulate the same problem leveraging distributions so that I can estimate confidence in my predictions rather than a deterministic value (i.e., 90% prob. of working v/s a distribution). Most Kalman Filter examples in literature infer the state/location of a system/entity in an unbounded space (i.e., location) leveraging variables represented using normal distributions. Since the state of my system is bounded (i.e., 0-100%), what is the right (and mathematically elegant) approach to using Kalman Filter?
