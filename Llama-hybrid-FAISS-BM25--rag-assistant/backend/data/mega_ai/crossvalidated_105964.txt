Measure accuracy of Holt-Winters model

I'm really confused about measuring the accuracy of Holt-Winters fitted models applying different transformations. How do i compare the accuracy between models when i apply no transformation to the data, the BoxCox power transformation and, for instance, log transformation? Say i have a time series x. fit1 The first 2, i think are comparable because i passed the parameter lambda to the forecast.HoltWinters() to the second one. But what about the other one? Do i apply the inverse if the natural logarithm like this exp(accuracy(f3)) Any help is appreciated. Thanks guys.
