Calculating the probability a predicted point is 0

I have a deterministic function $f(x)$ and have evaluated some points $x_1,...,x_n$. So essentially I have pairs of data $(x_1,f(x_1)),...,(x_n,f(x_n))$. I am modeling the function $f(x)$ using a Gaussian process and thus can make predictions about the function where I do not have observed values. For example, imagine I have the following data (black points) coming from the true function (black line) and I try to predict the true function (red line) using my Gaussian process. So now, what I am interested in is using my Gaussian process to make my best guess at where the true function $f(x)$ will be equal to 0. So what I am interested in is probably making a calculation that would look something like $$\text{Pr}(f(x)=0)=...?$$ So my questions are: What are the possible ways to quantify how likely a predicted point is equal to zero under this modeling scenario? Is that probability calculation feasible? Also, if it matters, I am doing this from a Bayesian point-of-view.
