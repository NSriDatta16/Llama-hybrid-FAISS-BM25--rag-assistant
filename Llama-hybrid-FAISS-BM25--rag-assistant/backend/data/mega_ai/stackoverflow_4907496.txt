As long as you do not have register_globals activated I don't see any value in validating the field names. You typically know beforehand which variables you need and will validate their value accordingly. With register_globals on (which is highly discouraged ) variables from a request could hide your own uninitialized variables. More on this here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.globals.php
