This book is really good, though very introductory: What is a p-value anyway? by Vickers. He draws on his experience as a medical researcher. Perhaps it provides a good high level of info and helps with the intuition side of things. However, I know you asked for more of a reference book. I have heard good things about these 3 books from several different colleagues: Principles of Biostatistics by Pagano Optimal Design of Experiments: A Case Study Approach by Goos and Jones Practical Statistics for Medical Research by Altman
