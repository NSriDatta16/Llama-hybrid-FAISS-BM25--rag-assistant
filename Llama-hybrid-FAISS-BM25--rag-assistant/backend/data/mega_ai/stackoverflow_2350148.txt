Typically I would take the "I am not a lawyer" route, but Apple really is quite clear in their license. You can pretty well do whatever you want with it. You can certainly use it in your products in any of the ways you likely have in mind, and Apple encourages you to do so. The only restrictions they really have in there are standard BSD-style things: don't sue us, don't say you're part of Apple, and "if you redistribute the Apple Software in its entirety and without modifications, you must retain this notice..." (so don't strip off their notice and put the source code on your web site and pretend you wrote it). Apple's example code license is in the same realm with BSD and MIT. Very laid back; easy to comply with.
