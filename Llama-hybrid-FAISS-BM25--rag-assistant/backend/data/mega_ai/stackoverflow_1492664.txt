Any view code ideas when using state machines?

I've been trying to implement a guided (wizard-like) interface to collect information to populate several models. I've found a decent amount of information on the various state machine plugins, but only one example on how the state machine can be used to control the view. (The Advanced Rails Recipe book from Pragmatic Programmers). I'm convinced there has to be several ways to integrate a state machine with a view, and possibly a better way than the helper method in the Rails Recipe book. Can anyone provide any links or info on how they implement state machines into their views? Thanks!
