Look into the numpy and scipy packages for python - you might find some time series analysis functions. Then its just a matter of getting the values out of the database, but thats standard django/python. Do you want something like this: def gaps(seq): ... return gaps_found which, when fed [1,2,4,5,6,8,12] returns [3,7,9,10,11]? That might be doable with sets.
