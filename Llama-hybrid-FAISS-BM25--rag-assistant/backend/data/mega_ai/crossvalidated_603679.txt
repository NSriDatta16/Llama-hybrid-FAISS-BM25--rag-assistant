Question about Mann Whitney U and Rank Sum test in Scipy

I am trying to compare the average visual acuity between to sets of independent groups using logMAR visual acuity. As the sample size is small I have opted for the Mann-Whitney U test which, in my understanding, is the same as the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. I am using scipy in python and my code is as follows; import scipy.stats as stats mPVR = [0.00, -0.18, -0.08, 0.30, 0.48, 0.60] iERM = [1.00, 0.60, 0.78, 0.10, 0.00, 0.18, 0.60, 0.48, -0.18, -0.08] MWU = stats.mannwhitneyu(mPVR, iERM, use_continuity=True, alternative="two-sided") WRS = stats.ranksums(mPVR, iERM, alternative="two-sided") print(MWU) print(" ") print(WRS) ____________________________________________________________________________________________ MannwhitneyuResult(statistic=22.0, pvalue=0.4131761509873124) RanksumsResult(statistic=-0.8677218312746247, pvalue=0.385546631571102) Now I am asking these questions for my learning. 1) Why are the p-values produced by the Mann-Whitney U and Rank Sums test different if the two tests are the same? 2) If they are indeed not the same (which I very much suspect given that there are two different functions) then which test would be most appropriate to use in this scenario? 3) If the tests should produce the same p-value, then what have I done wrong with the above?
