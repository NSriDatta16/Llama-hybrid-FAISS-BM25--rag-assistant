The problem with this is that it reduces most of the game down to just one thing: end-content. Take World of Warcraft for instance, I love playing that, and I love leveling up a character. Sure, there are some tedious points in the process, but by and large, it's fun. Now, if I had installed a bot and just put it to work leveling up my character, at least doing all the repetetive work and leaving me with just visiting a trainer NPC and getting my new skills once in a while, then all I had left was the things I could do at level 80. Additionally, all the skills I, as a person (not my character) should've learned along the way goes out the window. There are two types of people that are beyond good in Counterstrike, as an example, it's the people that use bots, and it's the people that have just played so much that they are that good. Once you resolve to using bots, you're pretty much doomed to keep using them, and trying to automate your end-content playing as well, since you really don't have the experience to play at that level. So basically, you're reducing the whole game down to a programming contest. Even if you keep you code only to yourself, all you've proven is that you can program. You've yet to prove that you can play the game. So in the end, what actually is the point of you playing that game then? As others have said, there's many options available to you if all you want to do is create software to automate things. Having said that, I share some of your joy of controlling my environment. I use regularly quite a lot of addons in World of Warcraft, but they don't give me an advantage over others in the same way a bot would. They might make it easier for me to organize my inventory, let me keep notes inside the game, or just prettify the user interface, but in the end, it's still me that pushes the buttons in response to game events. And that's what gaming is about for me.
