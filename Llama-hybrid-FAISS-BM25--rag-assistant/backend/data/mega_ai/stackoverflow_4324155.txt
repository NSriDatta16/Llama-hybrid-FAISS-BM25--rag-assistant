How to deploy an ad-hoc distribution (ipa file) or how to synchronize iTunes with devices

I'm using the Ad-Hoc distribution to deploy my app on different devices. I already created an *.ipa file and dragged it onto iTunes. Under "Apps" I selected my app and dragged it onto the device. This worked only one time. Now if I try it again a red serrated circle with a one in it appears when dragging the app onto the device. What I'm doing wrong? I have to add that the Mac I'm using is also the development machine. I also tried to replace the *.ipa file but it is the same result. I tried it on different devices. It is always the same problem ... Edit: On iPad with iOS 4.2.1 it worked one time. On another iPad (same capabilities but also with iOS 4.2.1) it does not. So upgrading to a newer iOS on other devices should not be relevant. I'll try the zip + mobileprovision method. No Perhaps the problem is that the first synchronization tooks place on another computer (Apple uses the binding between iTunes and the computer) and not the one I'm using.
