Calculating probabilities using cox regression

I have done a multivariate Cox regression in R. The model fits to my data very well. Now, I would like to use my model and predict the survival probabilities of new observations. I am unclear how to do this with a Cox model. Something similar to what can be done using a logistic regression,to plugin the values of new observations and multiply them with betas and calculate the probabilities. How can this be done in a Cox model?
