If you have very low proportions, approximations based on the normal distribution like the Wilson Interval do not have a good coverage probability. You should thus use the Clopper-Pearson Interval , which, e.g. the R function binom.test computes: > ci ci[1:2] [1] 0.00000000 0.03621669 For zero hits, the interval can even be computed in closed form as $[0,1-\sqrt[n]{\alpha/2}]$ , where $\alpha$ is the error probability (i.e. $1-\alpha$ is the confidence level). For other values, however, it must be computed numerically. See section 3.1. of this Technical Report for the underlying ideas and formulas. It also shows the problems of other confidence intervals for small (or large) $p$ .
