Our SD Source Code Search Engine is a tool for interactively searching large source code bases in many computer languages (including PL/SQL) efficiently, by preindexing the source code files by their tokens (identifiers, numbers, etc). As a side effect of the preindexing step, it computes standard metrics: SLOC, Cyclomatic, Halstead, ... for each file and produces a report. See the site for an example. Our SD CloneDR is a tool for analyzing large code bases for redundant code. We've applied it to PL/SQL, and have seen something like 45% of the code involved in clones. YMMV. The CloneDR works with a large variet of langauges; see the site for sample clone detection runs on some of those other langauges. EDIT 10/4/2010: Our Source Code Search Engine is designed to enable very fast searches across large codes of mixed languages. It succeeds by preindexing the source code. As a side effect of the indexing step, it compute a variety of metrics including Cyclomatic and Halstead measures of complexity. Just added: not a static analysis tool, but one generally of interest to people interested software quality: our TestCoverage for PLSQL stored procedures .
