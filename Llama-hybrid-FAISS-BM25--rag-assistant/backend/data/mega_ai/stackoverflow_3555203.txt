Actually we use Kanaban and TFS and my opinion is that TFS is more of an obstacle here than help. We basically reduced TFS role to bug tracking tool and code repo. One of strengths of Kanban board is its visual design which is very intuitive. It can't really be substituted with a set of forms organized in the flow. What more, teams tend to use "hardware" white/cork board with sticky notes whenever they can, namely whenever they are co-located. And even if they aren't they usually try to find a software tool which is as simple as possible. You can say a lot about TFS but not that it is a simple tool. Personally I think that's not a very good idea. I wouldn't use it.
