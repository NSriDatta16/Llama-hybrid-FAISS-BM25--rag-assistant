A kernel size of 1 does not make it a fully connected layer. This type of layer is called a 1x1 convolution (or "network-in-network") layer. As you noted, this is often used to reduce computational costs. There are a few other questions and answers on this site regarding the purpose of this type of layer: What does 1x1 convolution mean in a neural network? how does the addition of 1Ã—1 layers reduce from the complexity and solve sparse structure in inception module?
