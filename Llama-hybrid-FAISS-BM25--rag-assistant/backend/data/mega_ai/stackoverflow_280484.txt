I think there is no good way to create a score like this in a single number. I would suggest to calculate the average success and include the number of games. For example Peter scores 40/2 (average 40 pts in 2 games) Janne scores 10/8 (average 10 pts in 8 games) You can quickly see if the second number is larger, the first number is more accurate. Otherwise use ELO, but is is only accurate if each player plays at least 10 matches.
