Server Side Files : No, unless you serve them via a web service. You can open files in two ways. One is isolated storage , an area that your application has, of limited size (although you can ask the user for an increase). In this you can read, write and do what you want. If you want hard disk access then you can only read, and the file must be opened from a file open dialog . If you mean via a FileSystemWatcher - no, not even in isolated storage. Server side you can do what you want, obviously, because it's not Silverlight there. You can use duplex web services so the server could notify your silverlight application when something happens like a file change. In isolated storage you can do what you want. Outside of that it is read operations only and the user must choose a file from the File Open dialog.
