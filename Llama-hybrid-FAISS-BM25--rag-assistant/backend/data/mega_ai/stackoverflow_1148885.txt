64-bit library limited to 4GB?

I'm using an image manipulation library that throws an exception when I attempt to load images > 4GB in size. It claims to be 64bit, but wouldn't a 64bit library allow loading images larger than that? I think they recompiled their C libraries using a 64 bit memory model/compiler but still used unsigned integers and failed upgrade to use 64 bit types. Is that a reasonable conclusion? Edit - As an after-thought can OS memory become so fragemented that allocation of large chunks is no longer possible? (It doesn't work right after a reboot either, but just wondering.) What about under .NET? Can the .NET managed memory become so fragmented that allocation of large chunks fails?
