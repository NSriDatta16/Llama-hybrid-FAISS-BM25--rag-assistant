So I think reconstructing a matrix after PCA is the problemyou are asking. If you want to get in the weeds, here's a nice paper that made sense to me. It walks through the steps of reconstruction on page 4. Here's my explanation: After finding the principle components for a matrix (M x N), we have two matrices. 1 - Matrix of eigenvectors which are our principle components (K x N). 2 - Matrix of projected data relative to the principle components (M x k). Now, we want to reverse the process with our reduced data to create a matrix of the original dimensions. To do this, we simply take the inner product of Matrix 2 and Matrix 1 and voila, were back to where we started, just with bare necessities this time. Hopefully this get's you a little bit further to understanding this (if you haven't already figured it out). Let me know if you still have any questions.
