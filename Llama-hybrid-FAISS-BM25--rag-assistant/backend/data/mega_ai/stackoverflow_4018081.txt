Edit Title in Silverlight 4

We are developing an out-of-browser Silverlight 4 application and want to change the title after the application loads. Example: public partial class MainPage : UserControl { public MainPage() { InitializeComponent(); this.Loaded += new RoutedEventHandler(MainPage_Loaded); } public string UserName { get; set; } public string VersionNumber { get; set; } void MainPage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { string title = string.Format("MyApplication {0} {1} ", this.VersionNumber, this.UserName); HtmlPage.Window.Eval(string.Format("document.title='{0}'", title)); } } Three things I have tried: The above example does not work and throws an InvalidOperationException "The DOM/scripting bridge is disabled." All the references I found, example , said the HTML bridge is disabled in OOB mode. Create a custom OOB Window, example , but I would prefer a more elegant solution. Adjust the OutOfBrowserSettings.xml file, but it doesn't appear that I can get access to it after Load. Any ideas on how to adjust the title after the application has loaded?
