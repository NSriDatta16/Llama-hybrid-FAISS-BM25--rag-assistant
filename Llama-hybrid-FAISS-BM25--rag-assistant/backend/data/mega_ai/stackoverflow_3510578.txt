On your embedding element (e.g 'embed', 'object', 'iframe') in the main document add an onload attribute which calls your function, or add the event listener in script, e.g embeddingElm.addEventListener('load', callbackFunction, false) . Another option might be to listen for DOMContentLoaded , depends on what you want it for. You can also add a load listener on the main document. jQuery(document).ready doesn't mean that all resources are loaded, just that the document itself has a DOM that is ready for action. However note that if you listen for load on the entire document your callback function won't be called until all resources in that document are loaded, css, javascript etc. If you use inline svg, then jQuery(document).ready will work just fine however. On a further note you might want to consider using embeddingElm.contentDocument (if available) instead of embeddingElm.getSVGDocument() .
