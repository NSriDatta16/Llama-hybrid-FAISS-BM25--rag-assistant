R , the standard statistics programming language, has macros ( R manual, chapter 6 ). You can use this to implement the function lm() , which analyzes data based on a model that you specify as code. Here's how it works: lm(Y ~ aX + b, data) will try to find a and b parameters that best fit your data. The cool part is, you can substitute any linear equation for aX + b and it will still work. It's a brilliant feature to make statistics computation easier, and it only works so elegantly because lm() can analyze the equation it's given, which is exactly what Lisp macros do.
