Is it doable? Yes. Are there specific implementation details we need to be aware of? Yes. Each type of security implementation has its own implementation details that you're just going to have to figure out. Each one is different and has its own nuances. You should be able to implement whatever type of security you chose. Kerberos is a fine choice. You might also look into Openid and CAS. There are many others though. To handle the actual security itself you might consider looking into Spring Security. Spring Security is able to handle authentication/authorization fairly well. However, most of spring security is really focused towards security on the web and not client systems so you most likely will have to implement much of the authentication mechanisms yourself (using libraries available library whenever possible of course). When designing your system, especially if you're going to have many different types of login types, try to build the login system as pluggable as you can. Which will take time and a lot of trial and error. I would look into the Spring Security 3 book. It isn't a great book, but it does explain a lot about how to properly implement security. Leveraging springs work is highly recommend because trying to implement security all by yourself will be quite a daunting task. Best of Luck.
