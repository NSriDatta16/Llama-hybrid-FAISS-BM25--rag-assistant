Yes, besides there are a few different types of code coverage from wiki: Function coverage - Has each function in the program been executed? Statement coverage - Has each line of the source code been executed? Decision coverage (also known as Branch coverage) - Has each control structure (such as an if statement) evaluated both to true and false? Condition coverage - Has each boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false (this does not necessarily imply decision coverage)? Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) - Has every condition in a decision taken on all possible outcomes at least once? Has each condition been shown to affect that decision outcome independently? Path coverage - Has every possible route through a given part of the code been executed? Entry/exit coverage - Has every possible call and return of the function been executed? Path coverage for example, just because every method has been called, doesn't mean that errors wont occur if you call various methods in a given order.
