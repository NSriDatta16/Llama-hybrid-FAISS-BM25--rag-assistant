Estimating Joint Probability from limited data

This is probably a broad question but I am interested in getting the Joint PDF for n random variables each of which can take integer values within a finite range. I have data in the form of time series for these n random variables (it should be possible to see a correlation from this). For better understanding, see this below example: Time $$X_1$$ $$X_2$$ $$X_3$$ $$X_4$$ $$X_5$$ ... $$X_n$$ 1 1 2 1 4 2 0 4 2 4 5 1 3 5 7 1 3 2 3 4 1 5 0 0 4 2 3 2 4 4 1 2 5 4 5 6 5 7 4 7 6 3 8 3 7 2 2 1 7 7 3 2 1 8 1 8 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... This is what the data looks like. Now I want to estimate the joint PDF of these random variables so that I can use their realizations for some simulations. What I know about these random variables is that they have a finite range. The number of random variables is fixed, i.e. n is known. How do I go about this?
