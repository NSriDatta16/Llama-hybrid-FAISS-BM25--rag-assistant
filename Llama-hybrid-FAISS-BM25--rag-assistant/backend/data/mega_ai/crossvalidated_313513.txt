Is Multinomial logistic regression appropriate for this dataset?

I have the following dataset shown below. Any value between 500 & 900 were categorized as A, while values between 900 & ~1500 were mixed between A and B. I want to find the probability of getting A, B, and C at any value of x where x is my independent variable and A,B,C are my dependent variables. It seems to be a good fit for multinomial logistic regression. I believe the number of observations for each dependent variable is sufficient. If multinomial log regression is appropriate, I wish to uses Python's scikit learn logistic regression module to obtain my probability of A, B, and C at any value of x but I am not sure how to approach this using that module.
