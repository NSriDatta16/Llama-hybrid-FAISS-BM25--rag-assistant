Consider a 2-state $\{0, 1\}$ Markov chain with transition matrix $P = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ . It is easy to verify that $f_{00}^{(1)} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $f_{00}^{(n)} = 0$ for $n \geq 2$ (because $1$ is an absorbing state). Clearly state $0$ is transient and $$\sum_{n = 1}^\infty nf_{00}^{(n)} = \frac{1}{2}
