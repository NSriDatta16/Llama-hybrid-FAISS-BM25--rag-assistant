First of all you should use mysql's built in field types: status is ENUM('activated', 'suspended', 'verify', 'delete'); gender is ENUM('male','female','unknown') last_visited is TIMESTAMP suspended_note is TEXT failed login count is TINYINT(1) because you wouldnt have 10000 failed logins right - INT(5) date_time is DATETIME or TIMESTAMP add an index on username and password (combined) so that logins are faster index, unique email since you'll query by it to retrieve pwds and it should be unique Also you might want to normalize this table and separate suspended_note, website, IP, aim etc to a separate table called profile. This way logins, session updates, pwd retrievals are queries ran in a much smaller table, and have the rest of the data selected only in pages where you need to have such data as the profile/member pages. However this tends to vary a lot depending on how your app is thought out but generally its better practice to normalize. You could probably normalize even more and have a user_stats table too: fields that update often, like failed_login_count, ip, last_visited could be in another table. This way your members table itself doesn't change as often and can be in cache. â€“ Konerak 1 hour ago VARCHAR is good but when you know the size of something like the activation key always is 32 then use CHAR(32)
