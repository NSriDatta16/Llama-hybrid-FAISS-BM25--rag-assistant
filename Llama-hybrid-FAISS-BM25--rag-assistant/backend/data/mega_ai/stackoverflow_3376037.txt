The error implies the use of an object that hasn't been instantiated. From the code snippet given, it looks like you're attempting to close the recordset without ever instantiating it. Do you mean to be setting rstSimple to the result of cnnSimple.Execute()? Edit: Now that I've looked at the other question, what I've suggested may not be the problem. As people have pointed out, you should really clean the data in the Request object before inserting it in your string (security or no security, an apostrophe in one of those vars will kill that statement). It's possible (my memories of VBScript are blissfully hazy) that if the Execute() statement fails, nothing will be assigned to rstSimple, and the call to rstSimple.Close() will generate the error message you're seeing. Try setting rstSimple to a new ADODB.Recordset before calling cnnSimple.Execute() and see if that sheds any light on the issue...
