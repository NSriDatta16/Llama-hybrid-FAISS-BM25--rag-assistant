In matplotlib, how can I plot a time series with the x-axis as isoformat times?

I can find plenty of examples of plot_date() and the like, but how can I plot a time series where the x-axis is strings as returned by datetime.time.isoformat()? I am using microsecond data, and that appears to be a serious restriction.
