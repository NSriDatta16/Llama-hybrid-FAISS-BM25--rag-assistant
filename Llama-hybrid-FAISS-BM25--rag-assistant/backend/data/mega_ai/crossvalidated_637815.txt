Wrong time series detection

I have a problem and I need help. I have a time series and I need to know if the data is correct. Let me explain with an example. Suppose I have data generated by an atmospheric pressure sensor. The total data is 100 and of them 90 are equal to 0 and the rest are probable values around 1000 hPa. In this case, it is most likely that due to some error, the sensor has recorded the values at 0. If a study of outliers were carried out, it is most likely that the correct values will be those that are detected as outliers. For this example it is easy to know that if I am measuring atmospheric pressure the values of 0 are not correct. The problem is that I have several time series and each one represents data from different measurements. I need to do an analysis that allows me to determine when I have erroneous values in a time series and that this analysis is independent of the measurement that is made. I appreciate any ideas. Note: I ` m using PySpark
