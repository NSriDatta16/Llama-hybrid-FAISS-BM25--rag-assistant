Separating Code To Be Organized

I'm building a zipper application, but it has a declaration that I want to separate it in another file (compress-file.m), but only when I separate the files I got an error when compiling with a variable, see it: [ubuntu@eeepc:~/Desktop] make This is gnustep-make 2.0.2. Type 'make print-gnustep-make-help' for help. Making all for app LeafZip... Creating LeafZip.app/.... Compiling file main.m ... main.m: In function ‘main’: main.m:7: error: ‘PATH_MAX’ undeclared (first use in this function) main.m:7: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once main.m:7: error: for each function it appears in.) main.m:12: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘compressFile’ main.m:7: warning: unused variable ‘outFileName’ make[1]: *** [obj/main.o] Error 1 make: *** [LeafZip.all.app.variables] Error 2 Also see the line 7 of main.m file: char outFileName[PATH_MAX] = { 0 }; And see some lines of compress-file.m: #include #include #include /* Buffer to hold data read */ char buf[BUFSIZ] = { 0 }; size_t bytes_read = 0; gzFile *out = gzopen(outFileName, "wb"); I know that is Objective-C extension, but it's only because when I solve this problem I will need to continue the development in Objective-C. What I need to do to correct this?
