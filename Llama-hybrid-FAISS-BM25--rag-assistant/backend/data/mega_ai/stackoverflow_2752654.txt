How to store and echo multiple lines elegantly in bash?

I'm trying to capture a block of text into a variable, with newlines maintained, then echo it. However, the newlines don't seemed to be maintained when I am either capturing the text or displaying it. Any ideas regarding how I can accomplish this? Example: #!/bin/bash read -d '' my_var Output: this is a test Desired output: this is a test
