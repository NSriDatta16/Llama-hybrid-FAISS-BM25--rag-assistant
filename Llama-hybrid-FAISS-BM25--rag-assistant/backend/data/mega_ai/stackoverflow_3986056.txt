Get the path "difference" between two directories

The situation: I got one or more absolute paths, e.g.: /home/benjamin/test/ /home/benjamin/test/a/1 /home/benjamin/test/b/1 How can I get the difference between two paths? Let's say I want to know how I can get from path 1 to path 2. Expected result would be /home/benjamin/test/a/1 - /home/benjamin/test/ = /a/1 Is there a more elegant way than subtracting the strings from each other?
