How to customize iPhone UISlider control at runtime - where do I place the color update code?

I have added a UISlider control to an iPhone View-based application and have wired up a text field that gets the values from the slider. To fit with the user interface colors in the application I need to change the color of the slider. With a little googling I was able to find 2 samples which do this ( http://blog.hill-it.be/post/2009/03/23/Pimp-My-UISlider and http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/samplecode/UICatalog/index.html ) but I'm stuck because I'm not sure where I should be calling the code from. I have a method which should return a custom UISlider object, but how do I override the one that I created through interface builder that lives in my sliderViewController.m and sliderViewController.h? - (UISlider *)createCustomSlider { CGRect frame = CGRectMake(174, 12.0, 120.0, 7.0); UISlider customSlider = [[UISlider alloc] initWithFrame:frame]; [customSlider addTarget:self action:@selector(sliderAction:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged]; // in case the parent view draws with a custom color or gradient, use a transparent color customSlider.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor]; UIImage *stetchLeftTrack = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"orangeslide.png"] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:10.0 topCapHeight:0.0]; UIImage *stetchRightTrack = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"yellowslide.png"] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:10.0 topCapHeight:0.0]; [customSlider setThumbImage: [UIImage imageNamed:@"slider_ball.png"] forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [customSlider setMinimumTrackImage:stetchLeftTrack forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [customSlider setMaximumTrackImage:stetchRightTrack forState:UIControlStateNormal]; customSlider.minimumValue = 0.0; customSlider.maximumValue = 100.0; customSlider.continuous = YES; customSlider.value = 50.0; return customSlider; } With .NET I'd normally have some code generated by the WinForms editor which I would then be able to override by creating a new object and assigning to the existing reference.
