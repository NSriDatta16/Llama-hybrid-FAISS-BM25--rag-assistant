Upcasting to object doesn't require an execution time check - it will always work, and is just a no-op basically. Downcasting requires an execution time check to make sure you're not casting a Stream to a String for example. It's a pretty small penalty, and very unlikely to be a bottleneck - but avoiding it is just one extra benefit for generics.
