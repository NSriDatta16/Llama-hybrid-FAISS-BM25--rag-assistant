If you can't find a facebook API to suit your needs, you'll have to make one from scratch. Try using the Charles web debugging proxy to surf around facebook and post comments, add friends etc. It will reveal and log all the headers and GET/POST traffic. You can use the logged requests and responses to engineer your own API. It'll be a pain, but its a good exercise. If you get stuck, just post a query on this website. The issues are all common enough that people post solutions within a few minutes. A few pointers: Facebook requires a login, meaning you'll probably need to build your own urlopener using a cookie handler from cookielib. You'll also have to get comfortable programming HTTP POST requests. Facebook probably won't tolerate traffic from automated scripts, so all your traffic with the website will have to emulate a browser--slowish request rates, and a strategically defined "user-agent" element in the HTTP request headers.
