Corresponding RKHS of Common Kernels

A kernel, $k(x_1, x_2)$, has the interesting property that it may be represented as the dot product in a reproducing kernel hilbert space (RKHS), $\phi(x_0)\phi(x_1)$. I know that for the gaussian kernel $\phi$ is infinite dimensional and other properties of kernels but do not have an explicit representation for $\phi$. I wish to know the explicit representation for $\phi$ of common kernels eg gaussian, periodic, matern etc. (Links to papers or books would be great!)
