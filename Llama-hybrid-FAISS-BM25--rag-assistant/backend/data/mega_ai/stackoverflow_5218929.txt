Using WinPcap in VC++ programs

I am trying to include WinPcap library in one of my Visual C++ program and I am using Visual Studio 10 Ultimate. In the documentation it says To add a preprocessor definition, you must select Properties from the Project menu, then select C/C++ from the list control on the left, and under the category Preprocessor, you must add the definition under the Preprocessor Definitions text box. Project -> Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions-> Added WPCAP I have performed this step successfully, then To add a new library to the project, you must select Properties from the Project menu, then select Linker from the list control on the left, and under the category Input add the name of the new library in the Additional Dependencies text box. Project -> Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies -> Added wpcap.lib Now I have problem while performing the third step. To add a new path where Microsoft Visual Studio will look for the libraries, you must select Options from the Tools menu, then Project and Solutions from the list control on the left, VC++ Directories, then choose Library Files in the Show directories for combobox, and the add the path in the box below. Tools -> Options -> Project and Solutions -> VC++ Directories. Here it says VC++ Directories editing in Tools > Options has been deprecated. Now where is this user property sheet located ? Can some one point me in a right direction? Thanks.
