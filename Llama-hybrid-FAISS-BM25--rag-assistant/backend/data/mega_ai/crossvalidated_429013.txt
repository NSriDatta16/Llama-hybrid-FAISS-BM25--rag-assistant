I am not sure if the title and the body of your question are asking about the same thing, but I will try to answer in a general way to cover both. \begin{aligned} \text{AIC}&=-2(\text{loglik}-p) \\ &=-2(n\times \text{avg(loglik)}-p) \end{aligned} where $n$ is the sample size used for estimation, $p$ is the number of the model's degrees of freedom (a measure of model's flexibility), $\text{loglik}$ is the log-likelihood of the sample data according to the model and $\text{avg(loglik)}$ is the average log-likelihood per observation. AIC allows assessing the expected log-likelihood of the model on a new data point based on a given estimation sample. (Actually, the estimate for a single new data point is $\frac{\text{AIC}}{-2n}$ .) It does so by weighting fit ( $\text{loglik}$ ) against model flexibility ( $p$ ). As the sample size $n$ increases, average per-observation fit ( $\text{avg(loglik)}$ ) should improve because the estimation variance should shrink. Moreover, the weight of fit ( $n$ ) in determining the value of AIC would grow since the log-likelihood is summed over the observations. Both of these developments point in the same direction. Consequently, AIC would prefer more complex models in larger samples. When the estimation sample is an entire finite population , there can be no new data points to be predicted, so model choice based on AIC (motivated by achieving high likelihood on a new data point) is not directly relevant. In an infinite population , the estimation variance would be zero and only model bias (and - when it comes to forecasting - irreducible error) would be left. The likelihood would be summed over an infinite number of points ( $n=\infty$ ), dominating the complexity penalty ( $p$ ). Hence, the most flexible model would be chosen by AIC. (Stricly speaking, AIC might not be defined on an infinite sample, but we can still ponder how it would behave in the limit.) As such, we would not need AIC for model selection: pure model fit (the likelihood) would be enough. Given the considerations above, I think AIC-based model selection is hard to interpret on a population level.
