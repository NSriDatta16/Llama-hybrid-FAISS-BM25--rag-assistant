In the first example you can use this: #comment1 .helpText #comment2 .helpText #comment3 .helpText You don't have to define an id for the helpText elements, but a class with class="helpText" . You can also manipulate all children divs by using the following rules: #comment1 div #comment2 div #comment3 div If you want to manipulate all children of a "comment" node you cnn add class="comment" to these comment divs and access them with div.comment
