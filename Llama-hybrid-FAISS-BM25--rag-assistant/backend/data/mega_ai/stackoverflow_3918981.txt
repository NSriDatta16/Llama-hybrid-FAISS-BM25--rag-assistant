There are many solutions, which allow code generation from models, which are free. Look for example at the Topcased project. As said above, except from the validation part (if it is validation method which can be or already is automated), you really do not need any tools at all. However tools still can bring you advantage. Generally speaking, there are many tools which are not that good (e.g. support for all UML elements), so you should check if a tool fits your needs, if you cannot find one, use pencil and paper.
