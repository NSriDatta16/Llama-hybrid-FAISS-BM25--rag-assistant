Logistic Regression is a type of generalized linear model, and hence is analogous to linear regression. Because of this, the ability to handle a non-linear relationship is limited with Logistic Regression. On the other hand, tree-based models can capture non-linear relationships very well. I think the reason why you're seeing a variable that is important for a tree-based model, but not significant for Logistic Regression, is because that variable has a non-linear relationship with the target (dependent) variable.
