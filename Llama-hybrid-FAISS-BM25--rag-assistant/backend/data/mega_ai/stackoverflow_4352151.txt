We use MVC on all but the smallest projects. So in the "Classes" folder we start by adding three folders, Model, View, and Controller. Under those directories we might create subfolders grouped by functionality with the app (controllers for various subsections, etc.). You can add files directly to Xcode or the folders themselves. Similarly we have a Resources directory, usually in the same directory as the .xcodeproj file and under that folders for Images, Nibs, Audio, etc. Of course the above just describes a disk-based organization strategy. Since Objective-C is still C, you can build libraries and header files for APIs that you want to export. You can also use categories. Many of our projects reference a /Common directory that is outside of the project folder (and under Common we have Model, View, Controller, etc.). Sometimes we copy files from Common into the project if we expect to make significant changes to them that we don't want other projects to inherit.
