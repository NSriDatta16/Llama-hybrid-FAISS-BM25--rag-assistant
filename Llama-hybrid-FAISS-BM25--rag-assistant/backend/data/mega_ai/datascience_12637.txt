^ I completely agree with the answer above from Hima Varsha, however I wanted to add that sometimes there is different names for testing sets. A data science company I used to work for would use a training set, validation set, testing set, and sometimes a third testing set called a "holdout set". I'm not sure if that was particular to the company I was working for, but you might see it crop up in literature or documentation in the future. Also, there is a third metric that almost always goes along with precision and recall called the F1 score . This is actually calculated from both precision and recall, but commonly used as a summary of both precision and recall.
