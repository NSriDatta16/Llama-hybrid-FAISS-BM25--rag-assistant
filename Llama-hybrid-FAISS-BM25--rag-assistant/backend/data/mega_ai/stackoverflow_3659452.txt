I have two approaches for you: First: You could store these values in a temporary array and count the items, if there are less than 24, something went wrong! $tmp_arr = explode($delimiter, $line); if(count($tmp_arr) If you don't like the temporary array, you could count the delimiters (not as good in my opinion) if(substr_count($line, $delimiter) !Attention! you only have 23 delimiters for 24 fields! ;) Second Approach: Since the Undefined Offset issue is just a "Notice" from PHP you could write an error handler which catches the notice. See: http://www.codeunit.co.za/2009/09/09/php-how-to-catch-a-script-warning-or-notice/ But this one maybe a little overkill ;) Best Regards Simon
