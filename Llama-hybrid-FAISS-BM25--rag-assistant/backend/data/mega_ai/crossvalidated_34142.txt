This is not an issue that is typically addressed in time series analysis. I do not think there is any literature to point to that would address your problem. I think you have a fundamental difficulty in that it is not possible to minimize error when you have no true values to compare your predictions to. How can you figure out the proper lag for a series without the actual data? You can certainly fit individual time series to each of entities. But the best way to combine these series to predict the true price is not determinable.
