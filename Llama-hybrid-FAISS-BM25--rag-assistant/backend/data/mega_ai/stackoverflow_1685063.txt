Six degrees of Kevin Bacon in Perl

First yes, this is a homework project for my Perl class. I am not looking for the answer (although that would be sweet). As I understand it I need to use a BFS and a regular expression to organize my data for use. I need some direction on this one. How do I use a BFS? Do I use a massive stack and go through each item in the stack? Should I use a giant hash table? Has anyone worked on this problem? How did you go about doing it? I just need some direction is all. Is this similar to a BST? Is this possible without using the graph module? Is this possible using hash values?
