Classification & Regression Trees (CART)

It seems that most CART examples I encounter involve splitting the sample into a training sample and test sample. This split sample method strikes me as terribly inefficient unless you have a large sample. Are there alternatives to this method if you want to use CART? Or is one better off using logistic regression followed by bootstrapping to assess model over-optimism (as discussed by Harrell)?
