Should I only be testing public interfaces in BDD? (in general, and specifically in Ruby)

I'm reading through the (still beta) rspec book by the prag progs as I'm interested in behavioral testing on objects. From what I've gleaned so far (caveat: after only reading for 30 min), the basic idea is that I want ensure my object behaves as expected 'externally' i.e. in its output and in relation to other objects. Is it true then that I should just be black box testing my object to ensure the proper output/interaction with other objects? This may be completely wrong, but given all of the focus on how my object behaves in the system, it seems this is ideology one would take. If that's so, how do we focus on the implementation of an object? How do I test that my private method is doing what I want it to do for all different types of input? I suppose this question is maybe valid for all types of testing?? I'm still fairly new to TDD and BDD.
