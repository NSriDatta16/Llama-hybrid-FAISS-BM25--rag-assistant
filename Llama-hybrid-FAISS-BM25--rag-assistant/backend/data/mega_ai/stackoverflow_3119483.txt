Is there any reason you can't maintain a mirror (updated in the background however often you want) of the remote repository on your local machine, then have the release management tool on your local machine run hg archive out of the local clone as necessary? If your concern is user-responsiveness, and not total bandwidth/storage consumed, this offsets the "slow" part to where you won't see it. Tim Post noted that if you do have the hgweb CGI interface available, you can configure it to pull compressed archives down and unpack them (and the interface is consistent enough that you could script that via wget), but if you don't, core Mercurial doesn't have a lot of tools to help you, and the developers have expressed an opposition to trying to turn Mercurial into a general rsync-type client. If you aren't afraid of playing with unofficial add-ons, you could have a look at the FTP Extension . That will force you to push from the server, however.
