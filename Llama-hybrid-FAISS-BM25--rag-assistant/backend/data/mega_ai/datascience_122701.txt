Variable length training data for tabular data neural network regression

I want to predict the age of a parent using the ages of its children. The problem is that in the data each parent has different numbers of children. How do I create a model that can take variable number of children ages as input? For example X1 = {1,5} Y1 = 31 X2 = {18] Y2 = 38 X3 = {1,3,3,7,10,15} Y3 = 45 One thing I've thought of is to calculate the average and variance of the ages, and use that as input. But I feel that information is lost that way.
