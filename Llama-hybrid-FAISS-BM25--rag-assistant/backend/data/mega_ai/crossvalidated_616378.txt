Doing T-test across two data sets to validate null hypothesis

I have two features. I need to perform T-test for these two datasets but with the same model. train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y = model_selection.train_test_split(X_pac, labels, test_size=0.2) train_x1, test_x1, train_y1, test_y1 = model_selection.train_test_split(author_post_new, labels, test_size=0.2) I need to perform T-test for the SVM model on these two datasets. How can I do that? Update: I need to T-Test to check whether the Sentiment feature has a significant role in identifying gender from text. I have computed the TF-IDF feature and got author_post_new . I have applied the Sentiment feature on the dataset and got X_pac from the dataset. Now I want to determine whether the Sentiment feature has a significant role in identifying gender.
