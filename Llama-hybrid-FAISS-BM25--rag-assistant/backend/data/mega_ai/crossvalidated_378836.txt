What is the bias in PCA regression?

Assuming we have $n$ principal components and use $k for a linear regression. What is the bias of the l.s.e estimator $\hat \beta$ for the slope parameter using just these k components of the transformed design matrix instead of the full transformed design matrix ? Edit: I am talking about a model $y = Z\beta+\epsilon $ Where $Z$ is the transformation of the design matrix $X$ to the space of $k$ principal components. If I would take $k=n$ than $\hat \beta$ would be equivalent to the least square estimate of the original data. But since I cut off some principal components I lower the variance but introduce a bias. Therefore I want to calculate the bias with respect to the l.s.e of the untransformed data with the model: $y = X \gamma+\epsilon$
