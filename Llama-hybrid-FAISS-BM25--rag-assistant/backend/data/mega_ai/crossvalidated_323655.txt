As I understand it, you have a time series of values $X_1, ..., X_n$ that is growing over time. You can form the corresponding continuous growth rates $\delta_2, ..., \delta_n$ by using standard rate calculations, depending on how you want to measure the rate of growth. The variation in the values of $X_1, ..., X_n$ is affected by growth over time, and so if you take the sample variance of these values, some of that sample variance will be attributable to growth. However, the sample variance of the growth rates $\delta_2, ..., \delta_n$ automatically filters out the mean growth rate, and measures the variation in the rates of growth rather than the variation in the value of the original series. Perhaps this is what you're looking for?
