From the Wikipedia Quicksort page : Conversely, once we know a worst-case selection algorithm is available, we can use it to find the ideal pivot (the median) at every step of quicksort, producing a variant with worst-case O(n log n) running time. In practical implementations, however, this variant is considerably slower on average. In other words, the cost of forcing it to be guaranteed O(n log n) is generally not worth paying. There's more information on that page, as well as on the selection algorithms page.
