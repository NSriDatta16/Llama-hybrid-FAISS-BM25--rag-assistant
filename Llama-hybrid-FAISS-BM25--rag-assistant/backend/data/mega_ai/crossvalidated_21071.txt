Technical variation versus real signal

I'm testing for difference in a continuous outcome under three different conditions. Under condition A I take a measurement of the outcome. I do this twice for the same sample. Example values could be 2.2, 2.1. These are "technical" replicates that come from the same biological source I do the same for four "biological" replicates for condition A: A1, measure 1: 2.2 A1, measure 2: 2.1 A2, measure 1: 2.0 A2, measure 2: 2.1 A3, measure 1: 1.9 A3, measure 2: 1.8 A4, measure 1: 1.5 A4, measure 2: 1.6 I also have conditions B, C, and D, with two "technical" replicates in each of four "biological" replicates. How would I test test for mean differences (ANOVA) that best accounts for both the technical and biological variation? I wouldn't want to fit a model counting each measurement as a separate observation, because each pair comes from the same biological sample. I'm assuming there must be a better way than just averaging over the pairs. Bonus: how do you do this in R? Assuming I have data that looks like this: > data condition sample measurement outcome 1 A 1 1 2.2 2 A 1 2 2.1 3 A 2 1 2.0 4 A 2 2 2.1 5 A 3 1 1.9 6 A 3 2 1.8 7 A 4 1 1.5 8 A 4 2 1.6 9 B 1 1 1.7 10 B 1 2 1.6 11 B 2 1 1.5 12 B 2 2 1.6 13 B 3 1 1.4 14 B 3 2 1.3 15 B 4 1 1.0 16 B 4 2 1.1 17 C 1 1 2.4 18 C 1 2 2.3 19 C 2 1 2.2 20 C 2 2 2.3 21 C 3 1 2.1 22 C 3 2 2.0 23 C 4 1 1.7 24 C 4 2 1.8 I probably wouldn't want to do something like this: summary(lm(outcome~condition, data=data)) Thanks in advance.
