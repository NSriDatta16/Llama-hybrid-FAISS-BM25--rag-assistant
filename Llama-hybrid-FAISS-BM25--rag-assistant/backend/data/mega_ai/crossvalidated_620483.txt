Neural network regression - predicting mean and standard deviation

I have a dataset where for the same input, you get slightly varying results. In the final dataset I am using there are 4 input/output pairs for every input where the input is exactly the same but the output is slightly different. What are ways to handle this in a machine learning model? Some ideas I was thinking about: Take the mean and standard deviation of these 4 outputs and construct a single input/output pair having a mean and standard deviation as output to train for. So for every input, we would now be predicting a mean value and a standard deviation value. Just use the 4 pairs as they are. The machine learning model might learn automatically to 'balance out' given each pair is pulling the weights for a certain output. How would you handle this situation? I could not find relevant literature on this topic, could someone possibly show some articles which are related to this.
