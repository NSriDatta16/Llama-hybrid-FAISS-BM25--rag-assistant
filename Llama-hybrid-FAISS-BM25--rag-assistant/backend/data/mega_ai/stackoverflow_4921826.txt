Android ADB Cannot Find Samsung Captivate

I have tried downloading the Samsung specific drivers. It installs the modem, not sure if the adb bridge got installed. I don't see it in the device manager. I have installed kies 2.0, I have tried connecting USB via MASS storage, via Kies, and under no circumstances so far will ADB detect the device when running adb devices command. I got lots of suggestions to use Kies, I tried this. Don't see any real relationship between Kies and ADB which is a debug bridge. I simply have no clue what ADB is doing when I type adb devices. How does it look for devices, where does it check, where can i register my device with ADB?
