Are the same number of trees required to compare Random Forest against GBM?

My training set has 13,737 observations with 53 predictors. I need to compare the accuracy of Random Forest vs. GBM. For Random Forest, I set ntree = 128 [based on Oshiro et al. (2012)] in train(data=trainset, y~., method = "rf", ntree = 128) because the default (500) was taking far too long. At 128 trees, it took 1.25 hours. Now in train(data=trainset, y~., method = "gbm", verbose = FALSE) , I have not changed the default n.tree value (100). It has been running for 2 hour now... Should I set n.tree in gbm also to 128? Would it be wrong to compare it against random forest otherwise? Please advise. Thank you!
