Bayesian Inference Formulation

I am new to Bayesian inference so I apologise in advance if this seems a basic or poorly described question. I am trying to perform the fusion of probabilities of multiple data points. To do this I am trying to formulate how I can do this with Bayesian inference. I understand how Bayesian inference can obtain a probability for two data points on the same distribution. However, I now have two separate datasets of priors for two separate sources. I am given to understand that Bayesian inference must be conducted with independent and identically distributed variables. The two sets of priors in my case are not identically distributed. Can I still perform Bayesian inference? I have considered a normalisation approach to get them on the same distribution but this seems like a poor solution.
