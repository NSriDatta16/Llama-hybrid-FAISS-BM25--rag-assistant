When embedding Java in a C++ application, which files do I need to take?

Our C++ application hosts Sun's JVM and I need to upgrade it to the newest version on Windows. I downloaded JDK 6u20, but I have no idea which folders to take into our installation. We currently have some version of Java 5 but it seems that whoever did it in the first place, cherry picked the files. I'd like to know which folders to take from the installation of JDK. We are using JNI so I will also need all the include files/libs. Also, the Java people are saying that I should take the files from JDK installation rather than the JRE, is there any difference? Maybe in the jars that ship in the JDK's JRE?
