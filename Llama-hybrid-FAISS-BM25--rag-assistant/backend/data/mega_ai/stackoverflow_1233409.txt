Discriminator Property

Working through this step by step guide. I am trying to create the inheritance between BirthAppointment / tblAppointment. However I need the Discriminator Property to be set to appCatId. The appCatId is held within tblAppointmentType. How can I access this. alt text http://www.zero7web.com/RegBook-linq.jpg Thanks in advance for your help. Clare
