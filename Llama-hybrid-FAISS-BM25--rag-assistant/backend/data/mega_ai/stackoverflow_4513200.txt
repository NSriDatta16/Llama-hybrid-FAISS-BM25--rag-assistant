If you are interested in the performance of your procedural PL/SQL code you may want to investigate PL/SQL Profiling. The Profiler allows you to collect information about the run-time performance of your PL/SQL. After the profiling run is complete you can report on the results and view information like # of times each line was executed, average execution time of each line. This can help you identify bottlenecks and should point you to the first things that may need tuning attention. Your biggest potential payoff is by looking at the worst performing code and making it run better. Once that is improved, profile again to verify your improvements and to find the next statement that may need attention. A good first introduction is here: Oracle's DBMS Profiler
