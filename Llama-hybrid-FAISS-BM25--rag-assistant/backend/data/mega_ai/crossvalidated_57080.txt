A positive interaction effect between A and B means that when A increases, the effect (in this case log odds ratio) of B increases. A negative interaction effect means that when A increases, the effect of B decreases. When interpreting the results, I often find it easiest to work in the odds metric rather than the log(odds) metric. I tend to start with the baseline odds just to refresh my (and my audience's) memory on what odds are, then continue to interpret the odds ratios of the main effects (odds ratios are literary that: ratios of odds), and then go on to the interaction effects, which in logistic regression are ratios of odds ratios. A complete example is given in my answer to Interpreting interaction terms in logit regression with categorical variables
