The storage engine (MyISAM) DOES support repair table. You should be able to repair it. If the repair fails then it's a sign that the table is very corrupted, you have no choice but to restore it from backups. If you have other systems (e.g. non-production with same software versions and schema) with an identical table then you might be able to fix it with some hackery (copying the frm an MYI files, followed by a repair). In essence, the trick is to avoid getting broken tables in the first place. This means always shutting your db down cleanly, never having it crash and never having hardware or power problems. In practice this isn't very likely, so if durability matters you may want to consider a more crash-safe storage engine.
