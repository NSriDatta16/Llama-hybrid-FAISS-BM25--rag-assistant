Using FolderBrowserDialog on a Removable Device / Removable storage

I'm working on a simple copy tool to copy files off digital cameras. I've written the file copy code, I've got everything hooked up nicely. The issue I have seems to be with the FolderBrowserDialog. In Vista (I haven't checked XP yet), I can browse to the directories on the camera. However the FolderBrowserDialog will not let me select a directory on the camera. The OK button is greyed out. Looking at the path for the files on the camera it looks like this: Computer\[Camera Name]\Removable storage\AnotherDirectory\ As this is not a valid path (intead of C:\whatever), I'm guessing the FolderBrowserDialog doesn't like this. It works fine from a valid path name, but not off the camera... Does anyone have any suggestions to get around this? Update To confirm oefe's question the path is actually displayed as: Computer\[Camera Name]\Removable storage\AnotherDirectory\ ChulioMartinez's suggestion of using SHBrowseForFolder does work, and I will mark as the correct answer. Thanks for your help Chulio.
