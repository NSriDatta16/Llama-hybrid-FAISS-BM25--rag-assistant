The worst case is not the page found after 100 dice rolls. That would be is your dice always returned different numbers. The worst case is that you never find the page (the way you stated the problem). The average case is not average of the best and worst cases, fortunately. The average case is: 1 * (probability of finding page on the first dice roll) + 2 * (probability of finding page on the second dice roll) + ... And yes, the sum is infinite, since in thinking about the worst case we determined that you may have an arbitrarily large number of dice rolls. It doesn't mean that it can't be computed (it could mean that, but it doesn't have to). The probability of finding the page on the first try is 1/100 . What's the probability of finding it on the second dice roll?
