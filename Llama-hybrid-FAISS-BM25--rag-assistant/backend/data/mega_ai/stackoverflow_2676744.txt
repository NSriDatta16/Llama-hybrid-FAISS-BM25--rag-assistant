Set HTTP Caching Expiration, Recommended by Google PageSpeed

I ran tests on my website using Google's PageSpeed and it recommends that I "Leverage browser caching" and provided the following resource: http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/caching.html#LeverageBrowserCaching This resource never explains how to actually change the expiration date of my http headers. Do I do this through .htaccess? I would like to set the caching for as long as possible (without violating Google's policy of a year max). Any advice on recommended settings (for a custom php-driven social networking community) would be greatly appreciated.
