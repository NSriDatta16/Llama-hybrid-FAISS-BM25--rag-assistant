UIViewController not receiving touchesBegan message

I have a pretty simple UIViewController. It's initialized with a view I've created in Interaface Builder, which contains only a UIImageView. When the user touches the screen, I want the touchesBegan message of UIViewController to get called. So, I override it and added some logging, but nothing has happened. I haven't done anything "special" at all, as since UIViewController inherits from UIResponder, I expect this to work right out of the box. From what I understand UIImageViews have user interaction disabled by default, so I have enabled it, both via InterfaceBuilder and in my UIViewcontroller's viewDidLoad method (I have tied the UIImageView to an IBOutlet). I also am ensuring that userInteraction is enabled in the parent view in Interface Builder. Anything else that I am forgetting here?
