Any interesting stats from hand washing data?

I installed a flow meter on a faucet in one of my school's dorm buildings, with the intention of trying to gather some interesting data on patterns at the faucet. It collects flow readings on the sink, every second. I have gathered the duration, the amount of water used, and whether they used the hot or cold faucet. I would like to use this data to train a neural network model to identify hand-washing events from a set of data that it doesn't know the classification vector for. What types of models (I'm using Python) could I use to train a neural network to identify patterns like this? Also, what types of other stats aside from average wash duration time could I gather from the data?
