root.plist changes not visible on iphone

when i add new entries to my settings bundle root.plist file, build and run the app, the new settings are not visible within the app. I've of course used a unique key for the new entries. In my root.plist file in the xcode project the file shows the changes, but when i get the current file from the iphone via the organizer, the changes are not there. I am using iOs 4.0.1. BR, Martin
