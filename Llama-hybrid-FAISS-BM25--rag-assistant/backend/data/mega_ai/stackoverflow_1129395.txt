Maybe a few iFrames and some Comet/long-polling? Have the comment submission in an iFrame (so the whole page doesn't reload), and then show the result in the long-polled iFrame... Having said that, it's a pretty bad design idea, and you probably don't want to be doing this. AJAX/JavaScript is pretty much the way to go for things like this. I have heard it's possible with AJAX...but I was wondering if it was possible to do with Django. There's no reason you can't use both - specifically, AJAX within a Django web application. Django provides your organization and framework needs (and a page that will respond to AJAX requests) and then use some JavaScript on the client side to make AJAX calls to your Django-backed page that will respond correctly. I suggest you go find a basic jQuery tutorial which should explain enough basic JavaScript to get this working.
