Reference implementation of q-learning in Python

I'm a machine learning newbie, trying to learn Q-learning. I read a few texts and I get the general gist, but what I'd really love to see is a simple example of a Q-learning algorithm in Python that I could run and play around with. It can solve the simplest of games, I'm not looking for anything fancy. I've searched and found lots of examples that use the gym framework. This framework looks great, and I'll probably use it later, but I want the most no-frills version of a Q-learning algorithm, with nothing being done automatically for me. I think this will help me get a better understanding of everything that's going on. Do you know of a simple Python implementation of Q-learning?
