Proof of Concept!! I can't say it loud enough, but this is a prime example of where a proof of concept would help prove which approach is going to make more sense for your organization. It could turn out that he can build the system you described and have it humming in a few days, where it would take you several weeks to get up to speed on WWF. Or conversely (and I think this is what you're assuming) his POC will be buggy and lacking in features where your WWF POC will be done much faster and be much more robust. But you'll never know unless you try it out ... until then, if he has the clout, I guess he wins :-P
