Covariance structure for several mixed models with similar dependent variables

I want to fit several mixed models which only differ by their dependent variable. However these dependent variables are not totally different but fatty acids with similar characteristics. I know there are several possible covariance structures which seem reasonable. However, the covariance structure with the highest fit (according to BIC, AIC, AICc) is not identical across these fatty acids even though the results are quite close. So my question is, what to do select the best covariance structure for each fatty acid independently select the (on average?) best covariance structure across the different fatty acids I would also be delighted if someone could provide some further references to read. All articles that I found only discussed selecting the covariance structure for a single model.
