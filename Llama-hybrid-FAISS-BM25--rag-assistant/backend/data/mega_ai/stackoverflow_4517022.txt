Wrapping a paragraph inside a div?

How do I make my paragraph wrap inside my div? It is currently overflowing outside of the div and I have no idea how to stop the paragraph from overflowing over the edge. I do not want a scroll bar with: overflow: scroll; and the other overflow options don't seem to help here either... I have the following code: div { width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto; } .container { overflow: hidden; } .content { width: 1000px; float: left; margin-left: 0; text-align: left; } .rightpanel { width: 190px; float: right; margin-right: 0; } Some content flowing over more than one line Edit: Full age sex set feel her told. Tastes giving in passed direct me valley as supply. End great stood boy noisy often way taken short. Rent the size our more door. Years no place abode in no child my. Man pianoforte too solicitude friendship devonshire ten ask. Course sooner its silent but formal she led. Extensive he assurance extremity at breakfast. Dear sure ye sold fine sell on. Projection at up connection literature insensible motionless projecting. Be at miss or each good play home they. It leave taste mr in it fancy. She son lose does fond bred gave lady get.
