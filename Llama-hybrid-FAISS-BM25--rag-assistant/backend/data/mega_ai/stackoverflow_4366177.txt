Static block on home page in Magento

I am trying to add a static block to the home page of a Magento site using the layout XML file. I can see how to add and remove block inside a reference, but I am struggling to see how to add it for a specific page, i.e. the home page. home-page-block How would I wrap this code in the page.xml file for it to be only used on the homepage? Or is there a better way? Should the home page be a new template?
