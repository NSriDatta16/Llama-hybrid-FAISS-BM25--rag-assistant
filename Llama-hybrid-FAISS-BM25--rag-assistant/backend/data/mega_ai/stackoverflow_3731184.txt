Don't do it. You should never rely on the actual value of your ID column. Treat it like a black box, only useful for doing key lookups. You say "less storage required per record," but how important is that? How big are the rows we're talking about? If you've got 200-byte rows, another 4 bytes probably isn't going to matter much. Don't optimize without measuring. Get it working right first, and THEN optimize.
