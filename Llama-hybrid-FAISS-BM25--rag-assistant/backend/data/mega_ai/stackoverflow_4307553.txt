Unresponsive application after launched with JNLP

I'm looking into the JNLP stuff and I decided to try to run a small application that I made with JNLP. I created a simple java program and the jnlp file. I upload both the jar file and the jnlp file to my apache server, along with an html file to display the Launch button. This is the jnlp file (I'm not 100% sure if it's correct): Example Dev The following is my html file on my apache server: Example // using JavaScript to get location of JNLP file relative to HTML page var dir = location.href.substring(0, location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1); var url = dir + "example.jnlp"; document.alert(dir); deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url, '1.6.0'); The problem is, when I click the Launch button it asks if I want to run example.jnlp. Then after a bit the application just opens up but when I click any the buttons they do nothing. It's as if the GUI is showing but all over the under lying logic is not there. Any idea what may be the issue?
