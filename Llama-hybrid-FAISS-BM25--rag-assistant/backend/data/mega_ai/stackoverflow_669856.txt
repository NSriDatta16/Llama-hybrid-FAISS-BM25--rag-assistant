Rails is all about convention over configuration. You have to buy into the conventions if you want the convenience that Rails brings. I would strongly encourage sticking to the RESTful model and accept what rails is doing now. With that said, you can probably hack something together. It won't be pretty and it'll be a pain every time you want to create a link. So first get rid of map.resources :projects, :has_many => :pages map.connect ':controller/:action/:id' map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.:format' because the map.resources is thing that is sending you to url you don't want and the two map.connect 's don't help you either. So now you should just have map.connect ':project_id/:id', :controller => 'pages', :action => 'show' map.connect ':id', :controller => 'projects', :action => 'show' Then when ever you want to create a link you are going to have to make it yourself. You are going to want to use something like this: @project, :id => @project.pages.first %> or something like that. I don't know if that is exactly how are going to specify the route, you are probably going to have to change the :project_id and :id symbols. Like I said you don't want to take this route if you don't have to. Stick to the conventions as much as you can because it'll make your life much easier.
