As already noted, generally, there will be one header (.h) file for each source (.c or .cpp) file. However, you should look at the cohesiveness of the files. If the various source files provide separate, individually reusable sets of functions - an ideal organization - then you should certainly have one header per file. If, however, the three source files provide a composite set of functions (that is too big to fit into one file), then you would use a more complex organization. There would be one header for the external services used by the main program - and that would be used by other programs needing the same services. There would also be a second header used by the cooperating source files that provides 'internal' definitions shared by those files. (Also noted by Pax): The main program does not normally need its own header - no other source code should be using the services it provides; it uses the services provided by other files.
