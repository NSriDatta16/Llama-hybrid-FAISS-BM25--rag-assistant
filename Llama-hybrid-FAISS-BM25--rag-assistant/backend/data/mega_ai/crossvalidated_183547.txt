I took a look at the data that you've posted. I appreciate your question because it gave me the opportunity to run it through with the software Autobox. You are quite correct when you say that there is a structural break in 2004, but had you considered that there may be multiple candidates for a break in parameters? See the following table for a list of these candidates. DIAGNOSTIC CHECK #4: THE CHOW PARAMETER CONSTANCY TEST The Critical value used for this test : .05 The minimum group or interval size was: 51 F TEST TO VERIFY CONSTANCY OF PARAMETERS CANDIDATE BREAKPOINT F VALUE P VALUE 52 2004/ 1 3.69947 .0267988938 57 2004/ 6 3.71222 .0264738875 62 2004/ 11 3.21210 .0427876196 67 2005/ 4 3.58410 .0299305651 72 2005/ 9 3.32751 .0382910942 77 2006/ 2 2.25996 .1075565489 82 2006/ 7 1.67456 .1905412741 87 2006/ 12 2.15920 .1186484852 92 2007/ 5 3.08986 .0481356253 97 2007/ 10 5.95847 .0031691039 102 2008/ 3 .291259 .7477028638 107 2008/ 8 1.21682 .2987975860 The table above is quite illuminating, and provides a useful illustration of why iterative selection processes can sometimes do better than the human eye. Not that any of this is your fault -- you've got a difficult data set in front of you. Am [I] to create a dummy variable for it taking value of 1 between 2004-2009 and 0 otherwise would that be correct? You were quite correct with not only the above statement but also the following one. This is the issue in time series. The Chicken or the Egg. So your next best bet is to take it in steps--try your AR(1)[12] with encoded level shifts, and then do the process in reverse. Eventually, both should converge on an answer; but that is only if your inclination of seasonality was right. If you look at the partial autocorrelation function or autocorrelation function of the series you have put forth, neither of them suggest the need for seasonal differencing. Autobox, after using the Chow test, determined that neither of the above was necessary. Candidate Period 97 (August 2007) was found to be the most statistically significant breakpoint. After deleting the first 96 values, things look a lot different than before. Y(T) =1649.3 +[X1(T)][(+ 2040.7 )] :PULSE 2008/ 9 108 +[X2(T)][(+ 1888.7 )] :PULSE 2009/ 6 117 +[X3(T)][(- 1144.0 )] :PULSE 2008/ 1 100 +[X4(T)][(+ 1797.5 )] :PULSE 2009/ 4 115 +[X5(T)][(+ 1543.3 )] :PULSE 2009/ 5 116 + [(1- .594B** 1)]**-1 [A(T)] It seems that the data is sufficiently explained by an AR(1) with a few identifiable outliers.
