Seeking suggestions regarding JIRA customizations for a "Periodic Tasks" project

I am tasked with establishing a JIRA project for "Periodic Tasks" like software license and SSL certificate renewals, manual review of logs, annual year-end database processes, re-authorization of external users, etc. I am sure our organization is not the first to use JIRA for this purpose. I am interested in corresponding with others who have gone down this road. I would like to see what custom fields, screens, workflows, etc. have proved useful. I have created a new project, set the key, description, project lead... and created a new Periodic Tasks Issue Type Scheme with just issue types "task" and "sub-task". I also created a Periodic Tasks Notification Scheme; right now it is an exact copy of our default notification scheme, but it seems likely that they will diverge. My permission scheme and issue security scheme are default, but, I can easily imagine some environments where these periodic tasks might require different security (in our case the developers and operations people work pretty close -- in fact sometimes we are the same person.) Right now I am using the default workflow, but, I expect to change that as soon as I get enough experience to confidently understand the requirements. But when I come to Components, I am of two minds. One approach would be to try to organize this by our components. Perhaps categories of components: servers, certificates, software licenses.... Another approach is to use Components to categorize by type of task: license renewal, certificate renewal, year-end process.... I have implemented as the type of task because I think that this will be a smaller and more stable list of categories. I am particularly interested in seeing workflow examples from others who are doing something similar.
