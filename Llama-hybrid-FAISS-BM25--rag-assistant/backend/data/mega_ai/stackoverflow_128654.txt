Make criteria public and do not connect incentives with any sort of automation . Publicize examples of what you are looking for. Be nice and encourage people to publicize their own bad examples (and how they corrected them). Part of the culture of the team is what "good code" is; it's subjective to many people, but a functioning team should have a clear answer that everyone on the team agrees upon. Anyone who doesn't agree will bring the team down.
