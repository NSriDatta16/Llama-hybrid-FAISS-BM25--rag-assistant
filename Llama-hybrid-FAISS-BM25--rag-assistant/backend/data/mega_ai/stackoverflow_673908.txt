Eclipse Plugin Fragment

Does anyone have a "hello world" sample or tutorial for creating an Eclipse plugin fragment? I have a working host plugin that, for the sake of simplicity, is just this... public void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception { System.out.println("Hello...."); super.start(context); plugin = this; } public void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception { System.out.println("Goodbye..."); plugin = null; super.stop(context); } Simple enough and works. Now I want to add a fragment to that host, which seems not as simple as creating a plugin host. I just don't see how to create a fragment project and add logic to it. Let's say I just want to do something simple and have the fragment to print a "Hello2" at start() and "Goodbye2" at stop() . Can someone give me a working example?
