What books should I read to have an undergraduate education in Computer Science?

I've always been a largely independent learner gleaning what I can from Wikipedia and various books. However, I fear that I may have biased my self-education by inadvertent omission of topics and concepts. My goal is to teach myself the equivalent of an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from a top university (doesn't matter which one). To that end, I've purchased and started reading a few academic textbooks: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs Introduction to Algorithms Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach As well as a few textbooks I have left over from classes I've taken at a mediocre-at-best state university: An Introduction to Computer Simulation Methods Calculus: Concepts and Connections Computer Organization and Architecture Operating System Concepts A First Course in Database Systems Formal Languages and Automata My questions are: What topics aren't covered by this collection? Are there any books that are more rigorous or thorough (or even easier to read) than a book listed here? Are there any books that are a waste of my time? In what order should I read the books? What does an MIT or Stanford (or UCB or CMU ...) undergrad learn that I might miss? Software engineering books are welcome, but in the context of academic study only please. I'm aware of Code Complete and the Pragmatic Programmer, but I'm looking for a more theoretical approach. Thanks!
