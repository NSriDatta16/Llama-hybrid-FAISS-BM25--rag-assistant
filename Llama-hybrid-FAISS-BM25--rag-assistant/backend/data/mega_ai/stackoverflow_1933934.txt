Injecting JavaScript into head element of website using Fiddler

I was thinking of using Fiddler for the following purpose... I have a JavaScript based service I want to demonstrate to potential clients. In order to show them what their website could look like if they install (i.e. include) my script, I want to set up Fiddler on my PC, so that when fetching the client's website, the line will be included in the HTML section. Can this be easily done with Fiddler? Could someone point me to where I may find the documentation covering that, if it is? Thanks! ----Update---- For the time being I have resorted to using a BHO to add my script to the page. I use execScript(), upon onDocumentComplete, to run a simple piece of JavaScript which appends the .js file I need to the page. But EricLaw's pointers and jitter's answer seem like the way to go for a more complete (and elegant) way to do what I need. If someone is interested I could upload the BHO code here. -Thanks!
