Accounts XML from array, containing members

I'm sure this has been asked before, but struggling to find the correct search terms. I have an array; that is ultimately built from a SQL query $users = array('peter','megan','michael'); What I am trying to end up is XML structure of each user, with the other user's in the array as members. Like: peter megan michael megan peter michael michael peter megan Anyone shed some light on how to do this?
