fragments. The relation holds whenever the truth of one text fragment follows from another text. In the TE framework, the entailing and entailed texts are termed text (t) and hypothesis (h), respectively. The relation is directional because even if "t entails h", the reverse "h entails t" is much less certain. Triphone – sequence of three phonemes. Triphones are useful in models of natural-language processing where they are used to establish the various contexts in which a phoneme can occur in a particular natural language. Processes of NLP Applications Automated essay scoring (AES) – the use of specialized computer programs to assign grades to essays written in an educational setting. It is a method of educational assessment and an application of natural-language processing. Its objective is to classify a large set of textual entities into a small number of discrete categories, corresponding to the possible grades—for example, the numbers 1 to 6. Therefore, it can be considered a problem of statistical classification. Automatic image annotation – process by which a computer system automatically assigns textual metadata in the form of captioning or keywords to a digital image. The annotations are used in image retrieval systems to organize and locate images of interest from a database. Automatic summarization – process of reducing a text document with a computer program in order to create a summary that retains the most important points of the original document. Often used to provide summaries of text of a known type, such as articles in the financial section of a newspaper. Types Keyphrase extraction – Document summarization – Multi-document summarization – Methods and techniques Extraction-based summarization – Abstraction-based summarization – Maximum entropy-based summarization – Sentence extraction – Aided summarization – Human aided machine summarization (HAMS) – Machine aided human summarization (MAHS) – Automatic taxonomy induction – automated construction of tree structures from a corpus. This may be applied to building taxonomical classification systems for reading by end users, such as web directories or subject outlines. Coreference resolution – in order to derive the correct interpretation of text, or even to estimate the relative importance of various mentioned subjects, pronouns and other referring expressions need to be connected to the right individuals or objects. Given a sentence or larger chunk of text, coreference resolution determines which words ("mentions") refer to which objects ("entities") included in the text. Anaphora resolution – concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names that they refer to. For example, in a sentence such as "He entered John's house through the front door", "the front door" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to). Dialog system – Foreign-language reading aid – computer program that assists a non-native language user to read properly in their target language. The proper reading means that the pronunciation should be correct and stress to different parts of the words should be proper. Foreign-language writing aid – computer program or any other instrument that assists a non-native language user (also referred to as a foreign-language learner) in writing decently in their target language. Assistive operations can be classified into two categories: on-the-fly prompts and post-writing checks. Grammar checking – the act of verifying the grammatical correctness of written text, especially if this act is performed by a computer program. Information retrieval – Cross-language information retrieval – Machine translation (MT) – aims to automatically translate text from one human language to another. This is one of the most difficult problems, and is a member of a class of problems colloquially ter
