Elasticity with log + 1

I am running time series regressions to estimate the percentage change in quantity to a percentage change in price, with the most basic form being $\ln Q = \beta_0 + \beta_1\ln P + \varepsilon$, where $\ln Q$ and $\ln P$ are the log of quantity and price respectively. My question is if anyone knows about the validity of taking $log(q + 1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\log(p + 1) + \varepsilon$? The reason for the transformation is obviously to deal with zeros (that is, time periods with zero sales).
