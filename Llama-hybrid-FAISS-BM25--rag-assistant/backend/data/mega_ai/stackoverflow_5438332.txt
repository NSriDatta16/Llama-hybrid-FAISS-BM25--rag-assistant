eclipse complains: Can not find the tag directory "/WEB-INF/tags/" but it really does exist

I have a Maven2 web module as an Eclipse project (more specifically, SpringSource Tool Suite 2.6). I have a hello.tag in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/tags. It's just this: Hello World! I have a Hello.jsp in src/main/webapp. It's just this: If I build and deploy the application, everything works as expected. The problem is that Eclipse is reporting a problem with the taglib line. It says: Can not find the tag directory "/WEB-INF/tags/" I have already seen a similar question , but the resolution had to do with the projects natures/facets not being enabled and I believe I have all of the natures I need set up in .project: org.springframework.ide.eclipse.core.springnature org.eclipse.jem.workbench.JavaEMFNature org.eclipse.wst.common.modulecore.ModuleCoreNature org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature org.maven.ide.eclipse.maven2Nature org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.nature org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.core.jsNature Anyone seen this before or have any ideas what else I should check?
