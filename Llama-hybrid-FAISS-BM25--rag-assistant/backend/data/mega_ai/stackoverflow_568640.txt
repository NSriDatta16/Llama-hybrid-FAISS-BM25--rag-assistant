To answer your 3rd question; The second as an empty block level element simply wont be rendered. You can force the element to be rendered while empty by giving it a height or padding, or including a non breaking space &nbsp; inside the para. (there are probably more ways to do this). Normal whitespace (eg newlines, tabs or spaces) don't seem to work in this regard. Edit #2 :: To properly illustrate how this all works, save this locally and see what renders. Page Title p { margin:10px; background-color:#ccc;} p.padding { padding:5px; background-color:#eec; } p.height { height:30px; background-color:#cee; } text i have padding 5 empty paragraphs before this, only one will render. (it has padding) & nbsp; 3 whitespace before me, one will render, it has &amp;nbsp; im 30 px high 3 empty before me, 1 will show (it has height) text text
