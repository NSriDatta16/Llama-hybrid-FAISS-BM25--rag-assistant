There should not be an estimate of the offset: this offset is (could be) different for every observation (the whole idea is that you monitor the number of events within a (linear) 'timemeasure' (here apparently numberofdrugs ). There is no one 'population' offset you could estimate: person 1 is going to have 5 drugs administered, person 2 maybe 10, and you assume that the number of events ( healthvalue ?) is linear with this person's numberofdrugs (as per the answer to your previous question). I don't have the book at hand, and Amazon won't let me look at the pages you mention, but I suppose something else is happening there (maybe simply the average numberofdrugs in the population)?
