In Interface Builder you can drag and drop components you've built into the library under the Custom Objects list. These can be reused in other XIBs you build later. I'm not sure about code snippets in Xcode itself, I would find that useful too. If you are talking reuse though, can you put alot of your generic stuff in superclasses that you can inherit from when appropriate?
