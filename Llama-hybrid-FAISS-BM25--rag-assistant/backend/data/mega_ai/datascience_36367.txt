Machine learning in layman terms is an algorithm that allows machines to identify patterns in data and then develop a model which can be used to predict unseen data. Artificial Intelligence is the ability of machines to make intelligent decisions which are equal to or better than their human counterpart. Difference between the two : A.I. is a very broad field of computer intelligence in which machine learning is one of the ways it gains the intelligence to predict outcomes. But AI also contains robotics, speech synthesis, computer vision and others. So if I were to draw a Venn diagram of artificial intelligence then machine learning would be a subset.
