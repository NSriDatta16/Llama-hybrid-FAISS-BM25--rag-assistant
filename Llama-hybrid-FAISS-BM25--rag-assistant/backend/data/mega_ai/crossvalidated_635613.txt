Versatility and validity of aggregate algorithm for a multiple criteria decision problem (averaging)

I'm trying to aggregate different variables in multiple scales and distributions. The distributions are not known beforehand, but I want to generate a general statistical value that represents all the variables combined for each datapoint. This is to find the optimal option, knowing that each measure has the same weight. My first approach to this is to apply a yeo-johnson transformation, followed by a Z-score transformation, and finally using some kind of average, maybe simply an arithmetic average. I thought about using percentiles but I'm afraid of losing precision and that the aggregation value won't be valid Is this approach correct?
