Which is a less expensive query count(id) or order by id

I'd like to know which of the followings would execute faster in MySQL database. The table would have 200 - 1000 entries. SELECT id from TABLE order by id desc limit 1 or SELECT count(id) from TABLE The story is the Table is cached. So this query is to be executed every time before cache retrieval to determine whether the cache data is invalid by comparing the previous value. So if there exists a even less expensive query, please kindly let me know. Thanks.
