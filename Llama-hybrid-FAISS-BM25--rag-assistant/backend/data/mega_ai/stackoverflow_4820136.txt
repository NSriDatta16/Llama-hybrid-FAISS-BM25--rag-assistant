As others already pointed out in the comments - if there is some way to do that, there will be quite a few nasty cases where it probably won't quite work and it will be very fragile... One way to deal with the problem (for you) is to just write the solution in F# and then rewrite it to C#. This may sound stupid, but there are some advantages: In F#, you can easily prototype the solution, so you'll be able to find the right solution faster. When translating code to C#, you'll probably find yourself using features like lambda expressions more often, so it may even improve your C# skills... If you rely on .NET libraries, then this part of code will be easy to translate. Of course, the best thing would be to convince the organizers that they should support F# (which probably wouldn't be too difficult if they allow C# already), but I understand that this may be a challange.
