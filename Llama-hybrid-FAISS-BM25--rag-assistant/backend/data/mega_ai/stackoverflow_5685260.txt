Your idea isn't that bad, you just obviously need some loops :) 1: loop to get numbers - you can't duplicate the same code 10x - write it once, in a loop. 2: loop to check digits - you can use your's if s, or do it as Josh said but before - you need data structure to store your data - occurs of digits. 10 variables is bad, BAD:), idea. use array[2][10] or simply array[10] (where number of digits = index of array and value = occurs) or even better - HashMap<> - google it. then inside loop you do: for(int i = 0; i = i*10) && (myCurrentNumberToCheck %100 = i*100) && (myCurrentNumberToCheck %1000 ahh and your inserted numbers should be in some structure too - try List numbers = new ArrayList () here :) and iterate thou list, to take a look at next number. so you will need to add numbers to List, and nextly - go thou that list and check them and here use that loop i wrote above
