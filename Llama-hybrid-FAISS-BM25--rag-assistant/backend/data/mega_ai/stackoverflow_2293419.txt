There is an article on CodeProject that shows how to host a exe as a control on the WinForms (It's an application that uses Tab pages, drag a Winform.exe onto it, it creates a tabpage with that window in it), derived from this article here . I know you asked for specifically WPF, but perhaps that might lead you in the right direction? Hope this helps, Best regards, Tom.
