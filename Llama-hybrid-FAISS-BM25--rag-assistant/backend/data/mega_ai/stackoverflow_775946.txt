I would suggest starting to look at alot of advanced AI topics on the web: such topics include neural networks, genetic programming ect (wikipedia them). Good places to look also include University research into higher levels of AI. (ie. I know of a team of people that wrote a program which extrapolated the laws of motion from making a computer watch a pendulum swing with a camera; very cool stuff) http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/04/newtonai.html It is a really big field and alot of code will need to be written by you; what you should really focus on is the concepts behind the learning algorithms, that way you can program or adapt the ones you find to your needs. I think that will be your best bet for creating a learning algorithm. I hope that helps.
