Descriptive vs. predictive In, say biology textbooks, the focus is on describing the relevant data; the sample mean was…, the p-value for this result is… etc. In machine learning texts, the focus is on producing models that can generalize beyond their training set; thus techniques like cross-validation are required in order to get a handle on that feature. This oversimplifies a bit, but I think captures the essence of the difference in approach that some works take relative to others. These differences are a reflection of the different priorities and goals for these different domains that apply statistics. Consider the Theory of Point Estimation by Lehmann and Casella 1998 . They start chapter 1 with the statement "Statistics is concerned with the collection of data and with their analysis and interpretation.", which reads to me that these authors have chosen to focus more on applying statistics for analysis and interpretation rather than on applying statistics in a manner that can be reliably generalized to other cases. Similarly, they describe the result of "classical inference and decision theory" as " Such a statement about [the estimated values of the model parameters] can be viewed as a summary of the information provided by the data and may be used as a guide to action." -- again the focus is more about how to describe the data (any maybe as a basis, with some interpretation, on how to guide actions), and less about the nature of the problems involved in ML. Finally, let me emphasize: this is a matter of what particular authors, problem domains etc. have chosen to focus on in different areas.
