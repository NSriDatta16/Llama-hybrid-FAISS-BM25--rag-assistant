A schizophrenics experiment from Bayesian Data Analysis, Gelman et al textbook

There is a psychology experiment in the Gelman et al textbook on page 524 section 22.2 Example: reaction times and schizophrenia , I believe the original work is from Belin and Rubin (1990) where the authors illustrated simple mixture models with this dataset containing 17 people: 11 non-schizophrenics and 6 schizophrenics had their reaction times measured 30 times. I am limited in Mixture Models and all the alternative models the authors prescribed. So far, I have prior knowledge on Regression, ANOVA, Nested models, Categorical Predictions and Interactions, Model Diagnostic, Collinearity, Transformation, Variable Selection etc. and I would like to accurately tackle the prompt question: Are there meaningful differences in reaction times between the schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic patients, adjusting for correlation between patients' repeated measurements? How and what is the best way of formulating appropriate model(s) to answer the prompt question. Please, forgive me of my ignorance.
