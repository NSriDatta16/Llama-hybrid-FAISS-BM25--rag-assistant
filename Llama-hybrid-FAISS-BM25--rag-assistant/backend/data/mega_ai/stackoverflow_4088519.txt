Migrating from C# to native windows C++

I want to develop native c++ windows application using windows API. but i find it being difficult because i am unable to render the window and drag and drop components, change the location etc.. How can i view, drag and drop components like i can do in C# ? May be there is no way to do. if so, what is the fastest procedure to design the application ?
