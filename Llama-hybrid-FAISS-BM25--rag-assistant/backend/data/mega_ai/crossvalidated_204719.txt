Any linear survival analysis method can be straightforwardly kernelised to generate a non-linear equivalent. I did something like this a while back for modelling the time-to-growth of microbial pathogens from spores in foods. G. C. Cawley, N. L. C. Talbot, G. J. Janacek and M. W. Peck, Sparse Bayesian kernel survival analysis for modelling the growth domain of microbial pathogens, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, volume 17, number 2, pp. 471-481, March 2006. ( www )
