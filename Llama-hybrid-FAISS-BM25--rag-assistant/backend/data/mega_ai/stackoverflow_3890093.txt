As others have pointed out, coverage can tell you what code has been executed. The trick for you is to be sure that your test suite truly exercises the code fully. The failure case here is over-pruning because your tests skipped some code that will really be needed in production. Be sure to get the latest version of coverage.py (v3.4): it adds a new feature to indicate files that are never executed at all. BTW:: for a first cut prune, Python provides a neat trick: remove all the .pyc files in your source tree, then run your tests. Files that still have no .pyc file were clearly not executed!
