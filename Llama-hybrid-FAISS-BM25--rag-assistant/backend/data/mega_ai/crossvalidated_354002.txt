Don't understand updated likelihood in example (Bayesian)?

This is from Bayesian Data Analysis - Andrew Gelman 2nd edition, example on pg.11. If theta = 1 = mother is carrier, theta = 0 = mother is non carrier and y1, y2, y3 = 3 sons, where y1 is either 1 = affected or 0 = unaffected. After calculating p(theta = 1 | y1, y2 = 0) = .2, if the mother has a third son who is unaffected, Why is the new likelihood .5? The book says before, But with the third son who is unaffected, I get how the posterior becomes new prior, but I don't get why new likelihood p(y1, y2, y3 = 0 | theta = .2) = .5 Hope I made the question clear. Thanks.
