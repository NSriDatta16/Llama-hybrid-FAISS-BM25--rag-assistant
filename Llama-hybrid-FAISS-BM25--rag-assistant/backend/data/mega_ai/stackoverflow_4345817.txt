Since border-bottom will only work on the element identified by its selector, I can't see another way of doing this apart from wrapping the text inside every with tags (or another). You could avoid annoying glitches by targeting span tags immediately inside all p tags: p > span:first-child {border-bottom:1px dotted #000;} this is a paragraph with a first-child span and a dotted underline this is a paragraph with no first-child span this is bold and this span is ignored
