I think you have a problem with the phrase "holding age constant". What it means for the example you quote is that we look at the effect of partner's age having already taken account of any influence of respondent's age. You can think of it as having first built a model with just respondent's age, calculating the residuals from that model, seeing how partner's age predicts the variation left over in the residual. In your example if the ages are correlated I might be inclined to use two new variables: average age of the couple, and difference in couple's ages. But this would depend on the scientific question being asked.
