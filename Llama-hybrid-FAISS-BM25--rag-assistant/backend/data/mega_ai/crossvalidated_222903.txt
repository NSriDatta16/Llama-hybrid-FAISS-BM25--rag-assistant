[...] this parabolic model makes way more sense theoretically. However, I've never seen a function of the intervention time used as a covariate in an arimax model like this before. Is it ok to do? I think it is OK to do. Time series modelling is often about approximating complicated processes in parsimonious ways. If you want to describe a pattern (a reaction to an impulse) in a simple way and you have in mind a functional form that seems to match to what you see, why not use it. Once you have fitted the model, you can assess whether it captures the pattern well. If model residuals still contain substantial patterns in them, you might reconsider the functional form. But that will become clear once you have fitted the model; it should not discourage you from fitting it in the first place, though.
