There are a few places where an empty (self-closing) element gets treated as significantly different to an element that has an empty text content. Assuming you don't control the source, I wonder if in this case you should be pragmatic and change it to a string member: public string Direction { get { return enumField.ToString(); } set { enumField = (EnumType)Enum.Parse(typeof(EnumType), value);} }
