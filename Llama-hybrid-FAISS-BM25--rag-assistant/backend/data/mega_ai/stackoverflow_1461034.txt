To give you are short answer: yes, you want a central data storage. You don't want to run complex reports on your live database. As your live database will grow you will want to do some housekeeping and clean it up but keep the data for analysi. You will also want the data to be aggregated so you could perform historical analysis. For the data which comes from different sources some clean-up will be required. And you will probably need to know how to link your data together and there are quire a lot of things like that you will have to be aware of to do the job properly. You might consider reading on data warehousing ( wikipedia ) and business intelligence ( wikipedia ). If you want to have 'new features' added to this system you could also look up orchestration ( wikipedia . It will allow you to link your heterogeneous business processes together. All of these are quite specialized and complex disciplines on their own so you might want to have a specialist to consult you.
