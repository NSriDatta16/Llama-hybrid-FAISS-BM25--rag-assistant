Vector is a dynamic array and is implemented internally as a dynamic array. I would suggest you to use vector as the machines are optimized to retrieve the continuous memory locations,while the link list will not be stored in continuous location. Having said that,if you don't require the fast retrieval of element by index in your use case then you can go for link list also.The link list also has a benefit of not wasting the space unlike dynamic array(by doubling when it is about to get full) and also insertion in the start or between the elements is cheaper as compared to array.
