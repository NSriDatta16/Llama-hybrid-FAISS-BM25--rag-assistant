When you did ordinary (linear) PCA on your likert-scale variables you already treated those variables as scale, or continuous, variables (variables with evenly spaced measuring benchmarks). To put in other words, you haven't regarded them as ordinal so far. To recognize their ordinal (i.e. potentially not evenly spaced) nature you might consider to perform categorical PCA (CATPCA) which quantifies measuring levels nonlinearly to achieve the "best" principal components. And yes, principal components are continuous, so usual regression is apt to them.
