I found two round-about methods for getting data from a batch file execution into the database. One method is to add logging to the actual batch file. I haven't tried this yet, but it seems conceptually possible. The other option I have tried that has worked is to put the batch file execution as a SQL Server Agent job step and add flat-file logging. After I did this, I created a small package that scrapes the file for specific messages. I would still prefer a better solution, but this works well enough for now.
