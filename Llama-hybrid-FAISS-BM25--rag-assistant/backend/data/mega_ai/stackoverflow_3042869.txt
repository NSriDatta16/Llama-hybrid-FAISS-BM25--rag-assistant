WPF A good way to make a view/edit control?

this is just a question to discuss - what is the best way to make a view/edit control in WPF? E.g. we have an entity object Person, that has some props (name, surname, address, phone etc.). One presentation of the control would be a read-only view. And the other would have the edit view for this same person. Example: I hope that the idea is clear. The two options I see right now two grids with visibility switching and a TabControl without its header panel This is just a discussion question - not much trouble with it, yet I am just wondering if there are any other possibilities and elegant solutions to this.
