Is the level of measurement of variables always preserved?

Is it conceptually possible for multiple variables of lower level measurement (i.e. ordinal data) to be combined to i.e. interval data OR is the level of measurement always preserved? If asked, I would argue that the former is true. Example: The ranks within an organization is as follows: 1 = sales assistant, 2 = junior sales manager, 3 = senior sales manager, = 4 = sales department manager, 5 = CEO . Let's take a look at the organization and sum it's ranks: > myOrganization sum(myOrganization) [1] 25 Is the ordinal nature of the individual variables is preserved?
