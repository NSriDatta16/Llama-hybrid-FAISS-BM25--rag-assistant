You can use sphinx in conjunction with mysql. sphinx is a standalone tool but it has a mysql proxy mode where it basically behaves like a mysql server and can be queried with any mysql connector out there. Or, as an alternative, there is a sphinx storage engine plugin for mysql which allows you to query sphinx with your current mysql connection and perform join's to other tables. Definetly not a quich and dirty solution but it's worth a further look: http://sphinxsearch.com/
