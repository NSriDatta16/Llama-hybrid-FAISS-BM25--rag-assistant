Create a CDF from multiple experiment runs

I have time series data from a series of experiments plotted above. I am trying to fit a cumulative distribution function to it. The time series can each be of different lengths and because of how the experiment works do not have equal time steps. All values lay between 0 and 1. X are the time steps and Y are the values. What is the best approach to turn the data into a model that takes an X and returns a Y from the distribution? I can fit a model to it easily (below). Roughly the results are $x^5$ . When I try to force it to a SmoothKernalDistribution however, the results don't look like the data at all so I suspect I'm doing something wrong. The data I used can be found below. {{{0., 0.}, {0.52, 0.}, {0.8, 0.3}, {0.9, 0.56}, {0.95, 0.75}, {0.98, 0.89}, {0.98, 0.91}, {0.99, 0.96}, {1., 0.97}}, {{0., 0.}, {0.69,0.}, {0.81, 0.44}, {0.89, 0.65}, {0.96, 0.82}, {0.98, 0.88}, {0.99,0.96}, {1., 0.98}}, {{0., 0.}, {0.47, 0.}, {0.79, 0.26}, {0.88,0.53}, {0.96, 0.75}, {0.99, 0.85}, {0.99, 0.96}, {1., 0.98}}, {{0., 0.}, {0.58, 0.}, {0.79, 0.26}, {0.89, 0.59}, {0.96, 0.79}, {0.97, 0.85}, {1., 0.91}}, {{0., 0.}, {0.59, 0.}, {0.79, 0.35}, {0.88, 0.56}, {0.95, 0.77}, {0.97, 0.89}, {0.98, 0.91}, {0.99, 0.94}, {0.99, 0.96}, {1., 0.99}}, {{0., 0.}, {0.59, 0.}, {0.82, 0.34}, {0.96, 0.63}, {0.97, 0.79}, {0.99, 0.86}, {1., 0.93}}, {{0.,0.}, {0.54, 0.}, {0.79, 0.26}, {0.91, 0.57}, {0.98, 0.76}, {0.99, 0.84}, {1., 0.96}}, {{0., 0.}, {0.5, 0.}, {0.75, 0.22}, {0.86, 0.48}, {0.95, 0.76}, {0.98, 0.88}, {0.98, 0.95}, {1., 0.97}}, {{0., 0.}, {0.55, 0.}, {0.8, 0.3}, {0.95, 0.65}, {0.99, 0.78}, {1., 0.89}}, {{0., 0.}, {0.63, 0.}, {0.84, 0.34}, {0.9, 0.68}, {0.95, 0.79}, {0.98, 0.87}, {0.99, 0.91}, {1., 0.95}}}
