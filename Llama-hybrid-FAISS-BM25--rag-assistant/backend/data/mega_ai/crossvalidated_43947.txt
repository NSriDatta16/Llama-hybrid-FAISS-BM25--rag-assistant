As with many questions, the answer depends on your underlying purpose in carrying out the analysis. If you are interested in not only showing that there is a significant association between a dichotomous variable A and a continuous variable b, but also in being able to compute the expected likelihood of the event recorded in variable A, then you want to use the logistic regression, as this approach provides you with a regression equation. In addition, the logistic regression in the bivariate case of A and b can be extended to the multivariate case of predicting A from b and numerous other independent variables for the purpose of controlling for covariates, testing mediational models, examining interactions, and all of the other good things we can do with multiple regression. Having said that, you should probably consider the link function relating the dichotomous variable A with the continuous variable B. Logistic regression used a logit link, which is more appropriate when the probability of the outcome is very high or low, while a probit link may be more appropriate when the probablity of the event is closer to .5 Choosing the link function that is appropriate for your data is important for building a good regression model.
