The Cobertura report file (which at this point is somewhere in $HUDSON/jobs/foo/workspace ) needs to contain something like this at the beginning: /path/to/source /another/path Does it have that? Do the paths point to the right place? Another gotcha: when it says "most recent build", it actually means "most recent stable build" (i.e. the status ball is blue, as opposed to yellow).
