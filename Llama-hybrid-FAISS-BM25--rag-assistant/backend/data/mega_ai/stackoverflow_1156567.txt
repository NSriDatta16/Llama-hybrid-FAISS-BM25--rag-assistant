Agent Based Simulations utilizing the XBOX 360 in C#

What is the best way to design an ABS using the XBOX 360 hardware? Can I follow my standard developing framework methodologies such as domain driven design? Are there frameworks out there that handle world creation and updates in C# for XBOX? Any good resources regarding the creation of generic simulations?
