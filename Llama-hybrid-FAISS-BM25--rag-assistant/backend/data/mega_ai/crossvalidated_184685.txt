Proof of why Randomization is Important In Experiments

A simple example: I am interested in finding out the average height of student's at a university - but I only decide to measure the basketball team. Intuitively, I know this will result in a biased estimate. What is the mathematical proof that randomization is important in sampling/experimentation?
