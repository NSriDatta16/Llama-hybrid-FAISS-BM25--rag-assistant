How can I count the number of occurrences of a category in dataset as part of an Sklearn Pipeline

Let us say we have a dataset with a feature such as Surname: arr['Surname'] = ['Smith', 'Jones', 'Johnson', 'Smith'] And I would like to encode this categorical info as a new feature like: arr['Surname_Count'] = [2, 1, 1, 2] with the caveat that it is done within a scikit-learn pipeline . Are there quick ways to do this that do not involve rolling my own partition counting transformer?
