PCA is a good technique for data dimension reduction. Based on what you shared, few thoughts as suggestions: Eigen values measure the variability for each component. You should choose the components with eigen values greater or equal to one. The sum of all eigen values produces a measure of variability in your data. If your eigen values are close to zero, variability is to low and using only two components as input for clustering will not produce a robust scheme for groups. What to do in this case. You can scale your data ( $(x_j-mean_j)/\sigma_j$ ). Apply that for all your variables and the results must change. In case you decided not scaling, your should take all components that accumulate at least 90% of variability in data, in this situation as you mentioned 30 components.
