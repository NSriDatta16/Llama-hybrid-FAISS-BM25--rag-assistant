If you are going to use the ECG time series as the input for the LSTM-network you will need to reshape your data data = data.reshape(signal length,time step pr sample, ECG channel) So if your data is 36000 samples long and you only use 1 channel you will do like this: data = data.reshape(36000,1,1) Then you can make a simple LSTM model like this: model = Sequential() model.add(InputLayer(input_shape=(1, 1))) model.add(LSTM(32,activation='tanh', return_sequences=True)) model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')) I think the same principals will apply to your encoder/decoder
