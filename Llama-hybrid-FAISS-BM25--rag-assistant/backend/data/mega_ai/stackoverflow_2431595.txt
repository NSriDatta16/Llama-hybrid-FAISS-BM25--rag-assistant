No, generally the log is not there for the user to analyze. it is also not organized in a way leading easily to this information UNLESS you would decode it from the start. Plus, as logs get deleted after every backup.... you may not know even then, unless you never make a backup. The only reason logs exist is to be there to roll forward in case of a disaster, to allow your last backup to get up to the point of the log. In generally, if you want that information as part of a table, make it part of the table (.e. insert create/update timestamp columns).
