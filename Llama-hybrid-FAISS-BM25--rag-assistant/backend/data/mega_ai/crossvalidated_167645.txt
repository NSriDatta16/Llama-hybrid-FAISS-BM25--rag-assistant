Petscher and Logan has written a very good paper on interpretation of quantile regression ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12190/abstract ). To quote the authors, it is apparently misleading to interpret the regression coefficients of quantile regression in the same way as one would with linear regression results. Instead the quantile coefficients for a given independent variable X in a certain quantile should be read as the gap between the mean of X for the quantile, compared to instances of X above 1 SD on the mean of X.
