redefinitions of public expectations. Legacy of the AI winter In the early 1990s, during the second "AI winter" many AI researchers found that they could get more funding and sell more software if they avoided the bad name of "artificial intelligence" and instead pretended their work had nothing to do with intelligence. Patty Tascarella wrote in 2006: "Some believe the word 'robotics' actually carries a stigma that hurts a company's chances at funding." Saving a place for humanity at the top of the chain of being Michael Kearns suggests that "people subconsciously are trying to preserve for themselves some special role in the universe". By discounting artificial intelligence people can continue to feel unique and special. Kearns argues that the change in perception known as the AI effect can be traced to the mystery being removed from the system. In being able to trace the cause of events implies that it's a form of automation rather than intelligence. A related effect has been noted in the history of animal cognition and in consciousness studies, where every time a capacity formerly thought of as uniquely human is discovered in animals (e.g. the ability to make tools, or passing the mirror test), the overall importance of that capacity is deprecated. Herbert A. Simon, when asked about the lack of AI's press coverage at the time, said, "What made AI different was that the very idea of it arouses a real fear and hostility in some human breasts. So you are getting very strong emotional reactions. But that's okay. We'll live with that." Deep Blue defeats Kasparov When IBM's chess-playing computer Deep Blue succeeded in defeating Garry Kasparov in 1997, there were complains that Deep Blue had only used "brute force methods" and it wasn't real intelligence. Notably, John McCarthy, an AI pioneer and founder of the term "artificial intelligence", was disappointed by Deep Blue. He described it as a mere brute force machine that did not have any deep understanding of the game. McCarthy would also criticize how widespread the AI effect is ("As soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore"), but in this case did not think that Deep Blue was a good example. On the other side, Fred A. Reed writes: A problem that proponents of AI regularly face is this: When we know how a machine does something "intelligent", it ceases to be regarded as intelligent. If I beat the world's chess champion, I'd be regarded as highly bright.
