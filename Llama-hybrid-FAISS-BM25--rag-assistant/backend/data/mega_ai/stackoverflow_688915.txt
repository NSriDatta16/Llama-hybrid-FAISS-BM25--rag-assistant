I use mercurial for incremental backups to non-mercurial aware online file storage. Just have a repo that contains what's already backed up, and hg bundle against it. Then push. Copy the bundle to a live mesh synced folder and presto, automatic backup and distribution to all my machines. (Note: encrypt the bundle first - I trust no one to respect my privacy). Of course, full backup is just as easy with hg bundle -all .
