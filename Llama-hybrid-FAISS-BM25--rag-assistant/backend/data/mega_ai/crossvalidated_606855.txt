Bayesian inference for simple gaussian model with measurement error

I'm having trouble understanding how to specify a model for Bayesian inference. I have a set of measurements, each with known uncertainty, and I would like to infer the mean of the measurements with gaussian model. The mean is known to be within the interval [0,1] , so I use an appropriate prior to enforce that. But I'm not sure that I'm handling the measurement uncertainty properly. The model I have is $$ \begin{align} x_{\textrm{obs},i} &\sim \textrm{Normal}(x_{\textrm{true},i}, \sigma_{\textrm{true},i}) \\ x_{\textrm{true},i} &\sim \textrm{Normal}(\mu, \sigma) \\ \mu &\sim \textrm{Uniform}(0, 1) \\ \sigma &\sim \textrm{Exponential}(0.25) \end{align} $$ where the "obs" variables are the known values and uncertainties for my measurements. Is this correct?
