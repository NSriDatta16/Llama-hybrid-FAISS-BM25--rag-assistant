Invertibility of MA process

I am currently working on moving average process, and not very clear about the invertibility concept. For me it seems like the concept arose from the need of one-to-one relationship between MA model coefficients and autocorrelation function. However, most definition focusing on whether MA can be expressed as AR( $\infty$ ), others relate to the root location. I can see the importance of invertibility. But how does the definition link to the one-to-one relationship? Yes, If MA can be considered as AR( $\infty$ ), it should have the one-to-one relationship, since all AR are invertible. But if I check why AR is invertible, it goes back to the definition of AR. I think I missed a critical proof if there is one.
