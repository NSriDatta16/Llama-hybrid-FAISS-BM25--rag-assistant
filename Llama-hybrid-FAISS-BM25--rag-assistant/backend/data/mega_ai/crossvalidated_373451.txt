Methods to try out: UnderSampling: I suggest using under sampling techniques and then training your classifier. Imbalanced Learning provides a scikit learn style api for imbalanced dataset and should be a good starting point for sampling and algorithms to try out. Library : https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ Rank Based SVM : This has shown to give improvement in recall for high precision systems and is used by google for detecting bad advertisements. I recommend trying it out. Reference Paper for SVM : https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/37195.pdf
