Drap and drop selected anchor text from browser window

I am performing a drag-and-drop operation of an anchor text selected in a browser window onto an app created in C#. Consider this link Google Me In case of IE browsers... When I select the anchor text "Google Me" and drop it onto my application, the text dropped is " Google Me ". In case of Chrome, Firefox, Safari.... On doing the same operation the text dropped is " http://www.google.com ". I tried doing this on some other apps as well like Notepad++, Eclipse, there also the same thing occurred. In some other apps, like Thunderbird, drag-and-drop from IE was same, from others, formatted anchor link got dropped. Is this about the implementation of drag-and-drop operation that is different in various browsers? If not, can the drag-and-drop implementation be changed in the application where the text is being dropped? I am a complete novice in C# and have no idea how the drag-and-drop operation is implemented. Just got curious with this. Regards
