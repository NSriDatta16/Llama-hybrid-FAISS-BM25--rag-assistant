An answer from Ian Goodfellow on Was Jürgen Schmidhuber right when he claimed credit for GANs at NIPS 2016? posted on 2017-03-21: He isn’t claiming credit for GANs, exactly. It’s more complicated. You can see what he wrote in his own words when he was a reviewer of the NIPS 2014 submission on GANs: Export Reviews, Discussions, Author Feedback and Meta-Reviews ( mirror ) He’s the reviewer that asked us to change the name of GANs to “inverse PM.” Here's the paper he believes is not being sufficiently acknowledged: http://ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/factorial.pdf ( mirror ) I don’t like that there is no good way to have issues like this adjudicated. I contacted the NIPS organizers and asked if there is a way for Jürgen to file a complaint about me and have a committee of NIPS representatives judge whether my publication treats his unfairly. They said there is no such process available. I personally don’t think that there is any significant connection between predictability minimization and GANs. I have never had any problem acknowledging connections between GANs and other algorithms that actually are related, like noise-contrastive estimation and self-supervised boosting. Jürgen and I intend to write a paper together soon describing the similarities and differences between PM and GANs, assuming we’re able to agree on what those are.
