First, let me summarize my understanding of the problem on an example. Let's have the boards of the following shapes: $4\times 6$, $6\times6$, and $2\times 4$. The following approach can be applied: Determine the largest possible square. This is analogy to largest common numerator. In our case, it will be square $2\times 2$. Using $r_i$, calculate the likelihood of each square size. Some of the square sizes will be excluded automatically, e.g. if $r_3=1/8$, the largest possible square size is $1\times1$. Combine the likelihoods by means of Bayesian inference, possibly using flat prior for allowed square size.
