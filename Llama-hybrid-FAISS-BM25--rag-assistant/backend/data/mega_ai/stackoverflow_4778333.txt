The easiest and most informative way to track down this error is to setup your IDE to debug Magento and set a breakpoint in your mysql4-install-0.0.1.php . If the breakpoint doesn't get hit, then you know if the issue is in your XML config. If the breakpoint does get hit, you can trace through the code to find the source of the error. It may take you half a day to setup, but live debugging of Magento is by far the best way to learn and understand the code. Do yourself a favour, make the investment now.
