As already discussed in the comments, since your data seems to be following a very nice (mostly) straight path, you can estimate the trend in your data - the controls, such as via simple linear regression, and then subtract this from your non-control samples. Alternatively, since all the samples seem to be on the same scale, you could also subtract the trend by decomposing each time series individually, and retaining only the seasonal and remainders.
