Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of a logistic regression is ill defined if the classes are linearly separable. In this case the parameters will go to +/- infinity. There are workarounds by introducing a regularization term, but you could try a linear discrimination analysis first (R function lda ), because it possibly already yields perfect results.
