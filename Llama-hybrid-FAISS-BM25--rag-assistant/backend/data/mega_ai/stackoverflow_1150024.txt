Where content based websites store their content?

Sites like cnn.com or foxnews.com. Where do they store all the articles? In html files? In database? More logically to store everything in DB but how to generate a static link to something that is inside DB? It's not that they have a a dynamic page load like: LoadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=123, every article has it's own address. Please explain how this is done.
