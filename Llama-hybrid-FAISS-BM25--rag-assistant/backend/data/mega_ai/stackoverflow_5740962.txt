I think the root of this problem is within http://ask.bitauto.com/TreeAsk/index.aspx . Following your link (thus having a referrer to stackoverflow) results in this answer: HTTP/1.1 302 Found Date: Thu, 21 Apr 2011 07:28:03 GMT Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0 X-Powered-By: ASP.NET X-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727 Location: Cache-Control: private Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 117 Notice the empty Location header - the reply from the server is a redirect to... nothing. Edit: It seems like the empty redirect page is only shown if you have no referrer or a non-ask.bitauto.com referrer. Setting the target URL as referrer results in a 200 OK answer. Edit 2: The empty Location header behavior isn't according to RFC2616 , and it seems like different web agents react to it in different way . I think the most robust solution for you is to specify HTTPWebRequest.Referrer in your request.
