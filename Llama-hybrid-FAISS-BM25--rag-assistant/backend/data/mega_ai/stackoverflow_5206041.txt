Since you asked for technical reasons, consider memory storage: "new Animal()" only requires enough resources to store the minimum data required by all animals, but "new Dog()" requires more resources -- the resources of a Mammal (fur, warm blood), and the resources of a Dog (fascination with squirrels). If, though, you're asking "Once I've written 'Dog' once, why do I have to say it again?" then the answer is "not all languages require that."
