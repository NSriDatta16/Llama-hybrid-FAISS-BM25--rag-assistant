Rather than have everything in one big dialog, I'm looking at being able to display child dialogs for separate groups of controls. The idea is these are not free-floating child dialogs like floating toolbars, but would be shown with no title-bar, their position locked to the parent dialog... so as you drag the parent dialog any open child is dragged too. I guess you could go for Multi-Document Interface. You could create your own dialogs, add the document template and use them for appropriate functionalities. The child will remain inside one main parent frame and will move along the parent whenever the parent is dragged.
