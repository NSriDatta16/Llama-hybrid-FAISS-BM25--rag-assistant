First note that a stationary process solution exists for your equation(Assume {$e_{t}$} is White Noise). And you can refer to any time series book to know that this process is causal, which basically means $X_t$ only depends on the previous innovations $e_i$ where $i \leqslant t$. So we know $Cov(e_t,X_{t-2})=Cov(e_{t-1},X_{t-2})=0$, then taking variance on both sides we have the variance $\gamma_0$ satisfies $\gamma_0=0.25*\gamma_0+2\sigma^2_e$, here $\sigma^2_e$ is the variance of the white noise series. Thus we know $\gamma_0=(8/3)*\sigma^2_e$.
