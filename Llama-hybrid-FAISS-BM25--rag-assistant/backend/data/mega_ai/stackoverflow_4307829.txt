Magento: Layout Changes using LOCAL XML ONLY

I'm pretty new to magento and I would like to customize the store front-end. I'm using Magento 1.4.1 and I'm planning to do all design modifications on the local.xml of my new template. My doubt is if it is possible to change the layout structure only using the local.xml. I mean without changing the phtml files. A simple example of what I would like to be able is: I want to put the catalog search in another part of my html and not inside the , as it is today. So I would like to remove it from top-bar and put it inside another div. Principal / Product Category Pesquisar Ir // How do I accomplish this? Is it possible to use only local.xml? Thanks in advance and best regards
