Casting array of pointers to objects

If B is subclass of A . And I have in main() : B** b = new B*[10]; ... // some algorithm that does b[i] = new B(..); So I have an array of pointers to objects B . Then I have a function: void f(A** foo); If in main, I do: f(b); I get a warning, but obviously if I do: f((A**)b); , I don't. The (A**) its a bit nasty. I was wondering if there's a more elegant way in C++ that at least do type checking as dynamic_cast . I want foo to sort (only using swaps) arrays of objects of type A or subclass.. so make a generic sorting algorithm. I hope now you understand better my problem.
