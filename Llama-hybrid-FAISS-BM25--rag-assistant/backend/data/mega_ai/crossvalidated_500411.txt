Yes, $L_2$ loss is another name for squared error. Not in autoencoders, but in general. $L_2$ in the name comes from the norm in mathematics . In different places you would see either sum of squared errors, or their mean, but they are technically equivalent, while mean is preferred since it has units independent of sample size.
