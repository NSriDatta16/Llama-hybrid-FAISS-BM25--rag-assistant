I ended up doing it a bit differently. I will still use the "store form in document" option to make sure that each submitted request can stand alone; but "request" documents will be based on hundreds/thousands of individual forms (yes, that's thousands; research and testing suggests it shouldn't be a performance issue). These many forms, then, will be programmatically generated. I'm setting it up so that "template authors" can create "request templates", which are normal documents with a block of xml in them. A background agent then takes all these documents and processes each block of xml, and a base form, into new custom forms. These custom forms are presented to users to create their "request" documents from.
