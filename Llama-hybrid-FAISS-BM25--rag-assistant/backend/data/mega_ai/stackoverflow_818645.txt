How to create igoogle layout(drag & drop & store) using PHP and AJAX?

In igoogle, we can drag & drop the modules and then if we quit the browser and open it again, the position of each module still the same. I have tested couple of things: When not logged in, igoogle store the modules position in my cookies(cache). Because if I clear cache, it goes back to original position. When I logged in, after positioning the modules, even I logout and clear my cache, if I login again, the modules still the same, not back to original position. What i want to ask: How to store the modules position for logged and not logged in user? Whar are the required skills? (I use php, mysql and jquery) Is there any good tutorials I can reference to?
