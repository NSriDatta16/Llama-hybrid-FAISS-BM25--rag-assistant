There is no real limit set for it. It is simply objects stored in .Net. Standard Windows process limits apply. You can apply a global limit in IIS (AppPool settings). There is however a consideration to make when you use ASP.Net State Service or SQL State Storage. The Session object must be serialized, sent to the store, retrieved and deserialized. This is a very expensive process. Therefore you want to limit the amount of data you store in Session. If you use internal state storage then the Session is simply kept in memory (no overhead), but this approach usually doesn't scale well with web clusters.
