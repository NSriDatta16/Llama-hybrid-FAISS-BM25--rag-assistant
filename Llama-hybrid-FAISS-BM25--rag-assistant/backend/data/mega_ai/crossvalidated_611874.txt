This might not be the most elegant proof, but I believe it answers the question: We assume $a_1,a_2,...a_n$ are i.i.d standard normal (we can assume as in Ljung-Box a constant variance $\sigma^2$ , but then we can divide by $\sigma^2$ both the numerator and denominator in the expression for $r_k$ , arriving at the standardized variables, so this doesn't lose generality). Consider, for arbitrary $k \ne m$ $$ r = \frac{a_ka_m}{\sum_{t=1}^n a_t^2} = \frac{a_ka_m}{a_k^2 + a_m^2 + Z^2}$$ where $Z^2 \sim \chi^2_{n-2}$ and $Z^2,a_k,a_m$ are all independent. It follows from symmetry $^1$ that $r$ have zero mean, $E[r]=0$ . Next introduce the rotated variables: $$ u = (a_k+a_m)/\sqrt{2} , v = (a_k-a_m)/\sqrt{2} $$ which are also independent and standard normal, and observe that $a_k^2 + a_m^2 = u^2+v^2$ , $a_ka_m = (u^2-v^2)/2$ , so we have $$r = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{u^2}{u^2+v^2+Z^2} - \frac{v^2}{u^2+v^2+Z^2} \right) \equiv \frac{1}{2}(U - V).$$ Now notice that $U$ and $V$ are ratios of Chi-squared random variables, which have a known Beta distribution: $$U,V \sim \text{Beta}\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{n-1}{2}\right)$$ with $E[U]=\frac{1}{n}$ and $E[U^2]= \frac{3}{n(n+2)}$ following from the properties of the Beta distribution. Furthermore, notice that $UV = \left( \frac{uv}{u^2+v^2+Z^2} \right)^2 $ has exactly the same distribution as $r^2$ , so $E[UV]=E[r^2]=Var(r)$ . From $r=(U-V)/2$ we also have $$\begin{align*} Var(r) &= \frac{1}{4}( Var(U) + Var(V) - 2Cov(U,V) ) \\ &= \frac{1}{2}( Var(U) - Cov(U,V) ) \\ &= \frac{1}{2}( Var(U) - E[UV] + E[U]^2 ) \\ &= \frac{1}{2}( E[U^2] - Var(r) ) \end{align*}$$ So finally, $$ Var(r) = \frac{1}{3}E[U^2] = \frac{1}{n(n+2)} .$$ To complete the proof we can observe that $r_k$ is a sum of $(n-k)$ terms which all have the same distribution as $r$ , namely $r_k = \sum_{t=k+1}^n r_{t,t-k}$ , and they are uncorrelated since for any $k,m \ne s,t$ , $Cov(r_{k,m},r_{s,t}) = E[r_{k,m} \cdot r_{s,t}] = 0$ , following again from symmetry. Therefore, $$Var(r_k) = (n-k)Var(r) = \frac{n-k}{n(n+2)}.$$ $^1$ Since the joint distribution of $\{a_t\}$ is symmetric with respect to interchaning $a_t \leftrightarrow -a_t$ , the expectation of any odd function (with respect to any of its arguments) is zero. For example, define $\tilde a_k = -a_k$ , such that $ r = -\frac{\tilde a_ka_m}{\sum_{t=1}^n a_t^2} \equiv -\tilde r$ . Since $r$ and $\tilde r$ have the same distribution, $E[r] = E[\tilde r]=-E[r]$ , implying that $E[r]=0$ . The same argument holds for any other odd function such as $\frac{a_ka_ma_sa_t}{(\sum_{t=1}^n a_t^2)^2}$ , provided that at least one of the $a_i$ 's in the numerator has an odd power. (This is essentially the same argument as given, e.g., here )
