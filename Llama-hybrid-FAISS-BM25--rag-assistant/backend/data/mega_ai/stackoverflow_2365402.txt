I personally do not feel that polymorphism via classes is "bad" - however, there are other options... I feel the real issue is that it's bad to feel that polymorphism is the only way to write software. There are many lessons we can learn from using functional programming techniques, for example, which can work around many of the limitations in traditional OOP practices, such as easing thread safety in heavily concurrent environments (which seems to be one of the linked points). Many times, there will be a more elegant solution to a problem than polymorphism - and often, mixing polymorphism with a functional concept can produce a very elegant solution.
