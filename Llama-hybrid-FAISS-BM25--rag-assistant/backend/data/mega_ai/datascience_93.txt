There's not much you can do with just this data, but what little you can do does not rely on machine learning. Yes, sessions from the same IP but different User-Agents are almost certainly distinct users. Sessions with the same IP and User-Agent are usually the same user, except in the case of proxies / wi-fi access points. Those you might identify by looking at the distribution of session count per IP to identify likely 'aggregate' IPs. Sessions from the same IP / User-Agent that overlap in time are almost surely distinct. To further distinguish users you would need more info. For example, the sites or IP addresses that the user is connecting to would be a very strong basis for differentiating sessions. Then you could get into more sophisticated learning to figure out when sessions are the same or different users.
