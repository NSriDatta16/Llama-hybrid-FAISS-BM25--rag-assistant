If you cannot use the user's IP address (presumably because they are behind NAT?) and you cannot use cookies, there's really not much you can do. You could try to use the IP together with the user agent string (which might be different among different computers in the lab), but this would be both slower and of course far from guaranteed to work. Other than that I think you 're out of options.
