This error is not triggered from your controller but rather, from your view. Show the script where you call paginationControl(...) ?> For reference, you need to supply at least two things to the PaginationControl view helper: A Zend_Paginator object. Supplied as the first argument to the helper or by setting it as the paginator property of your view. A partial view path. Supplied as the third argument to the view helper (after scrollingStyle ) or via the static method RobertPitt mentioned in his comment.
