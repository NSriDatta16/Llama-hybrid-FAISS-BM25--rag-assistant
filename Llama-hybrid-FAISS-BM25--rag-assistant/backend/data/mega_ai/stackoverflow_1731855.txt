What is your production running? Express, Enterpris, Standard? Your development server should be Express if production is Express, Developer if production is non-Express. The idea is that there are differences between the editions, in terms of how certain features are available. Eg. you may turn on PAGE compression in development and conclude there is no data storage space issue, but the production runs Standard edition that does not support page compression. Or your queries benefit from indexed viewes, but again the production runs Standard edition, that does not support it. Or the opposite, your development spends time and effort to optimize a query on the development Express servers, but the produciton is running Enterprise and can use a simple indexed view to solve the issue. The biggest set of differences is between Express and other editions. What you need, in the end, depends mostly on the type of product(s) you develop and the kind of features you'll be leveraging in your product. Also you should consider the need to set up repro scenarios in test/development for problems reported by production.
