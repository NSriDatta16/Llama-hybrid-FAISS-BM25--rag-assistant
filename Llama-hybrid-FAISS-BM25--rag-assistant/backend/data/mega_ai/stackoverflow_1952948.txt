If you use business domain objects to validate the form as well, which can be achieved using rather simple tools, this eliminates the cruft of most validator based solutions. In a way you want to extrapolate partial behaviour from the business domain to the form domain; this should reduce code and improve maintenance at the cost of some extra wiring. I agree with Robert. I feel this approach is better than Zend/Cake/Ci etc. It seems to go in the direction of the naked object philosophy; just dump the V and the C, go for models only: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects
