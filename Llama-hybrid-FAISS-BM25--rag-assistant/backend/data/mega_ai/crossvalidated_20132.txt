The order statistics are just the sorted data values, so for any case where the data is univariate iid, the order statistics have the exact same information as the original data (just in a different order). If the order in the data matters (not iid, e.g. time series) then the order statistics don't have that information and that would be one case where they were not sufficient. Another case would be non-univariate cases, the order statistics of X and the order statistics of Y would be sufficient for the X and Y distributions seperately, but not for covariance or correlation parameters.
