Dimensionality Reduction: this is a way of reducing the features of your dataset which may not really contribute much to the model development. Putting it in another way, dimensionality reduction helps to remove "noice" from our dataset thus avoiding overfitting of our model. However, Kernel Trick helps us to make a linearly inseparable dataset to become linearly separable by projecting it into higher dimensionality which may otherwise improve the precision of our model. With Kernel Trick, you can make a nonlinear dataset linear.
