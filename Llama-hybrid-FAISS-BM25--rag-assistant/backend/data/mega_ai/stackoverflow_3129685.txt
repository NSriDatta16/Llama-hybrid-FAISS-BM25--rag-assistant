Using OData from WebForms

As some background I prefer the flexibility and benefits that ASP.NET MVC gives me, and have been building in MVC since its release. But the new project I am about to start requires a complex calendar / scheduler control - and none of the jQuery alternatives meet all the requirements. This has led me to the Telerik Radtools Scheduler, which ticks all the boxes, except its targetted at ASP.NET WebForms. The rest of the project contains basic CRUD functionality, which is a great fit for the patterns exposed through MVC. I have seen a lot of buzz lately about OData and was wondering if this may give me the "middle ground" I am after. Has anyone had any experience leveraging OData from Webforms (or even if its possible, or something that you would want to do). Am still looking to create a jQuery based client side heavy UX, so any other thoughts or suggestions are welcomed.
