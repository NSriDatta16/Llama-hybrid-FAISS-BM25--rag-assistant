Lotus Notes - scripting the creation of design element

I have a Lotus Notes application which actually consists of a template with all the required forms, views and agents needed. It also requires some design elements (a custom form and a view for our own type of documents) from this template to be copied over to the mail template, so after the regular refresh all users have it. The application works like this: the application database (derived from the template I provide) is created on the Domino server. An agent, running in this database, upon http request, creates a "custom" document in user's mail database. Then, on the client side, the user can use our view to display this document. Currently, the deployment procedure goes like this: Create a "master" application database out of our template. Fill some data, using the forms and views in that database (to configure how the application works) Copy the custom form and view to the mail template. Create our button (to launch our view and/or form) on the mail template. After the nightly database refresh, all users receive the custom form and the view in their mail database, and they can use the button to view our documents (if any). Now, I want to easy the admin's work, and automate the copying of the custom form and the view, and also the creation of the button to the mail template. Any idea how I can do this from a NotesScript, JavaScript, Java?
