Whats the advantage of single target neural network over multi target neural network?

So right now I have made 2 neural networks to predict x and y coordinates separately. One for x, and one for y. I'm looking for a reason to backup my assignment. I have search for this and most of the results only shows the advantage of multi target without showing the disadvantage of it or stating the advantage of single target neural network. Is there any reason or advantage of why single target neural network is better than the multi target? And is there any paper or academic research or any source for that?
