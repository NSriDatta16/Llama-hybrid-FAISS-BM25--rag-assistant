How to find a 'similarity' measure between 2 pandas dataframes?

I have 2 pandas dataframes: one big (300.000+ rows) and one little (50- rows) with the same columns . Assuming that the entries of the little one form a cluster I want to identify the entries of the big one that belong to this cluster. Which algorithm can I use? Any suggestion is welcome. I have access to all the python ecosystem and I plan to use this: https://pypi.org/project/gower/ . (I have an approach in mind somehow described here: scikit-learn one class svm results: how to improve? )
