A view is a query that you run often with preset parameters. If you know you will be looking at the same data all the time you can create a view for ease of use and for data binding. That being said, when you select from a view the view defining query is run along with the query you are running. For example, if vwCustomersWhoHavePaid is: Select * from customers where paid = 1 and the query you are running returns the customers who have paid after August first is formatted like this: Select * from vwCustomersWhoHavePaid where datepaid > '08/01/08' The query you are actually running is: Select * from (Select * from customers where paid = 1) where datepaid > '08/01/08' This is something you should keep in mind when creating views, they are a way of storing data that you look at often. It's just a way of organizing data so it's easier to access.
