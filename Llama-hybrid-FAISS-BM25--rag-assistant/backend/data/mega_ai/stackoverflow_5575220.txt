Generate LINQ to XML C# code, from an XML document?

Does anybody know of a tool that will generate LINQ to XML code from a real XML document or fragment? It's reverse-engineering the common scenario of generating XML. For example, I want to provide an XML fragment as input like this value and have it generate the equivalent C# LINQ to XML code snippet like so var x = new XElement("root", new XElement("thing", new XText("value")); ); Although I'm looking for a quickie, I'm sure some enterprising individuals will tell me to roll my own and provide some awesome reference code.
