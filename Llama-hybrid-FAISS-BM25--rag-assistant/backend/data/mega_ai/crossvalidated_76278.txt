There might be a typo there. The concept that I think the text should be trying to emphasize is that random forests are robust to noise variables. Thus if you have $100$ noise variables and $2$ relevant variables you should still get good answers. Where $r$ is number of relevant variables, the chance of selecting a relevant variable will be: $$ 1 - \bigg(\frac{C(p-r,\ m)}{C(p,\ m)}\bigg) $$ This is not a linear function and relatively robust to small $r/p$. If $r=1$, then: $$ 1-\frac{p-m}p $$ I hope that makes sense / is right. Bit rushed so didn't check the maths that closely.
