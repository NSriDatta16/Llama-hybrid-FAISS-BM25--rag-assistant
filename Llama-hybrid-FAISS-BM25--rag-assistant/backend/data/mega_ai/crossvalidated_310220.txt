Correlation between unpaired data

I have an experiment with 2 mice of 4 different age levels. For each age, I analyse a mouse with method A and the other mouse method B (no mouse is analyse with both method). I want to see whether method A and B is comparable. I have constructed a graph and it shows some correlation. If I use Spearman's correlation on the average, there is strong correlation but not significant because there are only 4 data pairs. Is there any way to take into account all of the data points?
