Instead of going from Principal Component Analysis you can go for Linear Discriminant Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of data. Linear Discriminant Analysis or LDA as it is popularly known takes the classes into consideration and tries to give feature components(linear combination of original vectors) that maximizes the inter-class distance and reduces the intra-class distance. You can take the first few LDA components and remove the other components as irrelevant and noise. Then these LDA features(only the first few) can be used as features to any other classification algorithm such as logistic regression,SVM,etc Note: LDA works best when the observations more or less follow Guassian distributioon within a class.
