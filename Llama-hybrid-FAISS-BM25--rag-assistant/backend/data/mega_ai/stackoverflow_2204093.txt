OS X Data Storage in PLIST Example or Tutorial?

I have looked for several hours for a good tutorial on how to store data for my command line program that I am writing in Objective-C. It seems like my options are NSUserDefaults, Plists, sqlite, or XML. Now, I think at most I'd have 50kb of data to store, retrieve, and modify, so it seems like from what I read Plists would work just fine, but I'm having difficulty finding a good tutorial online. (I'm completely new to Objective C). Everything I find is for the iPhone, or NSUserDefaults - neither of which I'm looking for. Can anyone point me in the right direction? I'm hoping just to replicate the very basic functionality of "defaults write com.yourcompanyname.yourappanme key data" I would greatly appreciate a nudge in the right direction, but again, I'm completely new so the most basic tutorial is best.
