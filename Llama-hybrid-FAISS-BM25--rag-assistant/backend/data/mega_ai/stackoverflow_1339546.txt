Casting means creating a reference to an object that is of a different type to the reference you're currently holding. You can do upcasting or downcasting and each has different benefits. Upcasting: string greeting = "Hi Bob"; object o = greeting; This creates a more general reference (object) from the more specific reference (string). Maybe you've written code that can handle any object, like this: Console.WriteLine("Type of o is " + o.GetType()); That code doesn't need to be changed no matter what objects you set o to. Downcasting: object o = "Hi Bob"; string greeting = (string)o; Here you want a more specific reference. You might know that the object is a string (you can test this e.g.: if (o is string) { do something } Now you can treat the reference as a string instead of an object. E.g. a string has a length (but an object doesn't), so you can say: Console.WriteLine("Length of string is " + greeting.length); Which you can't do with an object.
