Android seek bar/ progress bar with no click

I am fairly new to the android platform. I have to implement a SeekBar or a ProgressBar with the following constraint: it should not be clickable. I only want to allow my users to change the value of the bar by dragging it not by clicking on it. I have not found any solutions for that so far. Do you have any ideas?
