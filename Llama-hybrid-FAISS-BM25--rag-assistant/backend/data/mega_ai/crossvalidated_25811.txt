Is the R language reliable for the field of economics?

I am a graduate student in economics who recently converted to R from other very well-known statistical packages (I was using SPSS mainly). My little problem at the moment is that I am the only R user in my class. My classmates use Stata and Gauss and one of my professors even said that R is perfect for engineering, but not for economics. He said that many packages are built by people who know a lot about programming, but not much about economics and therefore are not reliable. He also mentioned the fact that since no money is actually involved in building an R package, there is therefore no incentive to do it correctly (unlike in Stata for example) and that he used R for a time and got some "ridiculous" results in his attempts to estimate some stuff. Moreover, he complained about he random number generator in R which he said was "messy". I've been using R for just a little more than a month and I must say I have fallen in love with it. All this stuff I am hearing from my professor is just discouraging me. So my question is: "Is R reliable for the field of economics?".
