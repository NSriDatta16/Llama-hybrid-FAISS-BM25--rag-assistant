Magento: select from database

I am working on my first module for magento version 1.3.2.3. I have created a simple table (not EAV, just a primary key and 2 columns) and some classes to access it, following Alan Storm's articles which helped me a lot, but I can't figure out how to make a simple select: Alan explains how to load with the primary key, but not selecting rows that match some value. In normal MySQL I'd write: SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE some_field = '" . $someValue . "' I've found a snippet which gives me the result I want: $resource = new Mage_Core_Model_Resource(); $read = $resource->getConnection('core_read'); $select = $read->select() ->from('my_table') ->where('some_field = ?', $someValue); return $read->fetchAll($select); But there have to be an easier/prettier solution, using the model class I've created. The result will be a single row, not a collection. I've tried everything I could think of, like: return Mage::getModel('modulename/classname')->select()->where('some_field = ?', $comeValue); return Mage::getModel('modulename/classname')->load()->where('some_field = ?', $comeValue); return Mage::getModel('modulename/classname')->load(array('some_field = ?', $comeValue)); and more stuff, but no luck so far: what am I missing??
