jQuery UI sortable - allow dropping to parent

How can I make it so a jQuery UI sortable that allows dragging between different lists, will also accept being dropped on a parent? See this example on JSBin , where there are 3 lists, one of them empty. When dragging any list item, and dropping it on the elements that wrap the lists (green), I want that item to go to the end of the contained (red). The sortable's update function needs to be called automatically as well. How? $('.sortable').sortable( { accept: '.sortable li', connectWith: '.sortable,.container', update: function () { alert('done with the moving'); } }); My attempt (doesn't work) is to make the containing a droppable target, as follows: $('.container').droppable( { accept: '.sortable li', drop: function(event, ui) { ui.draggable.appendTo($(this).find('ul')); } });
