mousemove handler?

Can we add a listener for mouse move events on the main document in GWT? I'm not sure how to do this and if whatever I do add will interfere with other parts of GWT (like drag and drop?). In javascript I do this: window.onload = function() { document.onmousemove = function(e) { alert("the mouse was moved!"); }; } I'm just not sure where to start, GWT got a bit confusing for me since the new stuff was introduce in 2.0 (I used to use 1.4), Thanks
