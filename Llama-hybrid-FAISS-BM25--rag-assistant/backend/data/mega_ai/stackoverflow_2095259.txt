This sounds like a problem that has already been solved: http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyinventory/ http://sourceforge.net/projects/asset-tracker/ These are just two links I found on sourceforge by typing 'inventory' in the search box. The most basic description is this: Computer parts come in. Computer parts get stored. Computer parts leave. I am not strong enough with SQL to recommend a way to handle computer donations / sales and their breakdowns into parts - I would probably let some outside application handle most of that logic, and keep track of this: Who donated a computer To whom was a computer given As far as logic handling: for instance, a webpage that says: "Woo! We received a computer! Does it have: A power supply? A video card? A sound card? And so on, and so forth." The same can be done when giving a computer away - but you need to remove '1' from storage for each of the parts that goes away! So, how do we handle the inventory? Well, you could have one table that looked like this: video card | recycle | donation-in | storage | garbage sound card | recycle | donation-in | storage | garbage power supply | recycle | donation-in | storage | garbage With each bin being how many there are at a point in time. If you want to make it more specific, you can add a "description" column, so you know how many of each type of video card you have, for instance. And a table that looked like this: part name | from_bin | to_bin | quantity Most of the logic for moving the quantities around should probably be handled by the application (I am more of a Ruby-on-Rails guys, so this makes sense to me). Hope that helps.
