HTML source appearing different in Firebug to standard browser 'View Source' option?

I have some HTML content being generated via some PHP. Whilst investigating a css problem, I noticed through Firebug that some elements in the DOM were not organised as I expected. Yet, when I did the standard 'View Source' in Firefox it showed everything to be correct. I know the source being displayed by Firebug is accurate, because the source it presents me corresponds to the aesthetic issue I'm seeing on screen, but I'm not sure what this means and how to investigate further. Why does this happen, and which source version should I be looking at? (p.s. I have no JavaScript running on the website.)
