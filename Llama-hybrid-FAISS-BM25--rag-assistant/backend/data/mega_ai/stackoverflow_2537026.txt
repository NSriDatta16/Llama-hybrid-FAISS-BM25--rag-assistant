You have several options. As stated above, you could use one of the excellent frameworks, like jQuery or prototype. Or you give the an ID, that you can use simply with document.getElementById() . Then, as reko_t pointed out, without the above, you must write a lengthy DOM traversing code (which is preferable, if you don't use JS frameworks elsewhere, over embedding them only for this task). In the most recent browsers (namely, IE>=8, FF>=3.5, recent Opera and Safari > 3) you can also use this simple snippet: var p = document.querySelectorAll("div.box p");
