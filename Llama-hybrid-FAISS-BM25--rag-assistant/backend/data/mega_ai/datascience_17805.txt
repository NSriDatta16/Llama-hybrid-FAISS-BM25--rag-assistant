You can try two different approaches: 1) Kalman filter , the method is battle-tested and has proven useful in many areas. Resources: Understanding the Basis of the Kalman Filter kalman filter in pictures 2) Recurrent Neural Networks , the LSTM and GRU architectures are particularly interesting for time series predictions. Resources: RNN effectiveness Understanding LSTMs To do regression and predict future data points, you would need to build a training dataset consisting of a sequence of events. Let's say a value $x$ for every timestamp $t$. Your data seems to have 1 dimension, so both the network input layer and the output layer would consist of 1 unit. You would then train your model to predict $(x_{t+1})$ given $(x_{t})$. Let $M$ be our trained model and let's say you want to forecast a data point at time $k$ and you know the current value at time $t$. $M(x_{t}) = (x_{t+1})$ $t = t+1$ $M(x_{t}) = (x_{t+1})$ $...$ increment $t$ and keep predicting until $t+1 = k-1$ $M(x_{t+1}) = (x_{k})$ Put in pictures this corresponds to: (picture from Udacity lecture about Deep Learning)
