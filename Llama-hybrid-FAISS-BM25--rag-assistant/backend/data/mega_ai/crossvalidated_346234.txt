Feature selection and engineering are different concepts. There are many automated approaches to selection (eg, regularization) that are easy to look into. The meat here is in feature engineering, and it requires creativity and trial-and-error. There aren’t hard and fast rules. Besides engineering features you already have (eg, some transformation, imputation), the creative part comes in adding new features based on information you might be able to pull out or add from external sources. For fraud detection, think about things like time of day, industry segment, originating account holder size, frequency of transactions, historical record, variability of transactions, etc. In other words, you must think through the problem from multiple angles and identify characteristics that might be quantified despite not being readily available. A good example of this is solving the ‘titanic’ dataset. Kagglers have achieved impressive accuracy through feature engineering.
