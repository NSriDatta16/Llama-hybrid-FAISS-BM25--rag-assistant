How to dual license my open source software?

I am working on a library and would like to dual license it: One open source license for open source projects One commercial license for commercial projects However, I was approached by an organizer of a "coding fest" which wanted to use my project for an open source coding event. I am not sure if it would be smart to let other developers work on the project as I want to keep the legal right to release it under a commercial license as well as an open source one. How should I handle that ? PS: The open source license I have chosen is GNU Affero GPLv3 license (AGPLv3).
