Magento uses a response object to send all output. All output is added to this object, and then its sendResponse method is called. If you want to alter the output, setup a listener for the http_response_send_before event singleton group/observer alterOutput And then in your observer you may get and set the body class Packagename_Modulename_Model_Observer { public function alterOutput($observer) { $response = $observer->getResponse(); $html = $response->getBody(); //modify html here $response->setBody($html); } } If you're interested, this event is called in the sendResponse method of the following class app/code/core/Mage/Core/Controller/Response/Http.php and the output itself is sent in the sendResponse and outputBody methods of lib/Zend/Controller/Response/Abstract.php
