How to create asynchronous notifications in android

What is the best practice to create a scheduled notification at some point in the future? I have found a way using a Service that is triggered with a PendingIntent via the AlarmManager . In the onCreate() method of the Service I create the notification. This seems a bit like abusing the service to do something it is not supposed to be doing. Is there another less cumbersome / more elegant method of achieving the same end? (The use case in question is giving the user a daily reminder to do something with my app)
