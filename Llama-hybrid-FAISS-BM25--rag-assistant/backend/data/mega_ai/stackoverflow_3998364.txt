As you already said, we can use groupBy to group the Marks by name. Now we have a Map where each key is the name and the value is a list of Marks with that name. We can now iterate over that Map and replace each key-value pair with a Mark-object that has the key as its name, and the average of the style_mark s in the list as its style_mark and the average of other_mark s in the list as its other_mark . Like this: def avg(xs: List[Int]) = xs.sum / xs.length marks.groupBy(_.name).map { kv => Mark(kv._1, avg(kv._2.map(_.style_mark)), avg(kv._2.map(_.other_mark))) }
