Reviving this thread - In "Neurocomputing" by Robert Hecht-Nielsen @ 1990 there is reference to a 1986 paper by Cottrell/Munro/Zipser that outlines use of a neural network that has the architecture of an autoencoder, and is trained on the identity function, for compression and reconstruction of image data. The term "autoencoder" isn't mentioned, but that's what it is. There is no mention of using it for anomaly detection either. Seems like that usage was discovered later.
