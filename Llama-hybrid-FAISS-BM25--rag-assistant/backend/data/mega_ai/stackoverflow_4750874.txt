Your malloc() call doesn't look right to me, but perhaps I'm missing something. What I should be seeing is one malloc() call for the storage for the array. If you want 10 C strings in it, that would be malloc(10 * sizeof (char *)) . Then I should see some more malloc() calls that actually allocate the memory the 10 strings themselves use. But I'm only seeing one malloc() call, that appears to think it is allocating string array memory, not string pointer array memory.
