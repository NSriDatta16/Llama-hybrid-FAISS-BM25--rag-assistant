For reinforcement learning you do not need a dataset as the agent has to learn how to act by repeated trial-and-error interactions with the environment, so having a dataset is of no use here. You need to be able to simulate the whole environment from any position. Imitation learning, however, learns by trying to replicate what someone else (for ex. an expert) has done, so the dataset must exist in this case. The agent won't interact with the environment but it will try to learn to act like someone else (on the state space that was explored).
