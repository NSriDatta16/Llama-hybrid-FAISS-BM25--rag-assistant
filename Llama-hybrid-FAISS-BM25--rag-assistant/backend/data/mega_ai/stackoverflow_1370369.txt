NSTableView responding to first click in a panel

I have noticed in the Interface Builder if I want to click on or drag from the Library panel, I only have to click on it once, even if the Library panel does not have the current focus. I am trying to build a panel that behaves similarly. Is there any simple way to let the NSTableView accept the click, even if the window does not have the focus? Thanks.
