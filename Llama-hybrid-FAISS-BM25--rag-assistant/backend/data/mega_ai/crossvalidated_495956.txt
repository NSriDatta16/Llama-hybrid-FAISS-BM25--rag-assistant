My suggestion is to concatenate all 4 matrices into a single one with 11264 + 120 + 89 + 128 measures for each of the 284 individuals. And then perform the PCA on this resulting matrix. in this approach, if you select the PCA to keep k dimensions of the combined matrix, you will have the best k uncorrelated, derived (though a linear combinations of the original data) measures for each of your 284 individuals. adding the PCA of each individual matrices makes no sense. Let us assume that the GEI matrix contain genetic information. A PCA that results in k dimensions is the best k uncorrelated, derived measures from the raw genetic data. Let us assume that UR is the answers for a personality test for each of the individuals. A PCA that results in k final dimensions is the best k uncorrelated, derived measures of personality. The first dimension of the PCA reduced GEI has nothing to do with the first dimension of the PCA reduced UR. and thy cannot be added!!!
