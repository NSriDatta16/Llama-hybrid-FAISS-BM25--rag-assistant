Use a 10-sided die, marked 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4. Or are you (for some reason) limited to six-sided dice? For a computer implementation, see Benny Jobigan's answer. However, if you're restricted to two six-sided dice, one method is to make 36 small square cards. Mark 12 with "1", mark 9 with "2", mark 6 with "3", mark 3 with "4" and eithjer leave six blank or mark them "re-roll". Arrange the 36 cards in a 6x6 square. Mark each row and column with the numbers 1-6 and decide what die corresponds to the columns and what to the rows. Roll the dice and find the card that corresponds to the row and column selected. If the card has a number, that's the number you want, if it's blank (or says "re-roll"), roll both dice again. Note that the exact placement of the numbers on the grid doesn't matter for fair dice, but will give different results for biased dice.
