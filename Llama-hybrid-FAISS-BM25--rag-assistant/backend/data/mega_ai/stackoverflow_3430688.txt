Well the error message 0x80004005 E_FAIL Unspecified failure is not very helpful. I often get frustrated when working with Active Directory. Try changing line: group.Properties("member").Remove(x.Properties("OrganizationalUnit").Value) to group.Invoke("Remove", New Object() {x.Path.ToString()}) If you need more reference take a look at this article on VB.net Heaven by Erika Ehrli. The article covers various use cases with Active Directory. I hope that helps.
