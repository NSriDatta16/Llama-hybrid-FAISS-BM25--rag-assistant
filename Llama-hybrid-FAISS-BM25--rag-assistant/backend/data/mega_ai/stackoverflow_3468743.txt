An SMTP server is usually how you'd refer to an outbound mail server; it sends mail. POP and IMAP allow you to connect to a mail server, to read the mail that's already been received. You need the receiving/server side of SMTP, and you might benefit from reading up on MTA ; mail transfer agent. You might also be interested in reading about SMTP proxies; so, sent mail would go through your server - and could be filtered/listened to, I suppose - and then get sent further to it's actual recipient.
