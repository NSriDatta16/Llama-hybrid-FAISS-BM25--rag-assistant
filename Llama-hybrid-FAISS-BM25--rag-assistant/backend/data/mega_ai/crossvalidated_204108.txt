It was my mistake, I had the concepts mixed up: in the examples online they were doing 30 full passes through the training set, not 30 iterations. At 20 samples per iteration, an epoch is 3000 iterations. Then 30 epochs would be 90000 iterations, which is way more than the amount I was using. I just tried with 50000 iterations and I got an accuracy of 0.9467 in the first try. For reference, one of the Python implementations I mentioned is part of this online book on neural networks: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html
