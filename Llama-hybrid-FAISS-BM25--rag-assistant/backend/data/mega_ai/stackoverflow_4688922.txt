auto isn't a datatype. It's a storage class specifier, like static . It's basically the opposite of static when used on local variables and indicates that the variable's lifetime is equal to its scope. When it goes out of scope it is "auto"-matically destroyed. Note that auto in C is currently (ie: in C17 and earlier) not like auto in modern C++ -- it does not perform any type inference. However, it is possible that C23 will change auto to do a weaker form of type inference . The auto keyword is pretty useless today: you never need to specify it as the only places you're even allowed to are exactly the places where automatic storage is already the default behavior.
