Concerns over performance can be greatly mitigated if you consider this as a build/batch problem rather than a realtime query. The graph can be statically computed then latently updated e.g. hourly, daily etc. to then generate edges and storage optimized for runtime query e.g. top 10 similar users for each user. +1 for Programming Collective Intelligence too - it is very informative - wish it wasn't (or I was!) as Python-oriented, but still good.
