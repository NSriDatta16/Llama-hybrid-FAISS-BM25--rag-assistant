Using "robust scaling" in the sense we use the median and the interquartile range to centre and scale a variable before being used within a model is a very common use of order statistics. Similarly the MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) is relatively commonly used robust estimator of a sample's standard deviation $\sigma$ . Similarly, using min-max scaling where we rescale a variable to be in the range of $[0, 1]$ is a classical case of using a sample's minimum and maximum values. (Strictly speaking any sample quantile is not a order statistic statistic unless it relates to a pre-existing sample value and is not a function of averaging some sample values (e.g. when calculating the median of sample with an even numbered sample size, that median is not an order statistics, while it would if the sample size is an odd number.))
