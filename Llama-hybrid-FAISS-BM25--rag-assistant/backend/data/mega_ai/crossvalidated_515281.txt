How can I cure non-normality of residuals in logistic regression?

I am running a logistic regression against the "Default" dataset of ISLR . I am using the performance package in R (available on CRAN) to test the goodness of my model. MWE: rm(list=ls()) indf $default default) indf $student student) mod Diagnostic plot is as follows: As you can see from the plot in the upper right the residuals don't follow a normal distribution. How can I cure that? I have tried putting the squares of the variables in the model, but they are non-significant and the problem remains.
