The problem of covariate shift ultimately results in datasets with different underlying mathematical structure. Now, Manifold Learning estimates a low dimensional representation of high-dimensional data thereby revealing the underlying structure. Often Manifold Learning techniques are not projections -- therefore, different and more powerful, than standard PCA. I've used Manifold Learning techniques (for eg: IsoMap, MDS, etc) to visualize (and, if possible, quantify) the "(dis)similarity" between train and test datasets.
