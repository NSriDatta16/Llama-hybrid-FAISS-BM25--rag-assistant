How to omit the xml declarations when using XElement.Save?

XElement.Save actually does what I need but it starts the file with: Is there a way to prevent this? Should I save using other types, methods after I finish creating my XElement ? Or should I be skipping that line via XmlReader.Read ? Because doing this I feel like it's more fragile as I am assuming the first line is always gonna be this xml declaration. What's the simpliest way to accomplish this?
