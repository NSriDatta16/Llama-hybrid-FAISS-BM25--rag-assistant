If you have all the points organized into polygons you can draw polygons on a canvas and then draw it on an Overlay. That i think would be quicker. Also you can always do some calculation about what part of the building need to be redrawn for the next position and just change that part of the Canvas. If you moved (X,Y) pixels from an earlier position, shift the existing canvas into the new position and just draw the new things that appear on map. This is not the optimal solution of course because this kind of caching wouldn't work with the zoom. Hope it helped somehow! JQCorreia
