Prediction interval for Combined forecast of univariate time series

I have made a combined forecast of a univariate time series. I used ETS, ARIMA and STL and take a simple average of these means and get a combined point forecast 12 months ahead. My question is. How to calculate a 95% prediction interval for the combined point forecast?
