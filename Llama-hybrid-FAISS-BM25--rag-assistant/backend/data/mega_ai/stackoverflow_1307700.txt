Assuming you're talking about Winforms and you have your data source as a component on your form already, this is fairly simple. Drag a new BindingSource onto your form and set its data source to be whatever your existing data source is. You can then specify a filtering expression in the new BindingSource 's Filter property in the designer. Bind your TextBox to your new BindingSource and you're all set. Doing this manually (without the designer) is only marginally more complicated. BindingSource newSource = new BindingSource(); newSource.DataSource = yourExistingDataSource; newSource.Filter = "special_categeory = 'tot'"; textBox.DataBindings.Add("Text", newSource, "DataMember");
