How to write a text transformer?

Suppose I have a text that I can easily parse. It consists of text and special identifiers. After parsing I get a list of tokens that correspond to text and special identifiers in the text. The problem I am having is how do I transform it from this token list into some other form? I can't understand how to approach this problem. I tried to build a parse tree but I don't understand what to do next. Please advise on this general problem of parsing.
