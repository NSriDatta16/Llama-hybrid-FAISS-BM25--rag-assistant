Advances in hyper parameter tuning and ensemble models are taking a lot of the 'art' out of model building. However, there are two important aspects of model building that hyper parameter tuning and ensembles don't deal with and will keep you from finding the best possible model. First, certain types of algorithms are better at modeling certain types of data. For example, if there are interactions between your variables, an additive model is not going to find them, but a decision tree will. Knowing how models behave on different dataset, and picking the right one, might require knowledge about the domain to find the best modeling algorithm. Second, feature engineering and feature extraction is the real 'art' to model building. Your question assumes that the dataset is already prepared. But what you should not assume is that the dataset is the best possible representation of what you are trying to model. This is always and open question. In many cases, where the data set is complex, you can engineer features all day long, but you risk throwing more and more noise into the algorithm. To know which features to add you must know which features make sense from a statistical perspective and which make sense from the perspective of the domain expert. For those two reasons, I conclude that no, you will not be able to find an algorithm that finds the best possible model automatically. This is also why I'm skeptical of software vendors pitching tools that will replace the need for data scientists. However, if you are narrowing your ambition to finding the best model from a fixed set of models, with optimal hyper parameters, where 'best' is defined as the highest predictive accuracy on a training set, then yes, this is possible. Check out the caret package in R as an example of how to automatically tune models. caret uses grid search, which has flaws, and it only builds one model at a time. However, there are functions to compare models and convenient wrappers for a long list of models from many different R packages.
