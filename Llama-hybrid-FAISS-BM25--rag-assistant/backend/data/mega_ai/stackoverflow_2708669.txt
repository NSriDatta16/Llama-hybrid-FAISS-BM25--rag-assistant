Presumably, the code comments or revision comments have keywords to target the code fragment you are looking for: SVN Query - http://svnquery.tigris.org/ "SvnQuery is a fast full text search engine for subversion repositories. It searches every file in every revision. Not only the content of a file is indexed, but also its complete metadata like path, author, comments and properties. A simple, Google-like web frontend is provided, but it is expected that the query library and indexing mechanism can be reused in other frontends, e.g. a web service or a Visual Studio Plug-In. SvnQuery is implemented in C# 3.0 and ASP.NET is used for the web frontend. The full text search is done by Lucene.Net which delivers an astonishing performance. ..." The query language is described here: http://svnquery.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=o0dpdE&freeformpage=SvnWebQueryHelp
