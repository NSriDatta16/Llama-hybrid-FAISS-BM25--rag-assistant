Parsing XML with VB.net

I'm trying to make sense of a big data dump of XML that I need to write to a database using some VB.net code. I'm looking for some help getting started with the parsing code, specifically how to access the attribute values. My Property Name Section of main pool 114 apartments, four floors, no lifts Property location 2 key A comfortable property, the apartment is set on a pine-covered hillside - a scenic and peaceful location. PROPERTY_ID facilities include X,Y,Z Self Catering. Frequent organised daytime activities Basically I want to find a property within the xml file that has a certain property ID. So it would be something like the code listed below which is my interpretation of what it should be. The code doesn't work, so I'm going wrong somewhere with it. This is the relevant line that I need to be able to access: PROPERTY_ID Dim productsXML As XElement = XElement.Load("C:\myFile.xml") Dim foundNode As XElement Dim query = From p In productsXML.Elements("Product").Descendants("Values") Where p.Attributes("attribute").ToString = "PROPERTY_ID" foundNode = query.FirstOrDefault()
