have a look at my favorite SQLite ADO.NET Wrapper , which I personally use in a lot of projects. I suppose, that Google Gears is using a default SQLite database with a little bit of modifications in the code to prevent ATTACH and #PRAGMA uses. But the dataformat should be identical and so you should be able to access it using this wrapper. Best regards, Martin
