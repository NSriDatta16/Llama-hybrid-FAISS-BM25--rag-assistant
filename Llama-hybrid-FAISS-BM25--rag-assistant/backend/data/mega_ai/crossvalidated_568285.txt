I am not aware of any generalization of the Firth's penalized likelihood approach to mixed effect models (i.e. not clear how one ought to penalize the hierarchical scale parameter in this setting). However, note that Firth's penalized likelihood approach is basically a Bayesian maximum a-posteriori approach using Jeffreys prior. Thus, one thing you could do is to use software that's intended for (amongst other things) fitting Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects models. There is a number of convenient R packages like brms (or also rstanarm ) that would easily allow you to do something like that using familiar R formula syntax. You'd simply have to decide on appropriate prior distributions, for which you might e.g. choose something rather weakly informative in order to obtain something that's not too different from the Firth approach in simple settings (assuming that is desirable to you). In general, Bayesian approaches with proper priors are pretty good (i.e. they often have better frequentist operating characteristics for plausible scenarios than competing frequentist methods) at dealing with sparse binary/binomial data, if you set sensible prior distributions.
