The measurement error at issue here is an error in the dependent variable in the linear model. I believe the 'labels minus ground truth' could be considered 'classical measurement error'; orthogonal (independent?) of the right-hand-side variables. Paraphrasing Greene (Econometric Analysis 1993, page 280-8), and similar points in other sources (Wikipedia, https://theeffectbook.net/ etc.) in the image below (my notes are linked here): Such an estimate should be unbiased. Furthermore, while the measurement error in the outcome variable is indeed adding noise, this noise is incorporated in our calculation of the standard errors. While this reduces our statistical power relative to to a case without measurement error, it does not lead us to be falsely confident, so our p-values etc. are correctly stated. We should have correct 'coverage' I think. (However, this might be an asymptotic result only.)
