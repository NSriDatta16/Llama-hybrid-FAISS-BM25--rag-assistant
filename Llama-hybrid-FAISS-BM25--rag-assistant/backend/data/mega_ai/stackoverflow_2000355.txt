Java Web Start is kind of like a successor to applets - it allows Java programs to be run from your browser (though unlike applets, they don't run within the browser). For a practical example, see the TopCoder Arena. http://www.topcoder.com/contest/arena/ContestAppletProd.jnlp Here, Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) is the protocol that defines how a Web Start application should be run (analogous to HTML telling a browser how a page should be rendered). See the Oracle tutorials: Lesson: Web Start Deploying a Java Web Start Application Java Network Launch Protocol
