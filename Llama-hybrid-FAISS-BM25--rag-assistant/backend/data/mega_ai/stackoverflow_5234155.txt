What about an include file? Like the file attribute in the appSettings Element or the SectionInformation.ConfigSource Property ? The included file can be protected from public access with regular filesystem access rights. I would definitely NOT use isolated storage for that. Encryption would be ideal but since that is not acceptable for you... Using environmental variables would work too I guess... But I would probably not use it myself.
