What casperOne is saying is that out of browser Silverlight does not have access to a full fledged database on the client. The best that can be done is to use some sort of compact database either in the isolated storage or within one of the few accessible folders with Silverlight 4. I have personally used siaqodb.com , but you will have to keep the data synchronized manually (which can be a nightmare). More recently I have seen someone get access to a SQL compact database . However, there could be more ways of accessing data now. It has been some time since I've looked for a client side database for Silverlight.
