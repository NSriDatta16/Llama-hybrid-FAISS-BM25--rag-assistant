Everyone does know about SQL injections, but one of the most surprising exploits I recently heard about was putting SQL injections into bar codes. Testers should be checking ALL inputs for malicious SQL. An attacker could show up at an event and crash their registration system, change prices at stores, etc. I think just bar code hacking in general was surprising to me. No wow factor here, just something else to be aware of. EDIT: Just had a discussion where the idea of putting the SQL injection on a magnetic card strip was brought up. I guess you can put one anywhere, so test any and all input, especially from users and these kinds of data storage devices.
