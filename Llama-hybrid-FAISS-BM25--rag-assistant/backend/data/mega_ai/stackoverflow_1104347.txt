Redirecting C++ fstream

So I have a C++ program, that normally when it executes writes out things to a log file. This is done using an fstream. However, now I want to include functionality to turn the logging off. Essentially, my code looks like this: bool isLogging; fstream* logFilePtr; throughout my code, there are a bunch of statements like: (*logFilePtr) Now, if the "isLogging" is true, I don't want these to print. I could just go surround them with a bunch of if statements, but I'd prefer something cleaner than that. I thought there was some way to take a C++ stream and redirect it to point to "nothing" so that when the Does anyone know how to redirect the stream, or have any other ideas on how to handle this in an elegant way? Thanks, Colin
