Random forest feature importance vs. feature correlation to PCA eigenvectors

I have recently built a random forest model for classifying two types of cancer based on patients' genetic profile. I used patients' genetic markers (SNPs) as my features and disease status as my outcome. My question however is why top ranked features in my model are not the same as the features with high correlation to PCA eigenvectors? It seems like they are completely different features? If both techniques try to put more weight on features that describe greatest amount of variability within data why they are discordant? P.S: following discussion below I am enclosing my PCA plot. You can see a nice pattern of clustering/separation between the two groups and this is why I expected top ranked features in RF classifier be the same as highly correlated features to PCA eigenvectors!
