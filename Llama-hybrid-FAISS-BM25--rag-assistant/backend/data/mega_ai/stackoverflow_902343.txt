A good place to learn about version control is Eric Sink's Weblog . His most recent article is Time and Space Tradeoffs in Version Control Storage , for one example. Another good example is his series of articles Source Control HOWTO . Yes, it's all about how to use source control, but it has a lot of information about the decisions and tradeoffs developers have to make when designing the system. The best example of this is probably his article on Repositories , where he explains different methods of storing versions. I really learned a lot from this series.
