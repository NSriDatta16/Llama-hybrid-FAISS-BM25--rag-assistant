Generate a probabilistic dictionary with naive bayes

I want to make quantitative content analyses with a naive bayes algorithm. The analyses contain 10000 documents. However, I don´t want to encode 10000 documents manually. So the goal is to train the algorithm with some documents (maybe 1000) and generate a probabilistic dictionary with it. With that dictionary I want to encode the remaining 9000 documents. I know how the naive bayes works in R , but I don´t know how to generate the dictionary. It should be work like a spam-filter. Based on the training process the spam filter "knows" which features/words are the best predictors for a spam mail. Any Idea? Here is a small example. I encoded one category with 24 cases. Observations: 24 Variables: 2 $ Pragmatic 1, 1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 $ reviewText "I love this. I have a D800. I am mention my camera to make sure that y... The goal of the classification is to predict the positive (+1) manifestation of the variable "pragmatic" through specific words of the review text. Here is the code of the naive bayes. amazon_test_pragmatic$reviewText 0) corpus % tm_map(tolower) %>% tm_map(removeNumbers) %>% tm_map(removePunctuation) %>% tm_map(removeWords, c(stopwords("english"))) dtm 0, 1,0) y The Problem is, that I cannot detect which features (words) lead to this result.
