I think you are confused about the role of intercept in logistic regression. Logistic regression predicts the probability of some outcome, in your case e.g. the probability of the A choice. To do that, it forms a linear combination of predictors and passes it through a logistic function that "squeezes" real numbers from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ into a $[0,1]$ interval. It looks like that (image from Wikipedia ): $\quad\quad\quad\quad$ So if the linear combination has value 0 then the output of logistic function is $p=0.5$. This means that a logistic regression without any predictors whatsoever and with zero intercept predicts 50% chance. If you had 1 data point per subject, you could have used glm(choice ~ 1, family='binomial') and looked at the value and p-value for the intercept. In your case you have more than 1 data point per subject, so you can use glmer(choice ~ 1 + (1|subject), family='binomial')
