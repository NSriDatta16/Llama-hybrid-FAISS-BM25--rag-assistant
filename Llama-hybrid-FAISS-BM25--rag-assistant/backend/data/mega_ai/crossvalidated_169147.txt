When looking at a single parameter, it is possible that a test about the value of the parameter and the confidence interval "mismatch" depending on how they are constructed. In particular, a hypothesis test is a level $\alpha$-test, if it rejects the null hypothesis a proportion $\leq \alpha$ of the time when the null hypothesis is true. For that reason one can e.g. use estimates of model parameters (e.g. the variance) that are only valid under the null hypothesis. If one then tried to construct a CI by inverting this test, the coverage may be not quite right under the alternative hypothesis. For that reason one would usually construct a confidence interval differently so that the coverage is also right under the alternative, which can then lead to a (usually very small) mismatch.
