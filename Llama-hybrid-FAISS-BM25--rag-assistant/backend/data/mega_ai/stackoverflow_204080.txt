For the most obvious unused declarations, a high warnlevel would take care of the matter. Regarding the identification of unused pieces of code, the deadstripper (not being the center of a late night crime drama, but the mechanism which culls unused code during linking) will only get you part of the way - what you really want is a code coverage analysis tool. Plenty exist, unfortunately all of them are rather expensive. A robust editor with good context tagging and call-graphing mechanism will also help.
