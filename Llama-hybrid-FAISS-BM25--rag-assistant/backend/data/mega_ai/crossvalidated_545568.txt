Which predictive model to use for distributions like this

I have a target variable that has the following distribution. I have tried the typical regression models such as logistic regression, ridge regression, catboost regression etc. but I'm thinking that I could use a model that takes into account the features but also some kind of prior knowledge of the distribution of the target variable. Im trying to predict duration in minutes and Iâ€™m trying to use machine learning to predict that. Some of my features might have normal or other distributions but do not really know how to use even that. Any suggestions?
