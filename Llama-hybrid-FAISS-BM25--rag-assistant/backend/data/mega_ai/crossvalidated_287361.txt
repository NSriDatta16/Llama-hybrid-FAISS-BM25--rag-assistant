Although Frank Harrell's answer is correct, I think it misses the scope of the question. The answer to your question is yes , MSE would make sense in a ML nonparametric scenario. The ML equivalent of logistic regression is the linear perceptron, which makes no assumptions and does use MSE as a cost function. It uses online gradient descent for parameter training and, since it solves a convex optimisation problem, parameter estimates should be at the global optimum. The main difference between the two methods is that with the nonparametric approach you don't get confidence intervals and p-values and therefore you cannot use your model for inference, you can only use it for prediction. The Linear Perceptron makes no probabilistic assumptions. There is the assumption on the data that it is linearly separable, but this is not an assumption on the model. MSE could be in theory affected by heteroscedasticity but in practice this effect is nullified by the activation function.
