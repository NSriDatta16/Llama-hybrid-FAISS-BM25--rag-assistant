I'm not sure if this is exactly what you need, but I have found the ImmediatePost option of the grid to be very useful for situations where I need to update a summary - it's buried under its Data Controller property of the cxView. This makes the grid act like a spreadsheet - as soon as the user presses enter or tab in a cell, the record gets posted. Then I would have my summarising event fire from the AfterPost event of the dataset, perhaps? (You probably already know this but the gridview itself has a lot of very useful summarising options built into it - look at the Summary properties of the columns, and make sure ShowFooter is set to true in the ViewOptions - so if your summary is a relatively simple total or average or similar, let the grid do it all and save yourself some work.)
