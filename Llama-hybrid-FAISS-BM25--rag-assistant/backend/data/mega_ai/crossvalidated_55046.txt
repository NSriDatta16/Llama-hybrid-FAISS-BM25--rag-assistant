You're on the right path with the line chart (as Peter Flom mentioned, AVOID PIE CHARTS, especially comparing two of them). As for the line chart, consider the message you're trying to convey and use the chart's formatting to reinforce the message. Here's an example where perhaps you want to emphasize the strongest importer at the beginning period in comparison with the strongest at the end. By using pre-attentive attributes like color, you can direct the viewers attention to the information you want them to focus on. Include a more descriptive title that summarizes your message and the line chart can really focus your reader. All the other information is still present, so you don't lose context.
