What is the difference between decision_function, predict_proba, and predict function for logistic regression problem?

I have been going through the sklearn documentation but I am not able to understand the purpose of these functions in the context of logistic regression. For decision_function it says that its the distance between the hyperplane and the test instance. how is this particular information useful? and how does this relate to predict and predict-proba methods?
