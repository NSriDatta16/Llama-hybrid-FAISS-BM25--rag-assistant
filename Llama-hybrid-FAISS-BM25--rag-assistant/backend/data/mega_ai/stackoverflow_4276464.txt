Xdocument - how to convert non-html safe characters

I have a "title" attribute inside elements of my UTF-8 xml, e.g. as I want the content of this attribute to be printed directly in an HTML page, I'm trying to have an output like: The code fragment where I add there attribute looks like this: new XElement( "tag", new XAttribute( "title" , title) ); Characters such as & and " are escaped, but §£ are not - as they're valid utf-8 characters. What should I change?
