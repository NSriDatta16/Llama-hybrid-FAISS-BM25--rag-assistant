I really agree with the "People skills" post, but aside from that: To name one - I've really understood how languages are actually not languages. They are dialects. It seems that for each micro-piece-of-knowledge that goes into the autonomous parts of my fingers, I'm blessed with the ability to generalize into a higher level of understanding of things. -- These are words from my father who is a welder/steel-worker. Couldn't agree more. /Robert
