What is a good approach to increase the depth of Nifti file format or Dicom file series?

I have a CT scan dataset of skull fracture consisting of multiple fractures and normal cases, the CT scans are in Dicom format. I want to do multi-class classification. But not every Dicom image series has the same depth, some series may have 250 slices, some have 30 slices. My dataset is really small, so I don't want to drop any 2d slice. And at the end, I will convert Dicom into Nifti for 3d CNN, so I need all the Dicom series to have the same depth. I want to artificially increase the depth of the Dicom series. I've read GAN is a popular way to increase medical image artificially. What are my other options?
