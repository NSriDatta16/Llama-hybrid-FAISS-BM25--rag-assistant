Binary Pattern Prediction

I have 400K observations, each one is a growing binary pattern where order matters. The goal is to predict the likelihood of the next character. For example, 10101010101? - as humans we can eyeball and say with high confidence that the next character will be a 0. 111111000000111? - in this case, probably a 1. Any suggestions to the best approach? I was considering expanding the dataset really wide, deriving a lot of lagging variables and so forth, then using regular logistic regression. But I'm curious if there's a better approach.
