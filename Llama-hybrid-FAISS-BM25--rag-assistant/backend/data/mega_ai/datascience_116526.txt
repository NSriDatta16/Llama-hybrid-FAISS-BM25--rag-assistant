A machine learning model can be trained on labeled data to learn patterns and memic how humans label the entities, however, the provided dataset plays an important role in enhancing the model performance. The mentioned problem above can be easily transformed to a multi-label classification task and a BERT based model may perform very well in tagging those words in the text.
