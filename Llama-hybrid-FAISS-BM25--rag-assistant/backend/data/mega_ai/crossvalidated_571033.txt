Can the term 'hyperparameter' apply to non-ML modelling?

Commonly when modelling biological systems, some parameters may be from elsewhere or previous modelling fits, and are not being investigated in the current model. These seem to be equivalent to the ML hyperparameters, in that they are stated prior to model training and are not the purpose of modelling the dataset. I'm interested if this could be an appropriate use of terminology, or if this use of hyperparameter (i.e. not the Bayesian hyperparameter) is only applicable to ML. edit: An example of non-ML modelling - a set of ODEs/PDEs characterising dynamic systems of cellular interactions, where the form of the model is informed by chemical and biological understanding of the system. A hyperparameter in this context could be one governing the growth of a tumour, taken from a previous experiment, when the current model is based upon experimental data that describe tissue oxygenation over time as the tumour grows.
