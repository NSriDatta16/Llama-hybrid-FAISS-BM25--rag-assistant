Clearness Scoring Function

Hello to the community, I would love to hear your opinion about a Prediction Model I am currently working on for my thesis, in order to predict the Clearness of a website. I created a dataset of 5.000 landing page images. Then I made a web application where users would vote random pairs of images and choose the image that looked more "clear". As a result, after getting results from more than 1.000 users Î™ have a dataset with the following scheme "image1" "image521" 1 "image3" "image241" 0 "image35" "image12" 1 : : : "image5" "image902" 1 where I have tuples of the images that have been displayed and if the third value is 0, then the first image is chosen, if the value is 1 the second image was chosen. Now, my question comes to how I should structure the (Clearness) Score function. So far the Clearness Score function is calculated with the following way: Clearness = TimesAnImageIsVoted*100/TimesAnImageIsDisplayed As an example, if an image has been displayed 20 times in 20 unique pairs and has been selected 15 times as the more clear image, then the Clearness would be equal to 75. Should I take into consideration the pairs, penalize images that are not selected or in general have a more elegant approach? Thank you in advance.
