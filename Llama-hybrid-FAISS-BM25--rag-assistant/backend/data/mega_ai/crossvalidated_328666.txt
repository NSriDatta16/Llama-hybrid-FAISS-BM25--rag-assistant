Example of a Discriminative Bayesian Model

While reading through the differences between Generative vs Discriminative; Bayesian vs. Frequentist, I was able to classify the probabilistic models into a table. On further searching on Google, I was able to find a similar table being proposed: https://lingpipe-blog.com/2013/04/12/generative-vs-discriminative-bayesian-vs-frequentist/ $$ \begin{array}{l|c|c} & \text{Frequentist} & \text{Bayesian}\\ \hline Discriminative & {\quad\quad P(Y; x, \theta)\\\text{Linear Regression}\\\text{Logistic Regression}\\\text{GLMs}} & P(Y, \Theta; x) = P(Y | \Theta; x)*P(\Theta) \\ \hline Generative & {\quad\quad\quad P(Y, X; \theta)\\\text{Linear Discrimant Analysis}\\\text{Quadratic Discrimant Analysis}} & {P(Y, X, \Theta) = P(Y, X | \Theta)*P(\Theta)\\\text{Latent Dirichlet Allocation}} \\ \end{array} $$ Convention: $Y$ is dependent variable (continuous/discrete), $X$ are a set of independent variables and $\theta$ are model parameters. Capital letter denotes RV and small letters denotes elements that are not modeled probabilistically. Items to the right of ; are not modeled probabilistically. Questions : Are there standard models that can be categorized as Bayesian Discriminative? By standard, I mean models that people in the Machine Learning or Statistics community would know. What other standard models can be placed in this table? Auxiliary Question : a. Can we also classify parameter estimation methods like MLE, MAP, MCMC, EM, etc. for this table? For example, I think MLE would fall under Frequentist models and MAP under Bayesian models. Similarly, MCMC would be more suited for Generative models and EM (assuming Y is latent now) would fall under all categories except Discriminative-Frequentist. PS: I will continue updating the table based on answers.
