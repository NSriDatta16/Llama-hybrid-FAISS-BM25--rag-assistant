Edit: OK, this seems to handle more cases better. The triggering code is the same, but here is new code for the module: Function SeriesRange(s As Series) As Range Dim sf As String, fa() As String sf = s.Formula sf = Replace(sf, "=SERIES(", "") If sf = "" Then Set SeriesRange = Nothing Exit Function End If fa = Split(sf, ",") Set SeriesRange = Range(fa(2)) End Function Sub x(c As Chart) Dim sc As Series Dim sr As Range If SeriesRange(c.SeriesCollection(1)) Is Nothing Then Exit Sub End If Set sr = SeriesRange(c.SeriesCollection(1)) sr.CurrentRegion.Interior.ColorIndex = xlNone For Each sc In c.SeriesCollection If sc.Interior.Color > 1 Then SeriesRange(sc).Interior.Color = sc.Interior.Color ElseIf sc.Border.ColorIndex > 1 Then SeriesRange(sc).Interior.Color = sc.Border.Color ElseIf sc.MarkerBackgroundColorIndex > 1 And sc.MarkerBackgroundColorIndex 1 And sc.MarkerForegroundColorIndex /Edit This is probably more barbaric than elegant, but I think it does what you want. It involves your first bullet point to get the range from the Series object, along with a sub to run through all the Series objects in the SeriesCollection for the chart. This is activated on Chart_DeActivate . Most of this code is jacked - see comments for sources. In a module: Function SeriesRange(s As Series) As Range Dim sf As String, fa() As String Dim i As Integer Dim result As Range sf = s.Formula sf = Replace(sf, "=SERIES(", "") fa = Split(sf, ",") Set SeriesRange = Range(fa(2)) End Function Sub x(c As Chart) Dim sc As Series Dim sr As Range Set sr = SeriesRange(c.SeriesCollection(1)) sr.CurrentRegion.Interior.ColorIndex = xlNone For Each sc In c.SeriesCollection SeriesRange(sc).Interior.Color = sc.Interior.Color Next sc End Sub In the ThisWorkbook object module: ' Jacked from C Pearson http://www.cpearson.com/excel/Events.aspx ' Public WithEvents CHT As Chart Private Sub CHT_Deactivate() x CHT End Sub Private Sub Workbook_Open() Set CHT = Worksheets(1).ChartObjects(1).Chart End Sub
