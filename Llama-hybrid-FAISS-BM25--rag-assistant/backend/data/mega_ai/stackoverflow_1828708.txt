How to learn to like Visual Studio and heavy-duty IDEs

I've had some exposure to Visual Studio, but not a great deal, as well as Eclipse, and haven't gotten much out of the experience. What I tend to want out of an editor is line numbers, syntax highlighting, and if possible, a list of functions/subroutines. To me, Visual Studio is overkill. Particularly, I don't like the concept of drag-and-drop coding and auto-generated content. I'm not saying it's bad, but that personally it pushes me away. What would you suggest in order to get into the right mindset to work with these kind of tools, and what can show off the benefits of the potential for increased productivity as opposed to a feeling like I'm fighting with the GUI?
