Entity Framework 4 - Designing DB To Enforce Multiplicity of 1 to 1

I have encountered a scenario in my application where I would like to have a 1:1 multiplicity between entities but I dont know how to modify my database to ensure this. Lets say I have a Document table and an Index table where the Document will always have one Index and the Index will only ever be contained in one Document. In the Document table I had an IndexID field so the Document entity has a navigation property to its index, but the Index entity has a collection navigation property called Documents, which is not what I am after since there will only ever be one related Document. It would be nice to edit my DB schema somehow so that when I generate the model from the DB, the Document entity has a single navigation to Index AND the Index has a single navigation property back to the Document. Is such a thing possible? I figured I could probably edit the entity model or its associations in the model design surface to make this happen. But I am concerned that at some stage if I reload the model, it will reset this and any others like it. Is there an elegant solution to make EF automatically realize there is a 1:1 multiplicity? Thanks for any advice!
