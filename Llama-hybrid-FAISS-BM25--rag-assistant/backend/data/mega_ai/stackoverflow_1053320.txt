I'd recommend Dreamweaver for its built-in accessibility support and tools. Versions going back at least to MX 2004 have features that encourage or at least prompt for good development techniques like use of alt tags, form element labeling, data table tags (caption, summary, etc.), and so forth. CS4 lets you configure accessibility preferences in your work environment and also offers validation for W3C and Section 508 standards. See also: Adobe Dreamweaver CS4 accessibility overview
