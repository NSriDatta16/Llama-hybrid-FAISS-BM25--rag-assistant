In my view, the question is not clear enough to be answered. "Evolving" can have different meanings in different context. Here are some examples. One can say the model is "evolving" when the weights/parameters are changing. Think about the online learning algorithm (comparing to batch learning), the model and parameter will change with new streaming data. For example, suppose want want to build a classifier on cat vs. dogs. At beginning, we fit model with large number of cat, the model will more likely to predict on cat. But later, the data is dominated with dog. The model will "evolve" and more likely to produce dog. Another possibility is the model has some memory and can model sequential data. Such as Recurrent neural network .
