Mongo DB Design, embedding vs relationships

I'm building a simple accounting system where a user has many bills. Now I'm trying to decide if bills should be its own collection, or nested within the user. I'm leaning towards the former but I've NEVER done any noSQL stuff so I'm just going by trial and error and what I think makes sense to me. I understand that Mongo has a 4mb document size limit which is what's making me think that I should have a separate collection for bills, as these will accumulate daily and could eventually take up a large amount of space. I'm just looking for opinions on the matter. Basically I'll be querying for bills of a user between different date periods (as you can imagine an accounting system would do). Not that it really matters but I'm using Mongoid in a Rails3 project. I figured I'd do something like: class User references_many :bills end class Bill referenced_in :user end Any comments or design suggestions are greatly appreciated.
