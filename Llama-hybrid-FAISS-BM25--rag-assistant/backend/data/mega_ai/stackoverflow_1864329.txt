other people have had similar issues and here , is your disctionary the mutable variety? try this code to do a simple test write. maybe its your dictionarys contents. As for the NCSFDictionary class, this is the internal class used by the frameworks. sometimes you will notice these change if you have huge arrays dictionaries etc. apple uses optimised code and sometimes the back end storage object will change. but it is still your dictionary.
