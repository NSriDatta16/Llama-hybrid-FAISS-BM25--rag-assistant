What sort of display are you after? Some searching shows a viable jQuery-based gantt here ( jquery.gantt ). ILOG do a range of outlook-style calendar and gantt (task-based) / schedule (resource-based) controls for both winform and web, but they aren't free, and the web bits are currently non-MVC. So; what sort of display are you after?
