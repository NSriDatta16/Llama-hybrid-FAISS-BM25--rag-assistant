Since in CNN, we are taking one filter to indicate one feature. We introduce a variable(b) to incorporate the bias from that particular filter. Hence, each filter takes into account the bias that it can cause. The bias is not due to individual filter weights but the whole filter itself. I hope that answers your question.
