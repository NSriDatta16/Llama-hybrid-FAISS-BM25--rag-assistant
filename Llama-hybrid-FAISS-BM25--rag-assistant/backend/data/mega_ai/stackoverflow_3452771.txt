Overriding inheritance on intrinsic attributes in C#

After wrestling with a bunch of uncaught exceptions when trying to serialize my classes and subclasses, I've finally understood what my problem had been: [Serializable] isn't inherited by subclasses when applied to a base class. I'm still really fuzzy about C# Attributes in general, but I do understand that when creating a custom Attribute, the programmer is able to enable automatic inheritance of the Attribute. It there any way to override the inheritance of [Serializable]? Is there any good reason why it wasn't done from the start and/or would be a bad idea to do this in the first place? I would want all subclasses of said base class be serializable, so it just seems inelegant to have to add the attribute to any new subclasses I make. Thanks!
