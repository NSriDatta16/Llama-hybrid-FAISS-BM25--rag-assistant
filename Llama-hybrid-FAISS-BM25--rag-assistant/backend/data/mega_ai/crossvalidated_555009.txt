The function reg:logistic enforces that the predictions are probabilities. On the other hand, the functions reg:squarederror and reg:squaredlogerror don't know that you're trying to model a probability, so they don't enforce non-negativity constraints. This is essentially the same problem that can happen with OLS regression on a binary outcome: you have a linear predictor on the probability scale, so you can predict values less than 0 or greater than 1. These predicted values can't be interpreted as "probabilities," because they do not conform to the requirements of probabilities. This phenomenon is why using OLS is discouraged when you're attempting to estimate the probability of a categorical outcome; instead, GLMs are used. Likewise, your XGBoost model should use a method which enforces that the predictions are probabilities.
