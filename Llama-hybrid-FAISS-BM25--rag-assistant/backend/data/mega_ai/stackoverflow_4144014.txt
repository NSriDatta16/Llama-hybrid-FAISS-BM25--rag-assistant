richtextbox binding

I have 2 RichTextBox es (rtb1, rtb2), I something wrote in rtb1 and click on enter key, on this event is added text from rtb1 to rtb2. I solved this in code behind, it is possible this same write in XAML? C# code: private void rtb2_PreviewKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { if (e.Key == Key.Enter) { var textElement = new Run() { Text = rtb2.Text }; var paragraph = new Paragraph(); paragraph.Inlines.Add(textElement); rtb1.Document.Blocks.Add(paragraph); rtb2.Document.Blocks.Clear(); //On this place I would like set start position for input text in rtb2 richtextbox on the start position } } Thank for your advances.
