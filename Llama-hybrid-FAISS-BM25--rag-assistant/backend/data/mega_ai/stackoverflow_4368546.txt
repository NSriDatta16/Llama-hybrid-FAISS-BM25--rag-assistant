Eclipse c++ How to work with existing makefile

I'm a newbie and I've a problem! I've to work with a c++ code and I don't know how to import it and how to compile it on eclips ( I compiled it by command line). The code has a particular structure and it is organized in this way: repos____lib____configure (execute the configure file inside the libraries folders) I I___makefile (execute the make file inside the libraries folders, requires make/make.def) I I___ib1____.cpp I I I____.h I ... I____configure (it requires make/configure_lib and make/configure_includes I ... I____makefile (generated by configure) I I___lib2___.... i I___....... I I___libn____.cpp i I____.h i I____configure i I____makefile (generated by configure) I I___make(folder)__bashrc (are set the some environment variables) I I__configure_bin I I__configure_includes I I__configure_lib I I__make.def (are set all the include path and library path used I in the configure file) I___application__main.cpp I__configure I__makefile(generated by the configure file) to be sure that you understand my problem...(sure... :) ) the first configure file is: cd lib1; ./configure cd ../lib2; ./configure ..... .... cd ../libn; ./configure cd and the first makefile is include /media/Dati/WORKHOME/repos/make/make.def this is the makefile for the whole library lib: make -C lib1 make -C lib2 make -C libn an example of configure file (the one inside lib1): #!/usr/bin/perl $INC = '$(OPENCVINC) $(FLTKINC) $(DC1394V2INC)'; ## .h.templ require '/media/Dati/WORKHOME/repos/make/configure_includes'; print "Created $libname.h\n"; compile it without eclipse is simple type /.configure in the lib folder type make go into the application folder type ./configure type make run the program my question is....in eclipse??? I imported the three with import/ import existing code as makefile project but now I don't know how compile it. could you please help me? it's important! thank you very much gabriele
