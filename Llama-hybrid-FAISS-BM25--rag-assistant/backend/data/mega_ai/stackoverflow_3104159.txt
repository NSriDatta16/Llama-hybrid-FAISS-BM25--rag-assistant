Call SSIS Package on 2008 server from SQL Agent Job on remote 2005 server

I'm trying, unsuccessfully, to remotely execute an SSIS package. The package resides on a SQL Server 2008 instance and I'd like to call it from a Job on a 2005 server. The error I'm getting is: The package could not be loaded. The step failed. If I go from 2008 to 2008, there is no error. Any ideas?
