As already mentioned, yes the Storage card is emulated. Thought its good to always test on a real hardware device before releasing. I have found that sometimes the Storage Card on the emulator is not 100% consistent with hardware access. Actually, the emulator can be a bit buggy in this regard. For example, I use SQLITE extensively in my PDA applications. Sometimes I cant get the emulator to create a new database file, even though the same code works perfectly on a device. Point: Its great for testing, but will fail occasionally and if some code is not executing that you think should.... run it on a hardware device before wasting hours troubleshooting it on the emulator.
