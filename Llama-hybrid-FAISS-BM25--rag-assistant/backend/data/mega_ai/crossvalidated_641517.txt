NB regression and LAG variable X

I'm doing a time series analysis, and I want to fit a negative binomial regression model. I did a GRANGER analysis that told me that the LAG of X explains Y better than the LAG of Y. And in the problem it makes sense. So I performed the LAG of X and the present value of X in the model, and only the present value of X is significant. If I remove the present value of X, the LAGS become significant. And it is difficult to explain that the present value of X increases Y, as the logic is that increasing X in the past would lead to an increase in Y. I'm not sure if I'm breaking the model's assumptions removing the present value and working only with LAG.
