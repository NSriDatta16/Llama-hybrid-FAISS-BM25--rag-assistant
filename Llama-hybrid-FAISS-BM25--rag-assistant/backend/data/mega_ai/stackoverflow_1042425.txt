php itself can be used as templating language for generatin html, but in python you will need to use one of the several templating engines available. If you want you can do simple templating using string.Template class but that is not what you would want to do. Your first step should be to decide on web framework you are going to use, and use templating it provides, e.g django But if you want just a plane cgi python script, you will need to write your html to stdout. so create a simple html and replace template values with your parameters e.g. from string import Template htmlTemplate = Template(""" $title """) myvalues = {'title':'wow it works!'} print "Content-type: text/html" print print htmlTemplate.substitute(myvalues) to work with cgi you can use cgi module e.g. import cgi form = cgi.FieldStorage()
