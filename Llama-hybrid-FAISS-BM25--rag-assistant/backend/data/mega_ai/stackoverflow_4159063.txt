Do I need to run gather_table_stats every time I create an index in order for the Oracle optimizer to use it?

I saw some examples where indexes were being created. Afterwards the following was executed: exec dbms_stats.gather_table_stats(...) Is this necessary for Oracle to pay attention to the index? I think stats are gathered every night (?) but there have been situations where I created an index was was disappointed by the explain plans that followed. Maybe I'm missing a step?
