Where should I put my first method

I've a need to add method that will calculate a weighted sum of worker salary and his superior salary. I would like something like this: class CompanyFinanse { public decimal WeightedSumOfWorkerSalaryAndSuperior(Worker WorkerA, Worker Superior) { return WorkerA.Salary + Superior.Salary * 2; } } Is this a good design or should I put this method somewhere else? I'm just staring designing project and think about a good, Object Oriented way of organize methods in classes. So I would like start from beginning with OOP on my mind. Best practice needed!
