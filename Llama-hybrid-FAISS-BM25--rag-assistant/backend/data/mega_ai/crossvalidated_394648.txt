Differences between prior distribution and prior predictive distribution?

While studying Bayesian statistics, somehow I am facing a problem to understand the differences between prior distribution and prior predictive distribution. Prior distribution is sort of fine to understand but I have found it vague to understand the use of prior predictive distribution and why it is different from prior distribution.
