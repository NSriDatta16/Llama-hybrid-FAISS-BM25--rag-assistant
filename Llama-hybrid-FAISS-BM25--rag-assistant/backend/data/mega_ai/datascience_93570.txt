LSTM for Stock Return Prediction

I am writing my masters thesis and am using LSTMs for daily stock return prediction. So far I am only predicting numerical values but will soon explore a classification style problem and predict whether it will go up or down each day. I have explored several scenarios A single LSTM using as input only the past 50 days return data A stacked (2 layers) using as input only the past 50 days return data The results are not great for either (and I didn't expect them to be). So I tried some feature engineering using 3 day MA, 5 day MA, 10 day MA, 25 day MA, 50 day MA of the daily returns as well as the actual daily return, meaning I have 6 input features. All other variables are kept constant yet the model now overfits (see the training and test loss plots below). Does anyone have any ideas why this may be? Test Loss in orange and Train in blue
