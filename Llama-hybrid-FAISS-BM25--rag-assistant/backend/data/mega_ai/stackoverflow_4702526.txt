organize an haskell package between several files

again a total newbie question from me about Haskell, and Leskah. (First, a subjective compliment for Haskell lovers: at each come back for a learning session of Haskell I like it more and more. I hope this will go on for long :-). Latest pleasure has been Leskah's sugar for auto transforming symbols into math. It makes code looks really nice. But well that's not the point... ) I wanted to organize my learner package into several files. But I didn't succeed in adding a second file e.g. Second.hs, containing other definitions, to my current package build unit. I have added it in Leskah/Edit Package/Extra Files. But this doesnt seem to do the job. More over I feel as it it was a little bit akward to add each of any new file this way ( thru Leskah/Edit Package/Extra Files ). Anyway as a result all that is built is still only the content my Main.hs. I am surely missing some point ?! Another question is, in C++, I heavily use namespace so as to sort my object definitions by subject/goal. What is the equivalent of namespace in Haskell ? A module ? A package ?
