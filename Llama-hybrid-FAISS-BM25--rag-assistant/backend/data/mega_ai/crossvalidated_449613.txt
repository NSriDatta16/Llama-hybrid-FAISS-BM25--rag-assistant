When can you apply the bootstrap to time series models?

Under what circumstances can you apply re-sampling techniques to quantify the uncertainty about the parameters of a time series model? Say that I have a model such as below: $ Y_t = X_t\beta + e_t$ (where $X_t$ may include lags of Y $_t$ ) I'd like to use repeated re-sampling ('the bootstrap') to generate distributions for the parameters of the model. I understand that it's generally something to be wary of in the time series case. My question is: in what circumstances would this be valid? I was thinking that it very likely makes sense in the case of stationary input variables. But what if i'm satisfied that there's a co-integrating relationship. Is it valid in that case?
