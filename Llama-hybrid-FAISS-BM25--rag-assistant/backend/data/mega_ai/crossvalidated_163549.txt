How to approximate Bayes Factor?

I am searching for a computationally simple way to approximate a Bayes Factor. Currently, I'm using an approach which seems pretty logical to me but I would still be interested to know if this is correct: I repeat sampling parameters from the priors, compute the likelihoods, and in the end, compute the average of all those likelihoods. I do this for both models and build the ratio of both averaged likelihoods as an approximation to the Bayes Factor. Assuming this is correct, I think the only limitation of this approach is that it becomes computationally intensive with a growing number of parameters? So, is this approach fine for a small number of parameters? Are there any limitations to this approach? Is there a (simple) alternative way?
