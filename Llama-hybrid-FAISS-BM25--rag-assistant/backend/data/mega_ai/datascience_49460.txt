BERT has a non deterministic behaviour

I am using the BERT implementation in https://github.com/google-research/bert for feature extracting and I have noticed a weird behaviour which I was not expecting: if I execute the program twice on the same text, I get different results. I need to know if this is normal and why this happens in order to treat this fact in one or another way. Why is the reason for this? Aren't neural networks deterministic algorithms?
