Why does the best fitting Weibull distribution for this survival data deviate further from the actual data than a poorly fit distribution?

I started working with the Gumbel distribution and fit it to the lung dataset to try it out. I then compared it with the survival curve using the Weibull distribution, which provides the best fit per goodness-of-fit tests and also hews closely to the Kaplan-Meier plot as shown below. When averaging the death rate in the lung data (status = 2 is death; all status 2's divided by a total of 228 elements in lung data) the death rate is 72.4%. This compares to a death rate for Gumbel fit of 72.7% (see death_rate_Gumbel in below code) and a death rate for Weibull fit of 63.2% (see death_rate_Weibull below). Shouldn't the Weibull death rate be close to the actual death rate for lung dataset? What am I doing wrong, or misinterpreting? Code: library(evd) library(fitdistrplus) library(survival) time $time[lung$ status == 2] scale_est $estimate[1], fitGum$ estimate[2]) # Weibull distribution survWeib
