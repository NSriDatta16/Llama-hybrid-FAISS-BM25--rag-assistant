Controls do not show up when dragging from toolbox

When I drag controls from the toolbox to an .aspx page or the designer for that page nothing shows up. I am using Visual Studio 2010 with an existing website project. ** Update It seems to work now... I'm not sure if this was specific to one project, or a combination of things.
