Here's what the MS Sql Server FAQ says: For externally focused server applications. Processor licensing is a better choice for externally focused server applications, such as Internet and extranet scenarios. It is often difficult to count devices or users in these scenarios, so hardware-based pricing is more straightforward. For mixed-use servers. For mixed-use servers that will be accessed from both inside and outside the organization's firewall, processor licensing is generally favorable. Because the processor licenses are probably needed for external users, there would be no need to purchase access separately for internal users through CALs. For environments inside the firewall. For environments inside the firewall where client-to-server processor ratios are relatively low, the server plus device CAL licensing model will likely be the more cost-effective choice if there are multiple users per device (for example, in a call center), while the server plus user CAL licensing model will likely be more cost-effective if there are multiple devices per user. For environments inside the firewall where client-to-server processor ratios are high, the processor licensing model will likely be more cost-effective.
