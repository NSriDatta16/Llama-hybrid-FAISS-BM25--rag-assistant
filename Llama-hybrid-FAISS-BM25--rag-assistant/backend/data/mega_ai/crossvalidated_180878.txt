What is asymptotic variance?

I am struggling to understand the concept of asymptotic variance. The context is the geophysical time series processing with robust methods being employed. Methods with a very high breakdown point usually have a smaller asymptotic relative efficiency at the Gaussian distribution than LS. This means that the higher the robustness of the estimator, the higher the asymptotic variance. In order to achieve the same parameter uncertainties by the robust procedure, more measurements are required. Can someone explain this?
