Mixed-frequency time series are ones observed at different frequencies, e.g. monthly and yearly or hourly and daily. They can be modeled by casting them into state-space representation at the highest available data frequency or higher (e.g., even if your highest frequency is weekly, you might want to write the system daily to account for different numbers of days in different months), treating most of the lower-frequency data as missing and estimating by filtering (e.g., using the Kalman filter in the linear-Gaussian case); this is rigorous but tedious and computationally expensive, especially in higher dimensions; using MIDAS (mixed-frequency data sampling) models as an approximation to the state-space approach above; see also midas this is computationally friendly; using exact Bayesian posterior mixed-frequency analysis, e.g. as in Schorfheide & Song (2015).
