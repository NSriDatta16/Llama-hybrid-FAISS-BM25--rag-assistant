How do you fade in *partially* in jQuery?

Hey everyone. This seems easy enough, but for some reason I'm having a hard time piecing it together. I want to create an animated "fade in" effect, where a div fades from 0 opacity to 50% opacity, and stops. As far as I understand: var duration = 1000; $('#mydiv').fadeIn(duration); will fade the div to 100%, with no option of limiting this. Is there an elegant way of setting the finishing opacity?
