Comparing proportions between two mega-groups

Say I sit in 2 different restaurants, Cheesecake Factory and Panda Express, that has nothing in common on their menu. I randomly order items from the menu and record how much sugar it has as well as the item is an appetizer or entree or dessert. At each restaurant, I stop ordering 30 minutes after when I order my first item. At the end of the day I have a data set that may look like the picture below... I am wondering how to compare the % sugar in my orders from Cheesecake Factory to that in the ones from Panda Express? I understand that the items from the two restaurants are different and may be "incomparable" in a sense, but if I wish to simply compare the average sugar content from items listed on the menu of each restaurant, what should I do?
