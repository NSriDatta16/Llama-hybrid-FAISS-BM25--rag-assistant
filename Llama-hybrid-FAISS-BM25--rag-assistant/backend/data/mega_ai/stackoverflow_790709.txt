This is really going to depend on the size of the tables, the amount of memory you're allowing MySQL to use, and possibly the speed of the storage (disk). But it will make negligible difference. Other things will have much more effect on speed: table design, index coverage, memory, storage speed, etc. You'll get much, much more payoff, performance-wise, by addressing those issues.
