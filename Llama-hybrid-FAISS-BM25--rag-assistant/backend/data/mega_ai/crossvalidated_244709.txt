When this is done electronically it is usually done with an RC (resistance/capacitance) circuit e.g., see link . The circuit shown in that link is not what you want, rather you want the resistor in parallel with the capacitor so that the charging is immediate and the decay gradual. That is, events load charge into a capacitor, which is then slowly drained by a resistor. The resistance is usually selectable to adjust for time scales. Or, if you wish, a running cumulative impulse response to Dirac deltas, see math for a single impulse. If you want to do this numerically, you can use exponential decay of the signal in time to make this running average. Exponential functions are memoryless, or if you wish, and in draining a load, they enforce forgetfulness. So, what you do with each count equal to 1 occurring at times $t$ is, calibrate (scale) them ($s$) and accumulate decay (half-life $\tau$) by applying $s \sum _{i=1}^n e^{-\frac{\log (2) t}{\tau }}$. Here is an example for 5 events. $\left(n=5;\tau =1;s=2;t=\{0.2,0.3,0.8,1.2,1.5,1.9\}\right); \text{Plot}\left[s \left( \begin{array}{cc} \{ & \begin{array}{cc} 0 & x t[[5]] \\ \end{array} \\ \end{array} \right),\{x,0,2\},\text{AxesOrigin}\to \{0,0\}\right]$ Just one word of caution, in general that may be $s=\frac{\ln{2}}{\tau}$, (see here) implying that if you want counts per second from $s$, you would set the half-life $\tau=\ln{2}$ (seconds), but please check this scale factor against actual data.
