There is a wealth of gestational age and birth weight population data and the prediction is less error-prone that one may expect. Just like growth reference chart for children, there are growth reference chart for fetus as well. In addition, when it comes to interview, it can be burdensome for respondents to disclose when they have sex, mostly due to memory fading or the pregnancy being socially marginalized (especially in situation like teenage or underage moms, out-of-wedlock conception, etc.) Some people have sex once a while, some have sex multiple times a day, each of them would be subjected to different memory biases. And especially the condition you said: assuming it was the time it resulted in pregnancy, for those who have a lot of frequent sex, how can you even tell? It's not like the woman's nose will blink like Rudolph's if the sperm made it to her egg. Keeping the estimation of conception date in-house can skip many awkward moments, and perhaps will result in a higher response rate and a much trust-worthy assessment.
