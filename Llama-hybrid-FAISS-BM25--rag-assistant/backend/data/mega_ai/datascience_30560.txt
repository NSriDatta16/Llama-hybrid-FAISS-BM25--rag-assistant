Recommending college degrees based on high school subjects

I have a list of our college students' high school courses. I want to recommend college degrees to current high school students based on their courses - that is, predict a class based on a vector. For instance someone who studied algebra, calculus and statistics could be recommended software engineering, accountancy or mathematics. There seem to be a few approaches I could take: market basket analysis, collaborative filtering, clustering or even neural networks. I can structure my data in a sparse matrix of courses, with each row having a class representing the student's eventual degree, e.g.: DEGREE English Calc Algebra Geography History ... etc Soft.Eng. 0 1 1 0 0 Comms 1 0 0 1 1 Mech.Eng. 1 1 1 0 0 How should I approach this?
