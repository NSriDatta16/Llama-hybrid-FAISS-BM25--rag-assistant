Models that are good for long answer generation given context and question and what datasets would be the best for training?

Basically I am trying to create a context-needing question and long answer model and I was wondering what model would be best for such tasks, currently I am leaning towards T5, or GPT-NeoX-20B. Additionally for such tasks what datasets would be the most suitable, as of right now I have looked at CoQA, and SQuAD but none provide long answers.
