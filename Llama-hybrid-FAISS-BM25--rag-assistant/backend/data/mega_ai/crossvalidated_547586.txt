Data appear in both dependent and independent variable: what is this error called?

I want to find a proper name for the analytical problem I've identified below. One of the most accurate measure of firearm availability is the proportion of suicides committed with firearms, or FS/S (firearm suicides / suicides). The literature is divided on whether this proxy is appropriate when the outcome is suicides: some think it's fine, though others including me think it's bad because the same data appear in both the dependent and independent variables. I've put together some R code to show that this leads to spurious associations. I simulated firearm and non-firearm suicides using the mean and SD from real Global Burden of Disease Data, then use an ordinary least squares regression to test whether the simulated FS/S is associated with firearm, non-firearm, and total suicides. Even though the firearm and non-firearm suicides were generated independently, the proportion of the total that is firearm suicide (FS/S) has a highly significant association (p I think this could be collider bias, though some call it "contaminations" or a "mechanical" association," but none of these seem quite right to me. Can anyone help? library(tidyverse) # generate simulated data, analyse, put into table; source for info: https://msalganik.wordpress.com/2017/01/21/making-sense-of-the-rlnorm-function-in-r/ firearm_mean % pivot_longer(cols = contains("sim"), names_to = "method", values_to = "rate") %>% group_by(method) %>% do(lm(log(rate) ~ fs_s, data = .) %>% clean() %>% filter(term != "(Intercept)")) %>% transmute(method = recode(method, "firearm_sim" = "Firearm suicide", "nonfirearm_sim" = "Non-firearm suicide", "total_sim" = "Total suicide"), est = format(round(estimate, 3), nsmall = 3), p = format(round(p_value, 3), nsmall = 3)) %>% print()
