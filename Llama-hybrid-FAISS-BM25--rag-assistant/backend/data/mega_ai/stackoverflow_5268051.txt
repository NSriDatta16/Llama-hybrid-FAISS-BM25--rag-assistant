You are right that to store just a permutation of data, and not the data itself, you will need only as many bits as ceil(log2(permutations)). For N items, the number of permutations is factorial(N) or N!, so you would need ceil(log2(factorial(N))) bits to store just the permutation of N items without also storing the items. In whatever language you're familiar, there should be a ready way to make a big array of M bits, fill it up with a permutation, and then store it on a storage device.
