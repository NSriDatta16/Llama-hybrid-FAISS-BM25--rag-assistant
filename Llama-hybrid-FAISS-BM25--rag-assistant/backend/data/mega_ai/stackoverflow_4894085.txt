An answer you are probably not looking for: Don't do that. This is a violation of the basics: a value in a database should be atomic, not divisible into other values. All of the database's operations (did I mention all ) are tuned to handling individual values. You are "fighting the framework" here. Even if you can pull it off, it will be a drag on performance. Plus the database is not reportable, it's not just that you are having this issue now, every attempt to read this data for any reason will run into this problem. Well, I don't want to go into a rant, 'nuf said.
