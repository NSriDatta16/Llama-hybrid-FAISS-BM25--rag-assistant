ASP.NET AJAX doesn't play well with Safari by default. It has several JavaScript hacks in it to make it work with Safari 1.x that are no longer needed. Unfortunately, this breaks AJAX for Safari 3. But, there is a solution. Create a Safari3AjaxHack.js , like this: // Safari 3 AJAX "issue". It no longer needs JavaScript hacks that are still implemented // http://forums.asp.net/p/1252014/2392110.aspx Sys.Browser.WebKit = {}; //Safari 3 is considered WebKit if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('WebKit/') > -1) { Sys.Browser.agent = Sys.Browser.WebKit; Sys.Browser.version = parseFloat( navigator.userAgent.match(/WebKit\/(\d+(\.\d+)?)/)[1]); Sys.Browser.name = 'WebKit'; } Then define your ScriptManager like this: I'm not sure about Chrome. I haven't had ASP.NET AJAX problems with it so far. It's pretty silly that Microsoft didn't fix this in .NET 3.5 SP1 at least, but what can you do :(
