In terms of the frustration - generally try to view a project as a journey rather than a destination. If you've been paying attention you'll have got a lot out of the project to date - things you've learned about the technology and the business, created modules of code you can reuse, you'll have built relationships with team members or users, made mistakes you won't make again and so on. It might help you personally to write a list of what you know now that you didn't at the start of the project. Ultimately the company may not have implemented the project but much of the benefit which accrues to you as a person and a developer is still there. Indeed, often you learn more on projects which go wrong and in companies which aren't great than when things are running like a dream. As with the rest of life, the more satisfaction you can get from things day to day, and the less you focus on only the marquee achievements, the happier you'll be. I'm not saying that delivering projects isn't good - it's obviously why we code - but it's not entirely inside our control so you need to be realistic and balanced about how much you let that impact you.
