NLP: Mapping Penn treebank and Brown corpus, to Universal PoS Tags

I am experimenting with NLP and PoS tagging. I wish to build a large corpus, composed of Penn Treebank and Brown corpus, and possibly even more. Unfortunately, their PoS tags are not compatible. Is there a way to map their tags to universal tagging? (Or any other tagging?)
