Sorting list items up and down not with drag and drop

I want a user to be able to reorder a list on a click event. Here is my code: $(function() { $('#reOrder li').each(function, (index) { $(this).attr('id', index); }); $("#reOrder").delegate("li", "click", function() { var $indexItem = $(this).index('#reOrder li'); var $thisTxt = $(this).text(); var $prevTxt = $(this).prev('li').text(); $($thisTxt).replaceWith($prevTxt); //alert($thisTxt); //alert($prevTxt); }); }); Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 4 So in this example I would like to move the clicked li item and its contents to the position above in the DOM. I suppose strictly speaking it is being moved down in the index of li items. This is going to be extended later to include buttons that move li items up and down and a submit button that saves the order/state of the list items. I have found a lot of info on drag and drop (which is not required) but not much on this sort of functionality.
