Why is the arima function giving odd answers

I have a problem in interpreting what the arima function in R is doing. I have the following code: x The resulting coefficient is "0.9988". But I would think the coefficient should be exactly "0.8", since x[t] = 0.8 * x[t-1] . I must be missing something that R is doing in processing the data. Any help would be appreciated. New Info I: If I change the function to arima(x, order = c(1,0,0), include.mean = F, method="CSS") then it solves for the correct coefficient of 0.8. My problem that I am generally finding that the function arima with order = c(1,0,0) is often producing different results to: lm(x[-1] ~ I(x[-length(x)])) for all sorts of different time series that I am reviewing. New Info II: Some of the comments and answers below are concerned that there is no random fluctuation in my data. I did this to make the problem as simple as possible, but even if you add in random fluctuation, arima still produces the same wrong results in the default case. To add insult to injury, arima will sometimes get the right answer if you change method = "CSS" . This suggest that there is perhaps a computational issue with arima and not my misunderstanding the statistical model. Here is an extended set of two examples that highlight the problem (I ignore the intercept difference between lm and arima as these two items are not the same thing, but the coefficients should be. set.seed(1) # Example 2 x
