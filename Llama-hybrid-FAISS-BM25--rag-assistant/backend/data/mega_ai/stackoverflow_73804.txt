The real benefit of using TFS compared to a separate set of OS tool is the integration of the various flow of informations available. * Create a requirement and insert into TFS * Create a set of task linking them to the requirement and assign them to the various developers * Each developer work on his task and checkin, assigning the task to the changeset checked in * A bug fix come in, also in this case the change set will be coordinated with the bug fix request and you can also map the bug fix to the original requirement Once done this all the information can be used to track project and make evaluation about the work, like for example how many changes a bug fix caused, which are the requirement that has generated more bugs or change requests and so on. All these informations are very useful in medium and large organizations and, from what I'm seeing now, are not possible (or very difficult) to track integrating different OS tools.
