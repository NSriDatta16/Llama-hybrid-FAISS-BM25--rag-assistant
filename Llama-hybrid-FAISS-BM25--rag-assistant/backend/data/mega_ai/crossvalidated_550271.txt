The synthesis behind causal reasoning is access to different aspects of reality/model using inferences from data. The paradoxical features in a model are avoided through formalisation in mathematical language. Informally, these counterintuitive features arise in observing a model unlike intervening through doing calculus . The question on the openess of algorithms in the foundations of mathematics and logic is debated. One of the central point is that formalisations lead to harness infinite power to practice but turns these consistent procedures closed. In principle, while you do , you close the system unlike observing that has an active role in quantum mechanics unlike Pearl's causation hierarchy. Quantum contextuality asserts fundamental acausal relations between events, manifest as bugs! Bug could be a way into the depth of an iceberg! Technically, DAG are insufficient to reveal deeper structure of nature, where unrelated events could be related in a non-trivial way via topology. Pearl's vision is significant in the sense that, he formally constructed causation theory and this integrity is elegant!
