(R Package 'neuralnet')A quick question: Why the `neuralnet` will produce different result each trial?

As I said in title, I don't understand why use the neuralnet package to create a regression model will produce different result at each time. The different results means each time, without modifying any codes, using the neuralnet will produce different predictions that I care. Ex: Assuming I am using nn = neuralnet(Y ~., data) to make a neural network regression model. Then, using compute(nn, test_data) to find the prediction values. Each time, I will get different prediction values.
