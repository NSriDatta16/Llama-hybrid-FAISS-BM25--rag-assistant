The only thing I would add to Rich McGuire's answer is that RoutedCommands (and their more prevalent descendant RoutedUICommand have to be wired up with event handlers to work correctly. Most MVVM implementations I have come across attempt to leverage binding against the ViewModel and thus the ViewModel (and not the View) owns the CanExecute/Execute logic. In contrast, the event handlers move that burden to the View. The handling can then be propagated to the ViewModel, but this means a slightly higher degree of coupling between ViewModel and View (casting + method call, etc.).
