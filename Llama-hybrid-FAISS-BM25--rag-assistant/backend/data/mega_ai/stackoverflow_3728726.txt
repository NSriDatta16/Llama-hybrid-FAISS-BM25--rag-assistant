what's the more elegant way to use an id already set? jQuery("#"+ t)?

i'm kinda of a newbie in javascript, even though i built so far lots of working website and apps.. btu i feel naive the way i used to pass the variable id to jquery.. for instance i used to do like this epsecialy when i have to work with some old code .. let's assume that i have all my website already coded with 'a' tags like this link and then in JS function doSome(id){ //old code removed and replaced by jquery jQuery("#"+ id).show(); } and the function in that way works flawless... so, again, assuming that i cannot change anything else than the code inside the function what's the best way to use the variable id? because as far as i know if I had used just jQuery(id).show(); instead of jQuery("#"+ id).show(); it wouldn't have worked...right?
