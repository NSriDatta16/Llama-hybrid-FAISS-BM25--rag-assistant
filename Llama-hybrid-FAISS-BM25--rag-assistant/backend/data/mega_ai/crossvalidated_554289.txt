When a Bayesian posterior is derived from a likelihood function that does not integrate (or sum) to unity the posterior function is simply re-scaled to make that integral (or sum) equal one in order that the posterior can be a 'proper' probability distribution. The use of a uniform prior makes the scaled likelihood function into the posterior and so it might make one wonder whether such a Bayesian approach offers anything beyond a pure likelihood approach.
