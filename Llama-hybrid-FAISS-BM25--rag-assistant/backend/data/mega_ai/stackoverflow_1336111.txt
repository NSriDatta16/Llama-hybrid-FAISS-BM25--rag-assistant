Some of the features you mention are there mostly because of the usual client/server separation. with an embedded DB library like SQLite, it's no longer client/server, it's a layered architecture. For example, stored procedures. What difference does it make if SQLite manages them or if your program does it? they're both on the same process and the same memory space! it's just a layer on top of the storage. Even better, you can use your own language instead of some 'proceduralized SQL'. Likewise for complex types and constraints. just a few caveats: You have to write the missing layers, SQLite doesn't provide them. (OTOH, they'll be specific to your taste and needs). To really handle constraints in your own layer you have to be sure to do all accesses through your layer.
