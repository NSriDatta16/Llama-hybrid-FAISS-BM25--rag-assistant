Magento case price

I have two attributes for a product,first one is the unit price and second is the case price. The unit price is the default price of the magento,for the case price i create a new attribute named case pirce. My question is i display the prices in the product description,but it is not allowing me to add the case price to the shopping cart Am i doing some thing wrong here,if so let me know the solution.
