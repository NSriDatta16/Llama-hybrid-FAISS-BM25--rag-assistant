If you have a prior distribution on the possible black boxes, this is a simple Bayesian estimation question. So it just comes down to what a reasonable prior is. Unfortunately, having "no information," if it means anything, certain means that we have no way of judging how reasonable a prior distribution is. If we assume this is a physical device then we could start out with a prior that says the probability of the sequence having Kolmogorov complexity n is proportional to 1/n. [1] But of course that just pushes the question back a step, because that takes our human knowledge of physics as a given, when of course our knowledge of physics is already based on our predictions of a black box process: we've seen the sun come up every day for as long as we remember, so we assume -- for no logical reason -- that tomorrow it will not be replaced with a giant papier-mache model of Conway Twitty's head. [1] I should emphasize that, while satisfying in principle, this would be completely impossible to implement in real life.
