First start by counting the number of lines you need. IPv6 addresses are 128 bits, so your output file will be 2 128 lines long. That's roughly 3.4 × 10 38 bytes, if all your lines are empty . A terabyte is only about 10 12 bytes, so you would need over 3 × 10 26 1-terabyte hard drives just to store the empty lines before putting any data in them. Storing 40 bytes per line would require proportionally more storage.
