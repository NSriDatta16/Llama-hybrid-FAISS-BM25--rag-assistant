python passing argument to a function

folks, i got a question about passing mutable object to a function with the following code, I was expecting the output to be [0,0,0], while the output is [0,1,2,3] does it mean the argument is actually copied and then send to the inside of the function? def lala(a): n = [0, 0 , 0] a = n a = [0,1,2,3] lala(a) print a if i want to fulfill the above task inside the function, how shall i write it elegantly? thanks very much!
