style and script tags in HTML body... why not?

[This is related to this question , but not since it's not about email.] In many cases -- especially when working with a CMS or someone else's framework, it's much easier to embed tags and tags in the than in the . This seems to work in IE6, IE7 (Windows), Firefox 3.x and Safari (OS X). Strictly speaking, is this wrong? And if it is, what negative consequences might it cause... aside from being completely ignored in some clients? Note: Glad everybody wants to talk about DRY and centralizing styles. Imagine for a second that I want to use style tags within a document because they ARE NOT GLOBAL and that I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE HEAD ON A PER-PAGE BASIS. For whatever reason, be it that the site differs on a page-by-page basis, or a per-paragraph basis or whatever. I'm not interested in it being hard to track down and change. I'm worried about possible consequences of using style in the body. You centralize stuff that's central. Everything else is bloat in the central stylesheets.
