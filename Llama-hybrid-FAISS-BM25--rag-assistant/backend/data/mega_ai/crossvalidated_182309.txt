If time series $A, B$ and $A, C$ are cointegrated, is $B, C$ also cointegrated? And with similar confidence?

While I am interested in the general case, let's consider the case of three series. So, suppose time series $A, B, C$. If I can show that $A, B$ and $A, C$ are cointegrated with a test statistic $\ge 95\%$ confidence interval level, can I be expect that $B, C$ are cointegrated? Similarly, can I make a good assumption about the strength of the cointegration test statistic, i.e. will the confidence level be similar? Intuitively I would think good assumptions can be made, but perhaps there is a chance of scenarios where cointegration is not the case.
