Convert javascript array handling to jQuery

I'm doing a javascript assignment and have just learned that I can do it in jQuery if I wish, rather than vanilla javascript. I thought I'd give it a go to see what it's like. This is the contents of my javascript function: rowsArray = $("#Table1 tr"); for (i=0;i As you can see, I started converting to jQuery with the first line, but got stuck :) The code works as is, but I figure there must be a more elegant way of doing it in jQuery. I tried using $.each but my selectors or syntax was wrong and it didn't work. I have a vague idea how it works for a 1D array, but I'm not clear on how to iterate through the items in nested arrays i.e. array[x][y]. The function creates and moves through a 2D array changing the id and mouse events of a set of images. Any thoughts would be much appreciated :)
