The recommended way of handling this is to set up each customer with a separate DotNetNuke install (the multi-portal feature should only be used from intra-organizational content). In order to do what you are wanting, you should do a clone-and-purge method for your customer. Keep in mind that there may be artifacts left over in the database, but it would be the best thing for you and your customer. If you need help doing that, I would recommend touching base with http://www.DNNHelp.com . (I work for http://www.PowerDNN.com )
