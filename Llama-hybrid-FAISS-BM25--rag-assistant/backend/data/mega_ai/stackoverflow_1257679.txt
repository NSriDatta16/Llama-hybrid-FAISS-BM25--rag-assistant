You can easily organize files into multiple folders without having to do this by business logic, or order-per-day, which is especially nice if that kind of ordering would be 'clumpy' (many hits in one folder, few in others). The easiest way to do this is to create a unique hash for the file name, so that maybe you get something like this: sf394fgr90rtfofrpo98tx.pdf Then break this up into two-character blocks, and you will get this: sf/39/4f/gr/90/rt/fo/fr/po/98/tx.pdf As you can see, it gives you a deep directory tree that you can easily navigate. With a good hash function, this will be very evenly distributed, and you will never get more than 1296 entries per directory. If you ever get a collision (which should be extremely rare), just add a number to the end: tx.pdf, tx_1.pdf, tx_2.pdf. Again, collisions on such large hashes should be extremely rare, so that the kind of clumping you get because of this are a non-issue. You said that the documents are digitally signed, so you probably have the hash you need right there in form of the signature string.
