WPF - Animating object lower/higher in visual tree

I have following problem. I created Style for ContentControl that enables moving/dragging of specific item. This is created with help of MoveControl (: Control) that controls mouse down/move/up events. In this class DependencyProperty IsDragging property is defined, that i want to use to fade in/out item when it changes state. Xaml file for my syle looks something like this. So, i want to create animation that will be done on the ContentControl styled with ItemStyle when MoveControl.IsDragging will be set to true/false. Thank you for help.
