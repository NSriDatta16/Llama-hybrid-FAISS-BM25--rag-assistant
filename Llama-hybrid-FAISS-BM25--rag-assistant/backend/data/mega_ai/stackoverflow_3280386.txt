You need to add a few members that are used by the sum function to do the calculation: type Foo(value:int) = member x.Value = value // Two members that are needed by 'Array.sum' static member (+) (a:Foo, b:Foo) = Foo(a.Value + b.Value) static member Zero = Foo(0) // Not needed for 'Array.sum', but allows 'Array.average' static member DivideByInt(a:Foo, n:int) = Foo(a.Value / n) The sum function starts with the value returned by Zero and then adds values of Foo using the overloaded + operator ( average then divides the result by an integer): let a = Array.init 10 (fun n -> Foo(n)) let sum = Array.sum a sum.Value // Returns 45
