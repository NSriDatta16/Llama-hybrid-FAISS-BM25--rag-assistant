Fit, AIC and deviation of my generalized linear model (poisson)

I need to fit a GLM (generalized linear model) in R , something like model which relates Daily.Results = variable that I need to count (and predict) Clicks = counts clicks in a link (which drives a person to be a potencial buyer) sqrt.of.Clicks = square root of Clicks log.of.Clicks = natural logarithm of Clicks Days = 1, 2, 3... sqrt.of.Days = square root of 1, 2, 3... in a dataset with 14 rows/observations and family = poisson because Daily.Results are non negative integers, with log link-function The results of summary(model) are: Call: glm(formula = Daily.Results ~ sqrt.of.Clicks + Days + log.of.Clicks * sqrt.of.Days, family = "poisson") Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.24096 -0.61927 -0.09041 0.81640 2.45392 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

By now, I often read people saying here that lower AIC and residual deviance means better fit. Is this correct and enough ? Also, would be nice to know which value can be considered lower enough ( R squared is so far more friendly ). Can you help me with that? A really good fit can lead to bad predictions? Can you give some example ? The diagnostic plots of my regression ( plot(model) ) follows, and I could not tell if some visual information can be found there. Perhaps, evidence of errors that I don't realized. Residuals vs Fitted Normal Q-Q Scale-Location Residuals vs Leverage Cook's distance Cook's distance vs Leverage I think that a final and clean answer about this questions will help a lot of people here. Straight to the point.
