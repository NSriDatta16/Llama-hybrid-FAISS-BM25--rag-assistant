There is a great book on Core Data itself that is geared towards desktop and iphone applications, but it requires a decent working knowledge of objective-c/cocoa touch imo: Prag Core Data . Another fair read is the Apple documentation on the subject. and there are some pretty good questions/answers here on stack overflow regarding the subject. And as you said, there are scattered tutorials outlining specific things all over the internet and on some popular iphone/objective-c blogs. This being said, if you are a beginner to programming in general, I would suggest that Core Data/databases in general (SQL etc) might be a bit of an advanced topic to begin on.
