What you actually need is a function $g$ such that $g(\theta_0, D)$ returns a p-value for the test $H_0: \theta = \theta_0$. Then the collection $\{\theta : g(\theta, D) > \alpha\}$ is a confidence set with coverage level $1-\alpha$. In this case $D$ denotes your data. If all you can do is test for $\theta = 0$ then I donâ€™t think this is possible unless you make some strong assumptions about your $g$.
