From the DDD book (Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software) by Eric Evans: The public interface of the ANTICORRUPTION LAYER usually appears as a set of SERVICES, although occasionally it can take the form of an ENTITY. and a bit later One way of organizing the design of the ANTICORRUPTION LAYER is as a combination of FACADES, ADAPTERS (both from Gamma et al. 1995), and translators, along with the communication and transport mechanisms usually needed to talk between systems. So, you might find examples by looking at the suggested adapter pattern and facade pattern . I'll try to paraphrase what Eric Evans said, your anti-corruption layer will appear as services to the outside of your layer. So outside of the anti-corruption layer the other layers will not know they are "speaking" with a anti-corruption layer. Inside of the layer you would use adapters and facades to wrap your legacy information sources.
