I believe it is the eigenvalues of covariance matrix. Thus, eigenvalues of X'X is true only if the X is mean-centered column-wise. Which means each column(variable) has the mean zero and this can be the reason why the results don't match. You can also refer to Principle Components Analysis (PCA) that does the exact same thing actually. Please beware that I don't have any experience with SPSS and SAS, but this is the way I know.
