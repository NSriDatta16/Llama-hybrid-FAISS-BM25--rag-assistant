How I would approach it (yes, this is a disclaimer). Let's say that for a single user, for a single event, there are 10 features of the event. Let's go further and say that there are 5 measures of the features. That means you have 10 columns and 5 rows for this subset. But what goes "in the box"? It looks like you have binomial data. I am guessing that you put a "1" if a feature is indicated in one measure and a "0" if it is not. So what questions can I ask of the data? are all measures created equal? are all features created equal? Thoughts that drive approaches: If all measures were identical, then all rows would be identical. If the measures were all junk, they might as well be random. I wonder if two measures are just variations on the same measure. I wonder if two features are just variations on the same feature. Can they be combined? (think PCA) (INCOMPLETE: I'm still thinking here, and will get back to it when I get a chance)
