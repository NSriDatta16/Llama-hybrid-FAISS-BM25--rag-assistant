If you want to use RNNs, you start setting an input_length parameter. Then you imagine to slide a window of that size on each trend, and at each step you take an observation for your RNN. You'd end up with an array of shape: ( # of observations , input length , number of variables ) And the output, of course, is the 1D array of values, output column. If it's a regression-like problem you can put a single output node. You can either put no activation (i.e. linear activation), or scale the output in [0,1] and use Sigmoid. That said, the efficacy of an LSTM Neural Network depends from how much data you can train it on. With small datasets, Deep Learning is not very useful and canonical statistical techniques could win against that. What is the size of your dataset?
