A clever alternative in LINQ for iterating over HashSet

I've got a whitelist of URLs I'm using, inside a HashSet . I'm trying to find if the url starts with any of the items in the white list (it has to be that way round). Edit: The previous example was a bit misleading and had a typo - I already have a base url like yahoo.com, the whitelist is just the path. HashSet whiteList = new HashSet (); string path = "/sport/baseball/"; bool validUrl = false; foreach (string item in whiteList) { if (path.StartsWith(item)) { validUrl = true; break; } } Is there a more elegant way of doing this lookup with LINQ (to objects)? The list isn't huge so performance isn't an issue.
