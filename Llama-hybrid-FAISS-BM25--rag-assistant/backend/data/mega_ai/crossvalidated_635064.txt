In a typical CNN there is a layer where all the data is merged into a 1d-vector, just before the classifier that maps onto classes. This vector representation ("embedding") can be used to create an "out-of-distribution" detector. This can be done by applying a standard outlier detection method to those vectors, for example Local Outlier Factor . Or even train a reconstructing autoencoder.
