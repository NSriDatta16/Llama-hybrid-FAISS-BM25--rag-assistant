I will take your comment Please make this decision for me. THANKS THANKS literally. Install at least 8 gig of memory in the db server (better SQL cache) Configure two disks as a mirror and place the log file for your application db on the mirror. Do not compress this disk (faster log file writes) Configure 4 disks as a Raid 10 and place the db on the Raid 10. Do not compress this disk (better read performance than raid 5) Configure a single disk as the location of the tempDB. Do not compress this disk (isolate activity of tempDB) Run only SQL Server on the server. Ensure your db has the correct indexes by inspecting the missing index dynamic management view. Ensure your db has a maintenance plan to reduce db and index fragmentation Extract and reload each of the “text” files from the database. Prior to loading the text file compress (zip) the file with the tool of your choice. Store the “text” file in a varbinary datatype. Configure the application to uncompress the file prior to display (reduce disk IO for SQL to store 'text' and network io to client) Benchmark you application with a known number of users and searches Compare your benchmark with actual values during client usage Monitor disk wait, network IO and memory on a regular bases. If you still have poor performance contract a SQL DBA to evaluate your system. I believe performanceDBA on this site is in the contract business.
