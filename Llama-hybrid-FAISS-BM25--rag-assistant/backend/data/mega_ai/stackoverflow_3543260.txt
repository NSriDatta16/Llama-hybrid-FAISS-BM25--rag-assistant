I'm not qualified to answer with respect to WPF and Silverlight, but with respect to SSRS and web applications, a subset of HTML will treat you fine, though you'll want to use SSRS 2008 or later. In SSRS 2008, displaying HTML requires a simple setting on a text box placeholder. You can see an example here: http://dinesql.blogspot.com/2010/05/reporting-services-2008-showing-html.html In a web application, displaying HTML is super easy, though I recommend first sanitizing your output using the AntiXSS library (using the GetSafeHTMLFragment() method): http://wpl.codeplex.com/
