Identifying features using two-sample t-test - resulting in over-fitting?

Let's say that I have a binary classification problem, thousands of features. If I were to run a two-sample t-test on some of these features to figure out which ones differ significantly between classes (correcting for multiple-comparisons), and then use the significant features in an SVM model, will this result in substantial over-fitting? If so, what are alternative ways I can sub-select a group of features that best predict classes while maintaining generalization ability?
