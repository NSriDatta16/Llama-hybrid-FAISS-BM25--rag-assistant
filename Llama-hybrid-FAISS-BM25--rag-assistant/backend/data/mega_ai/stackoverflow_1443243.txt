LaunchAgent - Is there something like RunAtScreenSaver?

I am looking for a way to execute my app (it's a background task) at times, where the machine is "idle". A good incident would be when the screensaver launches. I already read the manual auf launchd and already use a LaunchAgent to lauch my app at certain intervals, but I found nothing that might help me launching my app when the screensaver is active. Is there any possibility to do that? Thanks in advance! Josh
