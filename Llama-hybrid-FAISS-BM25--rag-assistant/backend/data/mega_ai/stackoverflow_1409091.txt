How do I prevent the Java XML Transformer using "HTML" method from adding tag?

I'm using the built-in Java XML Transformer to serialize an XML document into text. I'm having a problem however when I am outputting in HTML mode. Whenever I insert a head element the built-in transformer decides to insert a META tag with content-type data. I don't want this tag inside my data and I can't seem to find an output parameter that will disable this feature. I know I could build an xslt stylesheet and strip the tag in question, but it would be simpler just to be able to set a parameter on the transformer itself that disables it. You might respond with "but you really should have this tag" -- trust me, I don't need it, for brevities sake I won't go into it. Sample code Document d; //d = Transformer t; //properly inited with no xslt specified t.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.METHOD,"html"); t.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT,"no"); t.transform(new DOMSource(d), result); System.out.println(result); returns Case in point, I don't want that META tag there. How do I get rid of it in the easiest way possible? UPDATE: I've run across the option {http://xml.apache.org/xalan}omit-meta-tag which is supposed to do what I'm looking for. However it seems as though it's being ignored.
