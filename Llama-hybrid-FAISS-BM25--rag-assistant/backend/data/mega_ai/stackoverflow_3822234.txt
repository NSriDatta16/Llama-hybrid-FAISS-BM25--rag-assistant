Based on the description of App-V here I'd be shocked if the performance was good enough for Visual Studio to be usable. VS is a very processor and IO intensive application. Virtualizing its entire operation over the wire is likely drag performance down to unacceptable levels. I have seen VS perform acceptably on local VMs running VirtualBox, that might be another option for you if platform standardization is your goal.
