get xpath from xsl variable

I am trying to get some xpath from xsl variable using xsl ver 1.0 . Thatâ€™s my variable: I am trying to get bbb attribure value using the RefTag value: this is not working. VS XSL Debugger returns an error: "To use a result tree fragment in a path expression, first convert it to a node-set using the msxsl:node-set() function." I don't understand how to use msxsl:node-set() function, and anyway I prefer not to use msxsl namesapce. Can anyone help here?
