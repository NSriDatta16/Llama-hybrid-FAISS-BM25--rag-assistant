Solving the Kolmogorov forward equation for transition probabilities

Let $\lambda \mu > 0$ and let $X$ be a Markov chain on $\{1,2\}$ with generators $$ Q = \begin{pmatrix} -\mu & \mu \\ \lambda & -\lambda \end{pmatrix}$$ Write down the forward equations and solve them fro the transition probabilities, $p_{i,j}(t), i,j = 1, 2$. The answers say: "We have that $$p_{11}' = -\mu p_{11} + \lambda p_{12}, \, \, \, p_{22}' = -\lambda p_{22} + \mu p_{21}$$ where $p_{12} = 1 - p_{11}$ and $p_{21} = 1 - p_{22}$. Solve these subject to $p_{ij}(t) = \delta_{ij}$, the Kronecker delta, to obtain that the matrix $P_t = \{p_{ij}(t)\}$." The bits I don't understand are these 1) How do they get those equations in the first place? For example, why have they added $\lambda p_{12}$ when the coefficient for $p_{12} = \mu$? 2) How do you solve these equations? What do you do with that Kronecker delta to solve them?
