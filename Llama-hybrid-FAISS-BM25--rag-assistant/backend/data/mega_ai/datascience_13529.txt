Input for individual perceptron in input layer in MLP

For better understand of neural networks I started implementation of Multi Layer Perceptron. For now I'm implemented single Perceptron that resolve XOR problem. From this point I want start build MLP but I'm not sure if I correctly understand MLP structure. Assume I have data instance with 3 attributes and 2 classes and 5 input perceptrons. Should I give every perceptron same input and every output of perceptron should go to every hidden layer perceptron's input? I attach neural net pic.
