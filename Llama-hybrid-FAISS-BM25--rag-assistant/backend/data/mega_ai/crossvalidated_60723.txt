Bias of maximum likelihood estimators for logistic regression

I would like to understand a couple of fact on maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for logistic regressions. Is it true that, in general, the MLE for logistic regression is biased? I would say "yes". I know, for example, that sample dimension is related to the asymptotic bias of MLEs. Do you know any elementary examples of this phenomenon? If the MLE is biased, is it true that the covariance matrix of the MLEs is the inverse of the Hessian of the maximum likelihood function? edit : I have met this formula quite often and without any proof; it seems a quite arbitrary choice to me.
