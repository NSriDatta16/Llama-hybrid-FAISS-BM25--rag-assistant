You can use the Design view in Flex to drag and drop components too, but that doesn't matter. What matters is is why you want learn actionscript 3 ? What do you want to use if for ? For RIAs and the like, Flex is a good option. For rich media websites/presentations/games, go with Flash as you'll have more/easier control over media. Bad news is since actionscript 3, there is no easy way, but all the hard work will pay off. Once you get used to it/get to the point where it clicks, it might be a bit hard, but not impossible. Goodluck
