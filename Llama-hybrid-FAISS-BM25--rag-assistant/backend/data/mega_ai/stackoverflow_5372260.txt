It's part of Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA) earlier called Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX (SFU), earlier called Interix . Citing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interix , SUA is available on Windows Server 2003 R2 (all editions) - version 5.2 Windows Vista (Ultimate and Enterprise editions) - version 6.0 Windows Server 2008 (all editions) - version 6.0 Windows Server 2008 R2 and Microsoft Windows 7 - version 6.1 All you have to do to use fork() is to install free SUA SDK .
