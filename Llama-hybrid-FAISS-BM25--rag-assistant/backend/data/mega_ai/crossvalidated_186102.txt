Normalization on new test set

Many machine learning algorithms require normalization as a preprocessing step. For instance, SVM requires the input data to be normalized. So we do the normalization on the input data and then divide the set into training and testing sets and use the SVM classifier. Now consider a situation when i get a new different set of test of data to try. Now how do i normalize this new test set? Assuming a simple normalization technique such as the min-max normalization. In this situation what should be done? Is it like the min and max values of each feature must be computed from the training set and apply the same on the test set for normalization?
