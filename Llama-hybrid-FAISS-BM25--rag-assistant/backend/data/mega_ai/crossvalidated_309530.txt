Given that it's financial data, it's likely that the feature distributions in your train and validation sets are different - a phenomenon known as covariate shift - and neural networks don't tend to play well with this. Having different feature distributions can cause overfitting even if the network is relatively small. Given that l1 and l2 don't help things I suspect other standard regularization measures like adding noise to inputs/weights/gradients probably won't help, but it might be worth a try. I would be tempted to try a classification algorithm which is less affected by the absolute magnitudes of features, such a gradient boosted treees.
