What is the lowest-cost, cross-platform approach to parse XML using ksh?

Need to parse some basic XML (one root element, 3-4 subelements, 1-3 attributes each) from a ksh script (ideally stick to ksh, given the script already exists and it's just trying to read some extra configuration created in XML by another program). I know I can use sed and do pattern matching, but it's not foolproof given that the input XML could change and attributes could be duplicated on the various subelements (or new subelements). So far, I'm thinking of using an XSLT against the XML to extract the few attributes (for specific elements) that the ksh script cares about as individual fields. I can use Oracle for this given we are a DB-driven product, and Oracle would always be installed on our systems, but that seems a bit heavy handed. Any other safe approach to extract specific attributes from the input XML in a cross-platform manner that doesn't require access to 3rd-party parser/transformer?
