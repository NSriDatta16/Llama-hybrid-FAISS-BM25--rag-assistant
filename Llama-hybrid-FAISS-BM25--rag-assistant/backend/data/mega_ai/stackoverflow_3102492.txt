Searching table by Guid faster when the Guid is the clustered index?

If I am going to be querying a table by Guids (irregardless of fragmentation problems with Guids), would it be faster to have the Guid as the clustered index rather than the non-clustered index or no index at all? This question is coming from a read-only standpoint. I'm just curious if there will be a speed improvement between the searching rows for a specific Guid, and will searching complete faster with/without an index or with/without a clustered index? Alternatively, I'm fairly certain in the answer to my next question, but now apply int identifiers to the previous question. Will it be faster to search if the table is clustered by that int? (This is rather than clustered by some other item in the table?) I know there are many other questions posted on this topic, but I haven't found the specific answer that I'm looking for in any of these: Should a Sequential Guid primary key column be a clustered index? Improving performance of cluster index GUID primary key Clustered primary key on unique identifier ID column in SQL Server uniqueidentifier with index Should I get rid of clustered indexes on Guid columns Thanks for any help!
