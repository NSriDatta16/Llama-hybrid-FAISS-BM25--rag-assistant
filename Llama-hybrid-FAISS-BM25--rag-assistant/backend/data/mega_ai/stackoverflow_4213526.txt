JavaScript mouseenter event not working when mouse is down

I have an scroll and a div that on mouseover and mouseleave changes its background. You can see the working code here: http://jsfiddle.net/y8S57/ , please use a Webkit browser as type="range" works only on Webkit. The problem is that if the mouse is down on the type="range" button and enters the mouseover and mouseleave zone the respective events are not triggered. Somehow using the type="range" cancels the other events that should be happening. How can I fix this so when I drag the and my mouse is over that mouseover div the mouseover event to trigger? HTML: JavaScript: $("#zone").mouseenter(function(){ $(this).css({background:"red"}); }); $("#zone").mouseleave(function(){ $(this).css({background:"black"}); });
