The tried and true strategy is always to manage expectations. Don't make a user second guess you or your application. If, by your benchmarks, the average processing time for a particular page will go beyond, say a 6-second threshold, say so before the user clicks a button. It's much like waiting for a Web site to send you a confirmation e-mail, not knowing when it will arrive, because it was never mentioned that it could take several hours due to traffic beyond the control of the site.
