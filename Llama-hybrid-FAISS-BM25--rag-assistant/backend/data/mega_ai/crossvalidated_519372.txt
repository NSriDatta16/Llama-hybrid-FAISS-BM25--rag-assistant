If I am not missing anything, you are doing a linear model for some variable $Y$ and one of your predictor variables is the frequency of a certain word in the corpus of a film review. Note the following, in a linear model $Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \ldots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon,$ the choice of a good estimator for the parameters depend on the shape of the variance-covariance matrix $V(\epsilon \vert X).$ Usually, the assumption of Homoscedasticity can be done and $V(\epsilon \vert X)=\sigma ^2 I_n.$ In other cases, this hypothesis is false and $V(\epsilon \vert X) \neq \sigma ^2 I_n.$ In that cases is when you use weighted regression for taking into account this fact in order to get a good (unbiased and optimal) estimator. Therefore, performing a weighted regression or not depends on if you can assume Homoscedasticity in your model or not. It does not depend on the form of your variables. There are a lot of choices to test Homoscedasticity (see for instance Breusch-Pagan test https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breusch%E2%80%93Pagan_test ). So summarizing, take your initial regression and test Homocedasticity in order to know if you should perform a weighted regression. Try also with the absolute frequency (which takes into account the size of the corpus) and maybe you have Homoscedasticity and you can use a standard linear regression. Finally, one fantastic fact, if you get wrong and use a standard regression (LSE estimator) in the case of heteroskedasticity, this estimation is not the best (because the best is using weighted regression) but it is not that bad (this estimator is consistent, that is, converges in probability to the true parameters).
