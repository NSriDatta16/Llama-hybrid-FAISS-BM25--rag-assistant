Why is the session growing? Are you doing this within a request's lifetime? I'm assuming you're "tracking" by keeping info about emails sent within the session state. I'd write a tracker that can batch-write tracking information to exterior storage, such as xml files on disk or a sql database. If the tracking part isn't whats causing issues, but the one-at-a-time email (or the widget sending them) is, you can try batching emails and BCC them rather than sending them out one at a time. Blind Carbon Copies are always personally addressed and don't reveal to the recipient that it was mass mailed. You just have to figure out the limit on the number of emails you can send via BCC. Third option is to, in your web app, drop what you need to generate these emails into a common storage location and have a windows Service app (or a scheduled task app) that regularly checks for new email jobs and processes them outside of your web app... maybe even outside of your web app's host server. Of course, this kind of thing wouldn't work on shared hosting servers...
