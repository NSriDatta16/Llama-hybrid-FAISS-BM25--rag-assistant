What version of SharpPcap are you using? I'm moving a small in-work project from 2.1.1 to 2.4.1, and parts of the library have changed significantly. I struggled with this myself just a bit ago. LivePcapDeviceList devices = LivePcapDeviceList.Instance; foreach (LivePcapDevice device in devices) { // Do stuff here... }
