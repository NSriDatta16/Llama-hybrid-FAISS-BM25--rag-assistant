Is a very high cost function value a problem by itself?

I'm in the beginnings of following along with the Coursera machine learning course, and I just did univariate linear regression. My regression line/output looks good and the cost function decreased, but was still extremely high at the end of iterating (J(theta) = 2058715091.21221 at the final iteration). Is this an issue if everything looks right and it seems to asymptote around there or should it really be going to zero? Here are the plots: If there's not really a general answer and it depends upon specifics I'll make an edit and post all the code. For a general overview, the data is (house sqft, house price) with ranges (852-4478),(179900-699900). I normalized the house sqft input between [0,1], set the learning rate to 1 and the number of iterations to 100. I tried with a smaller learning rate and higher iterations and it doesn't seem to help. Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated, thanks.
