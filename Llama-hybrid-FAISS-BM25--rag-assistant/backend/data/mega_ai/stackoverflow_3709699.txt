can gcov deal with shared object?

I am recently using gcov to collect the code coverage info. gcov plays well with executable application :) , but when I try to load a .so file, I got this error: unknown symbol __gcov_merge_add. Then I search on Google and someone said adding -lgcov to the link flag(LDFLAGS), I did add this option and it didn't work. I also try on --coverage option in link flag, cannot get rid of this error. Can someone help on this issue? Thank you.
