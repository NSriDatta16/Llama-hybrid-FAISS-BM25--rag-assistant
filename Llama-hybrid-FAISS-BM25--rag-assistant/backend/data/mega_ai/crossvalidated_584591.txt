Conditional GAN training

Quite a simple question about this paper : How is the cGAN trained? I'm interested in the Pix2Pix network In particular, given the batch approach, given a specific step, is this the correct procedure? sample $(x,y_{real})$ from the dataset, generate $y_{fake}$ using the generator give to the discriminator $(x,y_{real})$ and $(x,y_{fake})$ and ask him to discriminate the fake ones Or to the discriminator, we have to give him a set of $(x,y_{real})$ different to the ones given to the generator?
