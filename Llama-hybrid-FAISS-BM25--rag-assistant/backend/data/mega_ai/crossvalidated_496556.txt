Markov chain ( Absorption)

I have just started learning Markov chain and I am clueless about how to solve this problem A man rolls a boulder up a 40 meter-high hill. Each minute, with probability 1/3 he manages to roll the boulder 1 meter up, while with probability 2/3 the boulder rolls 1 meter down. If the man is currently half-way towards the summit, what is the probability that he will reach the summit before descending to the foothills?
