Writing tests, and more importantly testable code is an independent skill, just like learning to program each new language is an independent skill. Read Mi≈°ko Hevery 's blog, read some books (I liked Test Driven by Lasse Koskela), use some code coverage tools like Clover , and then write some tests. As you write tests, your testing skills will improve, and you will come to understand what is involved in writing testable code. Then you will be able to know for your particular project the level of code coverage that is required.
