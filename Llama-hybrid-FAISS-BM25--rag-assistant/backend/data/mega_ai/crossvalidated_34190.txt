The BIC is justified from the Bayesian viewpoint but you din't need to be taking a Bayesian approach to use it. It is very similar to AIC. The difference is in the form of the penalty function on the number of parameterrs used. AIC was introduced by Akaike in the mid 1970s. BIC was introduced by Gideon Schwarz in 1978.
