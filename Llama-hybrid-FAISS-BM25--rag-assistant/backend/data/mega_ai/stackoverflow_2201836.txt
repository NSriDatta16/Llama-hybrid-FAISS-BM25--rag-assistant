from: css-tricks As anti-intuitive as collapsing seems to be, the alternative is worse. Consider this scenario: If the block element on top where to have automatically expanded to accomodate the floated element, we would have an unnatural spacing break in the flow of text between paragraphs, with no practical way of fixing it. If this were the case, us designers would be complaining much harder about this behavior than we do about collapsing. Collapsing almost always needs to be dealt with to prevent strange layout and cross-browser problems. We fix it by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container.
