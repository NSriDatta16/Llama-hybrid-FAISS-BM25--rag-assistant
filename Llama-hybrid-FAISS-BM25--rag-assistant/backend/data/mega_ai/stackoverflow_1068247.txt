If I were to do this, I'd store the generated files in a hierarchy, based on the file name (IFF the filenames are sufficiently well distributed), so "onefile.html" gets stored in "o/n/e/onefile.html" and "anotherfile.html" as "a/n/o/anotherfile.html". Using three levels of storage isn't necessary, you may require four. Also, chunking the pathnames on a per-character basis may not be the best distribution, you may be better off using two or three characters, depending on how your distribution looks. I've used similar storage schemes for received faxes for an electronic fax service in the past (using longer and longer prefixes of the destination fax number as pathname components). I guess the reason you're looking at generating the flat files is to amortise the cost of generating the HTML?
