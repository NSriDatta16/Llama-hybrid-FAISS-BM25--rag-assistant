From a bayesian point of view the distribution of p with k empirical successes and n trials is the Beta-Distribution , in detail $p\sim Beta(a,b)$ with $a=k+1$ and $b=n-k+1$. It represents the unnormalized density $prob(p|data)$, i.e. the unormalized probability that the unknown parameter is $p$ given the data (successes and trials) you have seen so far. (copied from my answer to this question ). Since the parameters $a,b$ are both real, it can also be applied in your special case, just substitute $k$ with $E$ and $n$ with $N$ (assuming that $E\le N$ is guaranteed) The upper bound of the two-sided credible interval (as it is called in the bayesian case) is calculated as $qbeta(1-alpha/2,a,b)=1-qbeta(alpha/2,b,a)$ ( source ) where $qbeta$ represents the quantile or inverse cumulative distribution function for Beta.
