I personally think this is not a good idea. I prefer to keep enums in their own file (one file per defined enum), just like a class. This makes it more obvious (to me) where to go if I'm looking for a type, by name. I treat enums just like a class or struct, or any other namespace-scoped type, which for me means one type per file. The main downside to your approach arises if you have many Enums defined in your project - that "one file" can get quite large. However, there is no technical difference in the compiled IL. This really is more of a personal, organizational strategy.
