Some confusion on learning of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

I have some experience with machine learning, but no background in deep learning at all. The idea of a GAN looks so cool, and there are so many sources out there that talks about the idea, but there is no good source that I could find which can convey how to train GANs to a deep learning beginner. Here are my detailed questions: Why is there a need for the vector $z$? And why $p(z) = N(0,1)$ initially? Is the latent vector $z$ learned in the training step of the generator network? Do we ever learn the distributions $p(x)$ and $p(z)$? If so, when? According to here , the discriminator network is trained with the real samples and the fake samples in separate steps. When there is only one class of samples (either real or fake), how come you can train a "discriminator" (there is nothing to discriminate)?
