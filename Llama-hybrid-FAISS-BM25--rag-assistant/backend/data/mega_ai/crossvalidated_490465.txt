Is there any university program that offers an intro statistical methods class that is bayesian -instead- of a frequentist one?

Is there any university program that offers an introductory statistical methods class that is bayesian -instead- of a frequentist one? Surely every intro to stats class in every program in the world, whether agronomy or economics or psychology or a service class by the stats department, is primarily frequentist based. And just as surely there are many (but not all) programs where later in the curriculum there are some specialty courses (requiring a few stats pre-reqs) that are titled 'Intro to Bayesian Statistics'. But are there at least some places somewhere that offer a bayesian class as the intro statistical methods class? (either as the only intro to stats -or- simply as an alternative first class to a frequentist intro) I would count an intro stats class that teaches bayesian methods in addition to frequentist ones. If such programs are not as rare as I imagine, then is there any indication of percentage? I am wondering how easy it is to have a bayesian methods course without first having a frequentist methods course.
