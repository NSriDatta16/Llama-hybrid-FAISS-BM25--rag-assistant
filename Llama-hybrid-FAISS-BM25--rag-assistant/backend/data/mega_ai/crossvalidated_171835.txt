So, as the question is perfectly on-topic here, as it deals with "Data Visualization", I would reproduce the comment as an answer, so that future viewers can be benefitted. What is this type of graph called? This graph is called as a "Tree diagram" and sometimes also called a dendrogram Are there existing tools to produce this type of graph? Yes, the tree diagram can be drawn in all the major data science tools. Here is a link to the tutorial for plotting the tree diagram in D3.js In Python, the pydot package can be used. Here is a link to a detailed tutorial. Here is another tutorial in R, which gives a step-by-step guide on various types of tree diagrams. I would recommend going with D3 for the dendrograms, owing to better aesthetics, ease of code and flexibility.
