What is the difference using a Fisher's Exact Test vs. a Logistic Regression for $2 \times 2$ tables?

For a $2 \times 2$ table, two ways to do inference on the table is through Fisher's Exact Test and also a Logistic Regression. I was told that using a Fisher's Exact Test, we are only interested in the presence of association. But that with a Logistic Regression, we are interested in the magnitude of association. However, I do not understand why. For example, in a Fisher's exact test done in R, it returns the Odds Ratio with a Confidence Interval, while with the Logistic Regression, we are returned with the intercept and the slope, both of which correspond to the log odds and the log odds ratio. My question is , where does the Logistic Regression give us the magnitude of association? I am assuming it is in the $\beta_1$ coefficient, but that is just the log odds ratio, which Fisher's exact test yields as well . What are the differences?
