There is a viewer of this sort built into visual studio, go to Tools-> Connect to Database, and get it all hooked up to the database. Then when you see the database on the Server Explorer, open a table and look at the different buttons in your toolbar, there's one that will bring the table up as a little window on a grey background. Once you've got that window open, you can drag/drop other tables into the gray area and it will show you all there relationships.
