Delete all files/directories except two specific directories

So, there seems to be a few questions asking about removing files/directories matching certain cases, but I'm looking for the exact opposite: Delete EVERYTHING in a folder that DOESN'T match my provided examples. For example, here is an example directory tree: . |-- coke | |-- diet | |-- regular | `-- vanilla |-- icecream | |-- chocolate | |-- cookiedough | |-- cupcake | | |-- file1.txt | | |-- file2.txt | | |-- file3.txt | | |-- file4.txt | | `-- file5.txt | `-- vanilla |-- lol.txt |-- mtndew | |-- classic | |-- codered | |-- livewire | | |-- file1.txt | | |-- file2.txt | | |-- file3.txt | | |-- file4.txt | | `-- file5.txt | `-- throwback `-- pepsi |-- blue |-- classic |-- diet `-- throwback I want to delete everything but the files in test/icecream/cupcake/ and test/mtndew/livewire/. Everything else can go, including the directory structure. So, how can I achieve this? Languages I wouldn't mind this being in: bash or python.
