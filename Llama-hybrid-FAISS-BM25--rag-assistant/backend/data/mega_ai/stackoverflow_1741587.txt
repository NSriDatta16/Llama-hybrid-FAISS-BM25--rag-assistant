Linq DBML Mapping a Table With A Primary Key That Spans 2 Columns

I have three tables: Login, LoginRoles and Roles. Login joins to LoginRoles and LoginRoles joins to Roles. LoginRoles is a many-to-many table, and I want to constrain the columns as being unique TOGETHER. LoginRoles: MemberId (int), RoleId(int) This is similar to the aspnet_UsersInRoles table in the default membership database: Table 3.2 I set the primary key for this table as both of the columns. When dragging the table into the DBML diagram I can not see this primary key represented in the diagram and I get the warning (and other similar ones): Warning 1 DBML1062: The Type attribute 'LoginRole' of the Association element 'Login_LoginRole' of the Type element 'Login' does not have a primary key. No code will be generated for the association. 0 0 Any ideas on how to make it recognise the Primary Key?
