Should I put outcome variable in Matchit::matchit ()

I would like to perform a logistic regression by adjusting for propensity score. My question is, do I have to include the outcome (binary in my case) in the propensity score calculation? Otherwise how else can I link the outcome variable to the matched data created? For example if I don't put the outcome variable in function matchit() like in the scripts below library(MatchIt) m.out I will have such a data.frame which doesn't contain outcome. How could I make the link between the outcome variable and this data frame in order to do the final analysis. treatment var1 var2 var3 var4 distance weights 1 0 1 1 0 0 0.4135 1 2 0 1 0 1 1 0.5446 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.6534 1 4 1 1 1 1 0 0.7343 1 library(Zelig) z.out = zelig(outcome ~treatment+var1+var2+var3+var4, model = "logit",data = dataMatched )
