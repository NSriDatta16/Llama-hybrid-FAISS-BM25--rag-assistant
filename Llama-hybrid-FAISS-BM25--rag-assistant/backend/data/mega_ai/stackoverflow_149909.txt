How can I use a type with generic arguments as a constraint?

I would like to specify a constraint which is another type with a generic argument. class KeyFrame { public float Time; public T Value; } // I want any kind of Keyframe to be accepted class Timeline where T : Keyframe { } But this cannot be done in c# as of yet, (and I really doubt it will ever be). Is there any elegant solution to this rather than having to specify the type of the keyframe argument?: class Timeline where TKeyframe : Keyframe , { }
