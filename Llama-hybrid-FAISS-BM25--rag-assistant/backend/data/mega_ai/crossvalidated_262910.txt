Value of the dual variables corresponding to data points on the margin in Support Vector Machine

Consider the setting of binary classification using soft-margin SVM. \begin{align*} \min_{w,b,\xi} ~~ &\lambda ||w||^2 + \sum_{i=1}^m \xi_i \\ \text{s.t. } \quad &y_i(w\cdot x_i + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i ~~ \forall i = 1,\ldots, m \\ &\xi_i \geq 0~~ \forall i = 1,\ldots, m \end{align*} Can anybody give pointers to show that " if some data point $x_i$ is on the correct margin , then the corresponding dual variable i.e. $\alpha_i \in (0,1)$" ? More clearly, how to prove that the above said $\alpha_i$ will never take the boundary value $0$ or $1$ ?
