Using the bootstrap estimates to compute the acceleration parameter for BCa bootstrap CI

I have noticed different software use different method of calculating the acceleration parameter, $a$ , for computing the bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence interval (CI). In general, the formula for $a$ is $$ a = \frac{1}{6}\frac{\sum_i{I_i^3}}{(\sum_i{I_i^2})^{3/2}} $$ where $i$ index units in the sample and $I$ is the "empirical influence function". Calculating $I$ is where the approaches differ. The boot package in R offers four options: The infinitesimal jackknife The usual (leave one out) jackknife The positive (include one twice) jackknife A regression estimation method, which involves use the coefficients from a regression of the estimates on the bootstrap array (which computes the effect of the number of times each unit is present in the bootstrap sample on the bootstrap estimate in that sample) A fifth option is in the bayestestR package, which seems to use the bootstrapped statistics directly, i.e., $I_j=(R-1)(\bar{t}-t_j)$ , where $R$ is the number of bootstrap replications, $t_j$ is the $j$ th bootstrap estimate, and $\bar{t}$ is their mean. In this method, it appears the sums are over the bootstrap replications $j$ rather than over the units $i$ . This method is much faster than the others because all the values required for calculating the acceleration parameter come straight from the bootstrap estimates, whereas the other methods require additional calculations (e.g., performing the jackknife). See bayestestR:::.bci() for the implementation. Although it is clear that this method was developed for Bayesian inference (given its inclusion in a package for Bayesian inference), other packages use it for frequentist bootstrap inference as well. Is this valid?
