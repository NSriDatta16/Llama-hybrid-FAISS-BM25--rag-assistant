curl + jsecurity authentication

I have a grails app that is using jsecurity plugin for authentication. How do I use curl to send my credentials? If I just do curl -u username mysite I get a prompt for a password, then nothing. I tried to do an anyauth command and this is what I got for the site. Any idea why it is returning a 302? dcole@DCOLE-L /cygdrive/c/dev $ curl --anyauth --verbose http://localhost:8080/SkillsDB * About to connect() to localhost port 8080 (#0) * Trying ::1... connected * Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0) > GET /SkillsDB HTTP/1.1 > User-Agent: curl/7.20.1 (i686-pc-cygwin) libcurl/7.20.1 OpenSSL/0.9.8o zlib/1. 2.5 libidn/1.18 libssh2/1.2.5 > Host: localhost:8080 > Accept: */* > here is additional information: Rob is correct that it is form based. When I go to the address http://localhost:8080/SkillsDB/auth/initialLogin This is the form code that is displayed: âœ“ Log In
