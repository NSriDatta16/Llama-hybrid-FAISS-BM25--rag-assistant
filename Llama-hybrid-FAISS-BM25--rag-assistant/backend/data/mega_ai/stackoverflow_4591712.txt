Android ListView starting offset?

anyone knows how do i change the starting offset of a ListView ? i mean to make the list view's starting item a different item then number zero so when you drag down the listview from starting point it will return to the first (custom) starting point item when i try using ListView.offsetTopAndBottom(x) it gets that effect, only its not usable for me because it changes the offset of the entire view (the bottom as well)
