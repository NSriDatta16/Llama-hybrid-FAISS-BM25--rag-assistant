Django - expire django template cache based on variables

Its not to hard to invalidate a particular template cache in django def invalidate_cache_key(fragment_name, *variables): args = md5_constructor(u':'.join([urlquote(var) for var in variables])) cache_key = 'template.cache.%s.%s' % (fragment_name, args.hexdigest()) cache.delete(cache_key) However I have a situation where I need to delete all cached fragments that have had a certain variable passed to them. For example, delete all cached fragments about the car brand 'Toyota'. {% cache 100000 car_content car.brand %} Essentially is there a way to get all cache_keys based on a certain set of criteria? I have thought dangerously about changing the cache source but I was wondering if there might be a better solution to this problem.
