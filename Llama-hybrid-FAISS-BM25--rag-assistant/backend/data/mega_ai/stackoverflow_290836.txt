In my experience, pretty code usually works very well, while ugly code often breaks in hard-to-spot ways. It's just true that the kind of mind that pays attention to details like how the code looks is also the kind of mind that pays attention to more important details. That said, re-ordering the elements in a CSS style so that they go short-to-long is bat******** crazy.
