Drupal: How to integrate AES Encryption module with CCK?

AES Encryption (http://drupal.org/project/aes) module comes with an easy developer API $encrypted_data => aes_encrypt("mydata"); $decrypted_to_plain_text => aes_decrypt($encrypted_data); I was thinking how one could integrate this with CCK, so data stored into the DB is encrypted just before storage, and decrypted on retrieval. The way I imagine the UI is to have a simple checkbox on the field setup page asking whether to store the data as encrypted. This way, one could protect its database, in case hackers get a hold of it. Think of the recent email marketing website breaches, where the entire userbase was spammed. http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/05/idUS100003661220110405
