Honestly, if you yourself aren't a flash developer, I'd caution against interviewing a potential Flash developer, unless you're only doing it to get a sense of their character (as opposed to their skill level). Experience in working with the technology is going to give you a much more realistic perspective - blindly asking questions that other people told you are good ones to ask will get you into trouble. That said, if you can find someone you know to sit in on the interview with you and provide evaluation from a technical standpoint, here's a few things I'd remind them to ask: object oriented programming loading external media audio & video playback (also maybe volume control / mixing) event listeners transitions / animation filter / sort algorithms common UI elements: scrollbar, form elements, drop-down menu, rollover states, drag-and-drop, etc. Those are sort of generally useful areas of knowlege, but the true test of profficiency is a practical test - "write a class that meets these requirements", or "this code isn't working, find out why and fix it" are good ways to immediately gain insight into the candidate's work (and thought) process. Most importantly: even if the interviewee is short on specific knowlege or experience of the subjects you settle on, it's better to get someone who is a fast learner and will easily comprehend new concepts then to get someone who might know a lot now, but will resist learning new stuff.
