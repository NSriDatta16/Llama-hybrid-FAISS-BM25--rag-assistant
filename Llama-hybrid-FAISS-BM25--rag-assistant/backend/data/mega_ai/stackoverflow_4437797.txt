How can I programmatically modify an embedded bar/column chart with VBA?

I'm creating a ProcessBook display that populates an embedded Microsoft Office 11.0 Spreadsheet object (Office 2003) with a set of entries. I'm then calculating aggregate data about them; this aggregate data should not be visible in spreadsheet form onscreen, but does need to be used to generate a bar chart. The data is currently being used to populate a separate Microsoft Office 11.0 Spreadsheet object. It's organized such that the title of each bar chart is in column A and the corresponding value is in column B. Since this is ProcessBook, I've had some difficulty even gaining access to embedded objects, but I've managed to embed and gain access to a ChartSpace object, as well as a child ChChart object. Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to either manually set the values of the bars or how to use the .SetData or .SetSpreadsheetData methods to point it to an object that I've populated. Accessing the ChartSpace object is pretty straightforward: ThisDisplay.ChartSpace1 I can then add a Chart and access it fairly easily: Dim objChart as ChChart Set objChart = ThisDisplay.ChartSpace1.Charts.Add(0) I can access my spreadsheet values pretty easily as well: strBarName = ThisDisplay.sstChartData.Range("A2").Value intBarVal = ThisDisplay.sstChartData.Range("B2").Value How do I actually set the data source or manually set the values of the bars in the ChChart object? Alternatively, how do I use a different object to accomplish the same goal?
