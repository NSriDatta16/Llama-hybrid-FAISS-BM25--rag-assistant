I'm assuming what you're getting at is you want the entire block of text in the list item, and maybe the entire list item, to be clickable? First, a paragraph tag is a block level item, but an anchor tag is inherently an inline element. You can't place that inside an anchor tag, it's not semantically correct and it won't validate. Do something like this instead: This is the title This is the link text Assuming you want the entire area of the list item to be clickable, you can apply display:block; to the anchor tag using css. Note that if you've assigned a different height to the list item and want everything to be clickable, you'll need to set the height on the tag as well. .myList a { display:block; } And if you want the strong tag to break a line (your "main text" in the link)... .myList a strong { display:block;} Hope that helps!
