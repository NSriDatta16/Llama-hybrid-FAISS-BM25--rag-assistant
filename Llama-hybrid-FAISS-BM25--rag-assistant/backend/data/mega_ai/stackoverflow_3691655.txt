Embedding Python in an iPhone app

So it's a new millennium; Apple has waved their hand; it's now legal to include a Python interpreter in an iPhone (App Store) app. How does one go about doing this? All the existing discussion (unsurprisingly) refers to jailbreaking. (Older question: Can I write native iPhone apps using Python ) My goal here isn't to write a PyObjC app, but to write a regular ObjC app that runs Python as an embedded library. The Python code will then call back to native Cocoa code. It's the "control logic is Python code" pattern. Is there a guide to getting Python built in XCode, so that my iPhone app can link it? Preferably a stripped-down Python, since I won't need 90% of the standard library. I can probably figure out the threading and Python-extension API; I've done that on MacOS. But only using command-line compilers, not XCode.
