Which dimensionality reduction technique preserves the k nearest neighbors (euclidean space)?

I'm looking for a lower dimensional projection of data such that the k nearest neighbors (in Euclidean space) in high dimensions remain the k nearest neighbors in low dimensions. I found that Isomap takes k-neighborhood into account, but it looks at gedesic distance rather than Eucledian distance, right? What about Multidimensional scaling (MDS)? Or should I use t-SNE or LLE?
