Make SubSonic use existing instead of new data provider

I am adding SubSonic to a legacy application. This application already defines a ConnectionString. Is there a way I can use this connectionstring instead of creating a new Data Provider entry? I know that one solution is programmatically setting this in the code (i.e. SubSonic.DataService.GetInstance("Name").SetDefaultConnectionString("ConnString") ). However, is there a more elegant solution?
