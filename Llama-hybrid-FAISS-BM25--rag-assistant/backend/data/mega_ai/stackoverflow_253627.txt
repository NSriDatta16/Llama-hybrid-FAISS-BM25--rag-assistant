As I've said elsewhere, low code-coverage is a problem, but high code-coverage doesn't mean that you're writing pure gold. If you weren't concerned about code-coverage, then I'd suggest that you'd need tests for equals() and getValue() - depending on how and where hashCode() is being used (sorry, I'm a C# developer), then you might want to test that. The most important part is that your tests give you confidence that you've written the right code and that the code works as expected.
