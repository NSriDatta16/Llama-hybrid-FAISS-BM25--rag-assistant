You should probably look into using the SetWindowLongPtr function of user32.dll . You'll need to get the window handle associated with the application's main window. This could potentially be done using: Process[] processes = Process.GetProcesses(); foreach (Process process in processes) { if (process.MainModule.FileName == @"C:\Program Files\App\app.exe") { IntPtr handle = process.MainWindowHandle; // Call method to change window style here. break; } } You can then set the appropriate styles using the GWL_STYLE constant (value -16 in decimal) and SetWindowLongPtr . Changing the Style of the Main Window should help you find the styles that you need.
