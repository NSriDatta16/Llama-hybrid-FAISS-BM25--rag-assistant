SOLVED IT YES WOOHOOOOOOOO 3 days of testing, testing, testing. I decided to start a new project just with the extension method above and a simply for loop to test UI update functionality. I started testing different DispatchPrioraties (tested them all). Weirdly, I found the highest priorities were the worse, for example using Send didn't update the label at all, Render updated it twice on average. This was the weird behavior I was experiencing as I tried different priorities. I discovered Background: The enumeration value is 4. Operations are processed after all other non-idle operations are completed. Now this sounded exactly what I didn't want, as obviously the label should update during processing, hence why I never tried it. I'm guessing that once one of my method has been completed, before the next it called, the UI is updated. I'm find of guessing, but it 100% consistently updates correctly on two separate operations. Thanks all.
