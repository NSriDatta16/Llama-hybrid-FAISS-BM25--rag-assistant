In a deep autoencoder, you can freeze all components of the bottleneck layer and then perturb them one by one to see how each of them affects the output. This may lead to interesting insights. However, as you increase the value of a specific component, do not expect the output to only increase its intensity, because the model is not linear. Also, do not expect a combination of non-zero components to produce an output that is a linear combination of the output each component produces separately. This will work with convolutional autoencoders as well as fully connected autoencoders.
