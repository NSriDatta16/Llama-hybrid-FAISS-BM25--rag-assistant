Decision boundary for logistic loss and soft 0-1 loss

I have a problem at hand that I have the solution to, but I quite can't make sense of the solution. Any help is appreciated. We are given the data set in the below figure. We are asked to plot the decision boundaries for the following models: A generative model with Gaussian class conditionals where each class has its own mean and spherical covariance matrix, A logistic regression model, A linear model trained with soft zero-one loss. And here is the answer: I understand the boundary for the Gaussian model but I am lost on the logistic regression and the soft 0-1 loss one. Why is the logistic regression one going through the origin? Is the soft 0-1 loss like an SVM classifier? I guess that would make the dashed line the middle of the possible maximum margin solution. Any insight is appreciated. How can I decide on a decision boundary for losses if I am just given data?
