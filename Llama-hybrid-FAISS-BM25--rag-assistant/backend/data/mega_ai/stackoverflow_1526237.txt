Flash Deep-Linking Causing Page Refresh in Web-Kit

I am working on a project where my team's Flash application is being displayed in another team's Web-Kit browser. We are experiencing a bug when a Flash Accordions selected index is changed; the web-page itself refreshes. Since this is a map-based application, this is unacceptable since the users Area of Interest is lost. From my research so far, I understand that Flash uses "Deep-Linking" to set the state of the Flash App based on "fragments" in the url without actually refreshing the page. So, a change in the Accordion's selected index updates the url, and uses that url to do stuff without actually refreshing the page. Since this is not a problem in any other browser (FF,IE,Chrome,Safari), the incompatibility seems to be with the Deep-Linking and the Web-Kit. Both teams are actively troubleshooting, but time is running out. Does anyone know of a method to disable the url from changing while still achieving the desired result (i.e. the accordion still changes panels)?
