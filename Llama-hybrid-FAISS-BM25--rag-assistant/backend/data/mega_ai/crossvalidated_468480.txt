Bayesian Inference & Determining the Prior

I have a dataset made up of the date (YYYYMMDD) of a specific event, with the time period spanning from 1970-2015. I want to compare two time periods of 10 years each, and look at the yearly total number of events in both time periods. I'm doing a bayesian inference to determine the significance of the difference in terrorist events. I figured that the prior would be the distributions across the entire dataset, regardless of year. Does that make sense? Also, can anyone point me to good resources on how to pick distributions? I'm still learning bayesian statistics and don't quite understand when I'd pick an informative vs uninformative
