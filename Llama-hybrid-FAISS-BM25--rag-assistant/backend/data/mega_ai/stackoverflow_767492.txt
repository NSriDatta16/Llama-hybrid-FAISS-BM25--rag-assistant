You could also use: if (value instanceof Array) { alert('value is Array!'); } else { alert('Not an array'); } This seems to me a pretty elegant solution, but to each his own. Edit: As of ES5 there is now also: Array.isArray(value); But this will break on older browsers, unless you are using polyfills (basically... IE8 or similar).
