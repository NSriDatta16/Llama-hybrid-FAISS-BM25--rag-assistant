How to coordinate subversion client configuration?

As a subversion user you'll have a local configuration folder / /.subversion/ in your user home. In there is a config file containing, among others, auto-props . These properties are applied to files that you add to the repository, e.g. by svn add Now here's my question (actually two questions): How do you coordinate your development team so that they always use the same auto-props in your project? I know that there is a feature request registered at tirgis.org . But that's sheduled for svn 2.0 , so what's your intermediate solution to this issue? In case you are working on separate projects from different svn servers: How do you organize your auto-props configurations to handle different settings per server?
