which data structure is good for temporary big binary data storage?

Plan to have a data structure to store temporary binary data in the memory for analysis. The max size of the data will be about 10MB . data will be added at the end 408 bytes at a time. no search, retrieve operations on those temporary binary data. data will be wipe out and the storage will be reused for next analysis. questions: which structure is good for this purpose? byte[10MB], List (10MB), List (24000), or ...? how to quickly wipe out the data (not List.Clear(), just set the value to 0) for List or array? If I say List.Clear(), the memory for this List will shrink or the capacity (memory) of the List is still there and no memory allocation when I call List.AddRange() after the Clear()? List.Insert() will make the List larger or it just replace the existing item?
