javascript function isn't called in a XSLT document with IE

With the help of a onchange event on a drop-down menu, I make that only the paragraph relevant to a category are displayed. It works on FF and Opera, but on IE 7 and IE 8 there is no change when selecting a new option on the drop-down menu, and only the default paragraph are displayed. The javascript code does work as intended when inserted in a html document (only the wanted paragraph are displayed). XSLT Code: help center Help Center The Help Center require javascript for optimal use. first1 second2 third3 XML Input First Section first1 second2 Do first step first1 Do auxiallary step 1.5 second2 no auxilliary step needed first1 second2 Do second test. This step is important. third3 Do the first advanced step. third3 Do the second advanced step. first1 second2 third3 This is a common step. Second section first1 second2 third3 This is some &lt;foo&gt;, where &lt;bar&gt; is important. first1 second2 Foobar. third3 Barfoo.
