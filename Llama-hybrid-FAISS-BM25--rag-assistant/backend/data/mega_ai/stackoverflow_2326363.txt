How can we get the location relative to window form?

I am implementing an application which can be drag and drop images in a panel and so I want to make sure that the image is placed within the panel and it is visible the whole image when is dropped.In that case I want to get the current cursor position when I doing drag and drop event. So how can I get the cursor location related to panel? Here is the method of panel dragdrop event. private void panel1_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { Control c = e.Data.GetData(e.Data.GetFormats()[0]) as Control; if (c != null) { if (e.X 0 && e.Y 0) { c.Location = this.panel1.PointToClient((new Point(e.X, e.Y)));** this.panel1.Controls.Add(c); } } }
