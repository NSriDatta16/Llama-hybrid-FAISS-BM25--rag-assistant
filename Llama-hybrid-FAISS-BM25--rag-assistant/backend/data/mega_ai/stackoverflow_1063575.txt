Depending on what access you have to the system the task can be fairly easy. Typically you customize your mail template to include a button in the inbox folder and the all documents view (for safety precautions see this entry ). You customize ($Inbox) ($All) if you want to have the buttons only on the view level or additionaly the forms (there is a shared header subform you can use. Give the button a meaningful label and add this code: @Command([ToolsRunMacro];"(ExportDocumentsTo[yourSystemNameHere])") The round brackets are actually important. Your code (Java I presume) the goes into an agent. You select "Create Agent" and Java as language. You specify "selected documents" to run against and agent list selection as trigger (this puts the () around your name). You can can get them from the Session class. If your users are ok using a menu instead of a button you can simply select Action list as trigger and the agent will be listed in the action menu.
