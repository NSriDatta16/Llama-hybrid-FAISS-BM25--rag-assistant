Windows Azure or RackSpace Cloud?

So I have been running the numbers for Azure and RackSpace Cloud Servers and found that RackSpace is substantially cheaper, less developer investment (no custom programming), and RackSpace offers RackSpace Cloud Files if you need a substantial storage solution for your site. It almost seems too good to be true, what am I missing?
