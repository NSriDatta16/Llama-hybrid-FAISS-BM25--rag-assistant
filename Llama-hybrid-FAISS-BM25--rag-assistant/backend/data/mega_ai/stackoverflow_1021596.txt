The reality is this is too simple an example to prevaricate on. You'll choose your approach based on your existing convention -- and this example is too straightforward to make a decision on convention. What's more interesting is what to do with multiple get-out-now options and nested IF statements - it's a real grey area. So what is my convention? Ah... I am pragmatic, I don't have any rules. If it's possible to jump out the window in the first few lines, I take it, because I don't have to remember whenever I edit the code that some "unrequited function call" could still be live at any point during the function. Over time this function will be moulded and kneaded by bugs and enhancements. You are more likely to introduce a new bug with the latter approach than the former, because the quick-exit is obvious at the start, in your face, and you don't need to worry about it "forgotten" 50 lines down the function. In my bug-introducing experience, of course. This is a more tricky call if you set things up and have to tear them down as jumping out can force you to juggle 17 Schrodinger's cat states in your head when making changes.
