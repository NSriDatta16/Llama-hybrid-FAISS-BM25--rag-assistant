Conceptual limits on mtry in Random Forest algorithm

I have a random forest being applied to 7 different input variables to predict a particular classification. I've done a grid search on the hyperparameters mtry and ntree and it seems as though the algorithm is most accurate when mtry is at 6 (the highest value for mtry I allowed as a hypothetical value in my search). This finding has also been confirmed when applied to a test set. I have an intuition that mtry should always be less than the number of total variables in the model but I can't find anything that explicitly states this. My question Is there an upper limit to mtry as I think there should be? And if indeed that's the case, what would it indicate if my model gets more accurate as I approach that upper limit? Is that something to be concerned about?
