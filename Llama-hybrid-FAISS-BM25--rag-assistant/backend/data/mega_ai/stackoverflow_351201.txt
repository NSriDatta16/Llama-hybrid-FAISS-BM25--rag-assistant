If you want to retain line breaks you should replace them with something obscure as described by sindre j. In order for the line breaks to display correctly in Crystal Reports you need to replace the obscure characters in a Crystal Report formula with html breaks. Then add your formula field to the report and right-click, select 'Format Field', select the 'Paragraph' tab, and change the 'Text Interpretation' to 'HTML Text'. You also need to make sure the 'Can Grow' attribute is checked on the 'Common' tab. See the example formula below: " " + Replace({?ParameterField}, "___", " ") + " " Hope this helps.
