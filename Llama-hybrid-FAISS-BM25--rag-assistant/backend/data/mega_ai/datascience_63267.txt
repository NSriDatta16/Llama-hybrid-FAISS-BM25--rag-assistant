Sorry, but I think the statement Parametric or linear machine learning algorithms often have a high bias but a low variance. is not true. Ordinary least squares (OLS) is - under certain assumptions, i.e the Gauss-Markov-Theorem - unbiased. It is known as the „best linear unbiased estimator“ (BLUE). This property is preserved if we add non-linear parameters (e.g. polynomials) to the regression equation. So non-linearity in the data is not the issue here. Using Lasso or other things like boosting, reduces variance, but introduces bias. So I think the statement must be just the other way round. Parametric or linear machine learning algorithms often have a high variance but a low bias.
