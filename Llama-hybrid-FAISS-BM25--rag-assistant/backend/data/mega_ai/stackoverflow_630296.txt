Is there any reasonable SSDP or DIDL Lib for java/groovy/python?

For a future project I am looking for a library to handle SSDP communication and messages in DIDL-Lite xml dialect. Is there any reasonable implementation of java, groovy or python? I don't like to use implementations of existing UPnP stacks like cybergarage or the frauenhofer UPnP stack because they are highly depending on these stacks.
