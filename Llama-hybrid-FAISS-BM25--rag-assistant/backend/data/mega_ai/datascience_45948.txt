Is calculating the change automatic, or you need to do it by hand? If it is the former, can't you test simply training your CNN the $60\times 60$ img $\to x\%$ relationship? The continuous nature of $x\%$ might help the training better than a $2$ or $3$ value discrete one. But of course this depends on your data, just test it, and you'll see if it helps or not. If $x\%$ can be high, and $A$ is relatively low, you might want to cut of $x$ over a certain value, but if you do that, do it way over $A\%$ .
