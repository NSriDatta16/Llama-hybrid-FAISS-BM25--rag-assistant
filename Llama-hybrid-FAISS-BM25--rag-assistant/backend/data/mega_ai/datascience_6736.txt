Do you have any real example of Data Science reports?

I recently found this use cases on Kaggle for Data Science and Data Analytics. Data Science Use Cases However, I am curious to find examples and case studies of real reports from other professionals in some of those use cases on the link. Including hypothesis, testing, reports, conclusions (and maybe also the datasets they have used) Do you have any kind of those reports to share? I am aware of the difficulty to share this kind of details and this is why it is not a Google-search-and-find answer.
