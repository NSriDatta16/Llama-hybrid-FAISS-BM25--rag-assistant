Factors of Variation in Deep Learning

In the textbook im reading about Deep Learning, i found : When designing features or algorithms for learning features, our goal is usually to separate the factors of variation that explain the observed data [...] the factors are usually not combined by multiplication . What's the meaning of the bold phrase ? ps: what's your definition for "factors of variation" ?
