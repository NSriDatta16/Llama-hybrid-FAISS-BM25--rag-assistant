There are several papers that propose methods to adapt the Metropolis sampler in order to achieve certain optimality criterion. The most popular one consists of controlling the acceptance rate. Under certain regularity conditions of the target distribution, it has been shown that the Metropolis algorithm performs well if the acceptance rate is $\approx 0.44$ in dimension 1, and $\approx 0.234$ in higher dimensions: Weak convergence and optimal scaling of random walk Metropolis algorithms (1997). A. Gelman, W. R. Gilks, and G. O. Roberts. On the other hand, other self-adaptive algorithms that make use of running parallel chains have been developed in: A general purpose sampling algorithm for continuous distributions (the t-walk) (2010). J. Andr√©s Christen and Colin Fox Also implemented in the R package Rtwalk . There is no general criterion to make efficient the Metropolis algorithm in every single scenario, but these two algorithms work well in non-pathological scenarios and low to moderate dimensions (
