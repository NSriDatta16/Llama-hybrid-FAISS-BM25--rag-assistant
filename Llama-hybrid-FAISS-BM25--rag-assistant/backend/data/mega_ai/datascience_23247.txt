How to interpret continuous variables in a decision tree model?

After fitting a decision tree with some continuous variable, how do I interpret the effect that variable has on the target? For example I'm predicting target Y. From sklearn random forest or Xgboost I can find out that the feature X is important. How do I determine if feature X's correlation to Y is positive or negative?
