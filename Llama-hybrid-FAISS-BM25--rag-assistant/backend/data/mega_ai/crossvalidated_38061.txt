Check with a local university library. At my university there are two editions of this book. The first edition has a 1999 copyright date. And the second edition has a 2004 date. Both carry this title and author Monte Carlo statistical methods by Christian P. Robert, George Casella . Both were published by Springer. With a check with Springer they show the 2004 title and the following by the same two authors Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R by Robert, Christian, Casella, George with a 2010 copyright date.
