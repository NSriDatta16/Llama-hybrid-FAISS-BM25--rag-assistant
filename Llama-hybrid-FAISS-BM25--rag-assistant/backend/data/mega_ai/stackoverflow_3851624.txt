Maybe add intermediate QoQ with filtering only by date? Something like this (can not test, so it may need some fixes): SELECT organisationName, messageID, listSize, count(messageID)*1000/listSize as totalMsgCount FROM clusterReferrals WHERE datecreated>#refRateStartDate# GROUP BY organisationName, listSize After that update your existing queries to include select from clusterCombinedReferrals and order by totalMsgCount at first place, also drop the filtering by date as it already applied.
