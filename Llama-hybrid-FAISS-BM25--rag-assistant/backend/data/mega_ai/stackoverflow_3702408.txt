How can I write the set() method to trigger any time a child object calls it, passing in any other child object, without any modifications to outside code? Can you include code modeling what you want to do - I just want to be clear what it is you want because at the moment I suspect it simply is not allowed - no matter what you do. EDIT Classes I used to test with... package test.stack.overflow; public abstract class GrandParent { public T set(final GrandParent other) { System.out.println("GrandParent.set=" + other); return null; } } public abstract class Parent > extends GrandParent { public Parent set(final Parent other) { System.out.println("Parent.set=" + other); return other; } } public class Child_1 extends Parent { } public class Child_2 extends Parent { } public class TestPeerage { public static void main(String[] args) { Child_1 c1 = new Child_1(); c1.set(new Child_2()); c1.set(new Child_1()); Parent pc1 = new Child_1(); pc1.set(new Child_2()); pc1.set(new Child_1()); } }
