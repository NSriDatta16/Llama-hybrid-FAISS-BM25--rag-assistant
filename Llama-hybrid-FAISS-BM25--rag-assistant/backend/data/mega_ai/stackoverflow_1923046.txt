Multi User Password Manager Security Strategy

I am considering creating my own web based, multi user password management software. The basic question that comes up is, what strategy will I use for secure storage and retrieval of passwords? Obviously, I don't want to store information in clear text. Should I encrypt/decrypt on the database server, web server, client (javascript), or everywhere? Where will encryption keys live? Should I use a master password (pre shared key) for encryption/decryption? Are there other questions that I should be asking myself? I appreciate any suggestions.
