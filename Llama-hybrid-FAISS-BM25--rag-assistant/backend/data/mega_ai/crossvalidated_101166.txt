The $C$ parameter for most SVM implementations scales approximately linearly with the number of training patterns, so if you train with a subset, you will need to multiply $C$ by a factor of $N_s/N_t$ where $N_t$ is the number of training patterns and $N_s$ is the subset size for the parameter optimization. This is only an approximation though, so it may not give as good an estimate as performing model selection with the full training set.
