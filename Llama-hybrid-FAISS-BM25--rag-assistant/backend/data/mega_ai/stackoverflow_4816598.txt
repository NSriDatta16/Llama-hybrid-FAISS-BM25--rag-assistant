I added the following line to the code before LWP::UserAgent->new and it seems to be working for me (in linux). $r->uri("http://" . $r->header('Host') . "/" . $r->uri()); The uri that you got from the HTTP::Request object from the original request does not have the hostname. So added it to make it a absolute uri. Tested as follows: $ curl -D - -o /dev/null -s -H 'Host: www.yahoo.com' http://localhost:8080/ HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Thu, 27 Jan 2011 12:59:56 GMT Server: libwww-perl-daemon/5.827 Cache-Control: private Connection: close Date: Thu, 27 Jan 2011 12:57:15 GMT Age: 0 ---snip-- UPDATE: Looks like I was completely wrong. I didnt need to make the change to URI object. Your original code worked for me as it is in Linux
