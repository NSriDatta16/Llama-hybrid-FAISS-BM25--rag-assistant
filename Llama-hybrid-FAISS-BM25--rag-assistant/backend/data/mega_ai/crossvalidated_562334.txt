I guess your model is overfitting (validation performance is worse than training) and it's probably because of one/all of the following: The huge number of parameters (dense architecture) with -I assume- no regularization; The distribution/diversity of your data (your gaussian distributions are all centered?); The loss metric MSE is averaging over the number of pixels (10.000) even though most pixels are zeroed; I would suggest starting from the bottom and using an asymmetric loss where the cost of predicting zero when it should be non-zero is different from the cost of predicting non-zero when it should be zero or using a weighted loss where you give more weight to the error on non-zero pixels.
