Trying to cast up/down the inheritance chain is generally just plain wrong. If you are doing this, then you are most likely not using inheritance and polymorphism correctly. If you are finding that you need to upcast or downcast then odds are good that you have a flawed class design. As has been mentioned other answers, the way to go about this sort of thing is to have all the methods that you need defined in the base class. If a derived class doesn't support the method, then have it either be a no-op or have it return an error.
