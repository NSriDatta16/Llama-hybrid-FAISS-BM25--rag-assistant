I have a fair bit of experience using Amazon S3 for file storage for a website and you'll definitely want to go the database route. S3 is way to slow to query all the time and as you mentioned you'll have the additional costs(albeit small). The speed becomes even more and more of an issue, the more files you have stored in a bucket as listObjects() only returns 1000 at a time. The performance issues are easy to see simply by using any of the S3 tools(eg Bucket Explorer , Cloudberry , or even Amazons own tools ) to browse a bucket with lots of files. The extra effort required to ensure your database stays in sync with S3 is well worth it.
