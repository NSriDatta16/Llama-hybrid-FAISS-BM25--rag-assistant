How to Use Array.Exists with the Multi-dimensional string array

I have a multi-dim string array something like this:- string[,] names = new string[2, 2] { {"Rosy",""}, {"Peter","Albert"} }; Now i want to check the existence if the second index (Albert) holding the string is non-empty in the whole array. I just to check the existence of the non-empty string value in the second index. I was thinking of using the Array.Exists. If there is any other better way, please share. Thanks
