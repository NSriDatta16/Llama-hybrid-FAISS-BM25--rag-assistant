htaccess trouble

I have this .htaccess file, which is not working, when I navegate to gotgage.local/category/gages/ the gages portion of this is not being passed RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^/category/(.*?)/$ category.php?p=$1 [rn] For the sake of testing the category.php file is just dumping $_POST, $_GET and $_SERVER this is what I am seeing when I open the page. GET Array ( ) POST Array ( ) SERVER Array ( [HTTP_USER_AGENT] => Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/1.0.154.59 Safari/525.19 [HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING] => gzip,deflate,bzip2,sdch [HTTP_ACCEPT] => text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 [HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL] => max-age=0 [HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE] => en-US,en [HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET] => ISO-8859-1,*,utf-8 [HTTP_HOST] => gotgage.local [HTTP_CONNECTION] => Keep-Alive [PATH] => /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin [SERVER_SIGNATURE] => Apache/2.2.9 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.2.6-2ubuntu4.2 with Suhosin-Patch Server at gotgage.local Port 80 [SERVER_SOFTWARE] => Apache/2.2.9 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.2.6-2ubuntu4.2 with Suhosin-Patch [SERVER_NAME] => gotgage.local [SERVER_ADDR] => 192.168.0.180 [SERVER_PORT] => 80 [REMOTE_ADDR] => 192.168.0.196 [DOCUMENT_ROOT] => /home/gotgage/www/ [SERVER_ADMIN] => [no address given] [SCRIPT_FILENAME] => /home/gotgage/www/category.php [REMOTE_PORT] => 56793 [GATEWAY_INTERFACE] => CGI/1.1 [SERVER_PROTOCOL] => HTTP/1.1 [REQUEST_METHOD] => GET [QUERY_STRING] => [REQUEST_URI] => /category/gages/ [SCRIPT_NAME] => /category.php [PATH_INFO] => /gages/ [PATH_TRANSLATED] => /home/gotgage/www/gages/ [PHP_SELF] => /category.php/gages/ [REQUEST_TIME] => 1241579116 [argv] => Array ( ) [argc] => 0 ) Technically the redirect is working however I am not getting the vars the page below that is dumping is the correct from the correct page but my vars are not being passed.
