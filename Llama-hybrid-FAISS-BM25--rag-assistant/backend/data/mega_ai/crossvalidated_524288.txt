When non stationarity is a problem?

So in the literature one can find many times that ML works on the assumption that data distributions are stationary. Now I can do multiple tests on my dataset to show the violation on the non stationarity. Many of the papers I find include time series analysis that is not my goal. I want to use my input features without any notion of time to predict a value. The best way to explain it is that I have features about houses and I want to predict the houses possible selling value. Some of those features, like criminal rate, are non stationary. The question is then, do I still need to care about that dataset is non stationary since I am not predicting prices over time just the "instantaneous" price of the property if it was sold in the next dt. When do you care for non stationarity when you do not work with time series problems? Regards, Alex
