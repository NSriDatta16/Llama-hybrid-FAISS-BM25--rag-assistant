You can't put variables in an embedding since it's an instruction for the compiler, not a runtime resolution. Now, you can either create as many variables as smileys you have and then have N static embeddings create your own skin for a button which accepts an Image or a Loader and load dynamically the image inside the button preload an swf with all your images and use emoticon.setStyle("icon", getDefinitionByName(smileys[x][0])) where smileys[x][0] is the linkage name of the smiley in the Flash library.
