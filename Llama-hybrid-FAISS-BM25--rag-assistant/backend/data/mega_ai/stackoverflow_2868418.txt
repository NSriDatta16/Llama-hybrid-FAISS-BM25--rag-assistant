How to import classes into other classes within the same file in Python

I have the file below and it is part of a django project called projectmanager, this file is projectmanager/projects/models.py . Whenever I use the python interpreter to import a Project just to test the functionality i get a name error for line 8 that FileRepo() cannot be found. How Can I import these classes correctly? Ideally what I am looking for is each Project to contain multiple FileRepos which each contain and unknown number of files. Thanks for any assistance in advance. #imports from django.db import models from django.contrib import admin #Project is responsible for ensuring that each project contains all of the folders and file storage #mechanisms a project needs, as well as a unique CCL# class Project(models.Model): ccl = models.CharField(max_length=30) Techpacks = FileRepo() COAS = FileRepo() Shippingdocs = FileRepo() POchemspecs = FileRepo() Internalpos = FileRepo() Finalreports = FileRepo() Batchrecords = FileRepo() RFPS = FileRepo() Businessdev = FileRepo() QA = FileRepo() Updates = FileRepo() def __unicode__(self): return self.ccl #ProjectFile is the file object used by each FileRepo component class ProjectFile(models.Model): file = models.FileField(uploadto='ProjectFiles') def __unicode__(self): return self.file #FileRepo is the model for the "folders" to be used in a Project class FileRepo(models.Model): typeOf = models.CharField(max_length=30) files = models.ManyToManyField(ProjectFile) def __unicode__(self): return self.typeOf
