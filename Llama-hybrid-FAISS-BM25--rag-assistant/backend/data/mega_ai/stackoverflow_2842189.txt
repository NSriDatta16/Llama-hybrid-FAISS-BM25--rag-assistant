Good embedded database solution (like SQLite) for .Net

I am looking for file based storage solutions that I can use with a .Net project. THey need to have a sql-like interface for storing and retrieving data. They need to have relatively little overhead and must not require any additional components installed by the end user. I am hopping for a .dll that I can reference and use. Cool points awarded if it is closely tied to an ORM. My current favourite is SQLite, are there any better ones out there that I should know about? I have a (health?) bias against access because I feel it is overcomplicated for what I need, I am open to being convinced otherwise though. PS: "No, there is nothing better than SQLite" is a perfectly good answer.
