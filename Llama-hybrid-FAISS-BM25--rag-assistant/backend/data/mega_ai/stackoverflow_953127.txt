What is the standard way to organize iPhone MVC code in XCode?

I have an iPhone application that contains several views and their associated controllers. Looking at sample code, I've seen different different ways to organize these files - either have all of the views grouped, then all of the controllers grouped, or group the views and controllers by functionality. Option 1 - Views and controllers grouped separately -Views | - EditItemView.h - EditItemView.m - AddItemView.h - AddItemView.m -Controllers | - EditItemViewController.h - EditItemViewController.m - AddItemViewController.h - AddItemViewController.m Option 2 - Items grouped by functionality -AddItem | - AddItemViewController.h - AddItemViewController.m - AddItemView.h - AddItemView.m -EditItem | - EditItemViewController.h - EditItemViewController.m - EditItemView.h - EditItemView.m Option 1 seems to make more sense from a MVC standpoint - the code is grouped together, but I'm wondering as the app grows to 10+ views and controllers, is that the most logical and maintainable? Is there a best practice recommendation around this? Currently, I will be the only one maintaining the app, but whether or not there will be multiple developers, I want to use best practices as much as possible. Are there published standards on this?
