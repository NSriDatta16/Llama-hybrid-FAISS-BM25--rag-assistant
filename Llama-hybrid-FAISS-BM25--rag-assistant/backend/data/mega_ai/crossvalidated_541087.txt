Variation partitioning using a large matrix as a predictor

I'm trying to understand the amount of variance explained in a univariate response using multiple community matrices as predictors. The problem is set up as such: I have the measured rate of a process occurring in soil (response variable, n = 28), and I have matrices of community composition of both plants and bacteria, which are in separate matrices. The bacteria matrix has thousands of columns, each representing a unique taxon of bacteria. These community composition matrices are meant to be predictors. I'm attempting this in R, using the varpart() function from the vegan package. I'm running into issues of collinearity when I include the bacteria matrix. When I run the code, I get messages like: "collinearity detected in X2: mm = 9642, m = 27". And when I view the results, it includes this warning: "collinearity detected: redundant variable(s) between tables X1, X2 results are probably incorrect: remove redundant variable(s) and repeat the analysis collinearity detected". I tried making a correlation matrix and removing all variables that are highly correlated to other variables, but it didn't really get rid of the problem. One thing I've tried that removes this problem is to do Principal Components Analysis on the bacterial matrix, and use PCA scores for each data point as a predictive matrix instead of the data itself. This actually gives me an interpretable result. But I have no idea if this approach is valid. What are your thoughts? Is this a huge mess? I'm pretty new to all these multivariate methods, so any help would be appreciated.
