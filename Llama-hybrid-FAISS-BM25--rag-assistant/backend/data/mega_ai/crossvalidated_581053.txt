Are there any neural network architectures that perform multiple forward passes?

Across a many types of networks (simple feedforward, ResNets, RNNs, transformers, etc.) the model's output or prediction is produced by performing a single forward pass per input. Are there examples of network architectures that permit multiple forward passes per input?
