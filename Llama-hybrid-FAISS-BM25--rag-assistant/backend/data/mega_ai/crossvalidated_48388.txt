For the SVM algorthm you can look at that paper "Probabilistic Outputs for Support Vector Machines and Comparisons to Regularized Likelihood Methods " and others works derived by this one. The algorithm is implemented also in the libsvm library. I disagree with the fact that the distance from the margin proportional probability is a good estimator, because an example could be distant from the margin and at the same time distant from the class distribution.
