Pass collection of enums to ASP.NET MVC ActionMethod

Is there a way to pass a collection of Enums to an ActionMethod (on a GET) automatically? For example, if I have the following enum definition: enum DaysEnum {Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri}; and, I have an ActionMethod definition of: ActionResult SampleActionMethod ( List days) Is there a way I could render, in a View, a URL that would pass in a collection of DayEnums. Something like: var someDays = new List {DaysEnum.Sat, DaysEnum.Sun, DaysEnum.Mon}; Url.Route(new { days = someDays, controller="whatever", action="SampleActionMethod"}); The default model binder doesn't seem to support this, since I'm currently getting the following rendered: http://.../System.Collections.Generic.List`1[DaysEnum] I know I can do this by manually flattening the collection to, say, a dash-deliniated string, and then recreate the collection in the ActionMethod, but I was looking at something more elegant. Various blog posts talk about passing in collections, but that is more about when doing POSTS.
