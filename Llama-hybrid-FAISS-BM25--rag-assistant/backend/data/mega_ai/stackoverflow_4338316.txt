Assuming a browser obeys the specification , it will simply ignore the *zoom property: User agents must ignore a declaration with an unknown property. For example, if the style sheet is: h1 { color: red; rotation: 70minutes } the user agent will treat this as if the style sheet had been h1 { color: red } As for what happens if such a browser finds an empty declaration block, I don't know. I haven't seen the scenario mentioned in the spec, so I would guess it's an implementation detail and it'd differ browser by browser.
