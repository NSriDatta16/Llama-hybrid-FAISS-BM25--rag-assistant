Since you have differences, this means that the data is time series and we can write $$Y_t=Y_0+\sum_{s=1}^t\Delta Y_s$$ So if the true model is $$\Delta Y_t=\alpha+\beta \Delta X_t$$ we have $$Y_t=Y_0+\sum_{s=1}^t(\alpha+\beta \Delta X_t)=Y_0-\beta X_0+\alpha t+\beta X_t$$ So you can say that interpretation remains the same as in model with levels.
