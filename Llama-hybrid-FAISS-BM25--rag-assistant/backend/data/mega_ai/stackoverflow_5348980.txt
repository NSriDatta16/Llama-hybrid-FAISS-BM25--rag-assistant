pipe delimited text to xml conversion

I have a text file which I need to convert into xml. The very first line of the text contains heading which would go as a xml tags.Each of other lines will go as value of xml tags. Example input ( ABC.txt ): ID|Name|Subject|Marks 12|Sam|PHY,MATH|60 13|Gan|CHY|70 25|Rane|PHY|78 This would be converted into Output.xml : 12 Sam PHY,MATH 60 13 Gan CHY 70 25 Rane PHY 78 Is there any module exists to achieve the same like XML::CSV? Thanks, Man
