The licensing is as follows: Castle Project: Apache License ANTLR 3: BSD License Fluent NHibernate: BSD License Iesi: Here (do anything you want with it) Log4net: Apache License NHibernate GNU Lesser General Public License The Apache and BSD licenses are permissive. Basically, just make sure you include the license itself, and don't remove the copyright notices, and you'll be fine. The LGPL adds the condition that it has to be possible to link your application against a newer version of the library, which applies to virtually every .NET app - you'd have to make a conscious effort to violate this. As far as I know, those are the only restrictions you need to worry about. There's no copyleft GPL restrictions on any of those libraries, they're all free for commercial use. Disclaimer: I Am Not A Lawyer either. The last two paragraphs reflect my best understanding of the actual text of the applicable licenses. If you work for a publicly-traded company or are seriously worried about being sued, consult an actual lawyer.
