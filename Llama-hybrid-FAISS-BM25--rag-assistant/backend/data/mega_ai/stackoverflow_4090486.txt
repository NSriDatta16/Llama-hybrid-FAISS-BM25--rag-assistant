First of all, note that the right content-type for xhtml is not xhtml or text/xhtml , but application/xhtml+xml . Anyway, you'll need to check whether the user agent can actually accept this content-type by examining the Accept HTTP request header. According to the W3C recommendation : If the Accept header explicitly contains application/xhtml+xml (with either no "q" parameter or a positive "q" value) deliver the document using that media type. If the Accept header explicitly contains text/html (with either no "q" parameter or a positive "q" value) deliver the document using that media type. If the accept header contains " / " (a convention some user agents use to indicate that they will accept anything), deliver the document using text/html .
