Authorize and then Capture programmatically using Authorize.Net in Magento

Can anyone help me in getting the Authorization and the Capture steps (code) using Authorize.Net? It seems that everyone knows how to use both at the same time, however, there is no explanation as how we can do that into spearate steps, the Authorize first and the Capture after that (using a trasactionID).
