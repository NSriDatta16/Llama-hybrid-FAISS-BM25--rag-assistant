A sample could be more accurate than a (attempted) census if the fact of the exercise being a census increases the bias from non-sampling error. This could come about, for example, if the census generates an adverse political campaign advocating non-response (something less likely to happen to a sample). Unless this happens, I can't see why a sample would be expected to have less nonsampling error than a census; and by definition it will have more sampling error. So apart from quite unusual circumstances I would say a census is going to be more accurate than a sample. Consider a common source of nonsampling error - systematic non-response eg by a particular socio demographic group. If people from group X are likely to refuse the census, they are just as likely to refuse the sample. Even with poststratification sampling to weight up the responses of those people from group X who you do persuade to answer your questions, you still have a problem because those might be the very segment of X that are pro-surveys. There is no real way around this problem other than to be as careful as possible with your design of instrument and delivery method. In passing, this does draw attention to one possible issue that could make an attempted census less accurate than a sample. Samples routinely have poststratification weighting to population, which mitigates bias problems from issues such as that in my paragraph above. An attempted census that doesn't get 100% return is just a large sample, and should in principle be subject to the same processing; but because it is seen as a "census" (rather than an attempted census) this may be neglected. So that census might be less accurate than the appropriately weighted sample. But in this case the problem is the analytical processing technique (or omission of), not something intrinsic to it being an attempted census. Efficient is another matter - as Michelle says, a well conducted sample will be more efficient than a census, and it may well have sufficient accuracy for practical purposes.
