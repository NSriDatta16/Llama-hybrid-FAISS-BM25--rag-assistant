Average of noisy samples

I am not a statistician so I hope my question is not trivial. I have a set of $n$ samples affected by Gaussian noise with mean 0. I need to estimate the average of the samples, without the noise. Is there a better estimation then the sample mean itself? I was hoping that the noise would cancel itself in the mean since it has mean 0, but it does not happen.
