How to interpret forestplot with pymc on standard devisions of two groups

I'm using pyMC3 to do Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test (BEST) and I was wondering how to actually interpret this result. I see both groups have significantly different stds because the bar plot doesn't cross over zero. But why am I having negative std? I thought it's impossible to get negative std given the std formula. How do you actually interpret this result? I followed this example to do BEST in pyMC3. Thanks!
