As a very general rule, the proper treatment of outliers depend on the analysis purpose - if you're looking for large-scale tendencies, they often better be removed, but sometimes your goal might be actually finding the non-typical data points. Now, going into details... PCA is a method based on correlation/covariance matrix, which can be - at least in theory - very sensitive to outliers. One way to get around this problem is to use a robust correlation matrix - see e.g. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/robust/robust.pdf or, if you use Matlab, maybe https://sourceforge.net/projects/robustcorrtool/ will be better. Clustering can also serve as a outlier detection technique, but if you want to identify a few groups of similar points in the dataset, I'd suggest removing the outliers since - again - they can affect the workings of some clustering algorithms (like k-means, which is based on within-cluster variance) and make the results harder to interpret. We usually like the elements of a cluster to be rather homogeneous, and the very definition of outlier contradicts similarity to other cluster members... EDIT: sorry for not making myself clear - if you base PCA on robust covariance, there's no need to remove anything. When using 'ordinary' correlation, you might compare the results with and without outliers and see if they make any real difference.
