Without knowing why you want to normalize these distributions, let me assume you want to normalize them with respect to a representative central tendency and dispersion, perhaps to compare their spread, or to compensate for a bias in measurement. Let us suppose that they could be globally unimodal, not too skewed. If not, normalization could be hopeless. A larger standard deviation with respect to the mean, and a large gap between the upper quartile and the max : 75% 3994.000000 ; max 24449.000000 may suggests potential outliers of the right side of the distributions. So with the figures you have, you could center them with respect to the median at 50% , and divide by the interquartile range 75% $-$ 25% . Thus you will get two $0$-median and unit-interquartile range data. More fancy stuff could be performed afterward. EDIT: following your comment "put them in a single time series", one interpretation is that you have two sets of measurements, from potentially uncalibrated sensors. I feel risky to merge them according to their extremal values (could be saturation, outliers). Instead, normalizing them wrt to a "majority" of samples could be sounder. EDIT2: Keeping with the majority argument. As the first series is three times bigger, you may want to map the values of the 2nd series to the first one. Call $m_1$, $m_2$, $d_1$, $d_2$ their central tendencies and dispersions (e.g. median and interquartile range). Then, for any value $x_{\left(2\right)}$ in the second set, do $(x_{\left(2\right)}-m_2+m_1)\frac{d_1}{d_2}$.
