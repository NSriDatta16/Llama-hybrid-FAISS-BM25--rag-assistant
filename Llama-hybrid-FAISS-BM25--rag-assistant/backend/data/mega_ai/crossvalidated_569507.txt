How you interpret the model's predictions depend on the model and the data. Some losses take the form of a conditional expectation, but not all losses. Quantile regression estimates a conditional quantile (e.g. conditional median) instead of the conditional mean. Not all neural networks use loss functions that are based in probability. An example that I've worked with is the triplet-loss network, which seeks to map data in the same class to a vector representation that is far away from the vector representations of all other classes. Neural networks are not unique in being unrelated to probability. SVMs are not directly related to a probability model. Instead, the model training is motivated by optimizing a separating hyperplane. (But sometimes researchers will transform the signed distance from the hyperplane to a probability -- but this is not innately connected to training an SVM.)
