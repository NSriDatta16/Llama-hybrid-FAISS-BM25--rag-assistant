To enable precise filtering, I think you should reconsider structuring the lines into "columns", at least under the hood. For an intuitive UI showing these columns seems right to me, too. For the coloring this should not make a difference. Copying rows from grids should be easy to achieve, as soon as you have some multi-row-selection available, transforming records back to "raw" text-lines in some ToString-method should be much easier than the other way around. Therefore, I think you should really go with some grid-approach. If it shall be Xceed, infragistics, other vendors or the built-in .NET-datagrid... that's a different question.
