Predictive distributions for data from common distributions

I have data that I assume comes from some distribution, such as normal. I don't care about estimating the parameters of this distribution. Instead, I'd like to know the distribution that future observations will follow. I think this is called a "predictive distribution". When I look it up, people write about Bayesian inference. I am not asking about Bayesian specifically, though nothing against it either. I would think this is something that frequentists use as well. What is the usual frequentist practice? Do they just pretend that the predictive distribution is the same as the original distribution with parameters set equal to the best point estimates? I'm looking for an easy set of formulas: if the data are assumed to be from this distribution (especially normal), then this is the predictive distribution, and here is how to calculate its parameters. I'm not looking for proofs. Is there an R package for this?
