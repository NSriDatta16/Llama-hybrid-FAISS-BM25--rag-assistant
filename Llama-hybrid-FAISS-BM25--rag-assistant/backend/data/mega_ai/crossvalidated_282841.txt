It doesn't help to use the term 'prior' here unless you are using an explicitly Bayesian method. Logistic regression estimates a model for binary (usually, there are variations for more categories) dependent variables. As part of this, it estimates a probability that an observation is in one of the two categories, p. Let's suppose that is category 1 of 1 or 2. The probability that it is in the other category is 1-p = q. Then, if the estimated p is greater than 1/2, the better category to estimate is category 1. If p is less than 1/2, it is better to predict category 2. If your proportion of category 1 is small, then very few estimates of p are likely to be greater than 1/2, possibly none. In this case, it is better to estimate category 1 for the very few or no observations with p > 1/2. You might lust to choose category 1 for some of the observations, probably those with the biggest estimated values of p, even if they are 1/10 or 1/5. If you do, then the probability is high that you just chose the wrong category. If you were betting on these outcomes, you would just make a lot of losing bets. Resist this lust with all your might. It will gain you nothing. So, yes, the estimates from logistic regression do depend on the frequencies of the dependent variable categories. The average value of p equals the proportion of 1's, as I have described them. So, what should you do? Go ahead, ignore your results, pick any category you want for each observation? Sure, just ignore your estimates; why bother doing the regression in the first place? This happens all the time with certain kinds of outcomes, such as patient deaths, graft failures, readmissions, etc. For many kinds of outcomes, the predicted category just isn't a very useful piece of information, except for certain evaluations of the fit of the model. I might add that the se's of the estimated coefficients depend on the proportions of y for a fixed sample size. If observations are difficult to make, requiring a lot of interviewing, lab tests, or digging up old records, you might choose to collect data on equal samples of 1's and 2's. If 1's are harder to come by, you might choose to collect more 2's than 1's, the usual rule of thumb being up to about 5 times as many. If you do this, you will get correct estimates of coefficients but not the intercept. You might want to modify your intercept somewhat arbitrarily or use a prior to get more accurate estimates of the probabilities.
