handle touchesBegan method for UITextField in UIScrollView

I have a situation here, I have to handle touchesBegan for textfield. This textfield is in scrollview. I tried this so far: I made a subclass of UIScrollView @interface CustomScrollView : UIScrollView { } @end @implementation CustomScrollView -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"good"); } @end Here, I can get the desired result. Same thing I implemented with textfields. I made a subclass of UITextField : @interface CustomTextField : UITextField { } @end @implementation CustomTextField -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"good"); } @end This works fine if the text field is inside a normal view, but it fails when the text field is inside a regular scrollView or my custom scrollview. Please enlighten me on this (I am doing this to attain something like this when user long presses a textfield the text in textfield is assigned from Textfield to a label and user can drag this label to some other place in the view )
