How can I use inputs of lower frequencies to predict an output of higher frequency?

I would like to use a NARX or a LSTM to use different type of data at different frequencies -for instance weekly, monthly and quarterly- to predict data sampled at a higher frequency -in my case, daily data- The problem is that, for instance using a LSTM or another Recurrent Neural Network I do not now how to 'align' the input vectors to the output vectors, for instance if the input vector has two elements, one that comes from data that exists on fridays and another that is monthly at the first friday of the month, then I have for the first friday of the month: Input vector: [weekly_data 1 ,monthly_data] Output vector: [daily_data first friday ] But for the second friday of the month I have: Input vector: [weekly_data 2 , ? ] Output vector: [daily_data second friday ] And for any other day, for instance wednesday I have: Input vector: [ ? , ? ] Output vector: [daily_data wednesday k ] The question would be, how to fill the ? ie the missing values in the input vectors due to the different frequencies of input and output data? Or do I have to take another approach?
