standard deviation of the time-series

i am interested in measuring the volatility of a variable in the financial statements. previous studies measured it using the rolling standard deviation of the item that i am interested in measuring it divided by average total assets over the last four quarters. i don't understand how to calculate this measure. Also, in some articles they use quarters while in others they use years, my question is how can i choose the right period(quarters, years). Another question: what is meant by the standard deviation of a time series. could anyone please help? Thanks
