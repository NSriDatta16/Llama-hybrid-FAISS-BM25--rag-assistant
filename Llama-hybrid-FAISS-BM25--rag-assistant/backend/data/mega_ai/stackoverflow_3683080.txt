ANTLR can surely be used for this. However, if you're new to ANTLR or parser-generators in general, I don't think I can give a short explanation of how to do this exactly. I recommend you try some simple things with ANTLR and browse through The Definitive ANTLR Reference . It even has a paragraph about this type of problem which is similar to parsing Python code. See Chapter 4.3 Rules , paragraph Emitting More Than One Token per Lexer Rule for details.
