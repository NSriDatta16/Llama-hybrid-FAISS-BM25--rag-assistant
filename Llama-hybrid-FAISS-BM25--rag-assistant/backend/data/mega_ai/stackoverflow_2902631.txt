Focus on supporting the non-technical users. With Java you have a powerful tool to parse even the weirdest data sources ;) Assuming, the relations are strict one-to-many, I suggest the following approach: (1) create four spreadsheets for origanisation, department, manager and employee. Those spreadsheets reflect the database tables (2) create a fifth spreadsheet to represent the relations, like: |A |B |C |D | -+-----+-----+-----+-----+ 1| emp | mgr | dep | org | -+-----+-----+-----+-----+ 2| v| v| v| v| -+-----+-----+-----+-----+ 3| v| v| v| v| -+-----+-----+-----+-----+ the 'v' letters just represent combo boxes where the user can select organisations, etc. The values come from the other spreadsheets, the cells will store the id and display the readable name. Edit For clarifiction - each row represents a data set for an employee. I changed the order of the columns to make it clearer. First enter all entities (organisations, departments, ...) in the four sheets, then use the combo boxes to choose an employee, his/her manager, the department and the organisation. To me it's pretty intuitive and easy. excel supports those types of combo boxes where the values come from a spreadsheet.
