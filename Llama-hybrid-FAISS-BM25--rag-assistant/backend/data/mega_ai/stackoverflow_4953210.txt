SWFObject is not a media player, it is simply a method for embedding SWF files into your HTML document. You'll need to use a Flash SWF file that's capable of playing your media files, then embed that SWF into your HTML document using SWFObject. SoundManager2 is a great (and free) method for playing MP3 and AAC files via HTML5 with a Flash-based fallback.
