Apart from the syntax problems that jonearles already described: Unless you are just playing around with triggers (or this is some kind of homework), this is not a very good design. One rule in relational databases is that you should not store information that can be derived from existing data. You can easily select the class_code during a select, there is no need to store it: SELECT seat_no, CASE WHEN seat_no > 50 THEN 'high' ELSE 'low' END as class_code FROM seat; With Oracle 11 you can even define a virtual column that will do the "computation" automatically during retrieval, otherwise you could define a view that will return that information.
