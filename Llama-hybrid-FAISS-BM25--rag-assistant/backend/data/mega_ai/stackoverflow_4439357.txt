Here's sort of compromise, if you want to keep the indentation as it is: boolean valid = true; // optimistic start if (!valid || !condition1) valid = false; if (!valid || !condition2) valid = false; if (!valid || !condition3) valid = false; if (valid) doSomething(); The !valid in the first if statement is superflucious but doesn't harm, could be kept for readability. else/if is more elegant, to my opinion, but that's just an opinion. But I really wouldn't (ab-)use the for loop and I never ever would find a cheap way to implement a pseudo-goto. There's always a better solution.
