I don't think that it tracks when you close the browser or navigates away, and even if it does, that doesn't work in 100% of the cases. My guess is that they estimate the stay at the exit page, perhaps based on the previous pages or an average for that page for all visitors. If you get three page hits in a few minutes, you have an exact viewing time for the first two pages, but you never know how long the third page is viewed. Perhaps you close the page right away, or leave it open and read it later. It's statistics, so in the long run it's usually rather accurate, but it's never really the truth. ;)
