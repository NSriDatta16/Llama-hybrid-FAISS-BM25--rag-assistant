How do I forecast quarterly public expenses based on annual budgets and potentially other variables?

I have some time series data from 2008 and forward (see below) on quarterly public expenses and annual public budgets. I would like to forecast the last two quarters of 2018 as precisely as possible, but I am unsure about what methods I should use. I have been considering a vector autoregressive model, but there is an issue with different frequencies on the data. I guess I could split the budget into 4 equal parts. I have also considered computing the deviation between the two series and then use a univariate model instead, but that would rule out adding additional explaining variables such as demography. If possible I would like some suggestions on what type of models I should look into. I am not an expert in times series analysis and especially not the multivariate ones, but I hope it is possible. I hope you can help. Thank you! +------------+-----------------+ | Date | Expenses | +------------+-----------------+ | 2008-01-01 | 66.386.086.765 | | ... | ... | | 2016-01-01 | 78.200.910.570 | | 2016-04-01 | 167.604.150.482 | | 2016-07-01 | 251.017.792.801 | | 2016-10-01 | 337.595.471.006 | | 2017-01-01 | 77.580.707.994 | | 2017-04-01 | 166.599.846.864 | | 2017-07-01 | 251.331.721.551 | | 2017-10-01 | 337.247.375.085 | | 2018-01-01 | 76.467.286.000 | | 2018-04-01 | 166.634.900.000 | | 2018-07-01 | ? | | 2018-10-01 | ? | +------------+-----------------+ +------+-----------------+ | Date | Budget | +------+-----------------+ | 2008 | 295.130.222.937 | | ... | ... | | 2016 | 348.210.251.795 | | 2017 | 346.244.633.739 | | 2018 | 346.127.455.000 | +------+-----------------+
