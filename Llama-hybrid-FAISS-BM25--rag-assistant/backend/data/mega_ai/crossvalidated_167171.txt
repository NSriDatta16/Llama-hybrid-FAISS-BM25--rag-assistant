How to interpret meaning of regressors in this logistic regression model?

I'm trying to understand the model in this paper where they treat the item response theory model as a form of logistic regression. In the model the probability of getting an item (question) correct is given by $$ P = \frac{1}{1+e^{-Z}} $$ where $$ Z = \theta X = \sum_k \theta_k X_k. $$ $\theta$ describes the students' abilities, and $X$ describes the difficulty of the items. What I don't understand at the moment is how to interpret the idea of regression, when there doesn't seem to be any data associated with the independent variables. There's only the binary outcome of correctly or incorrectly answering a question. The authors associate an interpretation to the variables $\theta$ and $X$, but how is that guaranteed to be the outcome of the regression since the expression is symmetric? If there happened to be the same number of students as items could we be sure of the interpretation of our results?
