I can confirm the same behaviour with g++ 4.4.0 under Windows 7, so it's not in the compiler. In fact, the program fails when getIterations() returns 3590 or more -- do you get the same cutoff? This looks like a bug in Windows system memory allocation. It's all very well for knowledgeable souls to talk about memory fragmentation, but everything got deleted here, so the observed behaviour definitely shouldn't happen.
