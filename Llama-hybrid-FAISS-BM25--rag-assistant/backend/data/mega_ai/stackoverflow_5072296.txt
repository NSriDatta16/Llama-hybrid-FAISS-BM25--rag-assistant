Take a look at HorizontalPager . It's actually based on RealViewSwitcher , which in turn is based on the Android homescreen's code, and supports snap-to paging with drag feedback, as well as nested vertically-scrolling subviews. Gesture support for fast swipes isn't all it should be, but this may get you part of the way there (and I'd welcome contributions back). EDIT: As of 2012 you're much better off using Google's ViewPager - it's in the compat library.
