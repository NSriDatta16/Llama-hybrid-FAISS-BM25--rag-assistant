Another solution similar to creating a proxy class just for serialization would be using the [NonSerialized()] attribute. IdType could be non-serializable and another serializable string property could be implemented as a proxy (which would - on get or set - assign to / read from the IdType). The solution could even look elegant with the use of aspect-oriented programming.
