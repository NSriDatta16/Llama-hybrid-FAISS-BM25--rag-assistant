One method that is helpful to is to visualize the center point of the data, the mean, and how much each raw data point's distance varies along that mean. One way of achieving this is simply drawing lines that start from where the mean is (where the data on average is centrally located) and finishing those lines where the raw value is. I show how using R below. First we can load the tidyverse package for plotting, then create some x values and an index (for the order of raw data points). Then we plot the data on a scatterplot that draws segments from the mean to the raw data points. #### Load Library #### library(tidyverse) #### Create X Value and Index #### x % ggplot(aes(x=Index, y=X))+ geom_point()+ geom_segment(aes(xend = Index, yend = mean(x)))+ geom_hline(yintercept = mean(x), color = "red")+ theme_classic()+ scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) Which you can see below: We can see that the fluctuation in distance for each data point here is not the same. Some are very close to the mean ( $x = 30$ ), while others are quite far from the mean ( $x = 10$ and $x = 50$ ). Something you could also consider is drawing grid lines where each standard deviation below/above the mean is located to get a sense of where the bulk of the data should be contained within this variation. #### Add SD Lines #### df %>% ggplot(aes(x=Index, y=X))+ geom_point()+ geom_segment(aes(xend = Index, yend = mean(x)))+ geom_hline(yintercept = mean(x), color = "red", size=1)+ geom_hline(yintercept = mean(x) - 1*sd(x), color = "blue", linetype = "dashed")+ geom_hline(yintercept = mean(x) + 1*sd(x), color = "blue", linetype = "dashed")+ geom_hline(yintercept = mean(x) - 2*sd(x), color = "blue", linetype = "dashed")+ geom_hline(yintercept = mean(x) + 2*sd(x), color = "blue", linetype = "dashed")+ theme_classic()+ scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) We can see that all of the data is contained within 2 SD above and below the mean and we have a fair amount of data hovering below or above the 1 SD grid lines.
