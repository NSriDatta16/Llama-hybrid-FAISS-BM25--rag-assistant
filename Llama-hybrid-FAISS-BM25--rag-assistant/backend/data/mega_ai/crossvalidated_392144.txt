interaction with a mixed logistic regression using mlogit on choice data

What is the best way to analyse interactions in choice data between an individual specific variable and an alternative specific variable? I have designed a discrete choice experiment in which participants are asked to make several dichotomous choices (4 choice sets per participant) between different optione (air conditioners). Each options has two varrying attributes: price and energy star rating. The attributes are randomly drawn from a preset distribution. Furthermore, participants receive framed messages (2 framed message groups plus control group: eg. money: "save money with more energy stars" and impress: "impress with more energy stars"). These varry randomly between-participants and are displayed above each choice set. The reference group for the group variable is the "control" group. The data-frame is cleaned and has the following format: ## id instance alt group price rating choice # 1 1 1 impress 600 3 1 # 1 1 2 impress 450 2 0 # 1 2 1 impress 500 2 0 # 1 2 2 impress 650 4 1 # 1 3 1 impress 700 5 0 # 1 3 2 impress 550 4 1 # 1 4 1 impress 560 4 1 # 1 4 2 impress 580 4 0 # 2 1 1 money 300 1 1 # 2 1 2 money 450 2 0 # 2 2 1 money 600 4 1 # 2 2 2 money 550 3 0 # ... # 3 1 1 control 500 2 0 # 3 1 2 control 650 3 1 # 3 2 1 control 400 2 1 # 3 2 2 control 550 3 0 # ... # 4 1 1 money 500 2 0 # 4 1 2 money 650 3 1 # 4 2 1 money 400 2 1 # 4 2 2 money 550 3 0 # ... I am manly interested in the interaction effect of the group variable with the rating variable. Since the choice options are unlabelled and attributes are randomly drawn, I am not interested in the main effects of the group variable. I was planning on using the mlogit() function, but have not found anything on how to model the interaction. Would the following be the correct way to proceed? library(mlogit) dce_df
