Quadratic terms in logistic regression

I am looking at the results of a logistic regression model (i dont have the data) and the person who has developed the model has included quadratic terms in the model. I understand the use of such polynomial terms in a linear model where one can look at the relationship between the response and the predictor. But in case of a binary outcome, is there a way to identify such a trend before hand i.e. without including it in the model and then checking if the variable is significant or not?
