VS2008 Compile error with

Getting heaps (105) of redefine & syntax errors when trying to compile my VS2008 c++ project with included. Running Windows 7 64bit. I have googled and searched and the answer seems pretty uniform but it doesn't seem to work for me. Tried putting #include before #include . Also tried not including (as winsock2 includes it automatically if missing). Tried with #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN and/or #define _WINSOCKAPI_ prior. In the linker -> additional dependencies I have referenced ws2_32.lib. Also tried #pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32.lib") . I rebuild the whole solution just in case. Usual error (shared by many it seems): Error 5 error C2011: 'sockaddr' : 'struct' type redefinition c:\program files\microsoft sdks\windows\v6.0a\include\ws2def.h 206 RallyAction Error 6 error C2143: syntax error : missing '}' before 'constant' c:\program files\microsoft sdks\windows\v6.0a\include\ws2def.h 384 RallyAction Error 7 error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'constant' c:\program files\microsoft sdks\windows\v6.0a\include\ws2def.h 384 RallyAction Error 8 error C2059: syntax error : 'constant' c:\program files\microsoft sdks\windows\v6.0a\include\ws2def.h 384 RallyAction ...etc,etc. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
