How to serialize the Key and only one object value of a generic Dictionary ?

I am looking forward to serialize a Dictionary in order to save some of it's information, more precisely it's Key and one of it's Value, into Silverlight Isolated storage. I have read many question talking about the same subject on these boards, but none were explaining what I was trying to do, or at least not in a way I could understand. I also don't know with what I could serialize it: XmlSerializer, JSON, etc... I am trying to perform this serialization in order to 'save' some of the user settings, I don't intend to send them to a Web service or anything, it's only use will be inside the application. Here is the structure of my Dictionary: static Dictionary Mydictionary And here is the 'User' class: public class User { public User() { } public string name; public string age; public string groups; } I would like to save the Key and the 'groups' Value of my object and serialize only those two informations. I was asking myself if it was even possible? Thank you, Ephismen.
