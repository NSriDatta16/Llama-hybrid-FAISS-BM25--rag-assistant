How are objects made draggable in iphone app?

I would like to have objects in my view which can be dragged and dropped. When they are dropped in a certain area they should disappear and some code should execute. How are objects made draggable in an iphone app? Is it just a button which can be drag enabled? How would one detect the position of the draggable object? Would it be as simple as (Psuedo) if (draggableButton1.xPosition > e.g. && draggableButton1.xPosition e.g. && draggableButton1.yPosition ?
