Quoting a paragraph I've written before: An embedded system for our purposes is a computer system that has a specific and deterministic functionality\cite{LamieReal}. Typically, processors for embedded systems contain elements such as onboard RAM, special-purpose processing elements such as a digital signal processor, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters. Since the processors have more flexibility than a straightforward CPU, a common term is microcontroller.
