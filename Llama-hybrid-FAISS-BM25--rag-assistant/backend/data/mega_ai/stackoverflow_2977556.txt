Reverse letters in each word of a string without using native splitting or reversing functions

This task has already been asked/answered, but I recently had a job interview that imposed some additional challenges to demonstrate my ability to manipulate strings. Problem: How to reverse words in a string? You can use strpos() , strlen() and substr() , but not other very useful functions such as explode() , strrev() , etc. Example: $string = "I am a boy" Answer: I ma a yob Below is my working coding attempt that took me 2 days [sigh], but there must be a more elegant and concise solution. Intention: 1. get number of words 2. based on word count, grab each word and store into array 3. loop through array and output each word in reverse order Code: $str = "I am a boy"; echo reverse_word($str) . "\n"; function reverse_word($input) { //first find how many words in the string based on whitespace $num_ws = 0; $p = 0; while(strpos($input, " ", $p) !== false) { $num_ws ++; $p = strpos($input, ' ', $p) + 1; } echo "num ws is $num_ws\n"; //now start grabbing word and store into array $p = 0; for($i=0; $i
