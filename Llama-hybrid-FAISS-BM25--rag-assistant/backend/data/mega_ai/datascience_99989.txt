This is actually very similar to this stack where they discuss this is possible using a Random Forest model. You would just need to one-hot encode your categorical variables into dummy variables. To do this, you can read and follow this primer here , where it details one-hot encoding and why it would be relevant for your dataset. In short, since the categories you have displayed show no rank or order, we can say they are nominal, hence why you will need to one-hot encode them.
