How to interpret a linear regression model of logged numeric variables

Below is my model. All numeric variables have been transformed by the natural log (dependent and independent). I am wanting to understand how I can interpret my results. Is it correct to say the following? Every one unit increase of logged variable AmountSpent increases logged variable Revenue by .06 units on average holding all other variables constant. Every 1% increase of AmountSpent increases Revenue by .06% on average holding all other variables constant. AdFormatGIF makes .14 units more of logged variable Revenue than the reference level AdFormatIMG on average holding all other variables constant. Call: lm(formula = Revenue ~ AmountSpent + AdFormat, data = Ads6) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.112 -0.470 -0.067 0.432 5.369 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 3.9073 0.0647 60.43
