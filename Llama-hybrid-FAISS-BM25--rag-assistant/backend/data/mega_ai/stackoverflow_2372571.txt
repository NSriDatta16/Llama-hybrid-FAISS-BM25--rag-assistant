Configuration of the Endpoint address for the access to the Wsdl in jax-ws

I'm a newbie in web services with jax-ws and I'm a little mixed up with the different files. I'm doing a simple hello test and I'm trying to explain something. I successfully installed my web service on Glassfish. I also tested it with a standalone javaoutside the server) My example comes from the helloservice in the javaee5 tutorial examples. ( http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/docinfo.html ) In the web.xml, I have this section: ... HelloService /hello ... in sun-jaxws.xml ... ... and in the sun-web.xml: ... /helloservice ... I see that the context root specified in the web.xml is the same as the one in sun-jaxws.xml. The context root in sun-web.xml, does it matter or is it only used in a EAR file ? I can access my wsdl file from 2 different addresses: http://localhost:8080/helloservice/hello?wsdl http://localhost:8080/helloservice/HelloService?wsdl I can't explain the second one. Where does it come from ? Is it a configuration of the endpoint address ? How come we can access the web service both ways (by context-root and by Service name)? Please explain to me Thanks
