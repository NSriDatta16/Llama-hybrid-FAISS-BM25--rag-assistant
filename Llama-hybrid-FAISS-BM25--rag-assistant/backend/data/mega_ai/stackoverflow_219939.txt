I guess the answer depends upon the usage. If you are developing for profit, you would be likely to buy in components if the cost of using the component vs the cost of developing it results in more profit. This is particularly the case with large components when you do not have the in-house expertise to produce them. A couple of good examples that I have used are the Infragistics controls and Dundas charts. Although we could have created these in-house, the costs in terms of time and lost opportunity would be huge compared to buying a couple of licenses. Of course, sometimes we do this type of thing without even considering it as a component purchase. Streching the imagination a little, you could include the .NET framework, SQL Server, the Windows API, etc.
