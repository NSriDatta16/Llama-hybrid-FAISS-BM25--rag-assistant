Which tribe does Probabilistic Graphical Models fall under?

Pedro Domingos in "The Master Algorithm" listed five tribes of machine learning algorithms: Symbolists Connectionists Evolutionaries Bayesians Analogizers Which category do probabilistic graphical models fall under? From wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model ): A graphical model or probabilistic graphical model (PGM) is a probabilistic model for which a graph expresses the conditional dependence structure between random variables. They are commonly used in probability theory, statistics—particularly Bayesian statistics—and machine learning. In that case, would it be "Bayesian"? What about something like Conditional Random Field ? Is that Bayesian as well?
