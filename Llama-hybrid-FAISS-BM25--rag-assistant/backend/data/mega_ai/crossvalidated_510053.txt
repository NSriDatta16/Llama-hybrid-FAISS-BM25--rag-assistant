You may have heard of the "no free lunch theorem" in machine learning. For each model, there are pros and cons for specific data and use case. So. NN is not better than SVM and I can give couple examples easily. One important argument is SVM is convex but NN is generally not. Having a convex problem is desirable because we have more tools to solve it more reliable. If we know our data, we can pick a better model to fit data better. For example, if we have some data like donut shape. Like this using SVM with right kernel is better than using NN and NN may overfit data in this case.
