What loss function to use if I try to minimize $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y'_i - y_i)^2$

So my goal is to minimize $$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y'_i - y_i)^2$$ Where $y'$ is output of network and $y_i$ is a target label. I have two questions: What is the name of this minimization function? (Least sum of squares?) If I want to implement it in neural networks, what loss function do I use? Thank you!
