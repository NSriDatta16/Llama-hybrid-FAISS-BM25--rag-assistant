Does it have to be a multi-dimensional array? How about a "bubble" structure like this: typedef struct t_bubble_tag { t_colour colour; /* whatever else you want to store about your bubble */ struct t_bubble_tag pUpperLeft; struct t_bubble_tag pUpperRight; struct t_bubble_tag pLeft; struct t_bubble_tag pRight; struct t_bubble_tag pLowerLeft; struct t_bubble_tag pLowerRight; } t_bubble; Then when you pop a given bubble, you can do a tree traverse down both ways and sideways both ways, and get rid of any "island" of bubbles that are not eventually attached to the top wall. Bear in mind bubbles can be supported by "arms" of other bubbles from the side or below. I suspect that this is less storage efficient, but more speed efficient, than using a multi-dimensional array.
