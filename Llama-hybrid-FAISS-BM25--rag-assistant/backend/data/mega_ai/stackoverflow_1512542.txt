Select random rows but without duplicates of values from one column

This is a simple select from a single table. The purpose is to select four random products, one from each of x number of categories, with a couple of 'where' limitations. I've tried this: SELECT pName, pID from products WHERE pDisplay=1 AND pFeatured=1 GROUP BY pCategory ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 0,4 This kind of works, but it always returns the same product from any given category. I want to vary the products shown, while still showing only a single product for any given category. I also tried: SELECT DISTINCT(pCategory) pName, pID from products WHERE pDisplay=1 AND pFeatured=1 ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 0,4 I'm thinking maybe it needs two selects -the first to get a random 4 categories the second to choose a random row from each of them, but a. am not sure how to do this, and b. would prefer to use a single query if possible.
