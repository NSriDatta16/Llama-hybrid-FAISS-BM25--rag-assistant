Can AI (NLP) convert user questions (text) into database SQL queries?

I have been reading about NLP but got confused and not able to figure out - if it is feasible for NLP to convert questions in natural language to transform into SQL queries (so that it can execute on concerned database and fetch the output). Ex. If the user raises a question to the AI engine (application) - How many new customers have registered on my website this month? The AI should parse this using NLP techniques and convert it into SQL and execute on database table say "User_management" - select count(1) from User_management where joining_month = 'Oct' and joining_year = 2019 Please share your thoughts and advice. Update 1) Got this SO link and this NLTK chapter as starting point
