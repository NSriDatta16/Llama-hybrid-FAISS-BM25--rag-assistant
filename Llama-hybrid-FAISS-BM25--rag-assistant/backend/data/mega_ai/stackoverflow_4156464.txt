Parsing and grouping text in a string using Python

I need to parse a series of short strings that are comprised of 3 parts: a question and 2 possible answers. The string will follow a consistent format: This is the question "answer_option_1 is in quotes" "answer_option_2 is in quotes" I need to identify the question part and the two possible answer choices that are in single or double quotes. Ex.: What color is the sky today? "blue" or "grey" Who will win the game 'Michigan' 'Ohio State' How do I do this in python?
