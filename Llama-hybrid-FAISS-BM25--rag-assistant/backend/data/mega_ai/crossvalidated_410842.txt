Understanding ratio variable meaning

I have a ratio variable - women's income : men's income, women in the numerator and men in the denominator. This variable is intended to measure income disparity between women and men. In a logistic regression model - a one unit increase in women's income relative to men's means that income disparity is decreasing rather than increasing, correct?
