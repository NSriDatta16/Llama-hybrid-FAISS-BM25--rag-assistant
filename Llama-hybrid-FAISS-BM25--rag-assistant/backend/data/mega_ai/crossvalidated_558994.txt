Similar to simple covariance and correlation, the mean is subtracted while estimating the autocorrelation (autocovariance or cross-correlation and cross-covariance). The following is the covariance of $X$ and $Y$ for example, where the means of the random variables are subtracted from the random variable itself: $$\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)=\mathbb E[(X-\mathbb E[X])(Y-\mathbb E[Y])]$$ Your suggestion corresponds to something like $\mathbb E[X/Y]$ , which is fundamentally different than the covariance or the correlation. In time-series literature, we usually see the generative equation similar to $$x_t=\rho x_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$$ However, not all time series are generated this way, so ignoring the noise term and having a rough estimate like $\rho\approx x_t/x_{t-1}$ may not work well, even in this type of series, let alone the general family of random processes.
