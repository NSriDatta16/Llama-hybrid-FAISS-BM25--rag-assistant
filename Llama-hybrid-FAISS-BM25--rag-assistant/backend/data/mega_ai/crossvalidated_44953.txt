I'm going to go ahead and copy most of my answer from StackOverflow here: You may want to look into the literature on copulas . I believe that what you are doing here is basically constructing a Gaussian copula ( Wikipedia ): maybe this is already obvious to you, maybe not ... For example, http://www.casact.org/library/02pcas/venter.pdf states The linear correlation coefficient based on the covariance of two variates is not preserved by copulas. That is, two pairs of correlated variates with the same copula can have different correlations. However, the Kendall correlation, usually denoted by τ, is a constant of the copula. That is, any correlated variates with the same copula will have the τ of that copula. As suggested by @Glen_b's comment, you don't necessarily need Cholesky to do this -- there are lots of ways to generate correlated multivariate normal Gaussian data ( MASS::mvrnorm is probably the most widely used R function: it uses an eigenvector rotation).
