Regex are not the solution, as somebody said : Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems. But nevermind that, what I would use, is parse_url , and then append my var1=1&var2=2 to the result query string. Something along the lines of: $broken = parse_url($url); $broken['query'] .= '&var1=1&var2=2'; if (strpos($broken,'&')==0) $broken['query'] = substr($broken['query'],1); return $broken['scheme'].'://'.$broken['host'].$broken['path']. '?'.$broken['query'].'#'.$broken['fragment']; If you don't want your variable to appear twice, use also parse_str to break apart the query string.
