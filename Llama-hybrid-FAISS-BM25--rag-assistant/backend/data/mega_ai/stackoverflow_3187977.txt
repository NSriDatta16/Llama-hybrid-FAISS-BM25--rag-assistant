In section 6.7.8 of the C99 Standard, paragraph 21 states: If there are fewer initializers in a brace-enclosed list than there are elements or members of an aggregate, or fewer characters in a string literal used to initialize an array of known size than there are elements in the array, the remainder of the aggregate shall be initialized implicitly the same as objects that have static storage duration. And paragraph 10 states that static arithmetic types (which would include char) are initialized to zero. Based on that, you should expect the rest of the array to be initialized to zero when using a string literal as the initializer.
