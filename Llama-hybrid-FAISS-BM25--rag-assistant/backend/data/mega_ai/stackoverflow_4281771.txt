" My preference is of course to have everything obfuscated completely, not stick with half baked wrapping with high overheads if it gives me very little protection ." Are you sure you need obfuscation in this area of your solution? What are you actually trying 'to protect'? In my experience, the benefit comes from obfuscating custom UI code and business logic classes. ( that a competitor could possibly copy and leverage ). There isn't a great deal of benefit in obfuscating auto-generated service code. You don't really have much IP there to protect... The tool you are using should allow you to define which classes you want to obfuscate and which ones you don't. I wouldn't describe this approach as 'half baked'
