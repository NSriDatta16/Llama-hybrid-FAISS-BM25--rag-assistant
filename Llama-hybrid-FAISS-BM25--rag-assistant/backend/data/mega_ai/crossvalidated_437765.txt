Bayesian A/B Testing vs Frequentist A/B Testing?

I was reading the book Probabilistic Programming for Hackers and came across Bayesian A/B Testing. So basically, I get a Posterior Distribution for $P(A), P(B)$ and the $\Delta$ between $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ . How is this different from a Frequentist statistics? I mean I can just simply estimate the $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ using frequentist methods an I also get confidence intervals around it. I can't see the benefit of Bayesian method here.
