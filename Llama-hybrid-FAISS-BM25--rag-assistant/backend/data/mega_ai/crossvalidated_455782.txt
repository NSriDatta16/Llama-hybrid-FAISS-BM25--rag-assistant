Your problem is equivalent to randomly filling 20 boxes each with three items either A's and B's. There is no overlap between the boxes (even if there would be overlap it would actually not matter, but it is conceptually much more easy to understand). This should be a binomial distribution. For any particular point/box you draw independently 3 protein subunits with probability p for unit A and probability 1-p for unit B. If the case is that the 60 faces have a fixed number of A and B. Then this would become something similar to the coupon collectors problem, the birthday problem or the occupancy problem. The probability that any of the 5 B's share the same triangular facet out of the twenty. However you speak about 5 being the average and the number of B's is not restricted to 5.
