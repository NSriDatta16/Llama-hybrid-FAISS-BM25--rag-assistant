You can add something like this to the footer: ="Render Duration: " + IIf(System.DateTime.Now.Subtract(Globals!ExecutionTime).TotalSeconds 0, System.DateTime.Now.Subtract(Globals!ExecutionTime).Minutes & " minute(s), ", "") + IIf(System.DateTime.Now.Subtract(Globals!ExecutionTime).Seconds > 0, System.DateTime.Now.Subtract(Globals!ExecutionTime).Seconds & " second(s)", "")) ) So a basic render time, I know thats not exactly what your looking for but the only way I know of getting the data retrieval time is from the report execution table in your report server database.
