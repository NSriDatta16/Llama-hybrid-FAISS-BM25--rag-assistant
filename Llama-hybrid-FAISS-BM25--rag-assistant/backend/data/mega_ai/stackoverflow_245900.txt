HEAD is really useful for determining what a given server's clock is set to (accurate to within the 1 second or the network round-trip time, whichever is greater). It's also great for getting Futurama quotes from Slashdot: ~$ curl -I slashdot.org HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Wed, 29 Oct 2008 05:35:13 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.41 (Unix) mod_perl/1.31-rc4 SLASH_LOG_DATA: shtml X-Powered-By: Slash 2.005001227 X-Fry: That's a chick show. I prefer programs of the genre: World's Blankiest Blank. Cache-Control: private Pragma: private Connection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 For cURL , -I is the option for performing a HEAD request. To get the current date and time of a given server, just do curl -I $server | grep ^Date
