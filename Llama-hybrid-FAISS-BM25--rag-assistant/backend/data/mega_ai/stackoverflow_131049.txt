What's the easiest way to add a quote box to mediawiki?

I installed mediawiki on my server as my personal knowledge base. Sometimes I copy some stuff from Web and paste to my wiki - such as tips & tricks from somebody's blog. How do I make the copied content appear in a box with border? For example, the box at the end of this blog post looks pretty nice: http://blog.dreamhost.com/2008/03/21/good-reminiscing-friday/ I could use the pre tag, but paragraphs in a pre tag won't wrap automatically.. Any ideas?
