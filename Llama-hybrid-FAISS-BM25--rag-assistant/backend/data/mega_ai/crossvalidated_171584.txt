Learning from positive and unlabeled data is often referred to as PU learning. what you describe is a common approach to these kinds of problems, though I personally dislike such iterative approaches because they are highly sensitive to false positives (if you have any). You might want to check out two of my papers and references therein for an up-to-date overview on current research for these problems: A Robust Ensemble Approach to Learn From Positive and Unlabeled Data Using SVM Base Models http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3144 (published in Neurocomputing ) Assessing binary classifiers using only positive and unlabeled data: http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06837 The first paper describes a state-of-the-art method to learn classifiers and the second is the only approach that allows you to estimate any performance metric based on contingency tables from test sets without known negatives (you read that right). Both papers also provide a good overview of the existing literature on this subject.
