Linq Nested Grouping

I've a large table of Items and I need to organize them by Category, then by Year and then by Month. Item has CategoryID and Dated properties. I got this far: Dim Items = From Item In DB.Items _ Group By CategoryID = Item.CategoryID _ Into Categories = Group _ Order By CategoryID But where I put the: Group By Year = Year(Item.Dated) and the Group By Month = Month(Item.Dated) The final result should be something like this: For Each Category in Categories For Each Year in Category.Years For Each Month in Year.Months For Each Item in Month.Items Next Next Next Next Thanks
