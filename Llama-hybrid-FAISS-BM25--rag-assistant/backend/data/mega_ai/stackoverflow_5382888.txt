How can I create Multiple Shipments in Magento via SOAP?

I'm using SOAP to add a shipment to a Magento order but I need to have the ability to modify existing shipments, and add additional shipments. I can add a shipment and a track # but if the user voids a shipment for some reason I'd like to remove the shipment and then create a new shipment. I don't see a way to do this. If I just try to add another shipment then I get a SOAP error. Uncaught SoapFault exception: [102] Cannot do shipment for order
