Code Coverage of ASP.NET

I recently inherited a nice size projects with about 100k lines of code and would like to find out what code is actually being run. I've found a number of routines that are not called at all and looking for a fast and automated way to explore the Business Layer to see what other code can be refactored out quickly. This is an ASP.NET website with VB.NET codebehind and Business Layer.
