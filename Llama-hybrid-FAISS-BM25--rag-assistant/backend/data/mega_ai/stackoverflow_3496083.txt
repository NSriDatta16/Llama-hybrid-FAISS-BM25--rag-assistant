It should work just fine. Maybe leechers are autodetected and returned a different response. Since you didn't tell about the actual response in detail, it's as far a bit stabbing in the dark. Try supplying a legitimate useragent, or maintaining the session, or using a bit more smart 3rd party leeching tool. That said, do you realize that most of the webmasters don't really appreciate those kind of actions? Network bandwidth and CPU load are not free. Update as per your update: the name seems to be too long to be a legitimate save-as filename, also the ? is an illegal character in filenames (at least, in Windows). That might be the root cause of this all. I don't do wget , but you should at least specify a custom output file name. It'll be explained in its manual. This question is now probably a better fit for http://superuser.com .
