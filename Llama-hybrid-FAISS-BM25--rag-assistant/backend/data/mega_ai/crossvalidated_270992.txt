In a logistic regression, is it possible to have predicted probabilities that run counter to the beta values?

I've run a logistic regression on some data with 3 categorical independent variables, and a binary dependent variable. I've plotted the predicted probabilities as a way of visualising the significant interactions, but have found that despite the beta value being negative for some variables, the predicted probabilities show increases for those levels. For example, there is an effect of condition with the output suggesting that the dependent variable is 3.81 times more likely to be 1 for condition 1. However, when plotted, condition 1 has much lower predicted probabilities. Is this possible, or does it indicate something has been done incorrectly? UPDATE: Apologies for the quality of the graph and annotation, but here is what I mean - I have plotted the likelihoods for each condition, at each time point and across students and non-students: The issue I have is that I cannot explain why some of these look so different to the statistics I'm reporting; there is apparently no difference in the likelihood of having a value of 1 in the DV (0 is my reference category) between time 1 and time 2 in condition 1 for students, although this looks like the biggest difference in the plot. Similarly, there is apparently an increased likelihood of having a value of 1 between time 2 and time 3 for non-students, although the plot suggests a decrease. Is there a reason why this might be the case?
