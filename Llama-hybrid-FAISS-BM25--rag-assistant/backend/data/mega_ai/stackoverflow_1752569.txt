While less elegant, this will be significantly faster: html = " " + datum[0] + " -- " + datum[1] + ", " + datum[2] + " "; Your original approach creates a new regular expression for each iteration of the for loop which can be expensive. You could look into creating these expressions once and caching them perhaps but even then the overhead of executing the regular expression and replacing the format string will still be greater than a simple string concatenation. Unfortunately elegance is often the first victim of optimization.
