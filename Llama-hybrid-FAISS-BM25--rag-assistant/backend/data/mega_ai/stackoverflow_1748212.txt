Rails add_test_data migration

Just working through the Agile Web Development with Rails book and near the closing chapters of the book I had to rollback the db a few times using db:migrate VERSION=0 followed by the db:migrate command. However upon bringing the database back from the ground up, the add_test_data migration fails to add the test entries to the db as it had successfully done previously. Any Ideas? Im getting the following in the development log Migrating to AddTestData (20091111225948) [4;36;1mSQL (0.0ms)[0m [0;1mselect sqlite_version(*)[0m [4;35;1mProduct Load (1.0ms)[0m [0m SELECT "products".id FROM "products" WHERE ("products"."title" = 'Pragmatic Project Automation') LIMIT 1[0m [4;36;1mProduct Load (0.0ms)[0m [0;1mSELECT "products".id FROM "products" WHERE ("products"."title" = 'Pragmatic Version Control') LIMIT 1[0m [4;35;1mProduct Load (1.0ms)[0m [0mSELECT "products".id FROM "products" WHERE ("products"."title" = 'Pragmatic Unit Testing (C#)') LIMIT 1[0m [4;36;1mSQL (1.0ms)[0m [0;1mINSERT INTO schema_migrations (version) VALUES ('20091111225948')[0m The db is SQLite3, Ruby 1.8.6, Rails 2.3.4 and im developing on Windows (cringe)
