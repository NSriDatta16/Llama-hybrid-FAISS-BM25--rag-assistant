Interpolation seems like it would make sense in this case: any time you miss a day, take an average of the before and after. As an aside, I don't think you have to give up on the missing weather values so easily. There are a variety of R packages that simplify getting weather for an arbitrary location from someone like Weather Underground with only a couple lines of code.
