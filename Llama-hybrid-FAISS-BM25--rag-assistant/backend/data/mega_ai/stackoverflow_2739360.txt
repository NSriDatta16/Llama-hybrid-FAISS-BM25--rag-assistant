inno setup - registry key vs. .ini files

Dabbling with creating an installer with inno setup- but wondering: What are the pros and cons of using registry keys (windows program) vs. .ini files that sit within the program folder? If I store all my user settings in .ini files, the entire program can be removed by deleting the folder. With registry keys i'd have to create an uninstaller / remove the key manually. Why is it that most commercial applications use registry values? I know from brief use of Macs that most programs are drag and drop. Are one of the major reasons because of the lack of a registry key in mac OS?
