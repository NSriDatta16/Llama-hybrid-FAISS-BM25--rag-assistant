I think in your case you would need to fit a multinomial distribution (generalisation of binomial distribution for more than 2 classes), whose parameter is a vector of probabilities $\pi= (\pi_1, ..., \pi_k)$ where $k$ is the number of different classes. An easy way to estimate these probabilities is to comupte the different proportions of calls in the different categories among all the calls which are already classified(these proportions actually give the maximum likelihood estimator of $\pi$ ). You can then give confidence interavals, make tests, etc. If you have explanatory variables you would like to use to estimate proportions, then you can go for a mulitnomial (or polytomous) logistic regression.
