If the goodness means a low mean-squared error (MSE) as usual and if you are averaging the continuous-valued predictions from each learning method, A single model such as decision tree can easily give you a low MSE on the training set, but in ML you would like to measure your performance on non-training data. Unfortunately, most (all?) models produce bias while learning. By averaging many different models, you reduce bias and thus improve MSE on your non-training data set.
