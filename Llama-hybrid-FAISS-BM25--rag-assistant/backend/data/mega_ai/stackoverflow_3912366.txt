Not a NoSql expert but NoSql Storage are more efficent in diriect reads (the get method of grails domain classes) and are slower on complex join queries or has no support for agragation (max, min, avrg) Grails Security UI plugin has it all http://burtbeckwith.github.com/grails-spring-security-ui/docs/manual/index.html Grails MongoDB plugin implements the GORM functionality for MongoDB so everything should be OK (not tested directly )
