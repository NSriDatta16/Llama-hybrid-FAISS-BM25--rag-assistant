Saving local copy of text area entry

Previously when covering events I've typed my reports into an html file and ftp'd it to the server. If I lose connectivity or the laptop crashes, I've got the last saved copy. We just switched our event coverage area to a database holding Textile-formatted entries done via a web form text area. Is it at all possible to create a mechanism whereby a local copy of the textarea is saved so I can keep working during connectivity failure? Using Windows on the laptop. Guess the low tech way would be to type in a word processor and just keep pasting into the web form.
