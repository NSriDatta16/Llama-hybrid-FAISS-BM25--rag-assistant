Tweet value prediction: What sort of analysis (Bayesian?) might predict how much a Twitter user will value a tweet?

Iâ€™m thinking of adding a feature to the TalkingPuffin Twitter client, where, after some training with the user, it can rank incoming tweets according to their predicted value. What solutions are there for the Java virtual machine (Scala or Java preferred) to do this sort of thing?
