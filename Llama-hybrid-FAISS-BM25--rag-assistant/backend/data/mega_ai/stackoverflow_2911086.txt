Cakephp, an elegant solution to quantities?

I have a shopping cart system in Cakephp, this table has all your usual maguffins: user_ids, product_ids, option_lists ect. It also has quantity. I currently have some awful nested loops to check if the record is the same as any in there, if so add one to the quantity. If not add a new cart item. This loop has to check associated list items and product options, so it goes quite deep. What I'm wondering is if there is a more elegant way of checking to see if two cart items in a database are similar (everything except for quantity). Cheers!
