IE8: "The system cannot find the path specified" error when acessing window.localStorage

I have some javascript code which accesses window.localStorage, and it's working fine on most machines, but in one of them (IE8 compat view, Windows 7 64) I get the error "The system cannot find the path specified" whenever I try to read window.localStorage. I've tried to find some discussions about it at SO and Google (no cigar) and didn't find any suspicious setting at the browser's options. Has anyone encountered this error, and a solution for it? I could put a try/catch around window.localStorage but I'd rather understand what is going on.
