Can XGBoost learn more complicated interactions/features?

For a set of features {a, b, c, d . . . n}, XGBoost can easily learn, say, a*d. In practice can it also effectively learn a/c? Or (a + b + c + 2)/d? Or (c^(2 d))/ (b^a)? I'd imagine some of this depends on the amount of data available and the hyperparameters, but I am wondering about general guidelines.
