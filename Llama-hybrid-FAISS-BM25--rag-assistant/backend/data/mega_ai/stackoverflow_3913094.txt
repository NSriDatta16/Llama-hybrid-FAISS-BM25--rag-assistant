Why doesn't your operator new return a value? It is declared to return void * but dosn't return anything. This means your compiler should have given a compile error, apparently it didn't, and well the crash may be becaue of that. On the other hand, if this, as you say, is an example, then maybe you returned 0 from new, in which case operator delete is not being invoked because calling delete on a 0 pointer is equivaent to an empty statement. malloc something in new and return it, and operator delete will be invoked Let's be more specific here: Your core dump is obviously because you don't return a value. delete o is a delete expression which will only eventually call your operator delete, and it will do so ONLY if the pointer is not NULL. As said, it must be a valid pointer
