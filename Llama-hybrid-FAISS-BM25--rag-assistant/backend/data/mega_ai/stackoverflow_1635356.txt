Partitioning is a solution for storage problems, ie. determine on what filegroup data is located based on some field value. On its own, it gives no real performance benefit, in fact it actually slows down queries most times because new partition location operators need to be added. The only way to enforce queries to consider only one partition is the $PARTITION syntax, and this cannot be used in real world applications scenarios. Queries that opt to look up only one partition do so solely based on the index ranges, and would scan exactly the same number of records with or without partitioning. the only time when partitioning has a performance benefit is for administration activities like partition switch in and switch out from a table or bulk import operations. Performance benefits can come only from proper indexes and carefully designed queries.
