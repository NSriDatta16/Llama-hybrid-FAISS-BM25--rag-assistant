I would suggest WPF Toolkit which can be downloaded from DatGrid available in Codeplex. This is compatible with the latest WPF(.NET3.5 SP1) which is free and have almost all the features for a general purpose(and even more than that) But there are commercial vendors who have good grid controls(Not really free). Like Xceed, Infragistics, Component One, Telerik
