PCA maximizes variance captured by linear combinations of your input variables. There are several reasons why this might not extract useful information about your outcome variable: Maximizing variance does not mean maximizing dispersion if your variables are not approximately normally distributed; $>90\%$ of the variance in the input might be captured by your approach, but since this is an unsupervised technique, it might as well be that the last 10% correlates strongest with the output ; The other techniques you use return significance/variable importance based on the output: You are comparing an unsupervised approach to supervised approaches. On a different note, why bother with dimension reduction at all? It seems you have plenty of observations to estimate 100 features. If you suspect some to be less informative than others, why not go with a regularized approach (e.g. ridge regression), or a method that inherently does variable selection... say... a random forest?
