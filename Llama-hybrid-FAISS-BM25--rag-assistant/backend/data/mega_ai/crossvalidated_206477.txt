How to output as unclassified object in svm multiclass classifier?

I am developing an image classifier using opencv,python.I am using svm from opencv. The image classifier classifies Animals,vehicles and Humans.It works fine.But when i give the image of 'nature scene' then also it will classify.That's the problem.How can i output it as unclassified.When i give the input a image thats not belonging to the trained class How can i output it as unclassified.? Just for reference my code to predict is result = svm.predict(testData) if result==1: print 'Vehicle' elif result==2: print 'Animal' elif result==3: print 'Humans'
