Besides @juampa's suggestion you should also try NeRV (Neighbor Retrieval Visualizer), which " is a principled information retrieval based approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction ", and SNE/t-SNE can be seen as special cases of NeRV. The main point of NeRV is to minimize a tradeoff of the recall and the precision between the original space and the display. NeRV is provided as a command line tool written in C++. A demo picture from their website: the left result emphasizes more on recall (less "misses"), while the right one emphasizes more on precision (less "false neighbors").
