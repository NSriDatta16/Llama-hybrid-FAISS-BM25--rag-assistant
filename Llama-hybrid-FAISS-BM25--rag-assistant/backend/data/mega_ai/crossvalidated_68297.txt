I don't necessarily see anything invalid about doing this, but you have information you are not using when you do it this way. That means you will probably have lower power, and less informative results. If you have an ordinal outcome, you would do better to do ordinal logistic regression . The only issue there would be what to do with the Don't know responses, as Don't know doesn't necessarily have a clear ordinal relationship with the rest of the response options. There are several questions on CV regarding how to deal with the Don't knows ; you might try reading through some of the threads returned by this search . You could also try reading some of the treads categorized under the likert & survey tags. Alternatively, you could do multinomial logistic regression , which treats them as just 5 unrelated responses. It has no problem with the Don't know s, but loses the ordered nature of the rest.
