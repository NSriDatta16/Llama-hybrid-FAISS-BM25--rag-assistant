the first problem is that my outputs individualy has very noise and i want to know how can i remove it. Yes, that is natural, do not worry, you can remove the noise. the second problem is the gyro drift that i think it should solve with kalman filter. Yes, Kalman filter is one way to go. You may find these answers useful: Sensor fusioning with Kalman filter Combine Gyroscope and Accelerometer Data the third problem is the accelerometer.if i combine the gyro and accelermeter when i move the device without rotating the device the output will change. I am not sure I understand that correctly. If you have magnetometer Kalman filter can remove the gyro drift even if you are not rotating the device. Is that what you are asking? EDIT: Depending on your application, you can assume that the acceleration is zero on average. Read this, especially page 24: http://gentlenav.googlecode.com/files/DCMDraft2.pdf I use this assumption in my application for human motion sensing and it works perfectly.
