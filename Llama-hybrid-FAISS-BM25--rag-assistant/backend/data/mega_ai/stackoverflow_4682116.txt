In JQuery is there a way to queue effects to occur after a time limit has expired?

I'm trying to create a message notification for a web page using jQuery. The message will slide up from the bottom and then after 10 seconds slide back down. The problem is that I would like to setup the timing through the jQuery effects system if possible, rather than using setTimeout s. Which is a rather inelegant solution? How do you use jQuery to queue up effects to happen after certain time intervals?
