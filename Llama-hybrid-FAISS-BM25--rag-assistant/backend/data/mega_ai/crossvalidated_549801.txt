How to calculate mean and proportion from a binomial distribution?

Lets say that I flip a coin and get heads 50/200 times. What would my proportion and mean be for this binomial distribution? I am getting confused, because in a binomial distribution there are only 2 outcomes, so how do you find an average of a categorical variable? Thanks in advance.
