This is certainly breaking some coding standards, but is it breaking the WP coding standard? I wouldn't have an assignment in the condition of an IF block. People will always wonder, is that supposed to be == instead of = ?. Refactoring is good to earn back some of your technical debt. Unit tests and good code coverage makes refactoring easier. A good rule of thumb is any time you touch the code (or have to stare at it to decipher it), that's the time to refactor it, so the next person doesn't have to deal with it. In this case, you looked at the code, you should refactor it. Of course, these are guidelines that the group has to agree on. Ideally, you should keep your technical debt under control.
