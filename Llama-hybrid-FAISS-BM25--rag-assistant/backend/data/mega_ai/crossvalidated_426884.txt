Does ordinal logistic regression substitute for "multifactorial Friedman test"?

I'm searching for an appropriate statistical test, more or less a multifactorial version of Friedman test. But I'm also wondering if Wilcoxons rank sum test can do the job. Experimental design: 10 larvae are allowed to swim in an experiment chamber virtually divided into 4 brightness quartiles (Q1 to Q4, Q1 being closest to a lamp source). They are recorded for 1 minute. Every 5 seconds I score the number of larvae that's in each quartile (score out of 10 for t0, t5, t10, t15 etc.). This assay is run 3 times for each treatment (T1, T2)(different drugs being added to the water). Hence I have: y - score (not normally distributed) x1 - T1, T2 (what I really care about. H0: scores in T1 = T2) x2 - t0, t5, t10... (13 time points) x3 - Q1 to Q4 (4 quartiles) Choices: Simply do a Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare Scores between T1 and T2, across the timepoints (treat as 2 series of data, paired). Do this for each quartile separately. non-parametric version of repeated measures ANOVA (Friedman test), but this doesn't cater for a multifactorial design. 1 is probably over-simplifying it. I can't seem to find the solution to 2. Ordinal logistic regression seems to be an option, I've never used this before and wonder if it fits my purpose at all.
