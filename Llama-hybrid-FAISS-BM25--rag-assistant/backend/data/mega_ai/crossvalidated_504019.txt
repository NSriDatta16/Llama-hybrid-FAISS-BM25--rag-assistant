To start from the end: should I just stop reading random articles? Maybe you should first take a course on statistics, data science, or machine learning, before you return to reading 'random articles'. There are many gems on the internet, but even more garbage, and without a solid foundation it may be hard to distinguish between them. Classification with probabilities output seems odd This is subjective. Maybe probabilities aren't always the best criterion for classification, but sometimes they are, and even more often, another continuous value (perhaps expected gain/loss, which is, in part, derived from the probability) is. As an (artificial) example: Say, you are an umbrella shop owner and the weather forecast says that there is a 70% chance of raining today. Do you open your shop, or do you give your employees a day off? If you open your shop, but it doesn't rain, you have effectively lost money. If you don't open the shop, but it rains, you have forgone profit. Depending on the cost of keeping the shop open and the profit you make on a rainy day and on the probability of raining you can make the optimal decision. IMHO many models can be reformed for either For example: Generalised linear models. Depending on the 'link function' they can be used for linear regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression (which would give you probabilities and allow for classification), and many more. The choice of the model depends (or should depend) on the assumed process that generates the data. In statistics, people usually assume a law that relates the input and the output variables and superimpose a random noise ('error') over it. Depending on the form (probability distribution) of the noise you get different models. For example, if you assume that the noise is additive and Gaussian, this leads to ordinary linear regression. On the other hand, if you assume that the 'noise' is something like a coin flip (a 'Bernoulli process'), you get logistic regression. Hope that helps.
