The simplest thing would be to not do this at all :) If that doesn't work, then there are solutions like modifying the native getItem function but that's a really bad idea. The best way would be to write a wrapper around localStorage , much like what jQuery does to DOM nodes, and use that wrapper to get and put items in local storage. The wrapper could have an interface like: ApplicationStorage getItem() setItem() key() removeItem() Then define acceptable type wrappers like Array within ApplicationStorage that have methods like addItem ApplicationStorage.Array addItem() When applicationStorage.getItem("names") is called, return an object of ApplicationStorage.Array that contains the method addItem which will make chaining possible.
