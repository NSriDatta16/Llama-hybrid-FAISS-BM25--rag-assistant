In order to rotate text you have to embed the font. I'll play around and see if I can get you a more complete answer for your other issue. OK, here are some of your problems. 1) The x of your panel is -500 so it is WAY off the screen, maybe you need that for some reason but in my test it just pushed out of view. 2) rotation requires embedding fonts 3) when you rotate any UI component within another the default pivot is on the upper left hand corner, so when the button rotates, it actually rotates out of view. This is not easy to understand when you read it so here's a visual, consider the upper left hand corner of the container as 0,0 in XY coordinates: normal hbox/button layout: 0,0_________________________________ | ________________________________ | | | | | rotated layout: ___________0,0__________________________ | | | | UI | container | | component| | | | | | |___________________________| | | | | | | | | |__________| See how the button has rotated outside of the visible area (in your case it is no longer on the panel) Solution would be to use a canvas or something that will allow you to pull the HBox away from the edge of the panel.
