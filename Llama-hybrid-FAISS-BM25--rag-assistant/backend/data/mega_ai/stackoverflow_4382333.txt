You can use NSSortDescriptor ’s selector property here. If these objects are their own subclass, then create a selector—something like -compareFavoriteNumberToObject: that returns an NSComparisonResult . If the objects are just something like an NSDictionary , you can make a category on the class to do the comparison.
