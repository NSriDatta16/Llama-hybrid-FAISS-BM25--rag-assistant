You could consider using the wx.aui advanced user interface module, as it allows you to build UIs like this very easily. Also the user can then minimise, maximise, and drag the panes around as they see fit, or not. It's pretty flexible. I actually find it easier to lay out this sort of UI with the aui toolkit, rather than with grids and splitters. Plus all the fancy buttons make apps look cooler. :) There is a nice example in the official demos, called AUI_DockingWindowMgr.
