Java dropping half of UDP packets

I have a simple client/server setup. The server is in C and the client that is querying the server is Java. My problem is that, when I send bandwidth-intensive data over the connection, such as Video frames, it drops up to half the packets. I make sure that I properly fragment the udp packets on the server side (udp has a max payload length of 2^16). I verified that the server is sending the packets (printf the result of sendto()). But java doesn't seem to be getting half the data. Furthermore, when I switch to TCP, all the video frames get through but the latency starts to build up, adding several seconds delay after a few seconds of runtime. Is there anything obvious that I'm missing? I just can't seem to figure this out.
