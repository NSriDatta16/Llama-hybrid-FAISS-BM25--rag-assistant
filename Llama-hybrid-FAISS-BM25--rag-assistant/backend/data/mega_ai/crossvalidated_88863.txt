One simple way to do it is to transform your 3D data into a vector. This is a bit rough but often works fine in practice. Then you can use the prcomp function from the R base package to compute PCA. You can also use the "Multilinear Principal Component Analysis of Tensor Objects" (MPCA) proposed by Lu et al. (2008) . It answers your question directly, as it does PCA on multidimensional objects. An implementation of their algorithm is available in MATLAB here .
