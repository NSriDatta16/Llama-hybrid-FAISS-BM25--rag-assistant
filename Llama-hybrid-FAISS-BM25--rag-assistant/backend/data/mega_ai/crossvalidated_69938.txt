Variable Importance for different methods

Is it possible to compare variable importance, obtained for different models, built on different datasets with simular variables, using caret package? The property are different, but close, and the variables used for modelling are the same. For example, one can calculate importance for pls and random forest model, then scale them to obtain values from 0 to 1. Would it be valid to compare such values for two different Y? Is there any way to compare two different statistical models, built on two different datasets in terms of variable influence?
