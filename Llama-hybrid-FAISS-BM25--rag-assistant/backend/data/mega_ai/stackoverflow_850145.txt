Merge Spring and Grails projects

We are developing an backoffice application using Spring and Maven as configuration manager. The project is moreless divided in two parts, and one of this parts is just for manage the data in the DB tables. Now someone has discovered Grails, and with Grails this job is very easy, but we can't drop all the job and start a new project (the other part is fine as is). With this, we are trying to merge both. We've configured maven grails plugin, and now we can get dependencies and run grails tasks, not perfect yet, but almost. The big problem we have is that the first part of the project (the Spring part) has a directory structure a bit different of the one wich uses Grails. We want to change de structure of the Grails part, but we really don't know how to do it. We suspect we must use some of (G)ant to change the directory structure with a script, but we've no idea of first , how to make the script, second , how to use it from Maven, and finally merging the two parts. The libraries of both parts are compatible, so it is posible that putting everything together the thing works. I'm not waiting the answer but something related with the gant script and maven would be great. As second question, has anyone tried to do something like this? (merge or expand a normal spring project with one grails project?) Thanks all.
