JAXP Source and Result implementations for POJOs

Is anyone aware of implementations of the standard javax.xml.transform.Source and javax.xml.transform.Result which operate on underlying POJOs? In other words, I want to use XSLT to transform one java object graph into another. I am currently using xstream to render the POJOs to a W3C DOM, and then using DomSource and DomResult to pass to a javax.xml.transform.Transformer , but I'd like to skip that step and operate directly on POJOs, using the same XSLT and Transformer / Source / Result interfaces. I'm already aware of Apache JXPath, which provides an XPath implementation which operates on POJOs, which is sort of halfway there, but not quite far enough. Also, JAXB provides javax.xml.bind.util.JAXBSource and JAXBResult , but these only work on objects which are instances of JAXB-annotated classes.
