This is an interesting question, but it is advanced topic that still hasn't been solved completely by researchers in the field. Some teams have tried to obtain representations of the embeddings after an LSTM is trained on time series data. The only published paper I've seen so far is this one . You might want too look at how people extract language embeddings from translation and speech recognition seq2seq models and then see if the same method can be used for time series applications.
