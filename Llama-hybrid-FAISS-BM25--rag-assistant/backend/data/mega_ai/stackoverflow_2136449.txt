ASP.NET MVC - post multiple complex objects with form

In an ASP.NET MVC application I am trying to submit multiple objects with a single form. I am able to get simple types to post back but am having issues with complex types. I feel like I have mimicked the example provided by Phil Haack in his blog post Model Binding To A List but with no luck. Even going so far as copying his code exactly to no avail. I am trying to populate the ProjectNum and TaskNum properties of a set of MachineLicenseBillback objects. Unfortunately the IList machinePts always ends up as a null when posted. What am I missing? Class public class MachineLicenseBillback { public MachineLicenseBillback() { } public virtual int MachineId { get; set; } public virtual string ProjectNum { get; set; } public virtual string TaskNum { get; set; } public virtual string VerifiedFlag { get; set; } public virtual DateTime? RcdChgDateTime { get; set; } public virtual string RcdChgAgent { get; set; } } Action [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public ActionResult TrueUp(int id, IList machinePts) { // ... } Form " /> ].ProjectNum" value=" " /> ].TaskNum" value=" " />
