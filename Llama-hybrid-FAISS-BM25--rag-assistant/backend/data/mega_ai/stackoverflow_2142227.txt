SQL Server -- Elegant way to use custom fields for record set

I'm looking for an elegant way to select fields from a view, where a second supporting table defines the fields that should be selected. The view contains all of my employee data. The constraint table contains the field name, which references the view field name, and a bit which signifies to select that field. Example of View: Name | Age | Weight Peter | 38 | 180 Martha | 25 | 115 Example of constraint table: Field | Enabled Name | 1 Age | 0 Weight | 1 ...Where after running the query, the following data should return: Name | Weight Peter | 180 Martha | 115 Any ideas on how to approach this? Thanks!
