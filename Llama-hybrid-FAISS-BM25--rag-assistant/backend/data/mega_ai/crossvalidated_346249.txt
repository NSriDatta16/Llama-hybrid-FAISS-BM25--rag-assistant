Fitting Weibull distribution in R

My sample data: dat The data have four columns: cum.per.plant : cumulative area that is planted by a crop (hence goes from 0 till 1 loc.id : locations where data were collected year.id : years when the data was collected time.id : id of the weeks when data were collected. Hence for loc.id 7 and year.id 4, planting begins from week 2 and reaches 100% in week 8. I want to implement the below paragraph from this paper if you want to read: https://www.dropbox.com/s/v36i8npfwbutiro/Yang%20et%20al.%202017.pdf?dl=0 Preliminary analysis of the planting data indicates that once planting is initiated, the cumulative proportion of fields planted for a crop in a year at the county level follows a sigmoid pattern, but this can be modified from planting delays due to soil being too wet, we thus fitted the observed data to the following modified Weibull distribution function ProportionFields = 1 - exp(-(DOY - DOYplanting.initiation - Days.no.plant/a)^b) where ProportionFields is the cumulative proportion of fields that have been planted in a county, DOY is a calendar day of year, (DOY >= DOYplanting.initiation), DOYplanting.initiation is a calendar day of year of the earliest planting, Days.no.plant is the total number of days when planting does not occur due to soil being too wet since the start of planting. a is a scale parameter and b is a shape parameter. DOY - DOYplanting.initiation - Days.no.plant represents the total number of days when planting does not occurr since start of planting. I want to use the above approach, so I planned to do this: 1) Fit a distribution to the data. In the above example, they fitted Weibull distribution so I also fitted the same library(fitdistrplus) fw My first question is: 1) Will the scale parameters and shape parameter be affected by the time step i.e. if the data were collected at daily-level, will my shape and scale parameter get divided by a certain factor? Now after I get the parameters, I want to implement this equation to calculate the proportion planted each day for a given year and given location. prop.planted where x = Day of year - Day of year when planting started - No. of days with no planting since the start of planting I have the data to calculate $x$ i.e. Is the equation and my understanding correct of the above paper? EDIT: Suppose the data follows a beta distribution (and not a Weibull distribution). How can I implement the factor where I calculate x in the beta distribution.
