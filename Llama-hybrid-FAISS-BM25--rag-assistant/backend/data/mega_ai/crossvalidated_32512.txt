I am a little concerned about a couple points in your post: 1) PCA doesn't have such a thing as a response variable. Sometimes one does PCA in order to reduce the dimension of the set of independent variables in a regression, but it doesn't sound like that's what you are doing. 2) That odd categorical variable is likely going to cause problems. What is it? 154 levels, and some observations are more than one level? It's always easier to answer questions when context is given. As far as I know, PCA has no options for dealing with repeated measures like this. 3) Given that, it would help if you told us what you are trying to do, substantively rather than statistically. You might look at my post How to ask a Statistics Question
