Markov Chain: Simple Symmetric Random walk on {0,1,...,k}

Consider a simple symmetric random walk on {0,1,...,k} with reflecting boundaries. if the walk is at state 0, it moves to 1 on the next step. If the walk is at k, it moves to k-1 on the next step. Otherwise the walk moves left or right, with probability 1/2. a. Find the stationary distribution. b. For k = 1,000, if the walk starts at 0, how many steps will it take on average for the walk to return to 0? I'm struggling to figure out how to start this. I know how to solve these types of problems for chains that have a known number of states but having unknown number of states makes it so much more difficult. Now I know the Markov Chain is irreducible with period 2 (so it's no ergodic). Can someone help me get started? Thank you in advance. EDIT: My textbook has the following which I don't follow: Let $x= (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ with $x_1 = 1$ $$x_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i P_{ij} = x_{j-1} P_{j-1,j}$$ I understanding using $x_1 = 1$ but the equality for $x_j$ doesn't click for me..
