How to expose a function that takes two input files as a REST resource?

I need to expose a function, let's say compute that takes two input files: a plan file and a system file. The compute function uses to system file to see whether the plan in the plan file can be executed or not. It produces an output file containing the result of this check including recommendations for the plan. I need to expose this functionality in a REST architecture and have no influence on the compute function itself (it is being developed by another organization). I can control the interface through which it is accessed. What would be a recommended way to expose this functionality in a REST architecture?
