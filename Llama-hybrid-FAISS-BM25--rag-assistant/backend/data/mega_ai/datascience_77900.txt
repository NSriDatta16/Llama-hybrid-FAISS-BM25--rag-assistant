GPU vs TPU for convolutional neural networks (NLP)

I am testing ideas on IMDB sentiment analysis task by using word embeddings + CNN approach. What could explain a significant difference in computation time in favor of GPU (~9 seconds per epoch) versus TPU (~17 seconds/epoch), despite supposedly superior computational power of a TPU over GPU?
