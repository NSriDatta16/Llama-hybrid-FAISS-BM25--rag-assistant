If you are assuming that the case rate is a function of spending, you are going to need to get the baseline spending, and then use the changes to fill in the values for the spending for each period. (Unless there's some methodology I'm not familiar with). You can probably get that starting value with a few phone calls. Consider the following dataset: spending spending_change rate previous_rate 1700 0.0625 900 700 1800 0.058823529 1065 900 1900 0.055555556 1200 1065 2000 0.052631579 1305 1200 2100 0.05 1380 1305 2220 0.057142857 1419 1380 2330 0.04954955 1425 1419 2450 0.051502146 1395 1425 2570 0.048979592 1329 1395 2700 0.050583658 1224 1329 2850 0.055555556 1074 1224 Other than the first row, rate = previous_rate+(2350-spending)*0.3 Where rate = the number of infections. (I made up this data.) Using linear regression: lm(rate ~ previous_rate, data=testdata) gives an r-squared of 0.77, and previous_rate has a significance of 0.00025 lm(rate ~ spending + previous_rate, data=testdata) gives an r-squared of 1 (nearly perfect model), and both predictors are significant at e-16. lm(rate ~ spending_change + previous_rate, data=testdata) gives an r-squared of 0.74, previous_rate has a significance of 0.02, and spending change has a significance of 0.89. The model is slightly worse than the first model. As you can see, the change in spending was worthless. You want a high r-squared, and low coefficients mean the predictors are significant. Using a random forest with defaults: randomForest(formula = rate ~ spending + previous_rate, data = testdata) The variance explained = 47.14% Using previous_rate the variance explained is 34.8%. Using spending_change + previous_rate the variance explained is 29.0% Using spending the variance explained is 56.8% Using spending_change the variance explained is 0.01% I included the random forest results to show the methodology won't pick up the significance of spending_change here. The above is intended to show that you need the actual spending, and is not intended to be a recommendation of what modeling type to use.
