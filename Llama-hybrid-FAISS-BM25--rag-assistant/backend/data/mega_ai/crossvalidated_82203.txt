Differenced data USE: When the series resembles that of a random walk, taking first differences makes it stationary, so that it can be described as linear series representation of autoregressive or moving average terms. DO NOT USE: When the series appears to randomly fluctuate around its mean. Log-differenced USE: Similar to simple differencing but applied when the variance in the series is assumed to depend on the level. Or when the series is an index. DO NOT USE: When there's no such assumption or where the series is not strictly positive. Error term In classical time series decomposition you should proceed as follows: Decide on whether taking logs of original series is reasonable Decide on whether regression on time variable is reasonable Decide on whether to take differences of the residuals
