Instead of just straight sockets, you might consider a solution like AMQP . When you're talking about using socket connections for a pub/sub interface, that usually means point-to-point communication, which isn't always a scalable solution. AMQP really addresses this sort of pub/sub problem. It's free, it's open-source, and it works. Given that they've already solved the pub/sub problem, you might want to leverage off their work instead of doing it yourself. I recommend OpenAMQ. That being said, it really depends on what sort of environment you're working in. AMQP requires an AMQP broker (an application responsible for routing messages) to be running somewhere in the system.
