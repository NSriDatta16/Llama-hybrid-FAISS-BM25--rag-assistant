Playing small sounds in Java game

For the computer game I'm making, I obviously want to play sound. So far, I've been using AudioClip to play WAV files. While this approach works fine, the WAV files tend to be gigantic. A few seconds of sound end up being hundreds of kB. I'm faced with having a game download that's 95% audio! The obvious option here would be to use MP3 or Ogg Vorbis. But I've had limited success with this - I can play MP3 using JLayer (but it plays in the same thread). As for Ogg, I've had no luck at all. Worse, JLayer's legal status is a bit on the dubious side. So my question is to both Java developers and generally people who actually know something about sound: What do I do? Can I somehow "trim the fat" off my WAVs? Is there some way of playing Ogg in Java? Is there some other sound format I should use instead?
