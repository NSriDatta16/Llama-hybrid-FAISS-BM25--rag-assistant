You need to set up the notify icon as well. Either manually or via the toolbar (drag a notifyIcon onto your form) create the notifyIcon: this.notifyIcon = new System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon(components); Then add this code to Form_Load() : // Notify icon set up notifyIcon.Visible = true; notifyIcon.Text = "Tooltip message here"; this.ShowInTaskbar = false; this.Hide(); Though this will, as has been pointed out, briefly show the form before hiding it. From the accepted answer of this question , the solution appears to be to change: Application.Run(new Form1()); to: Form1 f = new Form1(); Application.Run(); in Main() .
