Linear Regression with Neural Net with betas as output

In a linear regression of multiple variables, $$ y = X\beta^T + \epsilon $$ , where $X$ and $y$ are the independent and dependent variables, we can estimate OLS $\beta$ as follows: $$ \hat \beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y $$ I wonder if it is possible to design a neural network such that given $X$ and $y$ (with a variable number of rows) as input, it will output $\hat \beta$ .
