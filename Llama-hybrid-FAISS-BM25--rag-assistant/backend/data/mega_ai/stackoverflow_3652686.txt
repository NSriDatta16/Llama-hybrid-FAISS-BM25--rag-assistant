Path to my C drive from php mail function

Hi I run an internal site site to organise our company events. I want a user to be able to send an email using php. The script is obviously on my server. When the user has has completed the email I want to pick up the email signature (HTML file) from the users own pc on a c drive and then include it in the mail program on my server . I have included a short bit of the code. I don't expect anybody to write code for me but can somebody help me get the right path to the users C drive. Thanks in advance $msg = " Test Email signature " ; $msg .= file_get_contents('C/Intranet/signatures/sig1.htm'); $email = new emailer; $email->subject = $type ; $email->body = $msg ; $email->from = "mwl707@googlemail.com" ; $email->to = "mwl707@googlemail.com" ; $email->sendmail() ; enter code here
