Suppose you have three different kinds of media outlets and that delays in coverage are exponential. None of the most common tests is ideal: (a) A standard ANOVA would not be idea because data are not normal and because variances are not the same (if populations differ). A Welch ANOVA test ( oneway.test in R) would accommodate to differences in variances. (b) Such an ANOVA on ranks would help to 'tame' the skewness of exponential data. (Taking logs of data, not shown here, might be another option.) (c) A Kruskal-Wallis test would not be ideal because (for exponential data) differences in delays are more about scale than location. Nevertheless, any of the three tests might be useful. (There are other options, which others on this site may choose to discuss.) Here are summaries and boxplots for some data simulated in R. In R, the parameter for an exponential distribution is the rate (inverse of mean): set.seed(611) x1 = rexp(10, 1); x2 = rexp(15, 1.5); x3 = rexp(20, .5) summary(x1); sd(x1) Min. 1st Qu.

For example, here are ad.hoc tests comparing the second and third (fake) 'media outlets' in my data: t.test(x2, x3) Welch Two Sample t-test data: x2 and x3 t = -3.0477, df = 24.763, p-value = 0.005418 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -2.2794258 -0.4405098 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 0.6068979 1.9668657 wilcox.test(x2,x3) Wilcoxon rank sum test data: x2 and x3 W = 64, p-value = 0.003435 alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
