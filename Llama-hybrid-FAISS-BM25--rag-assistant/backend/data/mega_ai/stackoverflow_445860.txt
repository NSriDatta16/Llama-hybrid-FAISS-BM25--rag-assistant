I use MediaTemple for my websites. They have a lot of professional organizations hosted on there servers. I'd probably go with them if I were you. My dad thought the server route would be easy and we found out differently the hard way. If you don't have a friend or an employee that really knows what he's doing, I'd be careful. Anyways, good luck.
