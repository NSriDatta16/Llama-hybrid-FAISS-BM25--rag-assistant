Determine if AR(p) model is causal stationary or invertible

I was going through these problems and think I figured out most of them both, but am having some troubles at one of the last steps. The question is for each of the following models: Express them using the backshift operator, state the autoregressive or moving average polynomial and use it to determine whether they are causal stationary or invertible. $$(1) X_t = 0.7X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$ $$(2) X_t = 1.8X_{t-1}-0.81X_{t-2}+\epsilon_t$$ For Question (1), I expressed it using the backshift operator $$(1-0.7B)X-t=\epsilon_t$$ And because it is an AR(1) model, it is causal stationary when $|\phi_1| . In this case, $|0.7| Meaning this model is causal stationary. Is that correct? For (2) expressed using backshift is $$(1-1.8B+0.81B^2)X_t = \epsilon_t$$ The root of this polynomial is $$z_{1,2}=\frac{1.8Â±\sqrt{0}}{1.62}=1.111$$ Except as this is not an AR(1) model like before I can't just check if $\phi_1 , so where do I go from here to determine causal stationarity/invertibility? Thanks in advance!!
