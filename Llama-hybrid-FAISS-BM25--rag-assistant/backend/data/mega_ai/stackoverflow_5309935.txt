I figured. The DOM element can and should be referenced prior when using data, and that wouldn't result in a performance hit thus (and we still maintain the DOM_Element-key-value relationship). So the initial look up for 'body' when storing the key-value is the only performance cost, and subsequent data retrievals don't have to find 'body' again: b = $('body'); b.data('key', 'value'); alert(b.data('key'));
