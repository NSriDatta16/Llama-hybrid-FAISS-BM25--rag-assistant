Memory management puzzlement for novice

As I'm pretty new to Objective-C and memory management, I was curious if this code was ok - First of all, code to return a UIImageView - -(UIImageView *)somethingAnimation { UIImageView *something = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"Something.png"]]; something.frame = CGRectMake(-100, -100, kSomethingWidth, kSomethingHeight); return something; // released later by the Swarmer object } Then the code which calls it, where UIImageView *something is declared in the interface then this is in the implementation - something = [controller somethingAnimation]; and later - [something release]; Is this correctly releasing everything? Seems to work without memory or crashing issues. Many thanks for any help.
