I nominate map-apply or maybe mapply if you want to just use it yourself or in a small group. (defun map-apply (fn arg-lists) (mapcar (lambda (arg-list) (apply fn arg-list)) arg-lists)) (map-apply #'+ '((1 2) (3 4 5))) => (3 12) EDIT Of course yours isn't just pseudo-Lisp if you have curry : (defun curry (f &rest values) (lambda (&rest more-values) (apply f (append values more-values))))
