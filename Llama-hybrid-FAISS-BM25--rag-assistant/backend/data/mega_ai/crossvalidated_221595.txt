Let's start with the main question, the interpretation of extremely high hazard ratios (HRs). As implicit in the comment from @Penguin_Knight, this is simply an issue of scales like, for example, in expressions of speed. A vehicle that is traveling at 100 km/hour has the same speed as one traveling at 100,000,000 millimeter/hour. An HR value is expressed as relative hazard per unit change in the predictor variable. If you, as in your example, change from fractional to percentage units then you will lower the numerical value of the HR by a factor of 100. Same actual relative hazard in any real sense, just different units. In your case, the problem is exacerbated by your choice of predictor variable. The tr.ma variable is an (averaged) fractional (or percentage) rate of change of some variable of interest, which we shall call $X$. Let's start with the simple case where there is a single value of tr.ma associated with each case at the time of entry into the study, a value which does not change with time. I see two issues here. First, how is one supposed to understand the interpretation of the associated hazard ratio: the change in hazard per percentage change of the rate of change of $X$? That requires a good deal of explanation. Can be done, but it's rather complicated; you're asking the reader to evaluate something like an acceleration. Second, the use of a ratio or percentage as a predictor variable poses difficulties. What happens, for example, if the value of $X$ is small, close to 0? Furthermore, you are throwing out information about the actual value of $X$. In regression, whether Cox or otherwise, for these and other reasons you will typically be better off including the actual values of the variables that go into the ratio, rather than using their ratio as a single predictor. If $X$ is necessarily positive in value, you could include the log of its present value and the log of some past value as predictors; if the rate of change of $X$ with time is truly a useful predictor, then the signs of the coefficients of these log-transformed values should be of opposite sign and approximately equal magnitude. If there is a more complicated (or interesting) relation of $X$ to survival, then you may find it by including both contributors to your percentage change of $X$ but you would miss it if you restricted yourself to the percentage change as the only predictor. With 46 events you should be able to handle 2 predictors without overfitting. Finally, there is the issue of whether tm.ma (or some other functions of $X$, as recommended) is a time-dependent predictor. If this value can change between the start time and the event/censoring time for an individual, and you think that the current value (rather than simply its value at the start time) is related to the hazard of having an event, then you need to set this up as an analysis with time-dependent covariates. The survival package in R has a vignette explaining how to handle time-dependent covariates. I can't say whether these suggestions will solve your problem with non-proportional hazards, but they may well help.
