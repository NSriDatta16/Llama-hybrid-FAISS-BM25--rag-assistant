How do I enumerate() over a list of tuples in Python?

I've got some code like this: letters = [('a', 'A'), ('b', 'B')] i = 0 for (lowercase, uppercase) in letters: print "Letter #%d is %s/%s" % (i, lowercase, uppercase) i += 1 I've been told that there's an enumerate() function that can take care of the "i" variable for me: for i, l in enumerate(['a', 'b', 'c']): print "%d: %s" % (i, l) However, I can't figure out how to combine the two: How do I use enumerate when the list in question is made of tuples? Do i have to do this? letters = [('a', 'A'), ('b', 'B')] for i, tuple in enumerate(letters): (lowercase, uppercase) = tuple print "Letter #%d is %s/%s" % (i, lowercase, uppercase) Or is there a more elegant way?
