While I'm one whose all for consistency, I'm also against micromanaging every bit of style. Having a huge list of coding conventions, particularly when some of them seem arbitrary, is part of what discourages people from following them. I think coding guidelines should be streamlined to the most valuable practices that improve the -ilities. How much is readability, maintainability, performance, etc improved by mandating this practice? While my personal practice is to not to call super() in such a case, its not serious enough that I would include it in the coding guidelines or call it a defect in reviewing other programmer's code. I would however still however mention it and discuss it in code reviews (not as a defect, just as a question of style) in an attempt to lobby more engineers to NOT use the call.
