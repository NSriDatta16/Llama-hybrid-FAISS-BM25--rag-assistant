@zetetic I did have a method called complete, I renamed this but the problem was still occurring. The problem occurred for all the following values: "disposition"=>"Dispose", "complete"=>"false", "storage"=>"Local", "contract_maintenance"=>"0" These values were received using normal form selectors rather than rails ones. That was the only thing I could find that they had in common. I ended up running some experimental tests and found that the values were not being stored withing the decommission object, but rather in their own. So in the controller I ran a few extra lines to set the values within the decommission object to equal the parameters associated with it: @decommission.storage = params[:storage] @decommission.contract_maintenance = params[:contract_maintenance] @decommission.disposition = params[:disposition] @decommission.complete = false
