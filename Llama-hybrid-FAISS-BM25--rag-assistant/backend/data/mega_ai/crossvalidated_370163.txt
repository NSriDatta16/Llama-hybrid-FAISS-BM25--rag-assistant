Problem getting SD from a 95% CI of a probability

I'm working on a simulation designed to investigate fertility, birth control, etc. One of the inputs to the simulation is the probability that a given ovulatory cycle is capable of producing a pregnancy, termed cycle viability . Being a Monte Carlo simulation, I need to be able to generate random samples from the distribution of cycle viabilities. (So, to be clear, the distribution function yields the probability of a probability!) Cycle viability is estimated in a 1995 paper from Weinberg et al. as 0.37, which is given with a 95% confidence interval of [0.31, 0.48]. There were 221 women and 625 cycles included in the analysis. My understanding of confidence intervals is only rather informal and rough. The first thing that caught my attention was that the mean is not in the center of the confidence interval . Does this mean that the distribution is not Gaussian? If not, what would be a reasonable distribution for me to sample from? I found instructions for obtaining the standard deviation from the 95% C.I., as follows: $\sigma = \sqrt{N}\ \cdot\ \frac{upper\_limit\ -\ lower\_limit}{3.92}$ I'm assuming N=221 and not N=625, because you can't get a probability from a single event and furthermore the latter produces an unrealistically high SD. That gives me SD=0.6447, but this is problematic because it implies a 1SD range of [-0.2747, 1.0147], but the variable under investigation, itself a probability, would be nonsensical outside of the [0,1] range. I could just clamp my samples to [0,1], and I would be comfortable to do so if the 2SD range was close to fitting within [0,1], but with the 1SD range's lower bound already being 27% outside of the logical range, I'm afraid 0 would be grossly over-represented in the sample. Where am I going wrong here and what would I have to do to generate reasonable random samples of cycle viability (i.e., what would be a reasonable PDF and how would I find reasonable parameters from the information available)?
