You don't absolutely need to have Visual Studio to create a SharePoint 2007 site. You can definitely get away with using notepad if your web site doesn't been compiled code. You may have some requirements that require some custom code. It all comes down to your requirements. I try to avoid using Visual Studio for writing features. Even some basic webpart can be written without using any code behind and using out of the box SharePoint controls. Visual Studio is very handy for source control (connectivity with TFS) and generally structuring your solution to match the requirements of the WSP file. Of course you should use Visual Studio to compile your assemblies. :) The general set up would be Visual Studio with WSP Builder extension installed (look on codeplex ). If then you create the correct folder structure inside your VS project, the generation of your WSP will become much easier. Having said this, you can create wsp files (which is just a renamed cab file) using WSP Builder. Once you've created your WSP, you can deploy this via stsadm commands (google this). I would suggest having a batch file as a deployment script. This might help with your initial setup: http://blog.zebsadiq.com/post/SharePoint-2007-installation-in-2010.aspx p.s. Definitely avoid making any changes through SharePoint designer, you should learn about the consequences before you change any files on your site with it. Forgot to mention: SharePoint desginer is great for formulating web part html. If you're new, you probably wondering a) where do I find the syntax for a basic out of the box web part b) How do I tweak that syntax to get the results that I need... Best way to do this would be to connect to the site, create a dummy page, add the web part to the page (drag and drop) and tweak it via the SharePoint Designer UI, then once you're satisfied, switch to html view, copy the web part syntax and paste it into the file on the file system. You can then delete the dummy page if you want or use it for configuring other web parts. The point is, though SharePoint designer has its flaws and you may be right to avoid it as your main method of development, its definitely got some features that make it worth while having available while developing.
