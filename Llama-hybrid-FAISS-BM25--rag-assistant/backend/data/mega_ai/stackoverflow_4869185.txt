Rails: Why don't the child classes get loaded when using class method to return attributes about child classes?

Hello I've been searching for a solution for this for a while. Using Rails 2.3.5 I have a parent class with several child classes and for the sake of not having a file that's 1500 lines long I have the child classes kept in a subdirectory of the app/models directory. Up until recently when I viewed this post: here I couldn't even get the child classes to load Now I want access each child in a manner using the self.inherited class method like this: class Project Temporarily, I put some debug statements to get a better picture of how things are getting loaded. I fired up the console and noticed this behavior: >> Project require_or_load /Users/frankdrebin/Sites/cerp/app/models/project.rb loading /Users/frankdrebin/Sites/cerp/app/models/project require_or_load /Users/frankdrebin/Sites/cerp/app/models/status.rb loading /Users/frankdrebin/Sites/cerp/app/models/status => Project(id: integer, url: string, deadline: date, state: string, type: string, priority: integer, status_id: integer) >> Project::CHILDREN => [] >> ArticleProject require_or_load /Users/frankdrebin/Sites/cerp/app/models/projects/article_project.rb loading /Users/frankdrebin/Sites/cerp/app/models/projects/article_project CHILDREN.inspect: [ArticleProject(id: integer, url: string, deadline: date, state: string, type: string, priority: integer, status_id: integer)] require_or_load /Users/frankdrebin/Sites/cerp/vendor/gems/state_machine- 0.7.3/lib/state_machine.rb loading /Users/frankdrebin/Sites/cerp/vendor/gems/state_machine-0.7.3/lib/state_machine => ArticleProject(id: integer, url: string, deadline: date, state: string, type: string, priority: integer, status_id: integer) >> Project::CHILDREN => [ArticleProject(id: integer, url: string, deadline: date, state: string, type: string, priority: integer, status_id: integer)] >> I am sure there are less elegant solutions to this, such as putting the Child Classes all back into one gigantic file but I'd like to avoid this if at all possible. Thanks
