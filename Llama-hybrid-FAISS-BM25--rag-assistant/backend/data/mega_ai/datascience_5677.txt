How should I create a single score with two values as input?

I have two series of values, a and b as inputs and I want to create a score, c, which reflects both of them equally. The distribution of a and b are below In both cases, the x-axis is just an index. How should I go about creating an equation c = f(a,b) such that a and b are (on average) represented equally in c? Edit: c = (a+b)/2 or c = ab will not work because c will be too heavily weighted by a or b. I need a function, f, where c = f(a,b) and c' = f(a + stdev(a),b) = f(a, b + stdev(b))
