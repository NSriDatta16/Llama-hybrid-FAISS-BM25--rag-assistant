Assuming that Trial is a dichotomous variable taking values 0 and 1, then The 95% confidence interval for Trial (0.07 - 0.63) is for the difference of the average RT between Trial=1 and Trial=0 . The 95% confidence interval for sd_Trial|ID (1.49 - 1.95) is for the standard deviation of the random subject-specific differences between Trial=1 and Trial=0 .
