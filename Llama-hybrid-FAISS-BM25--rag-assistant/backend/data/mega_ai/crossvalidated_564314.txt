This is nested cross validation (CV). The test data is used to estimate the error of that run. Then, you average the errors obtained over each run's test data. This completes the outer part of CV. Its purpose is to estimate the real world performance of your procedure . The validaton data is for tuning the hyper-parameters. In your case, this can be number of epochs, number of hidden dimensions etc. The best performing model on the validation fold is selected to estimate the performance on the test set. In the final run, where you're going to deploy the model, it's still preferable to have train+validation+test split, so that you can still optimize the hyper-parameters and do a final check on the test data.
