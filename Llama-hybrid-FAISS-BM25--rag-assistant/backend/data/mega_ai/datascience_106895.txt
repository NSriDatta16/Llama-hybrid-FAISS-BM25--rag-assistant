Machine Learning resources

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but is there any online source that provides a complete in-depth explanation of Machine Learning algorithms, all at one place , but not too complicated for a beginner to understand? Every source I refer to either covers the topics superficially or focuses on only one aspect of the algorithm which makes me waste a big chunk of my study time going through different websites & videos looking for the same.
