This was still a problem for me after following the steps proposed above. Here's the solution that finally worked for us. Turn on IIS logging on your local machine. Be sure to log the query string and the HTTP response code. Attempt to open your solution and let it time out. Perform an iisreset to flush the IIS logs. Open the IIS logs. You will notice that when you opened your solution you generated quite a bit of activity. VS2003, for whatever reason, attempts to navigate to some of your pages... in particular, it may navigate to your login page if you have forms authentication turned on. Check the processing time and HTTP response code in the log entry for your login page. In our case it was returning a 302 HTTP redirect. In our code, the login page starts up by checking for a cookie and redirecting to an external page if it isn't found. This redirect is to a location that is not accessible in the dev env. So VS would open the page, follow the redirect, and time out trying to get the page. We fixed it by modifying the login page with the following code: //If Request is coming from Visual Studio, just return an error if (Request.UserAgent.StartsWith("Microsoft-Visual-Studio.NET")) { Response.StatusCode = 500; Response.End(); } Visual Studio can handle the 500. It can't handle a 302 to an unknown host. Hope this helps.
