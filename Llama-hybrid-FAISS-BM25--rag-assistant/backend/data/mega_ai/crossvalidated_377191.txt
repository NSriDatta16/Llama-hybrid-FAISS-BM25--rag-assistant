I think that the crucial difference between BCI and FCI is that Bayesians calculate the probability conditional on the observed number of chips, i.e., they calculate the posterior probability and find the interval while frequentists don't. Let's repeat your modified experiment many times. For a frequentist the 70% is the ratio of the number of right answer she made over the number of all repetitions. For a Bayesian, the 70% is the ratio of the number of right answer he made over the observed number of each possible number of chips. Let your friend choose a jar randomly with the uniform probability. In the modified case, a frequentist reads the third table given in the answer you linked. Then she makes some numbers bold so that the ratio of the sum of the bold numbers over the sum of all numbers is to be 0.7 (while in the original case, she reads each columns independently as explained in the answer). A Bayesian with uniform prior (or the uniform pick up process is known) reads each row of the third table independently. Then, for each row, he makes some numbers bold so that the ratio of the sum of the bold numbers over the sum of the numbers in the row is to be 0.7. Then the FCI of the modified ensemble of experiments is still the same one as the original case. The relative frequency of each possible event (jar type, number of chips) is the same with the original one and so nothing changes.
