create an incrementing Int as your internal PK. Yields superior fill factors for your storage and indexing performance. create a hash, composite key, or GUID as an external AK - this value should be the one exposed on forms etc. US Drivers Licence # is a great example of contrived composite keys - generated from unique random number plus some arbitary combination of the driver name characters. never have a GUID as a Clustered index - it causes terrible page fill issues
