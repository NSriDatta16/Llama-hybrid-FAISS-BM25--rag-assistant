How to visualise multidimensional categorical data with additional time dimension

I am trying to visualize a dataset that registers the career of people in an organisation and their backgrounds before starting in that particular organisation. I 'd like to show how individuals are positioned in the space based on their background areas and show the evolution through time in the beginning of each decade. I have seen the answers here but my data are much more categorical and also, ideally, I 'd like to display all three background categories (see below) at the same time A sample of my data follows: Person BkgArea1 BkgArea2 BkgArea3 TotalSize YearFrom YearTo P1 3 2 0 5 1959 1965 P2 0 2 1 3 1959 1967 P3 3 0 2 5 1991 2008 P4 3 0 0 3 1959 1980 P5 3 0 0 3 1981 1998 P6 0 2 1 3 2006 2014 P7 2 2 2 6 2008 2014 P8 0 0 3 3 1991 1996 P9 3 3 1 7 1966 1972 P10 3 0 2 5 1975 1991 P11 3 2 0 5 1998 2013 P12 3 1 0 4 2004 2013 P13 0 2 0 2 1998 2010 P14 0 3 0 3 2003 2008 P15 1 2 3 6 1998 2008 P16 3 0 2 5 1973 1977 P17 1 3 0 4 1998 2012 P18 3 0 2 5 1996 2008 P19 0 3 1 4 1998 2011 P20 3 2 0 5 1998 2006 P21 3 0 0 3 1986 1989 P22 0 3 2 5 1996 2014 P23 3 2 3 8 1959 1976 P24 3 2 0 5 1998 2001 P25 0 0 3 3 1998 2011 P26 3 3 2 8 1965 1992 P27 2 3 2 7 2010 2014 P28 3 2 2 7 1986 1998 P29 3 3 0 6 2013 2014 P30 0 3 2 5 1976 1977 P31 3 3 0 6 1986 1987 P32 0 2 2 4 1980 1990 P33 3 0 2 5 1975 1986 P34 0 3 3 6 1977 1991 P35 3 2 2 7 1963 1974 P36 3 3 0 6 1998 2001 P37 0 2 3 5 1998 2004 P38 0 3 2 5 1974 1980 P39 3 2 3 8 1989 1998 P40 0 3 3 6 1991 1998 P41 0 1 2 3 1998 2001 P42 0 2 0 2 2003 2012 P43 3 3 3 9 1973 1986 P44 3 2 1 6 1978 1986 P45 0 2 0 2 2002 2012 P46 0 3 3 6 1982 1988 P47 0 3 0 3 1992 1998 P48 3 2 2 7 1998 2004 P49 2 2 0 4 2012 2014 P50 3 2 2 7 2008 2014 The values in columns BkgArea1-3 are essentially categorical values, that indicate the strength of an individual in a specific category. It is thus 0: no background, 1: weak background, 2: average background, 3: strong background . The TotalSize column is the sum of the scores of the individuals The initial idea was to assign basic colors to BkgAreas 1-3, namely Red, Green, Blue, and then colour the individuals according to the mixture of their backgrounds, weighing each color with the strength of each area, i.e. 2/3 * Red if an individual has score 2 in BkgArea1, etc. I then tried to display the area as 3d scatter plot but it looks very complicated and hard to interpret. I also tried to apply Multiple Correspondence Analysis but I haven't got very satisfying results. Do you have any ideas as of how to represent this dataset? UPDATE After people having posted various useful answers but not 100% covering the representation needs, I summarize what I would like to achieve: Group/cluster the individuals according to their backgrounds and relative to the three background areas. if someone has scores in more than one of them, they should be displayed somewhere in the middle. Show, visually if possible, the number of individuals and the TotalSize of the individuals. This could be a cloud Show the development of the organization. I think this might be easy to do with stacked column charts or histograms RadViz can be a method to solve 1 and 2, or at least I am inclined toward that representation. The problem in my data is that individuals under RadViz will be placed at very specific points so we lose somewhat the track of how many individuals have specific background characteristics
