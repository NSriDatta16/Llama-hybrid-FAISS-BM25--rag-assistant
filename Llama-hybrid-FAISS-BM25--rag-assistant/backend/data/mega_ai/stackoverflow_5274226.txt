I used for this purpose the java instrumentation api . With the java instrumentation api you can modify any class bytecode at runtime and you can add some code (like AOP). A example of how to instrument java classes and methods at runtime using javassist is on my github. https://github.com/kreyssel/maven-examples/tree/master/javaagent You can simply modify the LoggerAgent.java and remove the logging statements and add your Thread.dumpStack() . The only thing you change in your production runtime is to add the agent jar to the java command line. -javaagent:jarpath[=options] Another blog post you can read here .
