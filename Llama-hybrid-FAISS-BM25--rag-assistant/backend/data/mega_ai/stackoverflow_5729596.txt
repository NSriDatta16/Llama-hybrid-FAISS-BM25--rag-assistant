How to elegantly compare an enum to a DataTable cell?

In our application we work with DataTable s a lot. This is dictated by the interface to a another system. Often a column in one of these DataTable's is in fact an enumeration, which is then of a Int16 datatype. Currently we use magic constants all over the place, but that isn't pretty. A real enum would be much better, but how can you write an elegant comparison? Especially considering that a DBNull is also sometimes a valid value. Ideally we would write this: if ( tbl.Rows[0]["EnumColumn"] == MyEnum.SomeValue ) // Do stuff But, naturally, that will not work. The closest to what I can come is: if ( tbl.Rows[0]["EnumColumn"] != DBNull.Value && Convert.ToInt32(tbl.Rows[0]["EnumColumn") == (int)MyEnum.SomeValue ) // DO stuff Which looks plain ugly. Any ideas on how to make this prettier and easier to write?
