I think you first need to find out which solution is better for the user, before solving the technical details. You can do that by organizing usability testing. It can be a pretty lightweight process if you use the techniques as described by Steve Krug in Rocket Surgery Made Easy. (Or his previous book, don't make me think). If you need another solution: why not have a single ajaxy autocomplete search box that contains all the possible module access menu items? That way the user doesn't need to scroll through a lot of lists and you keep the visual clutter to a minimum.
