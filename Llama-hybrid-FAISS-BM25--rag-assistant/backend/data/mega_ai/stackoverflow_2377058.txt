I'll go ahead and put one out there: Java Web Start applet support . I like to play around with JOGL , and it's so nice to be able to just use a short jnlp file and not have to write classloaders, code to download native library code, etc. to handle getting JOGL through the browser. (yes I know about JOGL's appletloader thing) Just one line of my JNLP file loads the JOGL jars, its dependencies (gluegen, nativewindow, newt), and the appropriate native libraries for the current system. The rest of my jnlp file is just for the title of my application and the URL of its JAR file, and that's about it. By the way, this was introduced in JDK 6u10 .
