About the FC layer in a CNN

So we know that the major disadvantage of pushing images through an ANN is due to the loss of information, particularly spatial information. But in regards to CNNs, in the last layer of the convolutions just before the fully connected layer, is there some form of flattening of the convolved layer just before we feed it into the Multi layer net? If so then, just like ANNs, wouldnâ€™t we be losing some representation of features or the order in which its represented? P.S My take on the answer would be that since we go through a process of continuously convolving and pooling, by the time we get to the fully connected layer we would have extracted the features that are invariant of location so now all we have to do is understand the connection between the pixels via ANNs?
