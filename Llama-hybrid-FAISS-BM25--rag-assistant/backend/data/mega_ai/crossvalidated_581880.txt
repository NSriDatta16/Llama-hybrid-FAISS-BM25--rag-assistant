What is the difference between Variational Inference and Variational EM?

I have been reading about variational inference and it is relation to Bayesian regression. It seems there are two versions The first version is discussed here. The second version is discussed here. What is the difference between the two versions? I know that variational EM is closer to the EM algorithm. However, how is this different to variational inference?
