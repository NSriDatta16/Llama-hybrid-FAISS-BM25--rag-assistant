Let's take a look at a specific country; data for the USA For all women, 15 to 44: 47.1% had 0 kids 16.9% had 1 20.4% had 2 10.4% had 3 3.4% had 4 1.5% had 5 or 6 0.3% had 7 or more. which averages (making a couple assumptions) to $1.13$ kids per woman. A Poisson with $\lambda = 1.13$ gives: 0 = 32% 1 = 37% 2 = 21% 3 = 7.5% 4 = 2.1% 5 = 0.4% more = 0.1% so, at least for the USA, it's not Poisson. Perhaps a zero inflated negative binomial would work.
