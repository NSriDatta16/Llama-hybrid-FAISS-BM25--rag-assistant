What languages/environments have you used for developing scientific software, esp. data analysis? What libraries? (E.g., what do you use for plotting?) My undergraduate physics department taught LabVIEW classes and used it extensively in its research projects. The other alternative is MATLAB , in which I have no experience. There are camps for either product; each has its own advantages/disadvantages. Depending on what kind of problems you need to solve, one package may be more preferable than the other. Regarding data analysis, you can use whatever kind of number cruncher you want. Ideally, you can do the hard calculations in language X and format the output to plot nicely in Excel, Mathcad , Mathematica , or whatever the flavor du jour plotting system is. Don't expect standardization here. Did you have anything like version control, bug tracking? Looking back, we didn't, and it would have been easier for us all if we did. Nothing like breaking everything and struggling for hours to fix it! Definitely use source control for any common code. Encourage individuals to write their code in a manner that could be made more generic. This is really just coding best practices. Really, you should have them teaching (or taking) a computer science class so they can get the basics. How would you go about trying to create a decent environment for programming, without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists (esp. physicists are stubborn people!) There is a clear split between data aquisition (DAQ) and data analysis. Meaning, it's possible to standardize on the DAQ and then allow the scientists to play with the data in the program of their choice.
