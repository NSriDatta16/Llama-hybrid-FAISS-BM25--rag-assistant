Consider two ways of doing the same thing: PreparedStatement stmt = conn.createStatement("INSERT INTO students VALUES('" + user + "')"); stmt.execute(); Or PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO student VALUES(?)"); stmt.setString(1, user); stmt.execute(); If "user" came from user input and the user input was Robert'); DROP TABLE students; -- Then in the first instance, you'd be hosed. In the second, you'd be safe and Little Bobby Tables would be registered for your school.
