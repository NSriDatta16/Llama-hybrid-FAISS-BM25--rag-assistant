PHP Function Organization

I am writing a pretty basic php app and have created a pretty big mess of functions to do various things, e.g. display_user_nav(), display_user_list() etc. I want a way to organize these in a logical way. What I really need is something like a ruby module, but I haven't been able to find a php equivalent. I also feel that from a programming standpoint they don't belong in classes, as I already have a User object to contain information for one user, and don't want to have to create and store a new object whenever I want to use them. What I am doing now: display_user_table() display_user_edit_form() What I kind of want to be able to do (sort of like Ruby): User_Functions::Display::Table() User_Functions::Display::Edit_Form() Any suggestions are appreciated.
