IPW up-weights individuals that are causally relevant and down-weights individuals that are causally irrelevant . Causally relevant control units are those with values similar to the those of the treated units, and vice versa. Causally irrelevant control units are those that bear little resemblance to treated units. A control unit with a propensity score of 0.9 is an unusual control unit but looks very similar to treated units; therefore, it is up-weighted because it does a good job of representing the outcome of a treated unit had they instead received control. The reason for doing this is so that the weighted outcomes of the control units simulate what the outcomes of the treated units would have been had they received control, which is the causal quantity of interest. Weighting by the variance is used to reduce the influence of outliers or poorly measured units (i.e., observations we have less confidence in), but weighting by the propensity score is used to reduce the influence of causally irrelevant units so that we can compare treated and control units validly. Note that there are extensions to this method that weight individuals differently. Overlap weights weight treated units by $(1-ps)$ and control units by $(ps)$ (note no inverse occurs) (Li, et al. 2017). This also serves to improve overlap but up-weights those with propensity scores close to .5 (i.e., those who could have received treatment or control with approximately equal probability). Chan et al's (2016) empirical balancing calibration weights solve a three-way balancing problem: weight the treated and control units to minimize the imbalance between the treated and the control units, between the treated and the overall sample, and between the control and the overall sample. Li and Green's (2013) matching weights weight individuals in such a way to as simulate 1:1 matching. Remember that the key is balance, and any weights that achieve balance are valid weights for reducing confounding. Chan, K. C. G., Yam, S. C. P., & Zhang, Z. (2016).
