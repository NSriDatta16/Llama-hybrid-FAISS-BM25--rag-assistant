When you ship a file with your application, it doesn't get stored in IsolatedStorage. You need use the conventional way of opening a file that ships with the XAP - XDocument xdoc = XDocument.Load("ClientBin/customers.xml"); var customers = from query in xdoc.Descendants("Customer") select new Customer { Name = (string)query.Element("Name"), Employees = (int)query.Element("Employees"), Phone = (string)query.Element("Phone") }; // Data bind to listbox listBox1.ItemsSource = customers; HTH, indyfromoz
