Why use maximum likelihood for a Bayesian problem? Nevertheless, the problem with two nonnegative parameters can be solved in several ways: Using a solver which admits restrictions. Maybe more practical, reparametrize the parameter, if it is $\theta_0 \ge 0$ , represent it in the model as $\theta=\log \theta_0$ . That admittedly also avoids the value zero, but it seems that's ok with you.
