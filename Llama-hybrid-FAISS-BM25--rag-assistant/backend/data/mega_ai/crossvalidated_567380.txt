In a time series forecasting, should we apply differencing on entire dataset if one or two features are non stationary?

I'm working on a time series forecasting model using VAR (Vector Autoregression). I have 6 features, out of which 2 features are not stationary. If I apply first-order differencing on those features, they are stationary. Should I apply differencing on entire dataset or should I apply on only those 2 features?
