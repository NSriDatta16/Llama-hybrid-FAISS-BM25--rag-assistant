Windows Mobile and storage location

On a Windows desktop system settings should be saved in the AppData folder for many reasons, including write access without being admin and the possibility to have different settings for different users. But what is the recommended way for Windows Mobile (.NET CF) applications? As far as I know there is just one user, so that argument doesn’t apply. You also get a choice during installation to pick either the SD card or the device, and I guess you’d expect most of the files in the place you choose? My app contains the following types of files: Skins (users can add their own, ~200KB/skin) Voices (users can add their own, ~1MB/voice) Log files (small to large in size, depending on logging level) XML files where I store the actual data and settings generated by my application. Which of the above should go into application data and why?
