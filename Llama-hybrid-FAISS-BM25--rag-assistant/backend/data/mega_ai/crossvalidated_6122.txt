Simple and multiple logistic regression

I have almost two questions. I need a single covariate logistic regression (LR) for each of my variables. Should I do it manually in SPSS, selecting each variable and do logistic regression? Is there a "for each" cycle to do it? I should switch to R language to have what I want. In the multivariables (multi covariates) LR, could I have missing values? Thanks!!
