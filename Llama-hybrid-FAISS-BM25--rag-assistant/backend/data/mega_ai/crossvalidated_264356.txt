In regression models not all observations have the same influence on the final model and points which have more than most are said to be high-leverage points. We define the leverage of the $i$th observation as $$ h_{ii} = [\mathbf{H}]_{ii} $$ where $\mathbf{H}$ is the projection matrix $$ \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T $$ The bounds on $h_{ii}$ are zero and unity. Points with $h_{ii} = 1$ effectively use a whole parameter to fit them. Textbooks on regression will usually mention the topic and a full-length treatment of this and related topics is available in Cook, R D and Weisberg, S Residuals and influence in regression 1982, Chapman and Hall
