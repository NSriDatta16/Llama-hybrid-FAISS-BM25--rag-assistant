Java performance tips

I have a program I ported from C to Java. Both apps use quicksort to order some partitioned data (genomic coordinates). The Java version runs fast, but I'd like to get it closer to the C version. I am using the Sun JDK v6u14. Obviously I can't get parity with the C application, but I'd like to learn what I can do to eke out as much performance as reasonably possible (within the limits of the environment). What sorts of things can I do to test performance of different parts of the application, memory usage, etc.? What would I do, specifically? Also, what tricks can I implement (in general) to change the properties and organization of my classes and variables, reducing memory usage and improving speed? EDIT : I am using Eclipse and would obviously prefer free options for any third-party tools. Thanks!
