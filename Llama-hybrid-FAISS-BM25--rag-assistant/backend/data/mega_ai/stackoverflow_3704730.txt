MySQL offers you a feature called partitioning. You can do a horizontal partition and split your tables by rows. 8 Million isn't that much, how is the insertion rate per week? CREATE TABLE MyVeryLargeTable ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, my_date DATE -- your other columns ) PARTITION BY HASH (YEARWEEK(my_date)) PARTITIONS 4; You can read more about it here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/partitioning.html Edit: This one creates 4 partitions, so this will last for 4 weeks - therefore I suggest changing to partitions based on months / year. Partition limit is quite high but this is really a question how the insertion rate per week/month/year looks like. Edit 2 MySQL5.0 comes with an Archive Engine, you should use this for your Archive table ( http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/storage-engine.html ). Now how to get your data into the archive table? It seems like you have to write a cron-job that runs on the beginning of every week, moving all records to the archive table and deleting them from the original one. You could write a stored procedure for this but the cron-job needs to run on the shell. Keep in mind this could affect your data integrity in some way. What about upgrading to MySQL 5.1?
