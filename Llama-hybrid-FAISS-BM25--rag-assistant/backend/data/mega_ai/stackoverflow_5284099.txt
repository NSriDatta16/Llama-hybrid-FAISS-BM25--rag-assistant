Please help me choosing: Django, Drupal, PHP framework, JSP

I can't decide what web technology is good for me. I need something to make quite simple web apps, with single relational database, authentication, social features. Imagine for example a "Desktop wallpapers sharing community". These are my personal pro/cons of the various technologies I tried (everything is related to MY experience): DRUPAL (+) large community (+) cheap hosting (+) great modules available (+) content types, views, SEO (-) not a real framework (can't imagine how to make simple queries/operations) (-) templating is so non-natural to me (-) i hate working with those "blocks" (-) difficult to modify/create modules (-) don't like php DJANGO (+) i enjoy working with python (+) very flexible with templating (in love with inheritance) (+) very good built-in ORM that suits my needs (+) great documentation and good community resources (+) great security features (+) clean url system (-) not so cheap hosting (-) tricky with static files, external resources (-) i'm not too good at it, yet (making a good blog requires some days of work to me) haven't tried to deploy/publish a django website. don't know how it is difficult. PHP FRAMEWORKS (example: CodeIgniter/Kohana) (+) tons of cheap hosting services (+) fast development (great results with less code) (+) huge amount of ready-to-use libraries (-) not great documentation (-) don't like php (-) i find the django ORM by far superior (-) security?! JSP (+) i've been working with java for years (+) persistence API (-) is java dying? (-) expensive hosting (-) "heavy" workflow for basic tasks (-) old url scheme organization I'd like to read your opinions. I have to find a technology I can use for all of my web projects (including "normal" websites with content editing features, for my clients). I strongly would like to use only one of them, for everything. But I really can't decide which is worth to study in depth, in order to get a job in the future too! Thank you.
