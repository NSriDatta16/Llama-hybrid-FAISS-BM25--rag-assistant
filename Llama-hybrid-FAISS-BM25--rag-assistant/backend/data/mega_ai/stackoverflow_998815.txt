As mentioned, it doesn't really matter where you go first. But the most usual tree traversal algorithms. If this tree is organized the way I think, inorder would be recommended: (from wikipedia)To traverse a non-empty binary tree in inorder, perform the following operations recursively at each node: Traverse the left subtree. Visit the root. Traverse the right subtree. (This is also called Symmetric traversal.)
