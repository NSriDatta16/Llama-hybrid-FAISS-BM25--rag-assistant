Using UIViewController with a UIView - (Want to use UIScrollView instead) - How to make the switch

I need to implement a scrolling window in order to accommodate all the items on the form I am creating. My current implementation is a UIViewController (that's vcAddCourse) and it has a UIView in it with my current form. Here is what I have done to add the UIScrollView into the equation. 1) Using IB, I dragged a uiscrollview object 'into' the existing uiview object. 2) Using IB, Ctrl-dragged from file owner to the IBOutlet I created for the new uiscrollview Here is how I init this controller. 3) I made sure that all the items on my form were now dragged to be under the UIScrollview object. Finally, over in my .m file, in the ViewdidLoad() function, I added the following line: theScroller.contentSize=CGSizeMake(328, 680); No joy. I see the form but it does not scroll. Note: this on iphone simulator. What else must I do to swap out the UIView for the new UIScrollView? Thanks!
