I agree with Jamiegs. Blogging is by and large a solved problem. Why not use an existing package? Most packages will include much more than anything you'd put together in your spare time not to mention that you'll benefit from all of the field testing too. I settled on hosted Wordpress and just pointed my domain there. Hosted Wordpress is somewhat more limited than self-hosted (you can't install your own themes, etc...) but I've hardly found it restrictive. Their documentation around the various shortcodes for displaying source code or embedding maps is pretty complete.
