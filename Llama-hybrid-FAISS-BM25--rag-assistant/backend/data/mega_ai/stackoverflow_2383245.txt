Installing the gem system_timer on Windows

Has anybody here successfully installed the system_timer gem on Windows? I have devkit on my machine and I am able to install other native gems. I get the following error when I install the gem. In file included from system_timer_native.c:2: c:/Ruby19/include/ruby-1.9.1/ruby/backward/rubysig.h:14:2: warning: #warning rubysig.h is obsolete system_timer_native.c: In function `install_timer': system_timer_native.c:28: error: storage size of 'timer_interval' isn't known system_timer_native.c:33: warning: implicit declaration of function `sigprocmask' The gem home page states that it doesn't work on Windows SystemTimer only works on UNIX platforms (Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, BSD, â€¦). You can install the gem on Microsoft Windows, but you will only get a convenience shell wrapping a simple call to timeout.rb under the cover. I am on Ruby 1.9, Since the threading model is different in 1.9, I am wondering if gem will work in 1.9.
