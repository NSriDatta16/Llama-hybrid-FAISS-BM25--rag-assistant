1) .6685 * 365 = 244; .6712 * 365 = 245. These are your days of the year, but expressed as fractions. So it's .6685 through the 2018 year. 2) There's not an easy, simple answer to this. You're already using auto.arima, so you're less likely to reduce errors by tuning arima. You could try the ets function from the forecast package and that will pick an optimized exponential smoothing model. There are many other time series methods as well. Are there other regressors you could add (like events or holidays or level shifts)? Can you do more aggregation of your data (either in some kind of categorical hierarchy or by time)? These are all things that could help you capture more signal and lead to lower forecast error.
