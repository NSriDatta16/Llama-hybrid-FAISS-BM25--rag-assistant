The Wikipedia entry claims: An alternative implementation exists for the .NET platform, but it has not been kept up to date. (citation needed) The "limitations" section of the FAQ has this entry: Does Scala work on .Net? Yes, the current Scala distribution can compile program for the .Net platform. The .Net platform has many similarities to Java but it has also many idiosyncrasies, making maintaining this port is a complicated task. The MSIL/.Net version of Scala implements at this stage virtually the entire Scala language, and most of the standard libraries. One significant limitation is that structural types do not yet work on .NET. There may still be problems when using particularly complex exception handlers. A small number of libraries are not available due to the peculiarities of .Net, and the interaction with other .Net languages is unsupported. For further details, please refer to this (possibly a bit outdated) documentation page. The guide to using Scala with .NET talks about version 1.4, which is rather old by now. On the other hand, it looks like documentation was written as recently as 2008, including the "Scala on .NET: quirks" page which sounds pretty important. Without having any experience of it myself, it sounds like support is limping along, but that the .NET port isn't really a first-class citizen. The fact that there's no "buzz" around Scala on .NET (compared with the Java version) isn't encouraging either. It doesn't sound like something I'd want to use for commercial software at the moment. Of course, it's possible that it's fine, and just not well marketed. If you're really keen on the idea, I'd ask on a mailing list . Why not either use the Eclipse RCP for a Java/Scala-based Windows client, or use .NET for the web app?
