In RSS Specifications , guid element should contain a unique identifier for each item, but not all rss feeds respect that, so you may combine that with a date check. Suggested Simple Storage: http://example.com/link/to/file.rss guid abcd-ef-12345678 http://example.ord/some/other.rss date 1283647074 This file contains info on the last item of each rss feed in the gadget, space separated (you can comma-separate them as in .csv files as well), first field is the RSS URL, second is the method used to check last item, either via guid or via pubDate , last is the value to check. In the sample file I put the timestamp instead of the pubDate that arrives, for storage purposes.
