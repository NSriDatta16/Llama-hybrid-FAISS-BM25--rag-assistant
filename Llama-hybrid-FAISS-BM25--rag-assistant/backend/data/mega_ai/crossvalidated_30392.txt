Here is an attempt to illustrate the last paragraph in Macro's excellent (+1) answer. It shows two priors for the parameter $p$ in the ${\rm Binomial}(n,p)$ distribution. For a few different $n$, the posterior distributions are shown when $x=n/2$ has been observed. As $n$ grows, both posteriors become more and more concentrated around $1/2$. For $n=2$ the difference is quite big, but for $n=50$ there is virtually no difference. The two priors below are ${\rm Beta(1/2,1/2)}$ (black) and ${\rm Beta(2,2)}$ (red). The posteriors have the same colours as the priors that they are derived from. (Note that for many other models and other priors, $n=50$ won't be enough for the prior not to matter!)
