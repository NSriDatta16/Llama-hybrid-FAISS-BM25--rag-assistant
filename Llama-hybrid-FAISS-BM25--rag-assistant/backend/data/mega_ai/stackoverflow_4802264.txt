Extend Google Maps Bounds so that div overlay doesn't cover any markers

In a Google Maps mashup I'm working on, the map is 100% wide and pretty much 100% tall and I have a horizontal transparent div that overlays the left side of the map using z-index and CSS. When I dynamically add my markers, I start with an empty Bounds object and extend it one by one to contain the new LatLngs. Sometimes however the markers appear under my transparent div that contains other elements. Let's say my transparent div is 250 pixels wide. What I'd like to do is once my bounds that show all the markers are established, I'd like to extend them one more time to expand the viewport of the Google Map so that when I fit the bounds, these markers now appear at least 250 pixels away from the left border so that they are not covered by the transparent div. I tried playing with MapProjection.fromPointToLatLng and MapCanvasProjection.fromDivPointToLatLng but wasn't able to achieve predictable results. Any advice or examples would be appreciated.
