Android tableview behaving as a listview

I am using table layout to display data, but i want it to behave like list items (ability to select, when select change background, when click, having hover effect, click able) for that purpose i am using following listeners OnClickListener(to perform action) OnFocusChangeListener(To change background color) OnTouchListener(to focus specific row) Now problem is when user touch any item it get focus first and then have to touch again to fire onclick event, to fix this i made a change and ontouch i fire action on specific to row. @Override public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) { if (event.getAction() != MotionEvent.ACTION_UP){ v.requestFocus(); int viewId= v.getId(); handleEvent(viewId);//Switch cases to perform row specific actions. } return false; } now if user touch the row event get fired that works perfect, But one more problem rises here when even user want to scroll down the data via dragging finger onto the screen ontouch event get fired.... and action automatically performed although user think it will scroll down the screen.
