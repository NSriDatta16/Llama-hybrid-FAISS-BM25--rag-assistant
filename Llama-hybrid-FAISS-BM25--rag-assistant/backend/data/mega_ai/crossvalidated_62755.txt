Period effects in pooled time series data in R

This is closely related to a question I asked yesterday but I've now got a much more complete answer on which I was hoping to get feedback. The previous question was just looking for conceptual advice and was very helpful. You can find the relevant data and introduction here . I wanted to find period effects for each age group. I've run two regressions using dummies as part of an interaction term. I'm hoping to see if my method is flawed and if my interpretation of the results is correct or not. They first regression is as follows: > ## Generate YearDummy and AgeGroupDummy using factor() > > YearDummy AgeGroupDummy > ## Check to see that YearDummy and CohortDummy are indeed factor variables > > is.factor(YearDummy) [1] TRUE > is.factor(AgeGroupDummy) [1] TRUE > ## Regress on AgeGroup and include AgeGroup*YearDummy interaction terms > > PooledOLS1 summary(PooledOLS1) Call: lm(formula = PPHPY ~ AgeGroup + AgeGroup * YearDummy + 0, data = maildatapooled) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -38.852 -10.632 3.298 11.275 26.481 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) AgeGroup 26.2212 3.5070 7.477 3.84e-10 *** YearDummy1 119.8836 15.6840 7.644 1.99e-10 *** YearDummy2 123.7458 15.6840 7.890 7.55e-11 *** YearDummy3 103.2660 15.6840 6.584 1.28e-08 *** YearDummy4 97.7102 15.6840 6.230 5.06e-08 *** YearDummy5 103.3295 15.6840 6.588 1.26e-08 *** YearDummy6 103.2330 15.6840 6.582 1.29e-08 *** YearDummy7 84.8291 15.6840 5.409 1.16e-06 *** YearDummy8 70.7114 15.6840 4.509 3.09e-05 *** YearDummy9 90.9566 15.6840 5.799 2.65e-07 *** YearDummy10 50.0885 15.6840 3.194 0.00224 ** YearDummy11 37.7004 15.6840 2.404 0.01933 * YearDummy12 33.1947 15.6840 2.116 0.03846 * AgeGroup:YearDummy2 1.8066 4.9597 0.364 0.71695 AgeGroup:YearDummy3 -3.8022 4.9597 -0.767 0.44632 AgeGroup:YearDummy4 -1.7436 4.9597 -0.352 0.72640 AgeGroup:YearDummy5 -6.0494 4.9597 -1.220 0.22735 AgeGroup:YearDummy6 -6.7992 4.9597 -1.371 0.17552 AgeGroup:YearDummy7 -3.6752 4.9597 -0.741 0.46158 AgeGroup:YearDummy8 -0.4799 4.9597 -0.097 0.92323 AgeGroup:YearDummy9 -9.8190 4.9597 -1.980 0.05232 . AgeGroup:YearDummy10 -2.2452 4.9597 -0.453 0.65241 My interpretation of the interaction term coefficients is that they represent the difference in slope of AgeGroup between the period of the corresponding YearDummy and the AgeGroup slope at the top of the results. This is kind of like the AgeGroup effect across different periods. My second regression is as follows: > ## Regress YearVar and Include YearVar*AgeGroupDUmmy > > PooledOLS2 summary(PooledOLS2) Call: lm(formula = PPHPY ~ YearVar + YearVar * AgeGroupDummy + 0, data = maildatapooled) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -29.345 -9.325 -0.915 8.540 40.150 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) YearVar -7.089 1.252 -5.664 3.04e-07 *** AgeGroupDummy1 142.292 9.211 15.447 My interpretation of the interaction term coefficients here is that they represent the difference in slope of YearVar between the corresponding AgeGroup in the interaction term and the YearVar result at the very top. That is, they are something like a period effect across the different age groups. Can anyone see a problem with what I've done here or with my interpretation? This second regression is the closest thing to period effects across distinct age groups that I've been able to muster. Any critiques/new ideas are welcome.
