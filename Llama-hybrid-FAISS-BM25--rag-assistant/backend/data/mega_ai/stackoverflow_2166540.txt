How can I fool a site that looks at the JavaScript object 'navigator' to see that I'm not on Windows?

I am trying to browse a website, however, it only works under Windows and Mac because they use the navigator.platform from JavaScript to find out the architecture I am running on. Of course, they also use the browser's user agent, but that was easy to spoof. Here is the .js in question: http://pastebin.com/f56fd608d . The code responsible for browser detection is at the top. Is there any way of changing the .js file before the site runs, or something similar, so I can eliminate the check? Using the JavaScript console yields: >navigator.platform Linux i686 Evidently I changed the browser's user agent, but navigator.platform does not seem to take it's value from the user agent. Maybe someone knows how to change the value returned by navigator.platform , because I hate running Windows under VirtualBox to use this site. EDIT: This could be of interest because Linux users might be artificially denied access to websites, and can do nothing about it.
