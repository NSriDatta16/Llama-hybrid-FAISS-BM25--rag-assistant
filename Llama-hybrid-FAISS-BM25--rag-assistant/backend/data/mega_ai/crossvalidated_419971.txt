The use of prediction intervals in random effects meta-analysis was popularised by Riley, R D and Higgins, J P T and Deeks, J J in an article entitled "Interpretation of random effects meta--analyses" available here where they state among other things that it can only be calculated when there are at least three studies (page 996). Just for the record it only differs from the confidence interval for the summary if $\tau^2 > 0$ . This is because the interval is from $\hat\mu - t_{k-2}\sqrt{\hat\tau^2 + s_{\hat\mu}^2}$ to $\hat\mu + t_{k-2}\sqrt{\hat\tau^2 + s_{\hat\mu}^2}$ where $\hat\mu$ is the estimate of the average parameter value, $s$ is its standard error, $\tau^2$ is the estimate of between study standard deviation, $k$ the number of studies. Since $t$ does not exist for zero df it is clear that $k$ must exceed two.
