Subversion is great at what it does, and what it does is version source code, although it'll work well enough for other text-based formats, and binaries, with reduced capabilities. However, as a one-stop project management tool, it falls rather short of the mark; it's far easier to track and organise bug reports and feature requests in a product that's designed to do that. Likewise, it's also far easier to use an actual wiki engine as a documentation wiki. If you're looking for something fairly compact, you might consider Trac , as has been mentioned elsewhere, which is a decent little issue tracker/wiki/project planning tool with good source control integration.
