I ONLY use the HTML editor and I write my own tags and and so forth... The problem I'm running into is that each time I use a special with custom styling that I've made, WP is adding a around that span as well as a after the paragraph. Now the solution is to have the Formating disabled in Wordpress editor by downloading this plugin
