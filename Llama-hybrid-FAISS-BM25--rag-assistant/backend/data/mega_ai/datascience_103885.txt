What does "expansion layer" mean?

Recently, I found "expansion layer" term in the next paper: Liu, Ze, et al. "Swin transformer: Hierarchical vision transformer using shifted windows." arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.14030 (2021). This term is mentioned in the context of Multilayer perceptron (MLP). So I have tried to figure out its meaning on my own, but I would not be able to find anything particular. Also I found "expansion ratio" term (again in MLP context) in this paper: Wu, Haiping, et al. "Cvt: Introducing convolutions to vision transformers." arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.15808 (2021). So, what does "expansion layer" means? And what is "expansion ratio"? Thanks in advance.
