I've done this before, and my approach was just to XOR them, byte-by-byte, against each other. Running them through some other algorithm, like SHA-256, is terribly inefficient, so it's not practical, and I think it would be not really useful and possibly harmful. If you do happen to be incredibly paranoid, and have a tiny bit of money, it might be fun to buy a "true" (depending on how convinced you are by Quantum Mechanics) a Quantum Random Number Generator . -- Edit: FWIW, I think the method I describe above (or something similar) is effectively a One-Time Pad from the point of view of either sources, assuming one of them is random, and therefore unattackable assuming they are independant and out to get you. I'm happy to be corrected on this if someone takes issue with it, and I encourage anyone not taking issue with it to question it anyway, and find out for yourself.
