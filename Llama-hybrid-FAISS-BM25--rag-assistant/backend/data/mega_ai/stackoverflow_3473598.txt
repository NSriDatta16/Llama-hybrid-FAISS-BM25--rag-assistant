in c++ a struct is in every way like a class, except that the default parameter access is public: rather than private: . It is a common practice to use struct instead of class when the scope of the defined type's use is very narrow, such as in the example of a simple functor. What this example does is emulate the appearance of a function pointer without the fragility of possibly being null. The operator() member here overloads function calling. when you try to do something like: cmp_decr_int2 foo; foo(peek2(), peek2()); that overload member gets called.
