To expand a bit on Jonathan's answer, it would be silly to run entire indexes every time a product is saved. Magento's indexing process for things like category products involves truncating tables and running the index queries again. If you were to save 20 different products, and the indexes were regenerated for each of those, you'd have wasted major time. Since the system can't guess when you mean to save 20 products in a row, you are instead expected to run your indexes yourself.
