Entirely Javascript Ajax spinner?

I was thinking that Ajax spinners are really great but the image spinning is actually shown with some delay OR is loaded too early, I thought maybe I could use these old school characters to provide more accurate ajax activity feedback. |, /, â€”, \ lets say the target paragraph is called How can I interchange these characters in that paragraph without it being too resource intensive, I have JQuery already loaded in the project. Thanks so much guys!
