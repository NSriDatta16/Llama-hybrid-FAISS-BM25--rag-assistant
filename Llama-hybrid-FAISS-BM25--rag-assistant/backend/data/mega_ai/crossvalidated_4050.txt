Statistics is the deductive approach to induction. Consider the two main approaches to statistical inference: Frequentist and Bayesian. Assume you are a Frequentist (in the style of Fisher, rather than Neyman for convenience). You wonder whether a parameter of substantive interest takes a particular value, so you construct a model, choose a statistic relating to the parameter, and perform a test. The p-value generated by your test indicates the probability of seeing a statistic as or more extreme than the statistic computed from the sample you have, assuming that your model is correct. You get a small enough p-value so you reject the hypothesis that the parameter does take that value. Your reasoning is deductive: Assuming the model is correct, either the parameter really does take the value of substantive interest but yours is an unlikely sample to see, or it does not take in fact that value. Turning from hypothesis test to confidence intervals: you have a 95% confidence interval for your parameter which does not contain the value substantive interest. Your reasoning is again deductive: assuming the model is correct, either this is one of those rare intervals that will appear 1 in 20 times when the parameter really does have the value of substantive interest (because your sample is an unlikely one), or the parameter does not in fact have that value. Now assume you are a Bayesian (in the style of Laplace rather than Gelman). Your model assumptions and calculations give you a (posterior) probability distribution over the parameter value. Most of the mass of this distribution is far from the value of substantive interest, so you conclude that the parameter probably does not have this value. Your reasoning is again deductive: assuming your model to be correct and if the prior distribution represented your beliefs about the parameter, then your beliefs about it in the light of the data are described by your posterior distribution which puts very little probability on that value. Since this distribution offers little support for the value of substantive interest, you might conclude that the parameter does not in fact have the value. (Or you might be content to state the probability it does). In all three cases you get a logical disjunction to base your action on which is derived deductively/mathematically from assumptions. These assumptions are usually about a model of how the data is generated, but may also be prior beliefs about other quantities.
