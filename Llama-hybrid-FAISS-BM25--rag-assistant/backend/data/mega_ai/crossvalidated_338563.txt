Increasing the size of training set prevents training of convolutional neural network

I am training a CNN for binary image classification. With a training set of about ~1024 entries the net overtrains but validation accuracy increases to about 80%. When I increase the training set size to around 2048 or 4096 (and change nothing else) the network does not learn at all. Neither training nor validation accuracy increases over 50%. I have no hypotheses for how this could happen. Does anyone have any theories to explain how simply increasing training set size could hinder CNN training?
