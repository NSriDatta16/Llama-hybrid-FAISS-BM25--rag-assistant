The terminology is unfortunately inconsistent. num_units in TensorFlow is the number of hidden states, i.e. the dimension of $h_t$ in the equations you gave. Also, from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/api_docs/python/functions_and_classes/shard9/tf.nn.rnn_cell.RNNCell.md : The definition of cell in this package differs from the definition used in the literature. In the literature, cell refers to an object with a single scalar output. The definition in this package refers to a horizontal array of such units. "LSTM layer" is probably more explicit, example : def lstm_layer(tparams, state_below, options, prefix='lstm', mask=None): nsteps = state_below.shape[0] if state_below.ndim == 3: n_samples = state_below.shape[1] else: n_samples = 1 assert mask is not None [â€¦]
