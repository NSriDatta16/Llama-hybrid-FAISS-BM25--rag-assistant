Machine learning is fundamentally about pattern recognition. If you have sufficient data and the model is flexible enough, you can find the pattern (see universality theorems). An expert makes predictions based on their experiences (data) and some perceived relationship (pattern) in the data. To me, ML and an expert are trying to do the same thing - with the crucial difference that human brains process the data differently and computers can crunch massive datasets whereas humans cannot. Clearly if the digitized data is a poor representation of reality or the model is inappropriate, the ML results will be worse. Alternatively humans are subject to cognitive biases and have limitations as well. But why does it have to be exclusively one or the other? Why not embed the predictions of experts into an ML algorithm?
