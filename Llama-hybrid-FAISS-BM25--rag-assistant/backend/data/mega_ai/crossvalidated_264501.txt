I thing RNN network (specifically LSTMS and GRU ) would be your best choice here if you have sufficient data to train them.Have worked with music in my masters though not this particular problem . I think something like converting these sequences to text and then trying something like a word2vec +LSTM/GRU architecture could be a good option. It would be nice to see if the model discovers chord substitutions or relations .You could experiment with all this in keras (its python based, built on top of tensorflow/theano )in a few lines of code. Just to put it out... there's also something called the Neural Stack from deep mind , this is the best explanation ive found so far. Haven't experimented with these though. Edit looking around i found this explanation on quora that would help you in case you are not sure how to implement my answer.
