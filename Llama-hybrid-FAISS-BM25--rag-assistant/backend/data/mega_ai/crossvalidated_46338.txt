Point and click interfaces seem easier, but in the long run you will benifit by learing "writing the code". One advantage of script based systems over point, click, drag interfaces is the audit trail/history (some GUIs do have a history, but they generally are not as easy to work with as a saved script). If you write some code to create your graph and save it then it is always easy to rerun it, or to make some small edits then rerun, it is not always easy to remember the set of clicks and drags used to create a prior graph. Scripts will also be much quicker for large numbers of plots. It will take a little more time to write the code for the first plot, but adding only a couple of lines and some small modifications can let you loop through 100's or more variables with little additional effort where you need to do the same set of clicks and drags over and over again for each plot. Many of the script based plotting tools do have GUIs that allow you to use point and click to get started, but help you learn the code and transition to the more powerful methods. I recommend R which is free and open source and does have some GUIs available (Rcmdr, jgr, rstudio, etc.) as a good option.
