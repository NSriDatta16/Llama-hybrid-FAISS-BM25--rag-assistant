Please look at my answer at Identfying spikes in data . A general method could be to calculate a (moving) average and standard deviation. Outliers are points that differ more than 3 times the standard deviation. In your case, B will probably have a standard deviation of 3%, because 10% is considered an outlier. For A, C, D, E, the standard deviation may be 7%, because 20% is not considered an outlier. Relative importance does not make something an outlier. A large deviation does.
