The term you're looking for is "code coverage" and there are various tools that will generate that information. You would have to make sure that you exercise every possible path through your code in order to be able to detect "dead code" with such a tool though, which is only possible with a really extensive set of tests. Most compilers have some level of dead code detection, but that only detects code that cannot possibly be called, not code that will never be called due to program logic, etc.. edit: for Python specifically: How can you find unused functions in Python code? for Java: How to find unused/dead code in java projects , Java: Dead code elimination for Objective-C: Xcode -- finding dead methods in a project , Cleaning up Objective-C code
