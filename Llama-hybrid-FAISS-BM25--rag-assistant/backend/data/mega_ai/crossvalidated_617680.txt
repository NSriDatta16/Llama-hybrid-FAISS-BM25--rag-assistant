Temperature time series data â€” best analysis approach

I have some time series data that shows a building indoor temperature subject to outside temperature. When the heating/cooling is turned off, the building slowly cools down (or heats up) towards the outside temperature. Now i was able to filter these periods in the time series. The data looks like the one in the picture. What would it be the best approach to fit a model to this data? collect different time series of the exponential decay (cooling down) and fit as many models into these time series, proceeding then to somehow aggregate the results into a model that can predict based on an initial temperature how long it'd take to get to x degrees for example or to keep it as one and fit a model? please advise. Thanks in advance! Edit: I want to find out how long it takes for the building to cool down in this case, provided the AC is providing no heating. The temperature should converge to the outside temperature and it does so in an exponential way. different outside temperatures will dictate the rate of the exponential curve that best models the data and I'm wondering how to best tackle this in practice.
