linear vs non-linear kernel SVM

The dataSet contains 213 examples of 7 classes . Each example are 25000 features. I want to learn model with SVM (test scenario used are 10-fold cross validation). I am a beginner in machine learning, i want to know what type of kernel i should use in the case of my data: linear or no-linear (as RBF kernel). Also, I want some tips to choose the value of parameter C. Thanks!
