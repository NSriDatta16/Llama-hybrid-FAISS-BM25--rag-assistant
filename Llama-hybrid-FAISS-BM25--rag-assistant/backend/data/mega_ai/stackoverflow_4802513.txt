Where / how to get free high resolution satellite images for geospatial data visualization with python

I want to overlay geospatial data (mostly heatmaps) on top of high resolution satellite images using python. (i am newbie, so be gentle on me ;-) ) Here is my wish list detailed enough to show streets and buildings must be fairly recent (captured within last several years) coordinates and projection of images/maps must be known that heatmaps i created can be overlayed easy retrieval (hopefully, several lines of python codes will take care of getting right images) free I think google map/earth, yahoo map, bing, etc... could be potential candidates, but I am not sure how to access them easily. Code examples would be very helpful. Any suggestions?
