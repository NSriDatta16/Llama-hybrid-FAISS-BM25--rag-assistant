XGBoost on Python

Hi could someone explain what the num_round parameter is for ? it is not well explained in the official doc http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html on that page, a (typical ?) value of 10 is used it is also said, that as ETA goes down, this parameter should go up but that about it.
