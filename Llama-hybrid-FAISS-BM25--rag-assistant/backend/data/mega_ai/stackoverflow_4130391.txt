I don't think that your problem is really one that relates to jQuery or even Javascript at all. Your problem is, how do I detect when an ellipse overlaps (or does not overlap) another ellipse? It's a math problem, and it's one that has already been asked here . Be warned that this strikes me as a pretty difficult problem for someone who is new to programming. I'm not at all new to programming and I would see this as challenging, particularly with your other requirements - drag and drop, and so on. You've taken on a pretty advanced problem, and at this point, anything you can do to simplify (such as using bounding boxes) is something I would strongly recommend doing.
