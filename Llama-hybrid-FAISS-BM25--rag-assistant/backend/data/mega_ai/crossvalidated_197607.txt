How to test difference between times series - does "time series ANOVA" exist?

Description: Temperature if six objects (obj_A, obj_B,...obj_F) was measured in 1 hour intervals (1,2...10) Objects were under the influence of two treatments (A and B). Treatment A = obj_A, obj_B, obj_C; treatment B = obj_D, obj_E, obj_F. Problem is that measured values of each object are serially correlated , therefore I can not use classical ANOVA. How to take into account such fact? # example data my.data blue = treatment A; red = treatment B ts.plot(obj_A, obj_B, obj_C, obj_D, obj_E, obj_F, col=c("deepskyblue","deepskyblue1","deepskyblue2", "darkred","indianred","indianred1"), lwd = 2.5, lty = 2, xlab = "time", ylab = "temperature") How to rigorously test whether temperature of objects differ according to used treatment, but without ignoring serial correlation?
