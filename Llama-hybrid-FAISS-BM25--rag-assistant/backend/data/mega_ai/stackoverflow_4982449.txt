What's the meaning of this C++ runtime warning

I'm getting the following runtime errors when executing my c++ application. Right after the error warnings my app terminates. warning: can't find linker symbol for virtual table for `world2d::SeeIntensityAlgorithm' value warning: found `std::basic_string , std::allocator >::_Rep::_S_empty_rep_storage' instead warning: RTTI symbol not found for class 'CppUnit::SourceLine' Any ideas on what the problem is? Sorry I can't give you any source, the project is big and if I knew where the problem was I would have it much easier fixing the problem myself. My compiler is gcc.
