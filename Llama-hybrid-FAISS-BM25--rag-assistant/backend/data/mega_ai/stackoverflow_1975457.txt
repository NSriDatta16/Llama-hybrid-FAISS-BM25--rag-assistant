accessing third-party ruby library module in code? is this the right way on windows?

I needed a little script to read data out of windows-style .ini files. Searching my windows machine I found inifile.rb in this path: C:\ruby\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\vr\contrib\ it seems unnatural to add this path directly to my rubylib path as this will mean any other special units I want will need to be added. so in my code I wrote this: require 'vr/contrib/inifile' ini = Inifile.new("file.ini") puts ini.read("common","name","default name") This worked, but also doesn't seem elegant for inclusion. There must be a better way to specify this in the code ?
