A categorical PCA (CATPCA) question

I have a dataset that I am analysing using CATPCA in SPSS. The problem that I have is that while I can see the variables that are positively or negatively correlated on the Component Loadings table and plot, I still don't know what opinions I have in my data. For example, I might find that component 1 comprises of variables A and B which are correlated, but both are negatively correlated with C. My problem is that I need to find out if my data shows that the most people agree with component 1 or agree with the exact opposite. Taking that a step further, it is likely that I have both sides of that story in my data and I need to find the proportions of people agreeing with component 1 and the proportion of people disagreeing with the exact opposite. How do I find this? I imagine that I need to create a composite variable to do this. I tried multiplying component loadings by the quantifications and I expected that that would give me the object scores on the components, but it didn't. If I could figure out how to get from quantifications to component scores then I could at least go on and build a composite variable, but at the moment I am totally stuck. This is a real life problem, not coursework etc. I have read a journal paper on this, the SPSS text book and looked at many examples online. All tutorials seem to stop by saying X, Y and Z are correlated and don't take the analysis further to show how often that association is shown within the data. The point is that I don't need to just find the components, I also need to know what my data tells me.
