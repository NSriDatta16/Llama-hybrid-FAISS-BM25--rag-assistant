Quite old, but worth a dig, because answers missed an important method and focused on optimal solutions, which you are not interested in. But the method I suggest may or may not suit your needs however. You can use quasi random sequences , which are designed for such problems. Most widespread are Sobol sequences , for which you can find canned packages for virtually any language. They are blazingly fast: only bitwise arithmetic. They most likely will produce some clusters, but this can be avoided by selecting the "seed" to use for the x and y dimensions beforehand, and checking with naked eye. It depends on what you want to do with the points: if "visual spread out" is important, this may not be what you want. If you want points which "fill the plane" almost evenly, they perfectly do the job. They are especially useful to average something on an image quickly, since it requires less points that with "normal" random generation. Experiment with different dimensions and see. See also this link for exemples experiments, and pictures.
