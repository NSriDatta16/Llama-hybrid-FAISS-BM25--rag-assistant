In finance, linear regression assumptions are frequently broken. While departures from assumptions, such as non-normality or heteroscedasticity, are widespread, alternatives include transformations, robust regression, or specialized models such as autoregressive approaches. While working with real-world financial data, analysts need to be aware of these variations and use suitable methods such as quantile regression or time series models. Example: Autocorrelation in financial time series may be handled using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, which account for the temporal character of stock movements.
