How can probability variables of different dimensions share the same parameter in VAE?

I am confused while studying VAE(Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes). My problem is as follows: We have a continuous variable $x$ and a random variable $z$ . The dimensions of $x$ and $z$ are different, with $x$ typically representing an image. The $z$ is generated from some prior distribution $p_{\theta^*}(z)$ . And the $x$ is generated from some conditional distribution $p_{\theta^*}(x|z)$ . How can probability variables of different dimensions ( $x, y$ ) share the same parameter $\theta$ ? Is there a cue in the reparameterization trick?
