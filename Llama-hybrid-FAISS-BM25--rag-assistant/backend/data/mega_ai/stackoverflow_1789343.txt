The approach you may be looking for is called "GPGPU" for "General Purpose GPU". Good starting points may be: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU http://gpgpu.org/ Rumors about spectacular successes in this approach have been around for a few years now, but I suspect that this will become everyday practice in a few years (unless CPU architectures change a lot, and make it obsolete). The key here is parallelism: if you have a problem where you need a large number of parallel processing units. Thus, maybe neural networks or genetic algorithms may be a good range of problems to attack with the power of a GPU. Maybe also looking for vulnerabilities in cryptographic hashes (cracking the DES on a GPU would make a nice thesis, I imagine :)). But problems requiring high-speed serial processing don't seem so much suited for the GPU. So emulating a GameBoy may be out of scope. (But emulating a cluster of low-power machines might be considered.)
