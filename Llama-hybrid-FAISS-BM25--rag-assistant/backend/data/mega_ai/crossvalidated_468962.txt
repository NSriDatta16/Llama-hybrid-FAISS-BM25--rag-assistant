This is such a neat question. I'm going to describe a similar scenario where we use a single lagged feature because it is easier to visualize. Let's say I have a time series that looks like this: Not only do I plan to use x to predict y , I will also use a single lagged observation of y . So to predict y_i I will use x_i and y_{i-1} . The use of the single lagged feature puts my total feature space in two dimensions. If I were to plot my two features against my outcome, I would get a 3d scatter plot, shown below When you use OLS, you essentially fit a plane to this data. Here is that plane the predictions from your model come from the plane that is learned. You are using more lags, so your plane lives in a higher dimensional space (which we have a tough time visualizing).
