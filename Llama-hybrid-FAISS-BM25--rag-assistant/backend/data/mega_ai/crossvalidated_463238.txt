You seem to be mixing up two components together. The latent $Z$ of a standard VAE is effectively a mixture of Gaussians, but it has nothing to do with the number of datapoints. The diagonal covariance is effectively a notation trick; a VAE latent space comprises $N$ instances of independent Gaussian 'particles', where $N$ is a model hyperparameter. Each of those particles has a mean and variance encoded by the output of the... well, encoder. The encoder can have any number of layers in its own right and tries to figure out an embedding that can be described nicely using a bunch of Gaussians.
