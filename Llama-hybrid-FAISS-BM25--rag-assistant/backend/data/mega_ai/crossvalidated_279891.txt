What is a valid statistical test for comparing data points between two time courses?

I've had conflicting advice over the best way to analyse my time course experiments. I'm comparing cells in two different conditions and observing whether a particular protein accumulates in a certain part of the cell over time. Approximately 50 cells are studied over time for each condition but they don't have the same n number. The average % of cells which are displaying accumulation are then plotted as shown below. I've been told by one person to do a t test and compare each time point individually, whilst somebody else has told me I can't do it this way. Unfortunately they didn't seem able to suggest an alternative! I basically just want to be able to identify which time points are significantly different. I'm terrible at stats so extremely simple answers would be hugely appreciated. Thanks
