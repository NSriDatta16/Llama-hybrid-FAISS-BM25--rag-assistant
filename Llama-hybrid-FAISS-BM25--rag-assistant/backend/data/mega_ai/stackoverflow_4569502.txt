First jQuery project - Using a variable as a selector

What I'm trying to do is quite simple but as a beginner I'm getting incredibly frustrated with it. Here's my first attempt just to give you the idea . I plan to do something a bit more fancy with the images, but I could see straight away that this wasn't the solution. Mouseover was changing the image before it had faded out and looked horrible. So, I thought I might put all the images in the same place and hide them, making them visible and bringing them to the front on mouseover of the corresponding hotspot. I'm hoping there's a way to decrement an element's z-index value with .css(). Here's where I am with it (same URL, 9872_gangsters_moll_2nd_attempt.html). $(".hotspot").mouseover(function(){ //Get the id of this triggered item var imageid = $(this).attr("id"); //use it to make corresponding image id to use as jQuery selector var currentImg = '#img_'+ imageid; // alert(currentImg); //shows variable is correct // $('.product-img').show(); //works fine with a class $('currentImg').show(); //doesn't work with a variable $('currentImg').addClass('front'); //same, obviously }); I tried toggling visibility with css originally, but went with jQuery's show/hide. Neither worked. The problem seems to be with passing 'currentImg' as a selector. Any help you could offer with this would be hugely appreciated. Thanks, Andy
