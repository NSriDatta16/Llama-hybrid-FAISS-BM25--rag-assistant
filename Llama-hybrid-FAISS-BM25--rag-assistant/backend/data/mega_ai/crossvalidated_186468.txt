Trying to simulate a birth death process

Question: A birth and death process is a continuous time Markov chain. Find an approximative numerical value for the probability P {max0≤t≤10 X(t) ≥ 10} for a birth and death process {X(t)}t≥0 with birth intensities λ0 = λ1 = λ2 = . . . = 1 and death intensities µ1 = µ2 = µ3 = . . . = 2 that is in steady-state (that is, which is started according to its stationary distribution). My attempt at a solution: rep = 100000 count = 0 for (i in 1:rep) { time = 0 xt = 0 succ = 0 start = 0 u.rand = runif(1) # These if statements determine where we start # according to the stationary distribution if (u.rand =10) {succ = 1} } count = count + succ # And here we add them up } count/rep # And this frequency should be equal to # the sought after probability I get count/rep = 0.00615 but it should be 0.0084865 Something is wrong in my code. Can anyone help me out? Im pretty sure im doing something wrong in the while-loop.
