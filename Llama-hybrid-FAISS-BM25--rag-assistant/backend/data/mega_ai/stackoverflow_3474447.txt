I am not sure I totally understand your question, it looks like you are writing javascript. But your subject is silverlight. Anyway.... The simplest way is to leverage Html Confirm either in silverlight: bool result = System.Windows.Browser.HtmlPage.Window.Confirm("Really..?"); or in straight JavaScript: var result = window.Confirm("Really...?"); To get the value to the server you can store the value in a hidden text field and post it to the server.
