Which Browsers don't support ids for in page navigation (fragid)?

In HTML5, name is no longer a valid attribute of the anchor tag ( ). It has been mentioned that older browsers do not recognize the the new recommended approach ( or any id for that matter). What are the browsers which don't recognize ids for in page navigation ( fragids )? Are we talking about Netscape-era browsers or the usual suspect, Internet Explorer 6?
