You could treat the problem as a classification problem instead of an ordinal one. Use the C5.0 command in the C50 package. I found this youtube video which does a good job of showing you how to do it on an example dataset that comes prepackaged with R. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NquIfQxpxk EDIT: The problem with using tree based regression methods to predict ordinal categorical variables is that output can be inconclusive. For instance, does output of 1.49999 or 1.500001 belong to class 1 or class 2? The accuracy of the result is called seriously into question. Ordinal logistic regression will output integer values. Try using the polr command in the MASS package. A rough outline of the code would look something like: library(MASS) model If you are dead set on using the C50 package, though, I would suggest approaching it as a classification task and ignore the ordinality of the categorical response variable. The C5.0 command is capable of predicting multilevel categorical variables (so is the tree package, incidentally). If you want to use the C5.0 command the code would look something like: library(C50) model In either case be sure you're splitting your data into a training set and test set. Check accuracy of both tests, and maybe make a confusion matrix.
