The DATEDIFF approach probably wouldn't work if you are concerned with the missing _TimeStamps. The straight count(*) would double count the duplicates (2009-12-20 11:59:56.4 in example). So to exactly answer the question: select count(distinct _timestamp) from table This counts the number of distinct _Timestamp's in the table. You could then limit it to a specific _Timestamp range and multiply it out by an average sample time to get the final result. Not sure what performance would be like but an index on the _Timestamp column would probably help.
