Ok, I guess here how it should be read. A sample could be in multiple categories. First, you look into a sample. Below is an example (at row 12) and the mail content: Content Cat_1_level_1 Cat_1_level_2 Cat_1_weight Cat_2_level_1 Cat_2_level_2 Cat_2_weight Jennifer, Thank-you for stepping in on this and guiding the process! ---------------------- Forwarded by Sarah-Joy Hunter/NA/Enron on 12/12/2000 05:03 PM --------------------------- From: Patrick Tucker@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 12/12/2000 02:52 PM PST To: Sarah-Joy Hunter/NA/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: Re: HP -- confidential internal document Sarah-Joy, thanks for your excellent recap of progress to date. I really appreciate the organization and order you have brought to this process. It's great to work with you again after all of this time! Patrick 1 2 2 4 6 2 Here, you need to combine the Cat_1_level_* to get a single category that this mail belongs to. You can do the same combination for other categories as well (like Cat_2_level_* ). If you combine the first category as Cat_1_level_1 (which is 1) and Cat_2_level_2 (which is 2), you get an actual category label which is Category 1.2 (Purely personal). As I said before, a sample could be in multiple categories. If you combine the second category labels, the Cat_2_level_1 (which is 4) and Cat_2_level_2 (which is 6), you get another category label which is Category 4.6 (gratitude). If you check the content, you can see they are talking about something personal and they try to express how grateful they are to each other. About the weights ( Cat_1_weight , Cat_2_weight , Cat_*_weight ...). Since this dataset samples were labeled by multiple people, in some cases, there were different labels assigned to the same sample (or in some cases a sample assigned with the same label by multiple people). The weights show that how many people assigned the same label in a category for a certain sample. Here, the Cat_1_weight is 2 , which means 2 people assigned this Cat_1_level_* labels to this sample. (I guess...)
