So, it seems I've been looking in completely the wrong place for a solution to this. In a nutshell, the problem is that I need to access Google PPC information regarding visitors to my site but google doesn't always pass this information along in the referrer and certainly is problematic where Display Network appears on a page using javascript to insert it directly into the dom. Where should I have been looking? Google Analytics. The __utmz cookie contains a wealth of information regarding the route that traffic got the site... including whether they came via PPC / Organic or Display Network and the search terms (where applicable) that got them there. See the following page for more information: http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/concepts/gaConceptsCookies.html Who'd have thought! Anyway, there is some great documentation on what the cookies do and how they are constructed. Problem Solved. Ross
