Use the stored proc to start a SQL Server Agent job that invokes the SSIS package... You can't invoke directly from a stored proc (which is not a good idea anyway) and then have the stored proc terminate. You have to decouple the stored proc execution from the SSIS execution Setting variables is easy though in SQL Server agent (GUI) and on command line (use /Set )
