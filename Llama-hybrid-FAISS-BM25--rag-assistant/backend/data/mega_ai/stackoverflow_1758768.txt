Is there a workaround to IE7's user agent being defaulted after installing .Net Framework 3.5 SP1?

I have verified that after installing the .Net Framework 3.5 SP1, when the User Agent string exceeds a certain number of characters, the user agent is defaulted to 'userAgent string:Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0)'. I've verified this behavior on several machines but can't seem to find a suitable workaround. This is preventing some Silverlight applications from running when the user's browser (IE7) is falsely reporting the user agent. Prior to installing 3.5 SP1, the user agent was correct in reporting browser version and .Net framework versions.
