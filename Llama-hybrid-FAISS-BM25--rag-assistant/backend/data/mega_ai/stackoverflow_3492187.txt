Dynamic property getters/setters in Javascript?

Storage (localStorage, sessionStorage) allows using arbitrary properties. E.g. you can do localStorage.foo = 'bar'; instead of localStorage.setItem('foo', 'bar'); Can my own javascript objects have the same behavior? I want to execute some code, when a property is attempted to be set. Note : I obviously know I can create setters, but that won't work for properties whose names I don't know in advance. Note #2 : After a bit of examination of the spec , I see that it doesn't really guarantee that this will work, unless the key was already set with setItem(): The names of the supported named properties on a Storage object are the keys of each key/value pair currently present in the list associated with the object I could probably achieve this behavior myself too, as long as the first set goes through a method, by dynamically defining getters/setters.
