Platform/browser independence is very incorrect for an answer to the question. What many answers didn't mention is that alot of organizations will create and use web applications that target a certain version of a certain browser. Easier to develop something that works and looks properly only in 1 web browser. Example: IE5, IE7, etc... I see this everywhere, so to say that web applications can run on any platform/browser in an intranet environment is false in very many cases as internal facing web apps typically are used only within the company and therefore the companies internal policy is typically standardized on a certain platform and browser. Because of this reason developers will write and test their web applications against a certain browser/platform only. I think this comment negates any above comments explaining why web applications are used in corporate intranets.
