Unless you're using Chrome + Native client , you can forget about it... There are many, many average browsers on the market out today, including mobile browsers which can't execute C++ code for variety of reasons. So, I'd recommend staying with the usual suspects: Javascript and HTML 5 if you want to be standards compliant. I strongly discourage using ActiveX, unless you're developing for a company intranet and all browsers in the company are IE 6. I hope you aren't in that scenario. Even then, I'd suggest staying away from ActiveX.
