There is nothing particularly wrong with the way you are already doing it. (Although as others have suggested, you should be making your fields private and using public properties instead) Often the best way to decide upon what storage structure to use is to consider how you will be using the data. For example, if you know you need to process the data in some kind of order, consider a SortedList instead. If you know you need direct access to the data from some kind of key or index, use a Dictionary.
