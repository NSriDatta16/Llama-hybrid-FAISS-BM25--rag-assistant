Find the minimum sample size to test for a normal distribution and 1-way ANOVA

I have been heuristically choosing sample sizes and would like to find a more quantitative method. For each group of my data I want to verify that they are normally distributed. Then I want to check which groups are different. How should I find a sample size for both tests? And is my current methodology sound? Methods I'm generating between 2 and several groups of simulation data. Each group has output from a different model, and each value in a group is a floating point number coming from a single simulation. I want to run my simulations until all groups are normally distributed or some threshold for max iterations is reached. This means all groups have the same size. Usually all the data in each group is within 1% of each other, so I've been using the magic number 30 for my sample size. I'm testing that each group is normally distributed with a chi-squared test . My expected values for chi-square are just the group average. Finally, I check that all groups are the same with a 1-way ANOVA test. If a group is dissimilar, I use a t-test to find unique groupings.
