I'm going to assume you've tried using the same stylesheets for webkit/ff/opera allready, and that this is the last resort because you're doing something strange? Anyway, Opera does indeed support @import . (It has to, @import is used in 6.79% of all stylesheets .) In addition, the media query that precedes the Opera CSS will never run in Opera because you're using (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:10000) in the rule. According to the Media query specs error handling rules : "User agents are to ignore a media query when one of the specified media features is unknown.". I doubt Opera honours -webkit vendor media features. For a full list of what Opera does and doesn't support, look at the Opera feature chart
