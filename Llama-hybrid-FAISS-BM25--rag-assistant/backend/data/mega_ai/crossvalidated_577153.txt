Because each cluster will be a high-density region, and this region is "pure" with respect to its cluster label, and because the clusters are distinguished by some partitioning of the feature space, it's trivial to train a classifier to recreate the clusters' boundary. It's not surprising that the random forest was able to capture the boundary exactly, because we know by construction that the labels determined by clustering correspond to a partition of the data according to the feature space. Typical reasons that a classifier is not perfectly able to predict the label is due to some combination of randomness in the relationship between features and labels, and the features are not highly informative. But we know that in this application, the features must be informative (you're using the features to make your cluster assignment labels and the same features to classify) and the labels cannot be random (any two observations in the same cluster must have the same label, by construction).
