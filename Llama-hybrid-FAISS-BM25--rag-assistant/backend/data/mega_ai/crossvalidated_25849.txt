Visualizing PCA time series

I have the following experiment. My predictors are: Plant area, 6 types of plants, 5 time points and 12 replicates for class. Time points are not equally spaced. A normal plot of Area vs. time will show $6\times 12\times 5$ points in the plot which doesn't reflect the fact that 5 of those points correspond to the same plant at different time point but whose Area has changed with time. Is there a plot that shows some sort of derivative approach?
