We are just wrapping up a project in which myself and 4 others developed a rather successful, distributed enterprise application. We started using Win32 and then switched to WPF after the first iteration to meet the demands of our usability expert. Here is my experience. WPF has some really, really great features. In general, it makes the really hard things trivial (such as creating listboxes that show rich presentation data, such as images mixed with tables, copy, etc.), but in turn can make the "this used to be so easy in Win32" painfully frustrating. I've been working in WPF for 6 months now, and I still find databinding a combobox to an XML dataprovider a dreaded experience. As I eluded to above, WPF has some great and not-so-great binding. I love how you can bind to an XML document or inline-fragment using XPath , but I hate how you can only use the built-in binding validations if your binding is two-way (and I doubly hate how you can't force the built-in binding validations to pass user input back to the object, even if the data falls outside the range of some business rule). WPF has a huge learning curve. It's not even a curve - it's a wall. It's a rough go. It's a completely different way of working with Windows presentation, and, for me anyways, it required a lot of reading and playing before I started to feel somewhat comfortable. It's not the easiest thing in the world, but it allows you to do some incredibly powerful stuff (e.g. In our project I created a form engine that creates full fledged XAML forms from XML using about 300 lines of XSLT - complete with full binding and validation). Overall, I'm extremely satisfied that we chose XAML, despite the learning curve, the somewhat buggy nature of it all, and some of the deep frustrations. The positives have far outweighed the negatives and it allowed us to do things I didn't think were possible without an enormously heavy hit to performance. If you decide to go the route of WPF, I would highly recommend these 2 books: Windows Presentation Foundation Unleashed, by Adam Nathan is a great intro, with full colour! It reads like a blog and gives you a great great intro - http://www.amazon.ca/Windows-Presentation-Foundation-Unleashed-WPF/dp/0672328917/ref=pd_ys_iyr3 Programming WPF: Building Windows Ui with Windows Presentation Foundation, by Chris Sells. More detail and a great book to accompany the WPF Unleashed - http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-WPF-Building-Presentation-Foundation/dp/0596510373 Good luck!
