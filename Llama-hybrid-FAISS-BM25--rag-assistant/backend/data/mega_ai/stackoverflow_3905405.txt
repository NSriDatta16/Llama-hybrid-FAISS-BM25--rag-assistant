You are using the getIdentifier wrong. You don't specify the text but the identifier of the text, in your case that would be txt_afirsttext or txt_asecondtext . int i = this.getResources(). getIdentifier("txt_asecondtext", "string", this.getPackageName()); I think there's no way to locate a String resource identifier by its content. It would be like passing a byte stream to locate a drawable. Does your application really need this weird way of getting resources? I'm quite sure you could use a better approach to dynamically load resources, though your first paragraph describes your scenario as a mysterious one :) edit: Answer fixed. Thanks to tdroza for the correction.
