VC ++ express, how do I fix this error?

I have experience programming in C#, but I'm taking a C++ class this semester, and I'm writing my second project, but I keep getting this error when I try to build a debug configuration of my program. My build log is below, any ideas on what's going on? I'm at a loss. Thanks everyone! 1>------ Rebuild All started: Project: Project_2, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------ 1>Deleting intermediate and output files for project 'Project_2', configuration 'Debug|Win32' 1>Compiling... 1>main.cpp 1>Linking... 1>LINK : C:\Users\Alex\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\Project_2\Debug\Project_2.exe not found or not built by the last incremental link; performing full link 1>Embedding manifest... 1>Project : error PRJ0002 : Error result 31 returned from 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\bin\mt.exe'. 1>Build log was saved at "file://c:\Users\Alex\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\Project_2\Project_2\Debug\BuildLog.htm" 1>Project_2 - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s) ========== Rebuild All: 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 skipped ==========
