unicode string literals in C++/CLI

Lets say I have this fragment of code which returns a unicode CLR string with Cyrillic letters property String^ EIDErrorDescriptionSr { String^ get() { switch(EIDErrorCode) { case EID_OK: return "Операција успешно завршена"; ... When I read the property in C# code referencing this assembly, I get a bunch of the "?" as if the C++ compiler "flattened" the string to single-byte chars. I did save the C++ source file as UTF-8 (even Unicode) and I always get this warning from the compiler for every non-ansi character: warning C4566: character represented by universal-character-name '\u041E' cannot be represented in the current code page (1252) Now, is there a compiler switch to force compiler to treat literals as unicode? I can't seem to find one.
