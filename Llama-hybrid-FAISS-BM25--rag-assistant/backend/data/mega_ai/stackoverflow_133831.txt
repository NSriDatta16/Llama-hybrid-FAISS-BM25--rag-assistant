Lucky I am not working for an organization use product ship from Microsoft is a needed. So I might not directly answer to your question, However in term of using MonoRail I enjoy every part of the framework although the lack of documentation but test suite are there to guide me through. In short I do not want to invested time in learning new framework although it closely match (each had it own convention) but ASP.NET MVC still lack of some features that I already familiar with such as feature mention by Dale Ragon ControllerDetail, ActiveRecord and so on.
