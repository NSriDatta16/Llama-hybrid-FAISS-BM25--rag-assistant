One point that hasn't been brought up yet is that you are obviously used to seeing projects with only java sources in them. however, if you throw in some other source file types, i think the organization makes more sense, e.g.: src/main resources java groovy each sub-dir has a specific classification of files: java -> things that are compiled as java files groovy -> things that are compiled as groovy scripts resources -> uncompiled data used for whatever... (also, these may be filtered to add compile-time info) also (as i've noted in some comments already), i don't usually make the resources directory flat. files may be nested into a package-like structure or into other sub-directories as appropriate (to my sense of organization).
