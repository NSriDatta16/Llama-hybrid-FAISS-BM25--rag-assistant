WHERE clause causing table to omit LEFT JOIN rule

I am essentially attempting to modify this stored procedure. Modified stored procedure: CREATE PROCEDURE sp1(d1 date, d2 date, client INT(10)) declare d datetime; create TEMPORARY TABLE foo (d date NOT NULL, Amount INT(10) DEFAULT 0); set d = d1; while d NOTE: the WHERE clause... p.ClientId = client I was wracking my brain trying to figure out why it was omitting the zero's. upon removal of WHERE p.ClientId = client the procedure began to return NULL... Why is the WHERE clause ommiting the null rows? I am probably misunderstanding what exactly a LEFT JOIN is. How can I go about filtering the SUM(p.Amount) results to only return the sum WHERE clientId = client ?
