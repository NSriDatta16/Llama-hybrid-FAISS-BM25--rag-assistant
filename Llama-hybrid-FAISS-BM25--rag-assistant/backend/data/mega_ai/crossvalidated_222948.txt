Regression models similar to Random Forest

I am trying to create an ensemble model. I tried some classical models, in which RandForest 's accuracy is around 85% and other models like Decision trees, NNet has accuracy from 35%-63% . So I need some models which are close to the working of Randforest or its variants. I am using R and my model is a Regression Model
