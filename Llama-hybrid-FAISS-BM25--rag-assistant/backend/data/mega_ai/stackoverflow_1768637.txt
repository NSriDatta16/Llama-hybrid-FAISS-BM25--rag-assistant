A typical progression path is to study algorithms and [data] structures . This may seem boring but will provide you with important skill for the long haul. To give you an idea of the kind of stuff this is about, check MIT's Open CourseWare 6.006 . You do not necessarily need to follow this class in full (just to give you an idea of what is meant by algorithms and data structures. Alternatively you can try and develop a game , by leveraging existing libraries, but the risk is that you'd develop somewhat of a superficial understanding of things. (Enough to "glue" various things together...) To be sure a video game would be much cooler to demo to your boy/girl-friend than say a fancy sort algorithm ;-)
