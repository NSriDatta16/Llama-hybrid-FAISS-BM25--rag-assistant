awk or sed: Best way to grab [this text]

I'm trying to parse various info from log files, some of which is placed within square brackets. For example: Tue, 06 Nov 2007 10:04:11 INFO processor:receive: [someuserid], [somemessage] msgtype=[T] What's an elegant way to grab 'someuserid' from these lines, using sed, awk, or other unix utility?
