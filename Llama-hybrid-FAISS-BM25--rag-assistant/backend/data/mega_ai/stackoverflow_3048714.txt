What would be a lot easier to do would be to pull in the entire Magento engine into your external page. This [unlike the rest of Magento] is pretty easy to do. All you have to do is the following: // Load Up Magento Core define('MAGENTO', realpath('/var/www/magento/')); require_once(MAGENTO . '/app/Mage.php'); $app = Mage::app(); Now you can use any of the Magento objects/classes as if you were inside of Magento and get your attributes $product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load(1234); $product->getSku(); $product->getYourCustomAttribute(); etc etc.
