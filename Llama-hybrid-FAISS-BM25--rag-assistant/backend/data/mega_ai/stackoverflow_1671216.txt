Open,Read,Write Files on Network Attached Storage via VBScript

I have thousands of small CSV files I want to aggregate (with a little munging in-script first). They are on a NAS device, a "SNAP" Server to be more exact. I've had some success with VBA from Excel - doing about 700 files in about a minute, if I recall (was a month ago). Actually, it was half-success: the snap server is home to 80% pdfs and some proprietary-format files and only 20% CSVs. The Loop to test for filetype took the execution time north of 2 hours and the script apparently completely ignored date filtering I put in. The quick result or 'success' was on 700 copies of the CSVs I made and put on my C drive. I've been doing VBA scripting for almost 20 years, and I think I'm decent at it; I do a lot of CSV reading and writing from VBA the last 9 years. So my question is more about your experience with snap servers or NAS generally. Can I not treat the snap server more or less like any drive/folder with VBA? Would VBScript be more appropriate? (already using FileSystemObject, after all) If I can use VBS can I store the script on the NAS and run it using taskscheduler? I'd appreciate any tips or gotchas from you folks who have experience with snap servers!
