You can use the USER_AGENT header to recognize most search engine crawlers as described in this question . However, be warned that what you seem to be trying to do - presenting different content to crawlers than human visitors - is a technique also known as "cloaking" and not well received at all by search engines. As far as I know, with Google, this can lead to heavy penalties, up to your site vanishing from the index completely. I would let this be, and employ legit SEO optimization instead.
