There is no such delegate method as tableView:touchesBegan:withEvent: . If you want to override -touchesBegan:withEvent: for your UITableView , you will need to subclass UITableView . Most problems like this are often better implemented with a UIGestureRecognizer . In the above, I'd probably use a UITapGestureRecognizer .
