IBM WebSphere vs Oracle Fusion

I have been asked to research the advantages/disadvantages the two application servers, but am new to the space and am having a terrible time finding an unbiased comparison of the two platforms. I understand that this is a broad question and I hate that I can't give a very specific use case (other than it will be an implementation in an organization with out a full time admin dedicated to management and it will be running in a mixed environment against JD Edwards/Oracle and SQLServer). Does anyone know of any (recently published) content that does a reasonable comparison or can any offer any insight into which might be the better choice and why. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
