There is no reason in principle why chi-square should not be applied to a 6 x 2 table. It is correct that small expected frequencies can be a bit problematic for chi-square. With 60 people and a 6 x 2 table the average expected frequency is necessarily 5 but the advice that no expected frequency should be less than 5 has not to my knowledge been promoted in any recent text. A better rule of thumb is that expected frequencies should ideally all be greater than 1. Fisher's exact test also sounds a distinct possibility, but not correlation. You need to study a better text, as some of the ideas you have are confused. Alan Agresti has written texts on categorical data analysis at several different levels.
