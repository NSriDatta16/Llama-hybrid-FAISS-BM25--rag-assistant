There have been numerous efforts to provide refactoring tools for C++, most of them failed pretty early, because the creation of such tools requires the full ability to process C++ source code, i.e. you need a working and full c++ compiler in the first place to implement even the most basic forms of automated source to source transformations. Fortunately, with the introduction of plugins into gcc , it it's finally becoming foreseeable that related efforts may actually be able to leverage an existing C++ compiler for this purpose, instead of having to resort to their own implementations of a C++ compiler. For a more in depth discussion, you may want to check out this . For the time being, the most promising candidate to provide widely automated C++ refactoring support, is certainly the Mozilla pork project, along with its related companion project Dehydra .
