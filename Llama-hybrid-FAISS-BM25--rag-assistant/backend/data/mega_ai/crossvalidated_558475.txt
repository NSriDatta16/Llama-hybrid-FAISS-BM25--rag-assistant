S-Shaped/Vertical ROC curve crossing the diagonal

I am running binary logistic regression and when the ROC curve is created this is the output (see below): I believe it makes sense somewhat, as the model does have 100% specificity and 0% sensitivity at the moment, but what consequences does it have? Is it okay to continue with the analysis? Is it just a mistake made in graphing the ROC curve? The other tests indicate the model is good and useful but I am not sure how to interpret the ROC graph in this case. Thank you in advance :)
