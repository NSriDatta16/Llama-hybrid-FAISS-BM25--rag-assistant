Denote $\phi(z) = 1 - a_1z$ , $\theta(z) = 1 + b_1z$ . Under the assumption that $\phi(z) \neq 0$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $|z| \leq 1$ (i.e., $|a_1| . Of course, $\phi(z)$ and $\theta(z)$ should have no common zeros, i.e., $a_1 \neq -b_1$ ), $X_t$ has the representation (see Theorem 3.1.1 and Definition 3.1.3 in Time Series: Theory and Methods (Second Edition) by P. J. Brockwell and R. A. Davis): \begin{align} X_t = \sum_{j = 0}^\infty \psi_j w_{t - j}, \quad t = 0, \pm 1, \ldots, \tag{1} \end{align} i.e., $\{X_t\}$ is causal. It then follows by $(1)$ and the assumption of $\{w_t\}$ that \begin{align} \operatorname{Cov}(X_0, w_0) = \psi_0\operatorname{Var}(w_0) = \psi_0\sigma^2, \end{align} where $\psi_0$ is determined by (see Equation (3.3.5) in the same reference above) \begin{align} (1 - a_1z)(\psi_0 + \psi_1 z + \psi_2 z^2 + \cdots) = 1 + b_1 z, \end{align} i.e., $\psi_0 = 1$ . Therefore, your answer is correct (provided the time series is causal). Alternatively, if you are told that $\{X_t\}$ is causal, then by \begin{align} X_0 - a_1X_{-1} = w_0 + b_1w_{-1}, \end{align} we have \begin{align} \operatorname{Cov}(X_0 - a_1X_{-1}, w_0) = \operatorname{Cov}(w_0 + b_1w_{-1}, w_0) = \sigma^2. \tag{2} \end{align} Since $\operatorname{Cov}(X_{-1}, w_0) = 0$ by causality, $(2)$ implies $\operatorname{Cov}(X_0, w_0) = \sigma^2$ .
