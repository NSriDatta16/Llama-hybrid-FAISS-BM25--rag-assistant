float the element containing the paragraph, float: left the content, and float: right the last line. The floated container will be as wide as the whole paragraph, so right-floating the last line will cause its right edge to line up with the right edge of the preceding text. Example: Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. "'T is some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door— Only this, and nothing more." If you need the whole thing to be centred within its parent container, you can set the topmost to text-align: center and use display: inline-block for the text container. I don't think you need to float it if you use this method: Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. "'T is some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door— Only this, and nothing more."
