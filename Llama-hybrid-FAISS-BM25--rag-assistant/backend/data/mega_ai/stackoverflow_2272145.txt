edit: http://php.net/each says: each Warning This function has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 7.2.0. Relying on this function is highly discouraged. Using key() is fine. If you're going to fetch the value anyway you can also use each() and list() . $arr = array ('dynamic_key' => 'Value'); list($key, $value) = each($arr); echo $key, ' -> ', $value, "\n"; prints dynamic_key -> Value
