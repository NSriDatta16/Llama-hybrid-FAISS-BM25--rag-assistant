I would guess the fitted sigmas are estimates of the actual conditional standard deviations, not their logarithms. If you cannot find this information in the help files, simulate a time series by a known data generating process. Estimate the model and obtain the fitted sigmas. See if they are closer to the actual ones or to their logarithms. When I tried this (see the code below), I got fitted sigmas close to the true conditional standard deviations, not their logarithms. library(rugarch) set.seed(1); x=rnorm(1e3) # true conditional standard deviation = 1 at all times uspec=ugarchspec(variance.model=list(model="eGARCH")) ufit=ugarchfit(spec=uspec,data=x) sigmahat=sigma(ufit) print(head(sigmahat)) (It would be more elegant to use ugarchpath for simulating an actual EGARCH series, but I just used an i.i.d. one.)
