How to interact between Web App and Windows Form Application

I have a problem where a Web Application needs to (after interaction from the user via Javascript) 1) open a Windows Forms Application 2) send a parameter to the app (e.g. an ID) Correspondingly, the Windows Forms Application should be able to 1) send parameters back to the Web Application (updating the URL is ok) 2) open the Web App in a new brower, if it does not exist If many browser windows are open it's important that the correct one is updated. Windows Forms Application is in ASP.NET Browser is IE6+ The applications are controlled and internal for a specific organisation so it's not a question of launching a custom app. Question A) Is this possible? Question B) How do I send parameters to an open Windows Forms Application from a Web App? Question C) If updating the Web App, how do I make sure the right browser is targeted?
