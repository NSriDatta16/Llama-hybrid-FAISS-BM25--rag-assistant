When dealing with time series prediction, incorporating external datasets into both the training and testing phases can provide valuable information to improve the model's performance. Here are some common approaches: Include Historical Values in Training Data: Include historical values of external features (e.g., GDP rate, unemployment rate) in your training dataset along with the corresponding target variable (the variable you are trying to predict). Train your time series model on this extended dataset, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships between the target variable and external features. Use Lagged Values of External Features: Include lagged values of external features in both the training and testing datasets. This means using past values of external features as additional input features for each time step. For example, if you are predicting the target variable for time t, include the values of external features at times t-1, t-2, etc., as additional input features. Predict External Features for the Test Set: Train a separate model to predict future values of external features for the test period. This model can be trained on historical data for those features. Use the predicted values of external features as inputs to your time series model during the testing phase. Rolling Window Approach: Train your model on a rolling window of historical data, and for each prediction in the test set, retrain the model with additional historical data up to that point. This way, the model continually adapts to the evolving patterns in both the target variable and external features. Ensemble Models: Combine predictions from different models. For example, you can have one model that focuses on predicting the target variable and another model that focuses on predicting external features. Combine their predictions to improve overall performance. Feature Engineering: Create new features based on the external data that might capture relevant information for predicting the target variable. For example, create a moving average of the GDP rate over a specific period.
