Remove "this" from the variables since you are setting them as a var with in the anonymous function, using this points to that function and not "Person" which is where you are now calling them. var secretAgent = (function(){ var person = {}, firstName = "James", lastName = "Bond"; person.WhoAreYou = function() { alert("My name is " + lastName + ", " + firstName + " " + lastName); }; return person; } )(); secretAgent.WhoAreYou(); example here: JSFiddle
