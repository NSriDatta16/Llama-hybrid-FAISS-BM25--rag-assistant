I figured I'd post my own solution to this problem. It's not the most "elegant" solution, but it works for me. Essentially, I don't "localize" the XIB files directly, but I hook up every UI object that has text in it to an IBOutlet, and set the text programmatically in my UIView class. That way, all of my strings end up in the regular strings files rather than having a separate set of strings files for the XIB files. So far, it's working pretty well.
