A grid of cells can be inputed into a neural network as a matrix. A matrix is a common input shape for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is generally useful to pick a simple representation of the input and pick a representation that is common to other deep learning problems. Representing the input in an amenable way for deep learning is only one issue in the entire workflow. Since you are training a game-like agent, representing potential future actions relative to the input space will also be challenging.
