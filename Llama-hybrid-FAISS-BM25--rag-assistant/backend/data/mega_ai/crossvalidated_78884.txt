The key difference is that we are not attempting to optimize anything. Instead, we are attempting to estimate a density function - but not by estimating in some optimal manner a small number of parameters, instead by generating a lot of random numbers from the density function and going from there. So MCMC is really a random number generation technique, not an optimization technique. To see what a gradient descent-like algorithm with a stochastic component looks like, check out stochastic approximation . The simultaneous perturbation variant is quite effective and accessible.
