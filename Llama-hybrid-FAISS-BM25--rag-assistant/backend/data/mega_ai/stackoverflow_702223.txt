If you know the bitrate, it's simply bitrate (bits per second) multiplied by number of seconds. Given that HDV is 25 Mbit/s and one hour has 3,600 seconds, non-transcoded it would be: 25 Mbit/s * 3,600 s/hr = 3.125 MB/s * 3,600 s/hr = 11,250 MB/hr â‰ˆ 11 GB/hr Google's calculator can confirm The same applies with H.264 footage, although the above might not be as accurate (being variable bitrate and such). I want to archive approximately 100 hours of such content and want to figure out whether I'm looking at a big hard drive, a multi-drive unit like a Drobo, or an enterprise-level storage system. First, do not buy an "enterprise-level" storage system (you almost certainly don't need things like hot-swap drives and the same level of support - given the costs).. I would suggest buying two big drives: One would be your main drive, another in a USB enclosure, and would be connected daily and mirror the primary system (as a backup). Drives are incredibly cheap, using the above calculation of ~11 GB/hour, that's only 1.1 TB of data (for 100 hours, uncompressed). and you can buy 2 TB drives now. Drobo, or a machine with a few drives and software RAID is an option, but a single large drive plus backups would be simpler. Storage is almost a non-issue now, but encode time can still be an issue. Encoding H.264 is very resource-intensive. On a quad-core ~2.5 GHz Xeon, I think I got around 60 fps encoding standard-def (DVD) to H.264 (compared to around 300 fps with MPEG 4). I suppose that's only about 50 hours, but it's something worth considering. Also, assuming the HDV is on tapes, it's a 1:1 capture time, so that's 150 hours of straight processing, never mind things like changing tapes, entering metadata, and general delays (sleep) and errors ("opps, wrong tape").
