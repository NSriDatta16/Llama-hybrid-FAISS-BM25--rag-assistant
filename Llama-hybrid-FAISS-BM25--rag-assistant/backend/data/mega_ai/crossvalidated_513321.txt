Signed circular-linear correlation or covariance?

In my recent project, I am implementing an adaptive MCMC procedure for a set of variables, some of which are linear (e.g., temperature in Celsius), some of which are circular (e.g., direction in angles). I figures the best way to calculate the covariance matrix would be through standard deviations and a correlation matrix: $$C=\left[\matrix{\sigma^{-1}_X \\ \sigma^{-1}_{\Theta}}\right]\bf{R}\left[\matrix{\sigma^{-1}_X & \sigma^{-1}_{\Theta}}\right]$$ where $\bf{R}$ is the correlation matrix between the two random variables, $\sigma^{-1}_X$ is the inverse of the standard deviation of $X$ , and $\sigma^{-1}_{\Theta}$ is the inverse of the circular standard deviation of $\Theta$ . Both of the standard deviations are fairly easy to compute, which leaves me with finding the correlation matrix. To calculate $\bf{R}$ , the tricky part is finding the correlation between the circular and linear variables. I found this tutorial , which gives the following expression for this linear-circular correlation: $$R^2=\frac{r_{xc}^2+r_{xs}^2-2r_{xc}r_{xs}r_{cs}}{1-r_{cs}^2}$$ where $$r_{xc}=corr(x,cos(\theta))$$ $$r_{xs}=corr(x,sin(\theta))$$ $$r_{cs}=corr(sin(\theta),cos(\theta))$$ However, it appears to me that this correlation is not signed. That is to say, I can only estimate whether a correlation exists, but not whether it is positive or negative. Do I see this right? Is there an alternative to get a signed correlation between linear and circular variables, or to calculate the covariance between them?
