tl;dr answer: it depends on the data itself. longer answer: Eventually, no matter how many linear manipulations you make, your data will always contain the columns $x_2,x_3$ which may or may not have some collinearity. The answer to the question "are the correlated?" which is very much similar to the question "is the coefficient of the interaction term a zero?", depends on the data and not solely on the design. True, an orthogonal design promises individual evaluation, but this is when the data columns are independent by nature - for example, consider data of math/sports/history grades at 3 different schools. we take $n$ samples for each subgroup (overall $3n$ per school and $9n$ in the whole dataset) but by nature these are independent factors. One manipulation you might want to consider in order to obtain orthogonal columns is PCA, but then it is up to you to assign the proper explanation per column (even before estimating the model coefficients).
