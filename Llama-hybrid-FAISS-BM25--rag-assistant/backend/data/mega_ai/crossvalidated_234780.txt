One thing that makes neural networks so interesting is that every subset of layers can be thought of as a neural network itself. So, after the first layer transforms its input, the second-through-last layers can be thought of as a network of their own. So, in an optimized network, the goal of the first layer is to transform the input so that the later layers can classify it as well as possible . This means turning the input into something that's easier to work with. Hence, edges. Edges are complex pixel patterns that can be linearly combined in later layers to form even more complex features, that are even easier for the rest of the network (which itself is a sequence of networks) to classify with.
