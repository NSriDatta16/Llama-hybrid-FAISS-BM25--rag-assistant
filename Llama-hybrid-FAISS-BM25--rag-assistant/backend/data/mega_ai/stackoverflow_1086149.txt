Jquery html() and Internet Explorer Issue

The JS script: function ShowUploadingAnimation() { $('#info_msg').html(" "); $("#uploading-img").attr({ src: "images/uploading.gif", alt: "Uploading" }); } And the html usage: So my issue is the following: This method works ok in Firefox, but in Internet Explorer the gif file is loaded, but it's not animated, just static... showing only a random frame each time the button is clicked. Any suggestions?
