C# Sorting Based on Rating [Updated to Clarify]

I'm doing some machine learning stuff and I want to take some random samples and determine if a human agrees with the computer. To do this a user just votes up or down on a given item. Then I want to be able to sort by the items with the highest rating. I want to use something more complicated than simply up-down to get good results. I've looked into the Wilson Interval Score and it seems like a decent solution, but I'm wondering if there are other alternatives. I'm going to be using C# 4.0 if that matters. Edit: Added below example; Lets suppose I have 3 items and multiple people have voted on them according to the table: Item Up Down 1 6 1 2 60 11 3 100 40 In this example I would like Item 3 to be listed first, item 2 second and 3 third. This is a rough approximation of my expectations. Item 3 has the most responses and highest relative approval. Item 2 has more responses than Item 1 despite having a lower percentage approval. I'm trying to list the items in terms of some sort of relative metric and algrotithm without using something like percent approval or net score; something more complicated.
