I think you need to page more attention to 1194.22 (n) in this situation. If you really, desperately need to do without a separate label you could try something like this: But I would strongly recommend at least trying this out in a screenreader ( NVDA is free, JAWS can be used for 40 minutes on a 'free trial') or, even better, setting up a test page and getting some screen reader users to try it. Alternatively you could investigate aria-labelledby and see if that allows you to fit in your label more naturally.
