Removing whitespace from the entire file being edited : Preferences -> Java -> Editors -> Save Actions -> check Perform the selected actions on save -> check Additional actions -> click Configure.. -> go to Code organizing tab -> check Remove trailing whitespace -> select All lines . Removing whitespace only from the lines I changed : Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Save Actions -> check " Perform the selected actions on save -> check Format source code -> select Format edited lines . Note it is not necessary to click Configure the formatter settings on the Formatter page - all the code styles automatically include removing trailing whitespace. At least I couldn't find a setting for this in Formatter configuration, and it worked out of the box for built-in Java Conventions, Eclipse, Eclipse 2.1 styles, as well as GoogleStyle . When using this set-up, you obviously need to also turn off the solution to part 1 of the question. Eclipse version checked: 4.5.2, 4.11
