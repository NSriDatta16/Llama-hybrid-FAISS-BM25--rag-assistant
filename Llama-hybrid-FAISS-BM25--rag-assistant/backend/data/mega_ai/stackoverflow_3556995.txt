You can do that. But it would be even more correct to say: const char* func(){ return "String"; } The c++ spec says that string literals are given static storage duration. I can't link to it because there are precious few versions of the c++ spec online. This page on const correctness is the best reference I can find. Section 2.13.4 of ISO/IEC 14882 (Programming languages - C++) says: A string literal is a sequence of characters (as defined in 2.13.2) surrounded by double quotes, optionally beginning with the letter L, as in "..." or L"...". A string literal that does not begin with L is an ordinary string literal, also referred to as a narrow string literal. An ordinary string literal has type “array of n const char” and static storage duration (3.7), where n is the size of the string as defined below, and is initialized with the given characters. ... Whether all string literals are distinct (that is, are stored in nonoverlapping objects) is implementation defined. The effect of attempting to modify a string literal is undefined.
