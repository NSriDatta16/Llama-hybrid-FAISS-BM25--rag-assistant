Welcome to the site. Sounds to me like you want some kind of regression, with "score" (1 to 7) as the dependent variable and color, interface, and their interaction as independent variables. There are two complications: First: What type of regression? You say you "know" you can use a t-test. But that isn't clear. Using a t-test assumes that the Likert scale is interval or ratio level, that is, that the difference between (say) 1 and 2 is the same as between (say) 6 and 7. Lots of people do make this assumption, but it is not, strictly speaking, correct; at least, it's hard to know how reasonable it is. If you are not willing to make this assumption, then you can use ordinal logistic regression. Second, there may be person effects, which would mean that the errors are not independent. Suppose that Joe just rates things higher than Jill does, regardless of the thing in question. One way to deal with this is to use multilevel models, with person as a random effect. There are MLM for OLS type problems and also for ordinal logistic. But it sounds like a fairly tricky problem and you might want to hire a consultant (not me, I'm retired). If you aren't very experienced with statistics, this is not a good starting place.
