sql query to return items based on text and group ID

I am not sure how to best describe what I am trying to do (or search for it for that matter) but I am going to try. I have a pre-existing query (stored procedure) that returns items based on 3 specific ID's. What I want to do is to be able to reduce the results even further based upon a column within the results having the exact same string. I want the query to return the count of items where a certain column has the exact same values within it. For some reason I am confused about how to do this, I am drawing a complete blank about this. Here a sample of the current data: PROGRAMID DAY TIMESLOT SlotInfoDescription TITLE 2688 4 13:00-16:30 Free Time NULL 2688 4 16:30-17:10 NULL Joint Session with Search Engines: Machine Learning for Social Media Analytics 2689 4 13:10-16:00 Free Time NULL 2689 4 16:30-17:10 NULL Joint Session with Search Engines: Machine Learning for Social Media Analytics 2300 4 12:00-13:30 Free Time 2300 4 16:30-17:10 NULL Joint Session with Search Engines: Machine Learning for Social Media Analytics Here are the results I want (based on Title being the same): count = 1 Here is the current query: SELECT WS.PROGRAMID, WS.ITEMID, WS.DAY, CASE datepart(weekday, dateadd(day, WS.DAY - 1, WE.EVENTSTARTDATE)) WHEN 1 THEN 'Sun' WHEN 2 THEN 'Mon' WHEN 3 THEN 'Tue' WHEN 4 THEN 'Wed' WHEN 5 THEN 'Thu' WHEN 6 THEN 'Fri' WHEN 7 THEN 'Sat' ELSE 'N/A' END + ' ' + Convert(char(12), dateadd(day, WS.DAY - 1, WE.EVENTSTARTDATE), 101) as Date, WS.TIMESLOT, WS.SLOTTYPE, WSSTC.DESCRIPTION AS SlotTypeDescription, WS.SLOTINFO, WSSIC.DESCRIPTION AS SlotInfoDescription, ISNULL(WSI.TALKID, 0) AS TalkID, LEFT(WPI.FIRSTNAME, 10) + ' ' + LEFT(WPI.LASTNAME, 10) + ' (' + LEFT(WEA.INSTITUTION, 10) + ')' + ' - ' + LEFT(WSI.TITLE, 10) + '...' + RIGHT(WSI.TITLE, 10) AS Talk, WPI.FIRSTNAME, WPI.LASTNAME, WEA.INSTITUTION, WSI.AUTHORLINE, WSI.TITLE, LEFT(WSI.ABSTRACT, 1) AS Abstract, WS.LOCATION, WS.ADDENDUM FROM DBO.WEBSPEAKERINFO WSI INNER JOIN DBO.WEBPERSONALINFO WPI ON WSI.USERID = WPI.USERID INNER JOIN DBO.WEBEVENTAFFILIATION WEA ON WPI.USERID = WEA.USERID AND WEA.EVENTID IN @EVENTID RIGHT OUTER JOIN DBO.WEBSCHEDULESLOTTYPECODES WSSTC RIGHT OUTER JOIN DBO.WEBSCHEDULES WS ON WSSTC.SLOTTYPE = WS.SLOTTYPE ON WSI.TALKID = WS.TALKID LEFT OUTER JOIN DBO.WEBSCHEDULESLOTINFOCODES WSSIC ON WS.SLOTINFO = WSSIC.SLOTINFO INNER JOIN DBO.WEBEVENTS WE ON WE.EVENTID IN @EVENTID WHERE WS.PROGRAMID IN @EVENTID AND WS.DAY = @DAY ORDER BY DAY, TIMESLOT
