Data science degree or Computer Science degree?

I'm going to be applying for college soon and some of my choices have a data science undergrad. I've taken some online courses on introductory data analysis and have been doing kaggle projects for awhile, so I know it's something I enjoy. The only questions I have are: How relevant is the curriculum? (For example, the UCSD data science major) How reliable is the degree in the upcoming future? (Would I be able to easily get a job like if I had a CS BS) Am I better off doing CS and minoring in stats or something else? I am also planning on getting either a masters or PhD in DS/ML. I don't know if it would better to get a lower level understanding of computers like I would probably get in a CS curriculum and then just focus on data science in grad school. Thanks!
