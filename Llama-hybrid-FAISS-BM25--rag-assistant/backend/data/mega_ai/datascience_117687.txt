Should value of equation outcome be treated as variable for Random Forest model training?

For example, I got 5 variables, A to E, for prediction of a value. A B C = A - B D E the output of random forest rank C, B and A are variables with the most importance in descending order, my question is should I put (A and B) together with C into model training or they should be mutually exclusive? Thanks in advance.
