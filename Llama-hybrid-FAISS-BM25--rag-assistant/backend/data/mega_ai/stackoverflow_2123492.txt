No you didn't get it, that file will only be present on your dev machine. After you deploy your program, the file will be embedded in your program and cannot be printed. You'll have to write the code that saves the file from the resource to disk, then prints it. For example: Private Sub btnPrint_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnPrint.Click Dim path As String = Application.UserAppDataPath path = System.IO.Path.Combine(path, "Help.rtf") System.IO.File.WriteAllText(path, My.Resources.Countdown_Timer_Help) Dim printProcess As New Process printProcess.StartInfo.CreateNoWindow = True printProcess.StartInfo.FileName = path printProcess.StartInfo.Verb = "Print" printProcess.Start() End Sub Given that you have to save the resource to a file, it probably makes more sense to simply deploy the file with your app instead of embedding it as a resource and writing it to disk over and over again. Use Application.ExecutablePath to locate the file. To make that work at debug time you have to copy the file to bin\Debug. Do so by adding the file to your project with Project + Add Existing Item and setting the Copy to Output Directory property to Copy if Newer.
