To answer your subquestion: How to do the following more elegantly? post.vector 0.1 & p 0.2 & p 0.3 & p 0.4 & p 0.5 & p 0.6 & p 0.7 & p 0.8 & p 0.9 & p The easiest way to do it using base R is: group Note that the breaks go from 0 to 1. This yields: Group.1 x 1 [0,0.1] 3.030528e-13 2 (0.1,0.2] 1.251849e-08 3 (0.2,0.3] 6.385088e-06 4 (0.3,0.4] 6.732672e-04 5 (0.4,0.5] 2.376448e-01 6 (0.5,0.6] 7.372805e-01 7 (0.6,0.7] 2.158296e-02 8 (0.7,0.8] 2.691182e-03 9 (0.8,0.9] 1.205200e-04 10 (0.9,1] 3.345072e-07 And we have: > all.equal (post.vector.alt$x, post.vector) [1] TRUE
