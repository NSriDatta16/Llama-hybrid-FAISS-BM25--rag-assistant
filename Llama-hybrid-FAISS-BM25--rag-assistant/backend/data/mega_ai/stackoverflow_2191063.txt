Simply put, REST means using HTTP the way it's meant to be. Have a look at Roy Fielding's dissertation about REST . I think that every person that is doing web development should read it. As a note, Roy Fielding is one of the key drivers behind the HTTP protocol, as well. To name some of the advandages: Simple. You can make good use of HTTP cache and proxy server to help you handle high load. It helps you organize even a very complex application into simple resources. It makes it easy for new clients to use your application, even if you haven't designed it specifically for them (probably, because they weren't around when you created your app).
