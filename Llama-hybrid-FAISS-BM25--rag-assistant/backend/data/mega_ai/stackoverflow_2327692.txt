Session management between thick client and server?

My application is a Eclipse Rich Client and I would like to add authentication and authorization features to. My Users and roles are stored in a database and my application also has a web based admin console which lets me manage users and roles. I am leveraging Spring security on this admin console. So here's my requirement: I would like my thick client to provide users with a login dialog box. The authentication would need to be performed on the server side (it could be a webservice) and the roles have to flow in to the thick client. I would also like to manage sessions on the server side, somehow. I really can't think of any easy way to doing this. I know that if I were to use Spring Rich Client, it would integrate pretty well with Spring Security on the server side. But, that is not an option for me at this point. Please share your thoughts on how to acheive this. Appreciate your help.
