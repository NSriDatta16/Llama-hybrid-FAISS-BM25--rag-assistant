Three things: As Andre says , it's very hard to write a fitness function that is sufficient. This is the ultimate version of Test Driven Development. You'd have to write unit tests that provide 100% coverage of an as-yet-unwritten program. Even then, 100% coverage by itself is unlikely to be sufficient. When we've solved the problem of formally specifying the precise behaviour of all aspects of a complex system, and then verifying that a given program satisfies that specification, then we might have a chance. Genetic Programming is non-deterministic and better suited to generating approximate solutions rather than exact solutions. Genetic Programming, when applied to any problem of reasonable complexity, is phenomenally computationally expensive. Back in 1999, Genetic Programming Inc was using a 1,000-node cluster for their work in the field.
