The easiest way to do this is to aggregate your data into an array. Have the first column represent the log of the weight and the second column represent a binary coding of 1: skilled vs. 0: unskilled labor status. Fit a regression model with log-weight as the outcome and labor status as the exposure. Take the coefficient and upper and lower 95% confidence limits and exponentiate all 3. These are interpreted as the ratio of weight comparing skilled to unskilled laborers. The p-value corresponds to the significance test that this ratio has a null value of 1 (no difference). The central limit theorem doesn't apply to the ratio because you aren't sampling and thus averaging the ratios themselves. The "statistics" which are accruing are the skilled/unskilled laborer means. The $\delta$-method is another option for aggregating those data. Using the Jacobian matrix: $$ \text{Var}\left( \bar{W}_{s}/\bar{W}_{u} \right) \approx \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1/\bar{W}_u \\ -(\bar{W}_s/\bar{W}_u)^2 \end{array} \right]^T \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \text{Var} \left( \bar{W}_{s} \right) & 0 \\ 0 & \text{Var} \left( \bar{W}_{u} \right) \\ \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1/\bar{W}_u \\ -(\bar{W}_s/\bar{W}_u)^2 \end{array} \right] $$
