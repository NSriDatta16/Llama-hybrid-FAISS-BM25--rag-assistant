the word is WATERMARK http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Watermark http://digitalbush.com/projects/watermark-input-plugin/ http://cysemic.com/2008/12/very-simple-textbox-watermark-using-jquery/ I encourage to use a plugin, unless you have plenty of time developing and testing. There are many issues and side-effects to take notice of when writing this code. Validate the field as 'empty' when it contains the watermark text. Thus distinguish the watermark text from inputted text. Not submitting the watermark text. Prevent the user to type in the watermark text itself :) Styling the watermark text. etc, etc....
