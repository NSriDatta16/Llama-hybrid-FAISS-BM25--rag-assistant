What is a good machine learning academic research workflow/tools?

I'm interested in ML research and want to get some insights into how its done in practice. In particular: What kind of data are you dealing with? How are you dealing with hyper-param optimization? How are you making sure the work is reproducible? Are you using a cloud provider to run jobs on the cloud? If so, how are analyzing the results? Do you have a single number evaluation metric? Does your work involve building on top of existing models? If so, how do you obtain them Any other extra tips & tricks, best practices etc. Thanks for all the helpers!
