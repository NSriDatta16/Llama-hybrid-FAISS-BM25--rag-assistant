Well the following code will put the "PAGE X of Y " in the footer. Just changed at few places in Mark's suggested code and changed the order of the code a bit and it worked beautifully.... Instead of using writer.setFooter(footer) to set the footer, the use of document.setFooter(footer) will do the trick... Paragraph p=new Paragraph(); p.add( "Page "); p.add(new RtfPageNumber()); p.add( " of "); p.add(new RtfTotalPageNumber()); p.setAlignment(Element.ALIGN_CENTER); RtfHeaderFooter footer1 = new RtfHeaderFooter(p); document.setFooter(footer1); And A special thanks to Mark ...he was brilliant in his code searching..... Good Day...
