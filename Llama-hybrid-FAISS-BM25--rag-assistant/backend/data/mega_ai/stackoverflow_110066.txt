If the WinForms app has a proper Object model architecture defined(More like an MVC model architecture) I think it wont take much time to migrate your UI to WPF. WPF has organized its visual elements heirarchically(VisualTree) and RoutedEvents and RoutedCommands are totally new concepts in WPF. and obviously there are more stuffs like DataTemplate/Controltemplate all are at XAML level. All of these makes a very powerful and easy way to accomplish great user experience. So my major point here is that you can expect just your Object model reusable(With some modifications) in WPF and everything else on the Winforms project need to throw off. Ofcourse all other layers need not be modified(Comunication Layer/DataLayer)
