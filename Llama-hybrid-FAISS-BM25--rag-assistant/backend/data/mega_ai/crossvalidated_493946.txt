Is it possible to resize/add noise to a hidden layer during training?

I'm working on class for a project where my basic idea is to create a "drop-in" layer, so similar to drop out, I'm thinking of adding hidden units that are sampled from the same weight distribution with probability p. The problem here is that the size of the neural network would probably keep growing dynamically as we train, right? I was wondering if there is anyway to achieve this, or something similar to this?
