Don't just approach this by "how can I have the data to be able to run algorithm X on it". First you need to go to the drawing board, and make sure you are asking the right question . "What would KMeans yield if I one hot encode the data" is probably not the question you want to answer... So first begin by formalizing the problem you want to solve. what is a good cluster , on your data, for your task? It's probably not the SSQ objective... Then from that, you can try to find an approach that optimizes this quality; at least approximately. For mixed data, hierarchical clustering is often much better. Because you can define a domain specific distance function, and then apply easy to understand optimization such as average-link, complete-link based on this distance. This yields clusters with well understood properties.
