TinyMCE issue where all text is getting centered if user centers top line

I have a website where i embed tiny mce to allow the users to edit the main content on the site. The issue is that if a users highlights the top row and clicks center button, the text alignment for the entire document (multiple paragraphs) all get centered. has anyone seen this or have any suggestions?
