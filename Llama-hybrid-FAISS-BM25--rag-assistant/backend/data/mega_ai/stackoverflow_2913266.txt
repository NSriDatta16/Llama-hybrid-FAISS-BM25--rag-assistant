Resizing a rectangular array

Does a smarter way than the following exist to resize a rectangular array? double[,] temp = new double[newSize, originalSecondDimension]; Array.Copy(original, temp, original.Length); I was concerned about duplicating a huge array and the memory necessary to do it. What does the Array.Resize() do internally? Thanks, Alberto
