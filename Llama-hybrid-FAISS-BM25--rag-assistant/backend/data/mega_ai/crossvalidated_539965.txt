Help understanding Bayesian Regression versus Frequentist Regression

I'm trying to wrap my head around this and hope that someone can maybe explain it to me in a simple way. I built two models: A frequentist regression A Bayesian regression with some priors Here is an example using data that is the height and weight of adult women: library(tidyverse) library(rstanarm) df % mutate(height_c = height - mean(height)) fit_ols Looking at the coefficients of these two models, they are nearly identical: coef(fit_ols) coef(fit_stan) > coef(fit_ols) (Intercept) height_c 136.7333 3.4500 > coef(fit_stan) (Intercept) height_c 136.736551 3.456117 They also make very similar predictions of body weight: df % mutate(predict_ols = predict(fit_ols, newdata = .), predict_stan = predict(fit_stan, newdata = .)) df > df height weight height_c predict_ols predict_stan 1 58 115 -7 112.5833 112.5705 2 59 117 -6 116.0333 116.0237 3 60 120 -5 119.4833 119.4770 4 61 123 -4 122.9333 122.9302 5 62 126 -3 126.3833 126.3834 6 63 129 -2 129.8333 129.8367 7 64 132 -1 133.2833 133.2899 8 65 135 0 136.7333 136.7432 9 66 139 1 140.1833 140.1964 10 67 142 2 143.6333 143.6496 11 68 146 3 147.0833 147.1029 12 69 150 4 150.5333 150.5561 13 70 154 5 153.9833 154.0094 14 71 159 6 157.4333 157.4626 15 72 164 7 160.8833 160.9158 I'm curious as to why my stan model does have coefficients that are pulled closer to my priors? I tried this with even small data, in the hopes to see the stan model diverge from the frequentist model and more closely reflect my prior knowledge, to no avail: set.seed(4873) df_small % sample_n(8) df_small %>% summarize(avg_hgt = mean(height), sd_hgt = sd(height), avg_wgt = mean(weight), sd_wgt = sd(weight)) fit_ols_small coef(fit_ols_small) (Intercept) height_c 136.533990 3.636453 > coef(fit_stan_small) (Intercept) height_c 136.532238 3.641111 What am I missing here or what am I doing wrong? Shouldn't my prior knowledge in some way be reflected here, otherwise, why wouldn't I just use the frequentist approach to linear regression (other than the fact that I can get other info from the Bayes model, like posterior simulations that allow me to create a distribution of possible outcomes).
