jQuery Ui: Cant drag element from Div with overflow

I have a simple UL in a div with the overflow set to automatic and a fixed height. Each LI is draggable via jQuery. Problem is that I cannot drag them from the div (they disappear when dragged to the boundaries). I have looked at this question and its answers, but the solution here does not seem to work for me (setting the scroll option): jQuery Draggable and overflow issue Thanks
