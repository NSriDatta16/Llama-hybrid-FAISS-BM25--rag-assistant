Java bytebuffer to C

From a C program on Windows we need to read and write like a Java bytebuffer which stores binary in BIG_ENDIAN The algorithm is described at : http://mindprod.com/jgloss/binaryformats.html Need to read and write int and float. Does anyone have example c or C++ code that does this or a reference ? TIA, Bert
