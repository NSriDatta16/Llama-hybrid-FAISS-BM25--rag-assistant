Map of activated brain regions for special feature extraction method

I have read the following paper: "Feature Extraction for fMRI-Based Human Brain Activity Recognition". The most useful point for me is the new method of extracting features from fMRI images. It introduces Covariance Selection based feature selection (in the end, eigenvectors of some expression are chosen as new features). My problem is now how to compute a activation map of the brain for different tasks. I feed these new features into a classifier (e.g. SVM) and train the classifier (there are several tasks). Then I want to create a map of the activated regions in the brain for each task with the help of the information from the classifier. When the features are voxels this is easy (just using the weighting of the classifier). Does somebody know how this could be done with these new feature extraction method?
