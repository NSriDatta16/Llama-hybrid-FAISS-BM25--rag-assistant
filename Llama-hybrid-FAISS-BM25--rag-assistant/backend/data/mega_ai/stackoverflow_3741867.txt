Yes, zip has an archive directory that allows jumping to a specific file. If you intend to spend much more time reading from the archive than changing it, this should be effective. If you have to be able to commit changes back to the non-volatile storage, then some other format besides zip would be better. Another approach you could try would be storing blobs (binary large objects) in a lightweight database.
