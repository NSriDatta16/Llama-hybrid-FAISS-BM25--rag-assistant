All comes down to how efficiently you'll be using the storage space and what your access requirements are. Having to set aside memory to hold a 10,000 x 10,000 array to store only 10 points would be a hideous waste of memory. On the flip side, saving memory by storing the points in a linked list will also be pointless if you spend so much time iterating the list to find the one point you actually need in the 10,000,000 stored. Some of the downsides of both can be overcome. sparse arrays, pre-sorting the list by some rule so "needed" points float to the top, etc...
