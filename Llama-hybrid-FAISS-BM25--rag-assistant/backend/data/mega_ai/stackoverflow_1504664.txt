T-SQL code to get a DateTime contain only Month and Year from any DateTime

Given a table Event containing a field called EventTime of type DateTime and that the value will contain both date and time elements, I need create a summary query which counts the number of events in each month. The resulting type of the Group By field must also be Date Time with a 0 time element and set to 1st day of the month. This is what I have so far but its not very elegant and I'm not sure its particularly efficient. SELECT COUNT(1) AS [CountOfEvents], DATEADD(d, 1 - DAY(EventTime), DATEADD(dd, 0, DATEDIFF(dd, 0, EventTime))) AS [Month] FROM [Event] GROUP BY DATEADD(d, 1 - DAY(EventTime), DATEADD(dd, 0, DATEDIFF(dd, 0, EventTime))) Better suggestions for either more efficiency or elegance?
