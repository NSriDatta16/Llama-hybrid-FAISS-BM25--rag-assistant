DOCUMENT_ROOT refers to the physical path on the webserver. There is no generic way to detect the http path fragment. Quite often you can however use PHP_SELF or REQUEST_URI Both depend on how the current script was invoked. If the current request was to the index.php in a /whatever/ directory, then try the raw REQUEST_URI string. Otherwise it's quite commonly: It's often best if you use a configurable constant for such purposes however. There are too many ifs going on here.
