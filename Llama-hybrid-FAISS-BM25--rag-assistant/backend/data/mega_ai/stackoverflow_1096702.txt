Delphi and Performance Coding. Statement Performance and code length results

Lets simply fantasize and talk about performance. As I have read the article in about.delphi.com called performance programming, there was interesting paragraphs claiming that Case statement ( in fact I prefer calling it as structure ) is faster than If ; For is faster than While and Repeat, but While is the slowest loop operator. I probably understand why While is the slowest, but ... what about others. Have you tested / played / experimented or even gained real performance boost if changed, for example, all IF statements to Cases where possible? Also I would like to talk about other - modified - loop and if statement behaviors in Delphi IDE, but it would be another question. Shall we start, ladies and gentleman?
