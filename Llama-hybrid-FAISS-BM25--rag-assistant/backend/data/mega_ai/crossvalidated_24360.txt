How to fit the coefficients of a first order linear auto-regressive function without noise in the model, and the coefficient are equal?

I have a simple auto-regressive function: $x_{i+1} = c - cx_{i}$ It is linear and first order . There is no noise in the model although there is in the data. I am using Matlab and have a vector (time series) of numbers that has arisen from a process governed by the above equation. I would like to obtain the value of the coefficient $c$ for the least squares fit to this data. How can this be done in Matlab by using a library function or toolbox? I have looked at the ar command , but fail to see how this can be used in my case. I consider writing instead a function to take the data and calculate the root-mean-squared error over a set of possible values for $c$ choosing the one that is smallest.
