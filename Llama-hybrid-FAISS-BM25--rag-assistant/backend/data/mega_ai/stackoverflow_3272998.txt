Effect like Interface Builder connection lines on iPhone

Hi I'd like little bit of help on something. In my app, I have a UITableView which is populated with custom cells that represent images. (i.e. selecting a row displays a picture in an image view). What I would like to do, is have an icon in the custom cell that I could drag to one of a series of image views. Similar to the way you can drag a line in IB to set connections. Once the user releases their finger I will have it check what part of the screen they released it and if it is one one of these rects that represent the picture frames, it will populate the picture frame with the image and the line will disappear. I have never drawn lines in my app before so thats not something I know how to do (so im just looking for a link to a tutorial or class definition) and second, what problems will I have since the start point of the line is in a UITableViewCell and the end point is in the main view?
