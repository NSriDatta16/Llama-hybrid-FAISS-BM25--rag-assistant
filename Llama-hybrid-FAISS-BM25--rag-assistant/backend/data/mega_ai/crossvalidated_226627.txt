If $X_t$ is a random process, e.g. ARIMA(p, 1, q), then you cannot know the $R^2$. The important thing to realize here is that the influence of innovations from $X_t$, an integrated time series, on its future observations do not decay over time, but their effect on $y_t$ does. The $R^2$ statistic you get will essentially be nonsense, and should be taken with a grain of salt. Granger and Newbold pointed this out in their paper Spurious Regressions in Economics ( http://wolfweb.unr.edu/homepage/zal/STAT758/Granger_Newbold_1974.pdf ). They note the following three things about regressing integrated time series on each other without first differencing: (i) Estimates of the regression coefficients are inefficient. (ii) Forecasts based on the regression equations are sub-optimal. (iii) The usual significance tests on the coefficients are invalid.
