Forecasting daily time series with many zeros

I need to forecast a univariate time-series of sales data with the following characterica. It is a daily time-series Around 70-80 % of the date nothing is sold ($x_t = 0$) At the 20-30 % remaining days there is a positive integer numberof sales The days during which nothing is sold are not always at the sameay day of the week Until now I tried the croston-method ( croston() from the forecast package in R). Is the croston-method appropriate? Are there any suitable alternatives? I am also grateful for code in R. Edit : My data looks similar to the data below: 0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0
