Storing user session data into a customized database

It's possible to store user session in database by changing the settings in factories.yml: all: storage: class: sfMySQLSessionStorage param: db_table: session # Name of the table storing the sessions database: propel # Name of the database connection to use # Optional parameters db_id_col: sess_id # Name of the column storing the session id db_data_col: sess_data # Name of the column storing the session data db_time_col: sess_time # Name of the column storing the session timestamp From the example given, it seems that the columns in the table are limited to a few predefined ones. Which means that it's not possible to store other information that Symfony doesn't anticipated, such as ip address. Is it possible to extend the database schema to include more custom columns?
