Given the context, there can be a big security concern with client access to databases. It requires either giving users access to the db, or creating a service account. Giving users direct access to the db poses risks. Both approaches open the door to exploiting desktop dll's to connect to db outside of application context (Multiple times I've seen cases where there is a common data access class that all functional operations use. And of course, this components initializes all the connection information. Reflection based access makes it is easy to get to protected or private methods, unless you assert Security Privileges). Web services expose functional operations that don't expose any sql based operations. Not only is this more secure, it abstracts your client away from your data storage implementation. Again, it depends on your context. In the Enterprise/ISV realm though, it is generally a big no-no.
