Need help understanding ordinal logistic regression output, R

I THINK this will boil down to a simple yes/no answer, but allow me to walk you through my thought process. I have data like this: df Consisting of a survey question that we gave participants with answers on a likert-type scale of never, rarely, sometimes, often, and always. Those participants also had a "score" from a previous instrument (continuous variable). What we're trying to examine is whether the continuous "score" predicted the survey response. Given my survey results are ordinal, and given my score variable is continuous, I figured that an ordinal logistic regression like shown in these examples was my best bet . So I ran this code: library(MASS) m Like in that UCLA example and I received this output: When sharing this output with my colleagues, I want to make sure I am interpreting correctly (and it was the right test). So two part question: -Given I am trying to see whether "score" predicted "Survey" response, was this the correct statistical test to choose? -If it was the correct test, I interpret the results as "yes, there is a significant relationship (basing that on the confint not crossing zero) and for a one unit increase in 'score' the odds of answering higher on the survey multiply by 1.065. Is that correct?
