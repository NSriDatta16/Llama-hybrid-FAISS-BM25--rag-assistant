Inject data in an swf at compile time

Is it possible to inject data, for example a collection of assets (video, images...), in an swf at compile time? We have a flex application that needs to be able to export an swf at runtime that contains all the necessary data, because it needs to run as a standalone application (on- and offline). The idea so far was to create a server side script that calls the flex compiler and feed it the data it needs. This approach seems to work fine using the [Embed] tag for single files, but it gets kind of messy when trying to inject collections of data that vary in length for each exported swf. We could generate an mxml file with one embedded variable for each asset and include it at compile time, but that approach seems for from ideal. We've looked into some actionscript bytecode libraries, but those do not seem to be fit for this. Any suggestions or other approaches for this kind of problem? Thx, Bert
