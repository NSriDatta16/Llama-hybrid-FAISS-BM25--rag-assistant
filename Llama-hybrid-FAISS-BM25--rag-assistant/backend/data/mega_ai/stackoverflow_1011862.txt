Project planning, Note taking tool for developers

i am looking for a project planning tool that include features like a organizer, todo list, target * deadlines of projects. since i am a developer, it will be good to have a tool that can also do modelling like UML/ERD etc. i am also looking for something that can do note taking. something like a blog with code snipplets - so with syntax highlighting. OneNote etc all does not have code highlighting - the best i can do is use an online syntax highlighter to generate HTML then paste in which is slow. of course its good to have a free/open source tool that has all the features i listed. but its fine to know what paid options are there
