In addition to complete system emulation, QEMU can also emulate SPARC at the user-space level, so that you can write a program in SPARC assembly and use standard Linux system calls and it will call the standard x86 kernel versions... works pretty well!! If you aren't sure you want to learn SPARC assembly specifically, you might look into MIPS instead. Most wireless routers are based on MIPS processors and can run Linux. It is similar to SPARC, of a similar vintage, and along with SPARC it's one of the two original RISC architectures... in my opinion MIPS is actually a little bit more of a clean and elegant architecture than SPARC, but they're both great.
