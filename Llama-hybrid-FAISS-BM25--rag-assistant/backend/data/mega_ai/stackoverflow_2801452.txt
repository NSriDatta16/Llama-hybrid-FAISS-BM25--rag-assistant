You write "I'd like to add WNDS, WNPS pragma ...". Why do you like that? Since version 9 (I think) Oracle does this check for you. The only reason you might want to add the pragma yourself, is when: you know where in a SQL statement you want to use the function AND you know which purity levels are required for this use AND you want to find violations at compile time instead of run time The easiest option is to just skip all the pragma declarations altogether. Having said that, you can omit the restrict_references pragma to function_private if you add the TRUST keyword to the restrict_references pragma of function_public. http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B10501_01/appdev.920/a96590/adg10pck.htm#21958 Regards, Rob.
