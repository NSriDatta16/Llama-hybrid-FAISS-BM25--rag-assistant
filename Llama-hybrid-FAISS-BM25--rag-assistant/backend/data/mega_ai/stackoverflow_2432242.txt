I am writing an audio recognition program in C++, and I am using now PostgreSql for data storage. So I am interested in an answer too :). What I can propose is that, the data storage should be chosen according the recognition algorithm. If you compare your image with saved images 1 by 1, then binary files seem to be quicker. But if during recognition you work with several images at once, a database may be more speedy solution.
