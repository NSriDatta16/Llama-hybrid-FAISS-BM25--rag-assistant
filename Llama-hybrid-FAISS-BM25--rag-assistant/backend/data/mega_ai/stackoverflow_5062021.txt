Use .png as custom ribbon icon in Access 2007

I'd like to use a .png as a custom icon in the Access 2007 ribbon. Here's what I've tried so far: I am able to load .bmp's and .jpg's as custom images without any problem. I can load .gif's, but it doesn't seem to preserve the transparency. I can't load .png's at all. I'd really like to use .png's to take advantage of the alpha-blending that is not available in the other formats. I found a similar question on SO , but that just deals with loading custom icons of any kind. I am specifically interested in .png's. There is an answer from Albert Kallal to that question that links to a class module he had written that appears to do exactly what I want: meRib("Button1").Picture = "HappyFace.png" Unfortunately, the link in that answer is dead. I also found this site which offers a download of a 460 line module full of dozens of API calls to get support for transparent icons. Before I go that route I wanted to ask the experts here if they know of a better way. I know .png is pretty new-fangled and all, but I'm hoping the Office development folks slipped in some native support for the format.
