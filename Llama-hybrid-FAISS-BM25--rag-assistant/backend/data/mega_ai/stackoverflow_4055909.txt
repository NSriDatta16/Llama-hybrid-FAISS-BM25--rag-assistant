C++: Elegant way to split string and stuff contents into std::vector

I would like to split a string along whitespaces, and I know that the tokens represent valid integers. I would like to transform the tokens into integers and populate a vector with them. I could use boost::split, make a vector of token strings, then use std::transform. What is your solution? Using boost is acceptable.
