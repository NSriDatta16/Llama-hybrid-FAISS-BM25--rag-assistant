How to handle Yes No dialog that was pop-up using Javascript on button click

I am having an update button on my from on clicking update i would like to prompt the user as Do you want to delimit the record with Yes and No buttons. If the user clicks on Yes i would like to execute the code which can delimit the record if not just update the record. My sample code protected void btnUpdate1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { EmpID = Convert.ToInt32(HiddenField1.Value); if (ID == 2) { oEmployeePersonalData.EmpID = EmpID; oEmployeePersonalData.PhoneNumberTypeID = ddlPhoneType.SelectedValue; oEmployeePersonalData.PhoneNumber = Convert.ToInt64(txtph1.Text); oEmployeePersonalData.EndDate = DateTime.Today.AddDays(-1); //As per my requirement if i click on yes i would like to execute this code if (oEmployeePersonalData.PhoneDetailUpdate()) { } // If No different code
