Foreign keys are only supported when MySQL uses the InnoDB storage engine. MySQL uses MyISAM as the default storage engine, where foreign key constraints and are simply ignored. Try your example with the following tables: CREATE TABLE products ( id integer unsigned auto_increment primary key ) ENGINE=INNODB; CREATE TABLE orders ( id integer PRIMARY KEY auto_increment, product_id integer unsigned, quantity integer, INDEX product_id_idx (product_id), FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (id) ) ENGINE=INNODB; Also make sure that the referencing and referenced columns are of the exact same datatype.
