Sortable + nested lists with jQuery UI 1.8.2

This question is all over SO, but no one seems to have had the same problem as I have. When I do something like this $(function(){ $('#unique-ul').sortable({items:'li'}); }); I'd expect it to "just work". By and large, it does. I can drag any from any list to any other list, and any sublist of that is dragged with it. However, when dragging, it seems to get really confused about where it should be dropped. Here's an example using 1.8.0; it displays the same behaviour. http://jsbin.com/ewuxi3/ All the other responses I've found about this lead me to believe that this behaviour is supported by jQuery UI; for example, here is a bug registered against 1.7 about nested draggables: http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4333 I can't find anyone else who has had this issue so it suggests I am Doing It Wrong. Any clues?
