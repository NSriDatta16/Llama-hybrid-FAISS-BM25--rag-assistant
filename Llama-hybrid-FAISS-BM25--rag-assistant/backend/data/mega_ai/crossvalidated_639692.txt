If I understand correctly, you wish to use only specific sample values of $X_i^{j}$ ( $i$ for the time period and $j$ for the predictor index) to predict $Y_i$ . Say you have the sampler values: $S_i^j = 1$ if predictor $j$ is selected in time period $i$ . Then you could simply run the following regression: $$Y_i = \beta_1 S_i^1 X_i^1 + \beta_2 S_i^2 X_i^2 + ...$$ and this would only fit to the regressors on the sampled time periods. p.s. From your explanation it didn't seem to me that there was anything inherently specific to time series...
