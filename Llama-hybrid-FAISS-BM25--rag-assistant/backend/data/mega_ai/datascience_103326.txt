The simplest option in order to represent the two sentences independently of each other is to represent each of the two sentences with its own TFIDF vector of features and concatenate the two vectors. In other words you obtain 2 * N features where N is the size of the vocabulary. But at first sight it looks like the wrong approach for the problem that you're trying to solve: LR or SVM are unlikely to capture the high-level nature of paraphrasing, especially if fed with only basic vocabulary features like this. A slightly more advanced approach would be to provide the model with features which represent the relationship between the two sentences: length, words in common, readability measure, etc.
