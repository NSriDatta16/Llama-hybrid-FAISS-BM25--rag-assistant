I'm working on a website that sells different artwork, what's the best way to handle different image sizes?

I'm working on a website that will allow users to upload and sell their artwork in different sizes. I was wondering what the best way would be to handle the different file sizes automatically. A few points I was curious on: How to define different size categories (small, medium, large) in such a way that I'll be able to dynamically re-size images with proportional dimensions. Should I store actual jpegs of the different sizes for download? Or would it be easier to generate these different sizes for download on the fly My thumbnails will be somewhat larger than your average thumbnails, should I store a second 'thumbnail image' with the sites watermark overlaying it? Or once again, generate this on the fly? All opinions, advice are greatly appreciated!
