So I think (You should be sure here) you have 2-1-1 mediation. The internet is full of resources for SPSS. Start somewhere around here " http://afhayes.com/introduction-to-mediation-moderation-and-conditional-process-analysis.html ". However, if you want to use R. There are few options. Each with their own limitations. For starter, you might want to look into Tingley, Dustin, et al, 2014, "Mediation" R package. The problem with this one is you cant do sensitivity analysis for multilevel mediation. The other R package is function developed by Elizabeth Page Gould, called indirectMLM ( http://www.page-gould.com/r/indirectmlm/ ). She has wonderful resources and worked example. This is very convenient. The best thing about this package is you can, if you want, dissect the between and within subject mediation. The other package is the Bayesian Multilevel Mediation package by (Matti Vuorre & Niall Bolger, 2017), however this only do 1-1-1 mediation. Here you have a lot of graphical options and makes many procedures easy. Since your M and Y are continuous I think this package is suitable also. I hope this helps.
