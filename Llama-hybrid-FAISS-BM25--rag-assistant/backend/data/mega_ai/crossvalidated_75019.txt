Organizing data to feed random forests

I'm willing to apply machine learning with R (I will start with random forests then maybe have a look at NNs) on some data, but I don't know where to start, probably because I don't know which words to put on my problem and what to google for. My data consist in a set of events of type A, each of which contains both some specific variables and a (variable) number of elements of type B with their own variables. A typical example of such data would be horse racing : each race has its own parameters along with a list of horses and their own parameters. Now, of course the training has to be done on each element of type A independently, so tutorials using basic iris data won't work — or at least I don't understand how to apply them on events of type A instead of elements of type B. How should I organize my data set or feed it to randomForest ? Or which keywords should I use to find relevant documentation on this kind of topic ? (I tried "grouped data" without much success…) NB : For a start I can discard the common variables of each A event, if needed. But still every B element has to be considered equal of other B elements inside a single A event, and independently from other A events. Update : I've found a workaround which may work in my particular situation (still to be tested, my DB needs reorganization). The workaround is to consider parameters of the A events as parameters of each B element, so the problem simply becomes a set of B elements. However I'm not satisfied with this solution and anyway I'm not sure it could be applicable to other similar problems, the question is still open.
