What does it mean for a two dimensional feature vector to have unit variances?

What does it mean for a two dimensional feature vector to have unit variances? This is related to a Bayesian Discriminant Function problem. For example, the feature vector for one of the classes has a mean of (3, 0) and unit variances. Does that mean $\sigma^2$ is (1, 1)? Is it ($\sqrt{2}/2$, $\sqrt{2}/2$)?
