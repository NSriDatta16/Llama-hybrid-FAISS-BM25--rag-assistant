First of all, how would you want to refer to a particular row? Is it the index of the row so that you have another table or something that will help you know which row you are interested? or is it by an id or something? These ideas come to mind Your approach Binary search. Assuming you have average length (size/rows), you can use a binary search to find a row assuming there is an identifier in the row which is ordered and can tell you if you are hit or miss. Loading it to a database! By the way, what prevents you to do that? You can even use SQL express - which is free - and to get around the size limit, you can shard your data to multiple databases.
