I'm in the process of trying to do this right now. We've got an on-site Customer Development department and I can tell you they are key in trying to grab buy-in for an iterative development process. Some great answers on this one here . If you've already got a track record of delivering projects late and over budget due to large and unmanageable chunks not getting done, that's a good start in convincing the stakeholders of your projects to get the ball of change rolling. Process can prove itself, but only with the right parties in support of it. Your key is getting other team players to see value in what you're trying to do. For us, it comes down to approaching things from a customers perspective. We need to constantly come back to the customer to make sure that what we're building is what they envision. We want to streamline the process to stop wasting everyone's time. Now of course, different parts of Agile work for different organizations and very few companies that actually use Agile processes are doing so in a purist sense. Through trial and error figure out what works for your business, culture and team. There is nothing that says you can't gradually adopt the overall process and cherry pick the parts that work the best for your business model.
