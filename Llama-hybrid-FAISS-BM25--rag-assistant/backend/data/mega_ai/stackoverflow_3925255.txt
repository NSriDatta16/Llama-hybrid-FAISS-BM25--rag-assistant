cvblob compile error in Visual C++ 6.0

I'm using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 to develop an academic computer vision project. In this project i need to use OpenCV 1.1 (http://opencv.willowgarage.com/) and CvBlob (http://code.google.com/p/cvblob/). I tried to compile this project with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and it compiles without errors. With Visual C++ 6.0 i got a lot of errors. OpenCV are not responsible of this behavior, because a trivial project with only OpenCV (without CvBlob) works well. To understand the errors better I made an empty project with only the CvBlob inclusion. I paste here a brief summary of the errors: cvcontour.cpp(253) : error C2371: 'i' : redefinition; different basic types (and others similar to this. i solved with variable redefinition, every time) cvcontour.cpp(318) : error C2664: 'thiscall std::vector >::std::vector >(unsigned int,const struct CvPoint &,const class std::allocator &)' : cannot convert parameter 1 from 'class std::deque >::iterator' to 'unsigned int' No user-defined-conversion operator available that can perform this conversion, or the operator cannot be called cvtrack.cpp(278) : error C2440: 'initializing' : cannot convert from 'struct cvb::CvTrack *const ' to 'struct cvb::CvBlob *' Types pointed to are unrelated; conversion requires reinterpret_cast, C-style cast or function-style cast Have you ideas on how can i solve these problems? Thanks in advance for the help! -------- UPDATE -------- I tried to edit and correct the code in order to elminate the three errors in my question. The error C2664 seems to be the more difficult to cirmumvent... I have replaced the indicted line return new CvContourPolygon(dq.begin(), dq.end()); where CvContourPolygon is a typedef std::vector CvContourPolygon; with deque ::iterator dq_it;dq_it = dq.begin(); CvContourPolygon v_tmp; v_tmp.push_back(*dq_it); while (dq_it != dq.end()){ v_tmp.push_back(*dq_it++); } First, what that i wrote is correct? Than, how can i solve the errors that occured from this? Thank you in advance! Errors (suppose that the first line is 318: cvcontour.cpp(319) : error C2679: binary '=' : no operator defined which takes a right-hand operand of type 'class std::deque >::iterator' (or there is no acceptable conversion) cvcontour.cpp(321) : error C2664: 'push_back' : cannot convert parameter 1 from 'int' to 'const struct CvPoint &' Reason: cannot convert from 'int' to 'const struct CvPoint' No constructor could take the source type, or constructor overload resolution was ambiguous cvcontour.cpp(322) : error C2679: binary '!=' : no operator defined which takes a right-hand operand of type 'class std::deque >::iterator' (or there is no acceptable conversion) cvcontour.cpp(322) : fatal error C1903: unable to recover from previous error(s); stopping compilation Error executing cl.exe. -------- UPDATE2 -------- This code seems to work correctly! deque ::iterator dq_it; dq_it = dq.begin(); CvContourPolygon v_tmp; for (dq_it = dq.begin(); dq_it != dq.end(); ++dq_it){ v_tmp.push_back(*dq_it); } //return new CvContourPolygon(dq.begin(), dq.end()); return &v_tmp;
