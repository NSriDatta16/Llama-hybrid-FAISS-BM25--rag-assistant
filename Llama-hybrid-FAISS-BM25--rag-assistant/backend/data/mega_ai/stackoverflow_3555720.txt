The title of your question by itself makes some sense. The body of your question doesn't make sense. is it possible to write python scripts which can do router configuration without telnetting into the router? Yes, depending on the platform. You maybe able to use a variety of other methods to configure the router that do not include telnet . E.g. xml-rpc, ssh + interactive, scp config file or fragments, snmp to induce upload config file, etc. Is it possible to deal it on a hardware level? You're in the realms of nanotech microscopy and seriously invalidating the warranty on your router.
