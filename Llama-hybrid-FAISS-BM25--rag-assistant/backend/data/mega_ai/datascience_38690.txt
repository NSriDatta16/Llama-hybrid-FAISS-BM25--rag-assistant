1,2) In classification and regression problems you are not searching for the average of correct output, but you are trying to predict the correct output! So no, I don't think this is what you want to do. You are considering an easier problem, where the output expected is just the moving average of the real values. 3) I never did forecasting for weather, but I guess in a way having that information is not completely useless. (Nonetheless not correct!) 4) I don't know how much you know about regression, but: have you split the dataset in train, validation and test set? have you considered using CNN for time series How is your accuracy on train e validation? Are you overfitting?
