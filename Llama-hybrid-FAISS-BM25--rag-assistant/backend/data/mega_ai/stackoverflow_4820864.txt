I'm not sure if this is what you want but if you double click on the "XAML" or "Design" tabs in-between the two panes it will maximize that tab and you can then use the tabs to switch back and forth between design view and XAML view. Hope this helps Edit: If you want to go back to split pane view there are three very small icons at the bottom right and you can click one of those to either split vertically or horizontally. The one with the double arrows will also let you switch back and forth between single and split pane views. Edit: I found this on MSDN which makes it seem that they had the split view so that ...if you drag a control from the Toolbox to Design view, the XAML is immediately updated to reflect the new element. Likewise, if a new element is added by typing the markup in XAML view, the visual representation will appear in Design view immediately, once the XAML is correctly formed. Edit 3: Looks like someone found an answer before. You may want to try this: Separating designer from XAML window for WPF in VS2010
