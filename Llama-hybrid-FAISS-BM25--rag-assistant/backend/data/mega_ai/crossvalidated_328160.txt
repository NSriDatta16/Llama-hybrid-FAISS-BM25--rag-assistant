An answer is already found in the wikipedia link from the first comment by Smith. Q: Are there situations where this sample average nevertheless converges in distribution to some other (non-normal) distribution? A: Yes, iff a distribution is a stable distribution then it is a limit to sums of the type: $$\zeta_n = \frac{\xi_1 + \xi_2 + \dots + \xi_n}{B_n} - A_n $$ with the $\xi$ independent and identically distributed random variables, $B_n>0$ and $\vert A_n\vert The type of distribution laws for $\xi$ that let the above sum converge to a stable distribution (the domain of attraction for that distribution) are described by a theorem in 'Limit distributions for sums of independent random variables' by Gnedenko and Kolmogorov (page 175 in the translated version 1954, link via google ) Theorem 2.* In order that the distribution function F(x) belong to the domain of attraction of a stable law with the characteristic exponent $\alpha$ ($0 \leq \alpha \leq 2$) it is necessary and sufficient that 1) $$\frac{F(-x)}{1-F(x)} \to \frac{c_1}{c_2} \qquad \text{as } k \to \infty$$ 2) for every constant $k>0$ $$\frac{1 - F(x) + F(-x)}{1-F(xk) + F(-kx)} \to k^\alpha \qquad \text{as } k \to \infty$$ *The theorem is attributed to B.V. Gedenko 1939 (no online version available ГНЕДЕНКО, Б. В. К теории областей притяжения устойчивых законов. Ученые записки МГУ, 1939, 2: 30. ) and Doeblin 1940 , see theorem V in the freely available pdf. A slightly more exact description (in comparison to the wikipedia article) is given by https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Attraction_domain_of_a_stable_distribution
