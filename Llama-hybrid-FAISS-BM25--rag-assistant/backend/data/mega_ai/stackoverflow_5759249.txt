Rails 3: How do I write forms that don't align exactly with the structure of the model?

For example, if I have a simple model with a time attribute named start_time , then the straight-forward form code would be... f.object %> But I would like to have two text fields, one for the date component of the time object and one for the time component of the time object. How would I structure that form code? In the controller, how do I want to organize the data being sent to the form? Do I want to separate the two components of the time object? Thanks so much for your wisdom!
