Forecasting algorithms for incomplete time series data

I want to forecast the demand of each SKU in my warehouse every week from the history transaction that I have collected. The data contains brand, product type, SKU, quantity, date(per day), price. But the SKU is not sold every week. Some of them are because of sold out and trend. I have tried RNN LSTM and ARIMA with per week but they need time series data that has any transaction in every daterange. I need an algorithm that can handle zero transaction in random week.
