You can determine the style of a paragraph using oParagraph.Style (where oParagraph is a Paragraph object). So, you could do something like: Dim oStartHeadingParagraph As Paragraph Set oStartHeadingParagraph = Selection.Paragraphs(1) If oStartHeadingParagraph.Style <> "Heading 1" Then MsgBox "Please select the Heading 1 paragraph for the section you want to delete." Else Dim oParagraph As Paragraph Set oParagraph = oStartHeadingParagraph Do While Not oStartHeadingParagraph.Next Is Nothing If oStartHeadingParagraph.Next.Style = "Heading 1" Then Exit Do Else oStartHeadingParagraph.Next.Range.Delete End If Loop oStartHeadingParagraph.Range.Delete End If
