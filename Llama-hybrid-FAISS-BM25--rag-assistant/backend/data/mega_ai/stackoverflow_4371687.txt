Your question has been partially answered already but let me try and summarise it in one go. You're on Windows Server 2003 which means IIS6. Whilst IIS6 can be published to via Web Deploy, you must use the Web Deployment Agent which means the end point you're publishing to should look something like this: http://myserver/MsDeployAgentService Note this is not an HTTPS address and does not explicitly specify a port. Also, the account publishing to this endpoint must have admin rights on the server (nasty, but necessary). Finally, make sure the "Web Deployment Agent Service" is actually running because it's not set to start automatically by default. Your example is for Windows Server 2008 running IIS7 where the IIS Deployment Handler can be used (incidentally, the Web Deployment Handler can also be used against IIS7). Have a look at this post of mine: You're deploying it wrong! TeamCity, Subversion & Web Deploy part 3: Publishing with Web Deploy .
