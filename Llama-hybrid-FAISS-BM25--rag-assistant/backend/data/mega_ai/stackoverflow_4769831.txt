Drag and Drop in NSCollectionView example

I need drag and drop in NSCollectionView. So I looked at Apples code-sample: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/IconCollection/Introduction/Intro.html There is a method for dragging. But it's not working. I added the following method without result: -(BOOL) collectionView:(NSCollectionView *)collectionView canDragItemsAtIndexes:(NSIndexSet *)indexes withEvent:(NSEvent *)event { return YES; } The Delegate is set. Does anybody know a solution?
