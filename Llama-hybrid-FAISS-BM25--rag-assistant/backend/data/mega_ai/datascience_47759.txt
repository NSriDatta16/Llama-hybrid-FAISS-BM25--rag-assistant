Keras vs. tf.keras

I'm a bit confused in choosing between Keras (keras-team/keras) and tf.keras (tensorflow/tensorflow/python/keras/) for my new research project. There is a debate that Keras isn't owned by anyone, so people are happier to contribute in and it'll be much easier to manage the project in the future. ‬ On the other side, ‪ tf.keras is owned by Google, so more rigorous test and maintenance. Moreover, it seems this is a better option for taking advantage of new features which are presenting in Tensorflow v.2. So, to start a data science (machine learning) project (in the research phase), that both are okay at the beginning, which one do you choose?!‬
