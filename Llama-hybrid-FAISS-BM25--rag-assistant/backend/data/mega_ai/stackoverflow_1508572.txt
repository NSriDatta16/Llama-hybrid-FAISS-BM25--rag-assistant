Converting XDocument to XmlDocument and vice versa

It's a very simple problem that I have. I use XDocument to generate an XML file. I then want to return it as a XmlDocument class. And I have an XmlDocument variable which I need to convert back to XDocument to append more nodes. So, what is the most efficient method to convert XML between XDocument and XmlDocument? (Without using any temporary storage in a file.)
