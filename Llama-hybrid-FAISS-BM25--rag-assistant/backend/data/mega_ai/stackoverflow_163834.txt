PHP templates - with PHP

What's the most elegant templating (preferably in pure PHP!) solution you've seen? Specifically i'm interested in handling: Detecting in a repeating block whether it's the first or last element Easy handling of odd/even cases, like a zebra striped table, or similar Other modulos logic, where you'd do something every n'th time. I'm looking for something that makes this less of a pain: "> Does it really take the mess above to create something like this below? John Jack Jill Jason Is it only me that find the above near hideous? All those starting and closing of php-tags makes me cringe.
