I ended up using Multiple Linear Regression, on the log-returns of the time series. In the content of time-series of asset returns, a key note on using the intercept: - if the goal is to fit an assets return using a set of other assets for purposes of portfolio construction, than an intercept should be avoided as it provides an external sources of "free" baseline return (a bias in the linear regression) which is not achievable using any of the given assets. - if the goal is to create the best possible fit, then the intercept should be used and it will provide a better fit (or at least no worse) then without the intercept. These are probably very basic concepts, but it took me a while to get a clear grip of the solution so I'm adding my answer.
