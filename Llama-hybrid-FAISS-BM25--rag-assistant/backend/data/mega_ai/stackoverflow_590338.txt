Even with indexes, 4 minutes to insert 100,000 records seems like a problem to me. If this database has I/O problems, you haven't fixed them and they will appear again. I would recommend that you identify the root cause. If you post the index DDL, I'll time it for a comparison. I added indexes on id and business_name. Doing 10 iterations in a loop, the average time per 100,000 rows was 25 seconds. This was on my home PC/server all running on a single disk.
