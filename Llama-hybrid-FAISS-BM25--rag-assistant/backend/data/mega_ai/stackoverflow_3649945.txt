I'm assuming some knowledge of SQL Server and ASP.Net here, so please let us know the level of help required. At a basic level you would need to create a table that has the required fields for a comment. For example commentId - primary key memberId - foreign key to the member table postId - foreign key to your posts (or videos etc) creation_date modified_date comment - the text of the comment. Your comment system should implement a Captcha - e.g. http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/aspnetnewfeatures.aspx If you would allow non-members to comment, add fields for email etc. Then when you render your post / video pages, you'd also render comments which match the postId. Member name would be linked from your members table via memberId. Of course, you will need to look after security, optimization, caching etc.
