ASP.net application organization question

What is the preferred way to organize your asp.net web application? Here are the two choice I have: have one bin/ directory with all the dlls in it and one main dll. This case would require a rebuild each time any server code has been changed. Obviously, there may be several directories, but there is only one BIN can have several bin directories (say one per each directory). The advantage here is that each directory is its own app - but other than that it seems pretty messy to me. What is the best option? If I go with option 1) can I have Web.config file contain settings for several apps?
