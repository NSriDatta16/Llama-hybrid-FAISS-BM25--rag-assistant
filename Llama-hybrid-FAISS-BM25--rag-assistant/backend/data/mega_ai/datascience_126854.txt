Should I choose an ARIMA model (2,1,1) with a higher AIC value or an ARIMA model (6,1,8) with a lower AIC value?

I am trying to fit an ARIMA model to time series data. When I fit the model using auto.arima function in R , ARIMA(2,1,1) model is selected with AIC=6618.16 . However, when I played around with the model, I found that ARIMA(6,1,8) gives an AIC=6528.37 . Which one should I choose? Here are the ACF and PACF plots after one regular differentiation. Besides, a portmanteau test (Ljung-Box test) gives the following results for checking the residuals whether are white noise or not. A portmanteau test returns a large p-value, also suggesting that the residuals are white noise ( Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos). Ljung-Box test data: Residuals from ARIMA(6,1,8) Q* = 6.2381, df = 3, p-value = 0.1006 Model df: 14. Total lags used: 17 Ljung-Box test data: Residuals from ARIMA(2,1,1) Q* = 20.261, df = 7, p-value = 0.005033 Model df: 3. Total lags used: 10
