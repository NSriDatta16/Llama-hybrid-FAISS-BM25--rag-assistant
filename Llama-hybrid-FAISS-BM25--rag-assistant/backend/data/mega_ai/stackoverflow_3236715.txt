Using ajax to call a servlet

As I understand it and have used it, AJAX is used to make requests from the client to the server and to then update a HTML DIV on the client with new content. However, I want to use AJAX from a client to a servlet to verify the existence of a URL. If the result is bad, I can set an error message in the servlet and return it to the client page for display. But does anyone know if, in the case of a positive result, I can have my servlet automatically display another (the next) page to the user? Or should that request be triggered by Javascript on the client when the positive results is received. Thanks Mr Morgan.
