Animation inside a UIScrollView

I want to fade-out a view as it is scrolling inside a parent UIScrollview. When the fade-out animation begins, the scroll view stops scrolling. It jumps to the correct position when the fade is complete. My fade-out is achieved with animateWithDuration and block objects, triggered upon a page-change I detect in scrollViewWillBeginDragging. Does anyone know how to make them both happen simultaneously? Just to be clear, I am not 'animating' the UIScrollView scrolling - rather it is happening via user interaction of swiping. EDIT: Here is the code I'm using to fade the UIView. This code is in a UIViewController derived class, which is the delegate for a UIScrollView. When the user starts dragging his finger, I want to fade out the subView. But when the user starts draggin a finger, the subview fades and the scrolling stops. After the subView has completely faded out, the the scroll view will then snap to the location where the user's finger is. -(void)scrollViewWillBeginDragging:(UIScrollView*)scrollView { [UIView animateWithDuration:0.5 animations:^ { self.subView.alpha = 0.0f; } completion:^(BOOL finished) { }]; }
