Broadly speaking, you are talking about the concept of Serialization - storing variable values in permanent storage like a file so you can reload them later. Have a look at that link to broaden your understanding. Specifically, it sounds like you have arbitrary text in a file and want to refer to it in your program. In that case, string sounds appropriate. Unless the text in the file is intended to represent one single number, that seems most appropriate. Note that if you have structured data (like a CSV file or XML file), a more complex data structure (e.g. a class, array of classes, etc) might be a better choice.
