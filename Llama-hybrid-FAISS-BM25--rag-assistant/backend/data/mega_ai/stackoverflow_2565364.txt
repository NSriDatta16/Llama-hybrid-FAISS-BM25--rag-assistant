If I can just add for anyone coming across this in the future- most of the documentation and tutorials/examples you find on the web about OpenGL is many years out of date, including the nehe.gamedev stuff, and will lead you to believe that things like non-power-of-two texture sizes are a problem when they realistically aren't, or encourage you to use long-since deprecated opengl functions, or libraries that haven't been updated for a decade.
