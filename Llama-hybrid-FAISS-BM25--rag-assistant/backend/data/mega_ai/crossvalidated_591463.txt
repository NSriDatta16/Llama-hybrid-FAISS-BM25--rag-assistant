One can consider a Gibbs sampler as a combination of componentwise Markov kernels $G_i$ with $$G_i(\theta,\theta^\prime)=p(\theta^\prime_i|\theta_{-i})\delta_{\theta_{-i}}(\theta^\prime_{-i})$$ Since each kernel is stationary wrt the joint distribution, so is the combination. The only major constraint is ensuring that the combination results in an irreducible Markov chain, meaning that all components must move infinitely often. Other than that, considering an arbitrary sequence $(i_n)_n$ over $\{1,2,\ldots,p\}$ leads to a valid Gibbs sampler $$G_{i_m}\circ\cdots\circ G_{i_2}\circ G_{i_1}$$
