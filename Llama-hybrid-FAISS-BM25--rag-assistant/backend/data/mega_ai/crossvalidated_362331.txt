For model-averaging a GLM, do we average the predictions on the link or response scale?

To compute the model-averaged predictions on the response scale of a GLM, which is "correct" and why? Compute the model averaged prediction on the link scale and then back-transform to the response scale, or Back transform the predictions to the response scale and then compute the model average The predictions are close but not equal if the model is a GLM. The different R packages give options for both (with different defaults). Several colleagues have argued vociferously that #1 is wrong because "everyone does #2". My intuition says that #1 is "correct" as it keeps all linear math linear (#2 averages things that are not on a linear scale). A simple simulation finds that #2 has a very (very!) slightly smaller MSE than #1. If #2 is correct, what is the reason? And, if #2 is correct, why is my reason (keep linear math linear) poor reasoning? Edit 1: Computing marginal means over the levels of another factor in a GLM is a similar problem to the question that I am asking above. Russell Lenth computes marginal means of GLM models using the "timing" (his words) of #1 (in the emmeans package) and his argument is similar to my intuition. Edit 2: I am using model-averaging to refer to the alternative to model selection where a prediction (or a coefficient) is estimated as the weighted average over all or a subset of "best" nested models (see references and R packages below). Given $M$ nested models, where $\eta_i^m$ is the linear prediction (in the link space) for individual $i$ for model $m$, and $w_m$ is the weight for model $m$, the model-averaged prediction using #1 above (average on the link scale and then backtransform to the response scale) is: $$\hat{Y}_i = g^{-1}\Big(\sum_{m=1}^M{w_m \eta_i^m}\Big)$$ and the model-averaged prediction using #2 above (back transform all $M$ predictions and then average on the response scale) is: $$\hat{Y}_i = \sum_{m=1}^M{w_m g^{-1}(\eta_i^m})$$ Some Bayesian and Frequentist methods of model averaging are: Hoeting, J.A., Madigan, D., Raftery, A.E. and Volinsky, C.T., 1999.
