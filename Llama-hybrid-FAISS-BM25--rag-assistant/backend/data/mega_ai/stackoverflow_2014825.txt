trying to create a set of test data that fully executed all the functionality involved in the computation would be nearly impossible If that's true, try a less ambitious goal. Start by testing specific, high-usage paths through the code, paths that you suspect may be fragile, and paths for which you've had reported bugs. Refactoring the method into separate sub-algorithms will make your code more testable (and might be beneficial in other ways), but if your problem is a ridiculous number of interactions between those sub-algorithms, extract method (or extract to strategy class) won't really solve it: you'll have to build up a solid suite of tests one at a time.
