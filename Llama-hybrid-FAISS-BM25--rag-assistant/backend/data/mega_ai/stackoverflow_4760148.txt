There is no totally general, and yet simple solution. The simplest solution is put the 2 JAR files on the classpath, with the 2.0 JAR file ahead of the 1.0 JAR file. This will probably work for your use case, but it won't work if the there are cases where you need to use the older version of some class. Another solution is to put the class in question into a new JAR file and put it on the classpath ahead of both the 1.0 and 2.0 JAR files. But reorganizing the JAR files may not be an option. The complicated way is to write a custom classloader for the 1.0 and 2.0 JAR files. This is a lot of work, and probably unnecessary.
