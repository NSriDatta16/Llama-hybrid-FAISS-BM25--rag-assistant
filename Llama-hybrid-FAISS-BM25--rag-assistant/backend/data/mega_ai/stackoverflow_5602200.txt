Ability to connect Magento to existing database?

I have an existing database that contains 4 tables: categories, sub-categories, products, prices. I am looking to create an ecom site using Magento leveraging the existing tables. I would rather not import the tables since products will be continually modified. I am new to Magento. What is the best way to handle this? Would I want to query my existing tables and hook into Magento bypassing their product tables? Is there a way to do this? Thanks!
