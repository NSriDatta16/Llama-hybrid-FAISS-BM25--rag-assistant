Anyone who "proves" that Cantor's diagonal method doesn't work proves only their own incompetence. Cf. Wilfred Hodges' An editor recalls some hopeless papers for a surprisingly sympathetic explanation of what kind of thing is going wrong with these attempts. You can provide speculative descriptions of hyper-Turing neural nets, just as you can provide speculative descriptions of other kinds of hyper-Turing computers: there's nothing incoherent in the idea that hypercomputation is possible, and speculative descriptions of mechanical hypercomputers have been made where the hypercomputer is stipulated to have infinitely fine engravings that encode an oracle for the Halting machine: the existence of such a machine is consistent with Newtonian mechanics, though not quantum mechanics. Rather, the Church-Turing thesis says that they can't be constructed, and there are two reasons to believe the Church-Turing thesis is correct: No such machines have ever been constructed; and There's work been done connecting models of physics to models of computation, going back to work in the early 1970s by Robin Gandy, with recent work by people such as David Deutsch (e.g., Machines, Logic and Quantum Physics and John Tucker (e.g., Computations via experiments with kinematic systems ) which argues that physics doesn't support hypercomputation. The main point is that the truth of the Church-Turing thesis is an empirical fact, and not a mathematical fact. It's one that we can have confidence is true, but not certainty.
