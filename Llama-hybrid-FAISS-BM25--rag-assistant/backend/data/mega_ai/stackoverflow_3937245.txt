I have a fully working flash application, made in as3. Now i dynamicly added a movieclip and i would like to be able to erase that movieclip with a eraser of some sort, my goal is to be able pick up a sponge with the mouse and then start dragging over the movieclip and erasing the parts where i dragged over it. Anyone who can help?
