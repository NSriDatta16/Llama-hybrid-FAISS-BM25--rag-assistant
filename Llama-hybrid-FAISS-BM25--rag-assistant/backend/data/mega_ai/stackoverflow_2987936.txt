Building SL4 + RIAServices app takes too long on VS2010

Got a Win7 box with VS2010 Premium installed on it. Building desktop apps works just fine. But we got this solution with 15 SL4 and 21 desktop projects... Building the SL part of it takes too long. This is very irritating and encourages to drop TDD since every time I run a test it takes ~3 seconds for msbuild to find out that nothing changed and the project should be skipped. The projects are very small and there's nothing fancy in them and we hadn't any problems before we switched from VS2008+SL3. I've heard people complaining abound VS2010 speed in general, but nothing about SL4 build time. Is anyone experiencing same problems and is there any workaround for this?
