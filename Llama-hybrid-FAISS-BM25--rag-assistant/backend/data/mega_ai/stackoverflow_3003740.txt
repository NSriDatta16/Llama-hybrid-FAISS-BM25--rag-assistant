One of the main benifits with the gap between the client and the server shrinking is the ability to reuse code on the client and the server. For instance if you want to have a rich and dynamic AJAX website for modern browsers and a stripped down version for older browsers you can use the same display code to format incomming data on both the client and the server. Other benifits with this include the HTML5/Google Gears/Adobe Air ability to have a local storage DB and server to run web apps offline, you can have code that would traditionally be on the server stored locally for when the server is not available.
