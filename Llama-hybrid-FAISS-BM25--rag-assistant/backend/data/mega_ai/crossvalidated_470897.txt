There are many styles of nonparametric bootstrap. For a random sample of size $n$ from a population with mean $\mu$ the principle of the bootstrap is to regard the empirical CDF of the data as an estimate of the population CDF. One takes a large number $B$ of re-samples of size $n$ from the data x with replacement and finds the mean of each re-sample. A very simple bootstrap takes quantiles .025 and .975 of these re-sampled means as a 95% confidence interval for $\mu.$ All we know about the population is that it is capable of producing the $n=15$ observations in our sample, so we re-sample from them. [Re-sampling without replacement would make no sense, because a re-sample without replacement gives just the same sample again--likely re-arranged, but with exactly the same $n$ values.] Example: Data in vector x in R. summary(x); sd(x); length(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.1139 3.4503 7.3113 6.1035 7.8384 11.0812 [1] 3.189805 [1] 15 stripchart(x) Because the sample shows no distinct skewness, it is OK to use a simple quantile bootstrap procedure without bias correction as shown below, obtaining the 95% nonparametric bootstrap CI $(4.46, 7.60).$ set.seed(2020) B = 3000; n = length(x) a.re = replicate(B, mean(sample(x, n, rep=T))) CI = quantile(a.re, c(.025,.975)); CI 2.5% 97.5% 4.459446 7.597443 Here is a histogram of the $B = 3000$ re-sampled averages, with vertical red lines indicating the quantiles used to make the bootstrap. hist(a.re, prob=T, col="skyblue2") abline(v = CI, col="red") By contrast, here is a parametric 95% t confidence interval $(4.34, 7.87),$ which assumes that the data are normal. t.test(x)$conf.int [1] 4.336995 7.869906 attr(,"conf.level") [1] 0.95 A direct comparison of the two CIs is unwarranted. The bootstrap CI assumes only that the data were randomly sampled from some population with mean $\mu.$ The t CI assumes random sampling from a normal population. Note: In this case, $n=15$ observations were randomly sampled from $\mathsf{Unif}(0,12)$ so that $\mu = 6.$ set.seed(1234) x = runif(15, 0,12)
