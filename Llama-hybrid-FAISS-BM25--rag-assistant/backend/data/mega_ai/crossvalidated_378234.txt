Actually, There is Wasserstein-GAN which is a GAN network but uses the wasserstein distance to calculate the loss. So, it has the discriminator and generator networks. The implementation 2 and implementation 3 correspond to that network. However, my target was the Wasserstein autoencoders which has encoder, decoder and discriminator parts. The implementation 1 corresponds to Wasserstein autoencoders and not to Wasserstein GAN. It was confusing for me.
