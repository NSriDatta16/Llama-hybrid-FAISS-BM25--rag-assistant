Isolated storage is designed to keep your program data fenced in rather than keeping other applications out, Data is ring fenced from other .net programs running under reduced permission sets. Data is stored in local or roaming user compartments and cannot be accessed via ordinary file streams only via IsolatedStorageFileStream. In short though if another program really wanted access it could, but you would have to deliberately set out to do so.
