It sounds like you have a reward / cost structure and decisions (i.e. actions)associated with your system. A Markov Chain would not be sufficient to explicate this. You can achieve this by modelling it as a Markov Decision Process. In a nutshell, A Markov Decision Process (MDP) model contains: A set of possible world states S A set of possible actions A A real valued reward function R(s,a) A description T of each actionâ€™s effects in each state. For an intro, take a look at Wikipedia and here .
