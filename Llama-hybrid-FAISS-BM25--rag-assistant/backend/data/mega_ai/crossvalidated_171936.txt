I don't think it makes sense to do multimodel inference on top of penalized likelihood. If you start with the biggest model and adjust the penalty via CV, you will arrive at alternative to the averaged model of B&A. In other words, when one relies on AIC, one tries to estimate the model's bias-variance tradeoff in sample, but with CV one tries to estimate it explicitly, out of sample. Combining these two doesn't make much sense: I would say that if it is possible to do CV at all, then that's what I'd prefer.
