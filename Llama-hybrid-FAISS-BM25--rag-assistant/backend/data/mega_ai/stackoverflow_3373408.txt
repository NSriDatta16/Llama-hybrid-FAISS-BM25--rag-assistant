Class Design Question

Let's say I want to make a HumanBody class. And I want to store the length of each limb. HumanBody.LeftArmLength = 14; HumanBody.RightArmLength = 14.1; HumanBody.LeftLegLength = 32; HumanBody.RightLegLength = 31.9; That's all well and good, but it seems like it would be better to do something like: HumanBody.Arm.Left.Length = 14; HumanBody.Arm.Right.Length = 14.1; HumanBody.Leg.Left.Length = 32; Humanbody.Leg.Right.Length = 31.9; So this would involve making sub classes. Is what I'm describing something that is considered a "Good Practice"? It seems like this is a more organized way to store data. Edit: this example is quite simple, but if there are 100 different pieces of data to store, this seems like a much better method to use.
