html { font-size: 100.01%; } 100.01%, not a hack or a kludge, has been around for many years. Google "100.01%" and read up. It is as valid as 100% and does cover some territory 100% doesn't. An initial font-size should always be declared. Set a base font-size on an outer container -- either or -- for it is from that container which all relative and inherited font-size values will derive. Using 100% or 100.01% makes the starting font-size equal to the user's browser preference. Setting that base font-size to the user's browser preference gives your visitors maximum readability. Read that again, please, about the USER's preference. Your visitor will have set their browser font-size for their own best legibility and reading comfort. Your design, magnificent and fragile though it may be, is only a second-string player. Content is king, assuming you have some. But if that content is un-readably tiny, you lose. The visitor surfs on. Your design, then, has failed your needs and your expectations. Therefore, the design really wasn't all that great, was it?
