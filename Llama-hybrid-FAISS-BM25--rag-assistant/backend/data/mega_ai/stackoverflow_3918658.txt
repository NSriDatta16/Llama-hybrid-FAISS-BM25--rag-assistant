server path / vs \

In some documentation, I have gotten the instructions to write SERVER_PATH\theme\ When I check _SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] from php info, it's /storage/content/75/113475/frilansbyran.se/public_html this renders of course /storage/content/75/113475/frilansbyran.se/public_html\theme\ this looks really weird to me what's the difference anyway which should I use? (unix-server)
