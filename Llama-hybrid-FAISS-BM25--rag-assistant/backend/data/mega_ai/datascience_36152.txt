Have a look at h2o's driverless AI or featuretools.py, I don't believe either use deep learning, but rather apply an array of mathematical functions on your data set and then performs Feature Synthesis/merging features. The auto-generated feature set is then iteratively tested against your model and discarded or improved. So yes, while you need domain knowledge/experts to realise that adding or creating new data could make a huge impact, for exploratory purposes you could definitely use auto-features.
