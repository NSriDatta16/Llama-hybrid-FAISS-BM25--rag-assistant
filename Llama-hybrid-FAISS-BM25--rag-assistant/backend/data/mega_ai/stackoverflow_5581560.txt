program's printf backslash n does not carriage return when compiled with Eclipse

I handed in a C program which contained a lot of verbose printf debug lines. I always compiled it command line with gcc. Now it's been turned into an Eclipse-CDT (Helios) project, and my \n no longer do carriage returns. I get an unreadable "staircase" in my console. RCINAHFM. Is there a check box in the IDE I need to modify or do I need to go back and carefully modify hundreds of lines of code? Any help greatly appreciated.
