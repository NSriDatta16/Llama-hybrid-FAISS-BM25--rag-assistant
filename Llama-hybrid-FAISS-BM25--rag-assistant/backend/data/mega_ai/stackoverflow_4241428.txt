Your co-worker is optimizing his short term effectiveness by sacrificing the longer term effectiveness of the organization (e.g., the rest of his co-workers as well as himself). Any changes required in the first file are likely required in the second one, but nobody will remember... and that will cause 2 cycles of find and fix, rather than one. You could run a clone detector over the code and simply exhibit the results to his manager. See Wikipedia on duplicate code for a list. You can see samples of clone detecion for various languages using our CloneDR detector. It is designed to find an detect big blocks of code with consistent renames and it can show exactly what happened.
