SQL Array being returned as number, not String in ColdFusion

In Coldfusion, I'm using a cfc that binds one select box to another (basically, choose a State from one box, the second box is populated with County names.) The value for the County box is a 5-digit number WHICH IS FORMATTED AS TEXT (ie. the value comes from a text field.) The problem is that I'm finding that if the value of the selected county id starts with a '0', it's been cut off. So I get stuff like: ID County 11223 A 2300 B (should be 02300) Can someone help make sure that leading 0s are not cut off? Here's the select boxes on the page: State: County: I hate pasting the whole .cfc but pay attention to the latter part, particularly the cfloop which uses a cfset to populate array RESULT: SELECT DISTINCT tblLoc.StateUSAbb, lkuState.StateName FROM lkuState INNER JOIN tblLoc ON lkuState.FIPS_State = tblLoc.FIPS_State WHERE (lkuState.StateName <> 'New Brunswick') UNION SELECT '' AS StateUSAbb, ' ALL' AS StateName FROM lkuState ORDER BY StateName SELECT '' AS FIPS_COUNTY, ' ALL' as CountyName FROM lkuCnty UNION SELECT FIPS_County, CountyName FROM lkuCnty WHERE StateAbb = '#ARGUMENTS.stateabb#' ORDER BY CountyName
