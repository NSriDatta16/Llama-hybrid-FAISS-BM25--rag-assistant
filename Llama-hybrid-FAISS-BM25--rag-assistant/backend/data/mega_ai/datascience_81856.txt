How to build a database of image data for machine learning?

I want to build a database of image data for machine learning. But how should this be done? I'm assuming people don't just dump all of their image data into a folder? Do they use a relational database management system, like MySQL? Or do they use a NoSQL database, like MongoDB? Is there a textbook that explores this part of machine learning in particular? Is this what "data warehouse" refers to?
