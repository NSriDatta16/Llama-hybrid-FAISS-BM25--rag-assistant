ColdFusion executing unwanted SQL statements

I have an application that loads a vast amount of data from twitter. We have began to notice some performance issues and so I setup SQL Profiler for the applications database. I have noticed the following SQL statement are being executed but do not appear anywhere in my code. Therefore, I am assuming that either SQL Server 2005 or ColdFusion 8 are adding these statements in for some reason. SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED SET FMTONLY ON select Title from Links where 1=2 SET FMTONLY OFF exec [sys].sp_datatype_info_90 -9,@ODBCVer=4 EXEC sp_executesql N'set implicit_transactions off select USER_NAME() select usertype,type,name from systypes where usertype>=257' EXEC sp_execute 16,'iTunes Store' exec sp_unprepare 28 I do not have any cftransaction's in my code All my queries are being ran from cfqueries. (no stored procedures) I am never running an execute or exec statement anywhere in my code All these statements are being ran from my database user account specifically set up for my web application The statements in #5 and #6 are replicated with many different numbers The statement in #5 is replicated with many different strings Why are these statements being added, are they needed, and if not how can I stop them?
