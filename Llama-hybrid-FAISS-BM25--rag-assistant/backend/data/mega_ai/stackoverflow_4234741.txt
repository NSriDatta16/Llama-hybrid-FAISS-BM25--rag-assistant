OK, User Agent Style sheet arcana coming your way: for some reason, FF sets table { -moz-box-sizing: border-box } in its default stylesheet. As does IE8 (but not 7). Other browsers use the default box-sizing: box-content . I have no idea why FF has done this, against the W3C defaul value. there's a long discussion about this here: Why is box sizing set to border-box for tables in Firefox? . to override it, use the -moz prefix: i.e. table { -moz-box-sizing: content-box }
