Using GAMs to model fish density data with many "zeroes"

I'm trying to fit GAM models to acoustic backscatter data (Sv_mean; measured in dB, log scale) which is proportional to the density of fish in the water column. I have four years of daily data. In the winter time there are a bunch of zeros (which in log scale are represented as -999dB). The zeroes are true zeroes. To go around having these -999, I replaced the zeroes with values 3 dB below the minimum backscatter value in the series (~ -134 dB that's roughly half the minimum fish density). To account for autocorrelation in the data I'm including a correlation term in the gamm() function (my data is ordered and I don't have NAs). I'm also including a linear form of time (date_numeric) to account for interannual patterns and day of year (julian_day) using a cyclic cubic spline to look at seasonal patterns. I am planning to do model selection using different candidate models with a different set of environmental covariates. I've fitted a couple of GAM models and it seems that no model is picking up the transformed zeroes. Because the zeroes have a seasonality, the normalized residuals keep having some autocorrelation. What are possible solutions to this? Here is the time series: Here is how the distribution of the backscatter values (Sv_mean) look like: Here is the example model I'm fitting: gam_6 Here is the output from gam.check() Here is the data and fitted model (you can see the transformed zeroes occurring during specific months each year): And here are the normalized residuals with their ACF and PACF:
