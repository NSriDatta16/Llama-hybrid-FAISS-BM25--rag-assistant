It looks like I've sorted out the problem. As I expected, it's more of a lack-of-experience issue, than anything. As it turns out, gcov was only finding a subset of the available tracefiles, and was therefore reporting only part of the total results. Finding and adding the rest of the tracefiles resolved the issue. For any that are curious, the problematic header file still shows up in the output. In fact, all of the other header files do too, even though they contain no executable code. However, they all show 90+% coverage.
