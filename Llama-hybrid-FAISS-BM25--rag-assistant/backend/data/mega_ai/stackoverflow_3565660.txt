Looking for artificial intelligence (AI) cookbook reader research

I am looking for research (published) on AI techniques for reading cookbook recipes. Recipes are a very limited domain that might be doable in a natural language recognition engine with some degree of accuracy. I have in mind writing a program that would allow copy/pasting a recipe from a web browser into the AI and having it determine the title, author, ingredients, instructions, nutritional information, etc. by "reading" the recipe. I would also like to be able to process PDF files (I have a large collection), maybe also just using copy/paste. The output will be some kind of (standard) XML-based format that can be read by a recipe organizer. I have in mind PhD or Masters-level work.
