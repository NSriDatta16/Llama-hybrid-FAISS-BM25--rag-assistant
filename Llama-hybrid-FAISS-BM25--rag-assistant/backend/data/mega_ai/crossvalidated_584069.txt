How to analyze the continuous covariate between two groups (ratio: 1:2, 1:3 or 1:4）which had been matched by PSM?

We plan to conduct a research for exploring the risk factors for a cardiovascular disease by a case-control study. The covariates are expected to be balanced between case and control groups by the Propensity Score Matching. We will compare the difference of covariates between case and control groups before and after matched by PSM. We could compare them by paired samples t-test. However, if we matched the samples between case and control groups as the ratio 1:2 or 1:3 or 1:4，how to compared the difference of covariates before and after matched by PSM ? If the covariates are categorical variable, we might analyze them by Conditional Logistic Regression Analysis. But if the covariates are continuous variable, which method could we conduct to analyze them between case and control groups（that is , the ratio is 1:2 or 1:3 or 1:4 between case and control groups）？ Thank you!
