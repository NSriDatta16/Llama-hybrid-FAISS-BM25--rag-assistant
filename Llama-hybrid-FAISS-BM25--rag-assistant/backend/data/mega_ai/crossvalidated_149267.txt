How is $p_{i}$ for a set of continuous data points related to the probability function $f(x)$?

I have the following set of continuous measurements: 155.08 178 264.81 238 378 140.38 130.5 140.69 155.5 To average this data, I sum the values and divide by the number of values to get 197.884. This suggests to some degree that the probability of each is 1/n = 1/9, and we are getting this average by the following calculation: $$E(X)=\sum_{i=1}^{9}{p_{i}\cdot x_{i}} = \sum_{i=1}^{9}{\frac{1}{9}\cdot x_{i}}$$ ...where $p_{i}$ is the probability of each (1/9) and $x_{i}$ is the random value associated with each probability. This approach for summing is generally reserved for discrete data, but this is continuous data. In reality, $p_{i}$ for each value above is not an even 1/9 across the board, but follows some unknown probability density curve $f(x)$. Should “$f(x)$” be known, then I could easily use the expectation operator to find the average: $$E(X) = \int_{x=a}^{b}{x\cdot f\left( x \right)}dx$$ However, in this data set, the $f(x)$ is unknown, so this approach can’t be done. Obviously we must find the average by summing these values and dividing by “n” as shown above, but this treats the values as discrete data, and not as continuous data. In essence, I am curious how in these two approaches, $p_{i} = \frac{1}{9}$ is bridged to the unknown $f(x)$ for the continuous data? Clearly if $f(x)$ follows some known function's behavior, then we can fit $f(x)$ to the measured points and then have ourselves a continuous probability density function to use with the expectation operator, but I’m not seeing how the value found by discrete averaging is similar to that of the expectation operator used on the (currently unknown) probability density function? From what I can tell, all descriptive calculations done on this data would have to treat it as discrete points, and not as continuous values, even though in reality they are continuous measures. This relation between the continuous and discrete handling of this data does not make sense to me, and its what I’m dying to understand.
