I think it won't be so easy to implement. One possibility is that instead of using a modal dialog in View A, you use a TabFolder. Then, you can open the contents of the dialog in a new Tab instead and force this tab to stay on top until you dismiss it. This is a similar behavior to the one you need. This will also allow you to drag and drop something from View B into View A.
