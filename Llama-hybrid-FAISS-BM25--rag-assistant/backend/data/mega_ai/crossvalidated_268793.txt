To what extent are convolutional neural networks inspired by biology?

I have read in several places that convolutional neural networks were biologically inspired. In what ways do CNNs mirror biology, and in what ways don't they? Is there a more biologically plausible computer vision architecture that succeeds in learning translation invariance?
