Multiple Entities, Multivariate, Multi-step - Time Series Prediction - Python

My goal is to create a time series model with Multiple Entities - I have multiple products with pre orders and they all have the a similar bell shaped curve peeking at the release date of the product but different orders of magnitude in unit salles OR I can use their cumulative slaes what is an "S" shaped curve. But I only have about 100 products 1 year of daily data to do the training on. Multivariate - I have a wide variety of data on these indie movies for each day: A.) number of times people added them to the Wishlist, B.) page views, C.) time spent on the page AVG, -> Y.) Target value is the number of products people payed for (it is the same pre order before release and normal purchase after release date) Multi-step - predicting 60 days ahead would be the goal Every day refreshing the predictions for every product - Does this requires me to retrain the modell on the whole dataset? Already Read I have found algorithms that can do prediction on 1 variate maybe even Multivariate. Multi-step is already problematic and I don't know how to add the Multiple Entities part at all. So I cant fine a project or guide that would contain all these 3 parts that I nd I have tried LSTM (13 different models with different datasets) but on longer "Multi-step" it is not working so more than 1 or 2 days. I also cant make the LSTM to accept Multiple Entities so I just chained each products data after each other historically, I do understand that it is not an optimal practice for sure. Python package non popular so I cant find projects to it - https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/412355/256200 I always see this R guide but I don't use R. I need help with Python - https://otexts.com/fpp2/hierarchical.html Not multiple variable and not Multi-step - https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/356008/multiple-time-series-prediction-python
