The formula for calculating the amount of nodes in depth L is: (Given that there are N root nodes) N L To calculate the number of all nodes one needs to do this for every layer: for depth in (1..L) nodeCount += N ** depth If there's only 1 root node, subtract 1 from L and add 1 to the total nodes count. Be aware that if in one node the amount of leaves is different from the average case this can have a big impact on your number. The further up in the tree the more impact. * * * N ** 1 *** *** *** N ** 2 *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** N ** 3 This is community wiki, so feel free to alter my appalling algebra.
