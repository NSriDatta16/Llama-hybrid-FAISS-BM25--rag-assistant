what is the return value of predict in the fGarch package

I have a question about a quit sophisticated model for a time series. Suppose $ \{X_t:0\le t\le T\}$ is a time series. The plot of autocorrelation function and partialcorrelation function suggest and ARMA model. However, I also want to model the volatility, hence I use a ARMA(p,q)-GARCH(1,1) model, say. This means $$ X_t=\mu_t+\sigma_t Z_t$$ $$\mu_t=\mu +\sum_{i=1}^p\phi_i(X_{t-i}-\mu)+\sum_{j=1}^q\theta_j(X_{t_j}-\mu_{t-j}) $$ $$ \sigma_t^2=\omega+\alpha_1(X_{t-1}-\mu_{t-1})^2+\beta_1\sigma_{t-1}^2$$ Then $\mu_t$ models the conditional expectation and $\sigma_tZ_t$ the conditional variance, where $\{Z_t\}$ is a strict white noise. In R we can use model command where we have to specify $p,q$ and we decided to assume the white noise has a student $t$ distribution. Using the built in functin predict we can get a forecast for the next day: predict(model,n=1) However what is the return value of predict ? Does it forecast $\sigma_{t+1}^2$, $\mu_{t+1}$ or $X_{t+1}$ and how can I get the other two forecasts within R ?
