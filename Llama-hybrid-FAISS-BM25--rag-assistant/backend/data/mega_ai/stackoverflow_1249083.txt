Detect Silverlight server-side

I have a fairly complex Silverlight banner, with interstitials, hovers, active areas, etc. This is specced to work in Silverlight 1/2. As I am an web standards fan, I'd like to accommodate users who do not have Silverlight and switch to an equivelant JavaScript-driven version of each banner if needed. For expediency, I'd love to be able to do this server-side, so I can just show/hide an asp:Panel accordingly. This will let me test between Silerlight.non Silverlight environments easily as I can then just mock a non-SL capable experience. Is there a way that will let me do this? I haven't noticed SL announce itself as part of the UserAgent, but we know we can't necassarily rely on that anyway. Am I restricted to relying on JavaScript and using that somehow to tell the server I need non-SL content?
