ASP.NET Email Patterns

ASP.NET Webforms application. Problem : How to implement emailling elegantly? Many parts of the application demand it. This will include HTML emails, solutions how to handle bouncebacks etc.. I have the option to use my own SMTP server (app is hosted on a VPS), or to use the hosting providers. I'd like to start logging here too (log4net probably) Any suggestions for libraries to use / patterns to implement? EDIT: http://martinnormark.com/2010/03/13/generate-html-e-mail-body-in-c-using-templates I like having a debug catch asp.net net.mail - route all emails to a different email address in debug mode
