Lasso for feature selection in classification models

I want to perform classification of breast cancer cases by using models like SVM or Random Forest. When I was browsing the web I saw that one could use Lasso for feature selection, and then applied these features as input to my ML models. The question that I have is if its useful to use Lasso as a feature selector for classification tasks. I ask this, because for what I know Lasso is used in Regression models. Could I use Lasso as a feature selector in classification tasks? Thanks
