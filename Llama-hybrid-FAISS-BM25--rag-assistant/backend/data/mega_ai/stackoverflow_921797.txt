If you are finding the Apple docs difficult, try reading Jonathan's post about re-ordering. Okay, well if that's a bit much, try the AbstractTree sample code from Apple's ADC site. The Drag and drop methods are highlighted in the AppDelegate files. I don't wish to sound rude, but are you working through a tutorial or looking at references? I ask because just requesting code that you can paste in isn't going to be helpful to you: There isn't generic code that you can just drop in. it needs to be written for your specific case. Without knowing about these, we can't just write your methods for you. Try and implement the example drag and drop methods from AbstractTree, and if you are still having trouble, try posting the code that you have written that isn't working.
