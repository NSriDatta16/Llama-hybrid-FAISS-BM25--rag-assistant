.Net Property Grid. Is there a way to let the Grid manipulate object in different way

As I understood , The property grid is given an object which it can manipulate by extracting its Properties using reflections. My problem is that I have a set of Parameters that is determined during run-time , thus I can't staticly compose a class with properties to represent this set. I have two idea in mind to solve this problem but both are complex and will probably consume lot of time , infact i will say they are not practical under my time constraints. One is to use Reflection Emit in order to define a class dynamically and the other is to dynamiclly build a C# source file and then compile it using CodeDom. Can Property grid behave in a different manner( other then extracting the Properties of an object using reflections ) that can suite my problem? If no do you know any other control that can do the job for me? I want to say that the reason I went to the property grid from the begining was its ability to provide realy nice Data Retrieval UI for common types.For color you autometically get a palette , For dataTime you automatically have a nice calender. I would like to get those things automatically , If possible.
