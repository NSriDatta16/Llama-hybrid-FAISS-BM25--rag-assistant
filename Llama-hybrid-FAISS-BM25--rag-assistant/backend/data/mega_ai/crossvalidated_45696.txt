Random Forest Regression - Coping with extreme values

I'm not sure if I used the concept "extreme values" right. Anyhow, I'm trying to produce a model that estimates maximum tree heights / $\text{km}^2$. I have a database of around 24000 points ($\text{km}^2$), each has the max tree height value and 33 predictors. After playing around with random forest I manage to achieve a correlation of 0.67 between the real height and the estimated height on the test sample (20%). A MSE of around 1.6 meters. But Maximum errors of up to 33 meters. What I can see is that patches with very tall trees or very short trees (50 meters - 1 meters) are out of the scope of the model. Thinking in linear regression it is analogous to losing prediction power as you move away from the center of gravity of the observations. Right? How can I cope with this if at all? p.s. this was implemented in R
