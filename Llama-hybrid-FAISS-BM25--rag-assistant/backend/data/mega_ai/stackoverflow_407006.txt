Need to load the whole postgreSQL database into the RAM

How do I put my whole PostgreSql database into the RAM for a faster access?? I have 8GB memory and I want to dedicate 2 GB for the DB. I have read about the shared buffers settings but it just caches the most accessed fragment of the database. I needed a solution where the whole DB is put into the RAM and any read would happen from the RAM DB and any write operation would first write into the RAM DB and then the DB on the hard drive.(some thing like the default fsync = on with shared buffers in postgresql configuration settings).
