install reCaptcha and white page

I've downloaded librecaptcha.php and made test.php: But it shows white screen. Problem is in require_once(), because if I exit with echo before require_once() - it echoes to page, but if after require - doesn't echo. File recaptchalib.php is in the same folder as the test.php What it can be? UPD 1: I think, the problem is in require_once('recaptchalib.php') . No matter what code is after it, white screen will apear. For example: This file return white screen. But this script works: So, the problem is in lib file itself. Path is correct, and I haven't modified the file. UPD2 : So, I should to check recaptchalib.php file. I've create lib.php file with such content: It've been opened in all browsers. But then I've added (copy-pasted) the content of recaptchalib.php before echo "lib" . So it looks like: And I've seen blank screen in FF, 500 server internal error in Chrome and Remove server or file not found on Opera. UPD3: recaptchalib.php began to work only when I've copied it's content function-by-function in a new file. (when I copied whole content - it hasn't work). I don't understand why??
