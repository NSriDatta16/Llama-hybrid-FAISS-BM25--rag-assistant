Respectable members have given you good hints. I will try fill in the points not yet touched. Question1: What is that value? It is a basic statistical concept. You ought to specify alpha before running into hypothesis testing. If you plan to run several statistical tests, it is better to take care of adjusting alpha to the number of the tests. 0.05 / 0.01 / 0.001 are not necessarily valid values. You should decide which Type 1 Error chance you accept. Question2: Is it acceptable to run ndiffs Yes. You may need to difference your master timeseries at least once. Second order differencing is not so common but still can be needed. Besides you could check out the opportunity to take diff(log(X)) . This can be needed if the volatility of your master data is non constant. Question3 Once the differencing is completed, is there a need to perform stl() or decompose()? To the best of my understanding you stationarize (in a weak sense) your series by either removing trend and possibly taking log(residual X) OR by taking an appropriate order of differencing. Strongly, you are about to check for AR coefficient to be constant. Then you should see the autocorrelation structure in your data either by taking acf(), pacf() , or checking out the seasonal component resulted from the seasonal decomposition. Question4 I see that these methods are used for checking residuals outside the insignificant zone. You are supposed to take a closer look at the residuals of the final nested model (ar, differenced, possibly moving averaged). The residuals should not show any autoregressive components in acf(), pacf() and they should also be about zero in mean and, ideally, should have a Gaussian distribution.
