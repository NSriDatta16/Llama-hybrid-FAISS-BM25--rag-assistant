Will googlebot index my index.php even with an htaccess redirect?

Using a redirect statement in my htaccess file, people who type the following into the address bar... http://example.com/index.php ...are redirected to... http://example.com/ I also have a noindex, nofollow meta tag on all my website's pages. My question is, given that redirect behavior and meta data, will googlebot index my mainpage (i.e. index.php) if my robots.txt file is as follows... User-agent: Googlebot Allow: /index.php Disallow: / User-agent: * Disallow: / If not, how should I change my robots.txt so that only my mainpage will be indexed in google and nothing more? Thanks in advance!
