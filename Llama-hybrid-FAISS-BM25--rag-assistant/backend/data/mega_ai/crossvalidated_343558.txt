Why is long-run variance a positive function of the spectral density at frequency zero?

MÃ¼ller (2014) provides the following definition of the long-run variance $\omega^2$: $\omega^2=2\pi f(0)$ where $f(0)$ is the spectral density of a time series process, evaluated at frequency zero. As I understand it, $f(0)$ is roughly a measure of how well our process can be described with a constant (i.e. with its mean). And the long-run variance is the infinite sum of autocovariances. So my question is, why is the long-run variance a positive function of $f(0)$? Also, could you please suggest some introductory literature on the spectral density representation of a time series process? EDIT: I'm looking for the intution of this relationship, since the mathematical reasoning is already available in the paper: $\omega^2=\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\gamma(j)$ $f(\lambda)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}cos(j\lambda)\gamma(j)$ So... $f(0)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\gamma(j)$ And therefore... $\omega^2=2\pi f(0)$
