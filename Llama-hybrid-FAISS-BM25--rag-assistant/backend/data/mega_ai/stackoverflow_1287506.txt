There’s an order in that the actual character encoding is choosen : To sum up, conforming user agents must observe the following priorities when determining a document's character encoding (from highest priority to lowest): An HTTP "charset" parameter in a "Content-Type" field. A META declaration with "http-equiv" set to "Content-Type" and a value set for "charset". The charset attribute set on an element that designates an external resource. So your META declaration may not be considered if there’s already a charset declaration in the Content-Type HTTP header field.
