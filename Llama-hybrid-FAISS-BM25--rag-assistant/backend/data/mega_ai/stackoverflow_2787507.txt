A few comments: eval("prod="+response); - don't do that. It's creates a global 'prod' variable, can execute arbitrary code, prevents the JS engine from speeding up your code, and generally is considered a bad coding practice. Use a JSON parser instead (either from json.org or helpers from your favorite library). tt.appendChild(st); // i even tried **tt.appendChild(eval(st));** - appendChild takes a DOM node; st is a string and eval(st) evaluates st assuming it contains JavaScript code (so running it on XML will result in a syntax error, unless you're using E4X , which still wouldn't create an object suitable for use with appendChild ). You should either parse the HTML code you've built (via innerHTML , createDocumentFragment , or -- again -- using a helper from your favorite JS library) Finally, if you do this a lot, consider using templates instead .
