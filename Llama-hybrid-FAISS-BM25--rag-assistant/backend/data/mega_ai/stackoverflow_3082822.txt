R time series object with two time dimensions

When you study time series forecast you most often have to deal with two times: the time you issue your forecast and the time you make your forecast for. These two times are not regularly sampled in general. What R object do you suggest to deal with these two times ? please indicate advantages and drawback. If no object exist, how should I use existing S4 object to create what I need? Thanks in advance for sharing your experience in R with this type of data
