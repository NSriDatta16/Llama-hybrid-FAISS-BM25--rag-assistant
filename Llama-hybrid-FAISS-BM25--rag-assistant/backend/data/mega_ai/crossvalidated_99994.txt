First, can you show your code? Something is wrong. You should be running a two way chi-square with 10 levels of extinction and 2 groups, so getting 9 degrees of freedom, not 344. However, instead of chi-square at all, since "level of extinction" is presumably ordinal, I would run an ordinal logistic regression with "level of extinction" as the dependent variable and "group" as an independent variable. You might also want additional independent variables. (Group would be whether the language is part of the 384 or not)
