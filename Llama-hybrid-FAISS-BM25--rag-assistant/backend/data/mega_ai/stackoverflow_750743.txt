You can use UIWebView to load html files stored locally on the iPhone. NYTimes app is probably caching html and images in local storage. Search google for "UIWebView local" and you get several useful hits. I tried it out and it works great: First, create a "view based application" and add a UIWebView to the NIB. Second, add this code to your UIViewController code: - (void)viewDidLoad { NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"index" ofType:@"html"]; NSURL *url = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:path isDirectory:NO]; NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url]; [webView loadRequest:request]; [super viewDidLoad]; } Third, add a file called "index.html" to your "Resources" folder in xcode and it will be displayed. UPDATE: Indeed, the complicated part of this is downloading the images and stylesheets for the webpage. Doing this server side is easy with Simple HTML Parser (and PHP). Just package everything in a zip and download to your iPhone. Alternatively, you could do it locally with a C/C++/OBJC HTML parser (libxml2.2 is available on iOS). See this SO question Parsing HTML on the iPhone . It's going to a bit of a project, so good luck.
