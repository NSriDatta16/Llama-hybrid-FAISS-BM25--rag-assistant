By far the best drag/drop plugins I've found for jQuery are located here: http://threedubmedia.com/ . They provide new jQuery event handlers for the key stages of a drag-and-drop action, which allow you to customise the behaviour very easily. Just check out the demos to see what can be achieved using them.
