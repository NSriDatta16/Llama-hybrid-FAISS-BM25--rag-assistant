Only option is to make sure first frame of your video is same as poster or not to use it at all. "When a video element is paused and the current playback position is the first frame of video, the element represents either the frame of video corresponding to the current playback position or the poster frame, at the discretion of the user agent." -- http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/video.html#attr-video-poster
