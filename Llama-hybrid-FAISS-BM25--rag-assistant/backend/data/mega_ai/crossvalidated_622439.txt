The calculated 95% prediction interval (95% PI) will not match the 95% confidence interval (95%) because it is (most likely) constructed with a t distribution, allowing for more uncertainty. Frequentist 95% PIs are typically calculated using a t distribution. When the estimated $\tau^2$ = 0, we only expect 95% PI to match 95% CI for a large number of studies. There is no battle between frequentists and Bayesians. 95% PIs are probabilistic. "A prediction interval is an estimate of an interval in which a future observation will fall, with a certain probability, given what has already been observed." (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_interval ). I would add "given the uncertainty of the data/evidence and what has already been observed". Based on the available data and uncertainty, there is a 95% probability that the true (central) risk differences to be estimated in future studies or settings lie between -0.074 and 0.152. It is important to note that your statement "there is no heterogeneity" is suboptimal. The method used (not described), and the four available studies do not indicate any detectable between-study variance. It can be large but could not be detected - given the small number of studies. This is not the same as inferring there is "no statistical heterogeneity between studies". Based on the graph you described, there is a fair chance that the true risk difference across studies, populations or different settings is below -1%
