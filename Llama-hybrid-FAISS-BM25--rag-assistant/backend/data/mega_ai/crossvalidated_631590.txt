First of all, please understand that we can never "prove" anything with statistics. Instead we can conduct a statistical test that, in a frequentist setting (not a Bayesian setting), provides evidence against a null hypothesis. I am assuming that you have conducted your regression in a frequentist setting. So when you run your regression model, you will obtain a regression coefficient for the variable of interest, in your case X_POST . This estimate tells you that when X_POST changes by 1 unit, the outcome variable changes by whatever the value of whatever the regression coefficient for X_POST is. Along with that, there should also be a standard error, a t-value and a p-value. The p-value tells you, that if the "real" value of the coefficient was actually zero (ie no effect) then the probability of you obtaining the data that you did (or even more extreme) is given by the p-value, which is a probability. The smaller this probability is, the less likely that it arose by chance, if the null hypothesis were true. Here the null hypothesis would be "that the value of the regression coefficient is zero", ie, this variable has zero linear association with the outcome. If you would rather just like to estimate the probablity that null hypothesis is true (zero effect) then you could adopt a Bayesian approach.
