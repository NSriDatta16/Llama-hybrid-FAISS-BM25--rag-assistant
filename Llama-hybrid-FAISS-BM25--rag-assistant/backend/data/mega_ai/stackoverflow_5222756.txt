Web SQL Database or Indexed Database API ... or both?

HTML5's localStorage, while a great step in the right direction, is quite incomplete for my needs; its a glorified 1-dimensional array. There are two competing client-side databases being built into modern browsers. Web SQL Database ( http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/ ) Indexed Database API ( http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/ ) Has anybody written and published a meta-library to both of these services? Akin to to how dojox.storage used to proxy the various plugins ( http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.3/dojox/storage/manager ) would be great. Futhermore, what has been your experience using either of these two 'standards'?
