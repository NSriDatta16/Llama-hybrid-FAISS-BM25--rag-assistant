Is it possible to extract mathematical expression of an trained ML Model?

In Python & R, Linear Regression model gives the mathematical representation after learning the training data, typically in the form of intercept, coefficients of variables, and the p-value/t-value. Is it possible to extract mathematical representation of complex models based on Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc. after training it on a training dataset?
