Are you already using Caching and Session state? The basic idea being to defer as much of the data loading to these storage mediums as possible and not do it on individual page loads. Caching especially can be useful if you only need to get the data once and want to share it between users and over time. If you are already doing these things, ore cant directly implement them try deferring as much of this data gathering as possible, opting to short-circuit it and not do the loading up front. If the data is only occasionally used this can also save you a lot of time in page loads.
