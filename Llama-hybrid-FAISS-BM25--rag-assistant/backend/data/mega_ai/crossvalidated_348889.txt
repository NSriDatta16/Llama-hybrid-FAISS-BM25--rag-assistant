Negative Price Series and Mixed Units

I am working on testing multiple time series (monthy data) for statistical significance. The data has mixed units, and some of the time series have negative prices. The data set includes prices, volatility, geo-political indices (indexed from 100 over time), price time spreads...etc. I thought the best approach is to scale the data using logs and run standard statistical tests (regressions, correlations...etc.), but the negative prices are posing a problem. Does the community have any suggestions on the best way to approach an analysis with negative data series and mixed units? For people unfamiliar with negative prices, they are very common in energy commodities. The costs of shutting down production, or the benefits received through production tax credits means participants will often sell a commodity at a negative price (ie., you pay to sell it). Prices, therefore can fluctuate widely from negative to positive values. The units are often mixed - bbls, MWh, GJ, indices scaled from 100 or zero...etc.
