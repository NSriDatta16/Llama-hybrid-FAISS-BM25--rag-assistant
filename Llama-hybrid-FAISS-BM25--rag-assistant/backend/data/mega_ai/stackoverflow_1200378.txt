Do MS SQL Server 2000 full text index queries using freetextable use stemming?

I'm using MSSQL's full text indexing on a handful of tables in my CMS and am unfortunately stuck with SQL Server 2000. I'm querying the index using freetexttable joins and am having pretty good results, but we have some unique terms that are likely search queries that do not appear to be stemming. For example a query using the term "smartbar" returns a couple of rows, but one using "smartbars" returns a different, only partially overlapping, result set. If I understand the stemming concept correctly I would assume that the first query would contain all of the rows in the second query, but it does not. Looking at MSDN's Books Online, this page mentions stemming in the freetext_string parameter comments, but this page does not. From that I would assume that SQL Server 2000 doesn't stem the words in the freetexttable query; is this a correct assumption? Is there any way to encourage or enable SQL Server 2000 to stem? As a fall-back I'll probably use the thesaurus files for important queries for our unique terms, but would rather let SQL Server do most of the work. As a follow up, if anyone has links to good resources regarding SQL Server 2000 full-text querying I would greatly appreciate them. The MSDN information is useful, but I would love some more in-depth info and haven't been able to find much.
