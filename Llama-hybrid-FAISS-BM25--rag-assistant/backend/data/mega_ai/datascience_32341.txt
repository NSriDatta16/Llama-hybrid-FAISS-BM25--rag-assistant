What is the best method for classification of time series data? Should I use LSTM or a different method?

I am trying to classify raw accelerometer data x,y,z to its corresponding label. What is the best architecture for best results? Or, does anyone have any suggestions on LSTM architectures built on keras with input and output nodes?
