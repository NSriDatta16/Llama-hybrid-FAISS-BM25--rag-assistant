MARS is a very flexible method and an excellent alternative to OLS regression. Also, it is more interpretable than machine learning methods such as neural networks and SVM. MARS can transform variables, identify higher order interaction between variables which is a huge + vs. OLS. For Question #1, MARS can handle outliers very well. MARS is distribution free, therefore no assumption. MARS is entirely data driven or in other words it learns from data. When I model using MARS at work, I hardly ever worry about assumptions. However its always a good idea to look at residulas and see if the model fit is adequate and there is no pattern left. For Question #2, MARS is entirely a data driven method, therefore you might need adequate data to fit MARS. n = 33 is probably a small set for MARS. I would suggest fit both OLS and MARS and see which gives better fit.
