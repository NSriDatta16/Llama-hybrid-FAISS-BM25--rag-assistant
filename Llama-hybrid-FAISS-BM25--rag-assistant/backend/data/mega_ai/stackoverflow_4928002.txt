JQuery Sortable set item to an index programmatically

I have a JQuery sortable (1.7.1 can change if necessary) list like so: 1 2 3 4 5 The second item is locked so if item 5 is tried to be moved in slot 2 it will go in slot 3 instead and if tried to be moved in slot 1 then existing item in slot 1 drops to 3 and item 5 goes to 1. The implementation logic is easy but what I need to know is if there is any programmatic way of moving items around that would include the animations. Did find this one already Moving an item programmatically with jQuery sortable while still triggering events but not sure if the 'sortupdate' event would simulate a drag and drop or if it would even work?
