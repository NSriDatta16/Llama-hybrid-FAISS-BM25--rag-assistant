How to organize and setup mirrored backup servers for Git repositories?

I am moving some svn repositories to Git. So, what I basically try to do is this: Setup one server with bare Git repositories from which I will pull and push to Setup a few backup servers for all of my repositories that are on the 1st server. So, let's say i have a directory on my server, like: $HOME/git/ , which has bare repositories. Eg: ~/git/project1.git ~/git/project2.git ~/git/project3.git ... My backup servers may be mirrors to this server, or keep the backed up data in archives or whatever. I suppose I can do something like: git clone --bare ssh://gitserver/~user/git/projectX.git Or maybe: $ cd ~/git/project1.git $ git bundle create ~/gitbackup/project1.bdl --all and then copy all bundles from all projects to my backup servers. However, having a lot of projects either strategy would be a tedious task, so in each case I would need to make some scripts to automate the task. I wonder how are you guys doing this? Maybe there is some better way to do it than what I considered already. Any tip would be appreciated.
