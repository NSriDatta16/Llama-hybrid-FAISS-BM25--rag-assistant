regression & ANOVA are General Linear Models - for Normally distributed data. Example of Generalized Linear Models can be Logistic Regression that uses logistic-function, or logistic-curve (S-shaped), that converts log-odds to probability of belonging to certain class (in binary classification) or other non-linear functions assigned in arguments of API's glmm-implementation Also, I know that it's possible to add mixed effects in a GLMM. Is it the case for ANOVAs? yes ANOVA can be GLMM for analysing within-group & between-group variability e.g. having several experiments repeated (as random effect) & compaaring it to the group after any treatment (as fixed effect)
