Reducing Size of Credible Interval Bayesian Regression Pymc3

I am interested in ways to reduce the width/size of a credible interval in a Bayesian regression. Suppose you have a simple Bayesian linear regression $y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$ , formulated with: Independent variables $x_1, x_2, x_3$ with priors on the intercept $\beta_0$ and coefficients $\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$ with $\mu = \beta_0 +\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3 x_3$ Prior on the standard deviation $\sigma$ As below: When you make predictions on the dependent variable $y$ you find that the credible interval for each prediction is wider than you would expect (generated by sampling from $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$ for a given set of independent variables). My question is, what methods are appropriate for narrowing the credible interval. For example, are any of the below inappropriate and any I am missing? Strong Informative Prior on the Standard Deviation (if this aligns with your belief) Increase sample size (if consistent effect in data to reduce uncertainty) Change type of interval of confidence level (ideally fixed)
