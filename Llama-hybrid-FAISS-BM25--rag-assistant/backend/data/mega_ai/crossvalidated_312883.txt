When would I use a trig function in a Regression/Time Model Series

I was casually flipping through some older journals in my university's library and found that some authors employ trig functions to forecast social phenomena. I'd like to know under what circumstances would I consider using trig functions as a tool in forecasting or cross sectional models? Would I ever use a trig function in time series analysis if I used seasonal dummies in a given ARIMA,VAR or VECM model?
