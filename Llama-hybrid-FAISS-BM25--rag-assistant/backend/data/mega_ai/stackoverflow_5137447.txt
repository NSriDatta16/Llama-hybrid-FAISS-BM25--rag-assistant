List of all commands that cause git gc --auto

Is there a definitive list of commands anywhere that cause git gc --auto to run? The git-gc(1) man page simply states: --auto With this option, git gc checks whether any housekeeping is required; if not, it exits without performing any work. Some git commands run git gc --auto after performing operations that could create many loose objects. (emphasis added) I'm in the process of organising a large migration from SVN to Git. The overwhelming majority of users will be on Windows PCs, and a not-insignificant portion of them are non-technical. They will be using TortoiseGit (as it closely matches TortoiseSVN, which they are already familiar with) - I've noticed that TortoiseGit does not include any functionality to run git gc manually at all. The non-technical staff cannot be expected to have to launch a "git bash" command line to run git gc --auto from the appropriate working dir; and as we are using the "portable" distribution of MsysGit they will not have the "Git GUI Here.." windows shell context menu shortcut. Is it reasonable to expect that over time Git will mostly self-maintain, or do I need to try and work out a non-technical user friendly method of invoking git gc --auto ?
