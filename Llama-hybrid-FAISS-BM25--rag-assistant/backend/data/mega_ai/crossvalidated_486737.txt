Instead of averaging AUCs per fold you can calculate two ROC curve per iteration for Model_A and Model_B (since every instance is exactly predicted once in k-fold CV). To calculate whether the addition of a biomarker results in a model with significantly different AUC you can use DeLong 's test. Here, I wouldn't use the median of the p-values - a simple count will do (e.g: around 5 significant p-values out of 100 times 10-fold CV can be explained by chance and indicate no improvement in model performance). Different approaches to "combine" your p-values are mentioned in " Statistical Methods for Meta-Analysis " by Larry V. Hedges and Ingram Olkin. If you are using Python and want to use DeLong's test, this blog post might be helpful (altough still in draft): https://biasedml.com/roc-comparison/
