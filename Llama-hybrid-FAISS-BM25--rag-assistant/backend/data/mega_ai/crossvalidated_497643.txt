Machine learning methods for filtering noisy data

I have my data (hear beat) cleaned up with the appropriate filter, however, they are still noisy and need to extract a clean pattern. Which is the best algorithm for this purpose? I have also clean data where the pattern is clear and could be used as a reference to extract the pattern. Many thanks
