Other answers recommended a good set of books about the mathematics behind data science. But as you mentioned, its not just mathematics and activities like data collection and inference from data has their own rules and theories, even if not being as rigorous as mathematical backgrounds (yet). For theses parts, I suggest the book Beautiful Data: The Stories Behind Elegant Data Solutions which contains twenty case-study like chapters written by people really engaged with real world data analysis problems. It does not contain any mathematics, but explores areas like collecting data, finding practical ways of using data in analyses, scaling and selecting the best solutions very well. Another really interesting book is Thinking with Data: How to Turn Information into Insights , which is not technical (=programming tutorial) either, but covers important topics on how to really use the data science power in decision making and real world problems.
