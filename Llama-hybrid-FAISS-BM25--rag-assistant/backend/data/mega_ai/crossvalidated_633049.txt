What do you do when bootstrap sample gives a numerically "bad" set of samples?

What do you do when bootstrapping and the sample for one iteration is "bad" in some way that makes your statistic uncomputable. For example suppose your statistic was the best fit linear slope for a data set of points $(x_i,y_i)$ , but your boot strap sample picked points all at the same $x$ coordinate (or even just picked the same point every time). Does one just throw that sample out? Is there a method where you put more constraints on how you sample when your statistic needs the sample set to have some property? I don't have a particular application in mind, this question has just been in the back of my mind for some time. Edit: I guess I can add a little more context since I'm asking about possible alternatives/work a rounds too. In my life, the place I use statistics is usually when taking time series data and fitting a model, but a "best fit" usually doesn't come with std err for parameter estimates. A lot of the time you just plot the fit and hand wave that it "looks good" but it's always bugged me that a std error for paramaters in those fits is not available.
