Question about changing the first view my app loads

Starting from the top, I am making an application that in the new project section of Xcode, is a new view based application, that is using core data for storage. Xcode does an awesome job of populating lots of useful code for me so that when I click build, I have a bar at the top with edit and add buttons, and a plain uitableview that is blank. My question concerns how I might go about making another simple view the first one that loads. I would like to have the editable uitableview as the second view in my drill down sequence, with a more user friendly welcome tableview that doesn't have the edit and add buttons on the bar, launch first. The user can click on a row in the first view, that will lead them then to the screen that is currently first. I have tried making a new class with a corresponding .xib file, and referencing that in the MainWindow.xib file that was referencing the rootScreen.xib, but that didn't work. Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
