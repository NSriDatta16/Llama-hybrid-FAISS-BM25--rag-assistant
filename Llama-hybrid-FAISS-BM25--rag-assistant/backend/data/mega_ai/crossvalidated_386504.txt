I would normalise health data in the same way as anything else. Continuous numerical values, such as age, temperature, etc should be rescaled to between 0 and 1. If you are planning on running machine learning algorithms on the data or doing other statistical tests then you might also like to transform your rescaled data so that it is normally distributed. Applying a Box-Cox transformation to the column of data is a quick way of doing that. Non-numeric variables such as blood type should be replaced by a single column per possible value where the value is 1 if the person has that value and 0 otherwise. For example, if the blood types in your data were A, O, B & AB then you would add four columns to your dataset and each patient would have only one of those columns marked with value 1 with 0 in the other three. You might have an extra couple of columns for Rhesus positive and Rhesus negative as well, if it makes sense to separate them out from blood type.
