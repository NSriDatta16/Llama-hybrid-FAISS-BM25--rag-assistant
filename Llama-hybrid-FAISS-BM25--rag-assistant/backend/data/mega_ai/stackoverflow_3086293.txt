Is it a good idea to obfuscate your server side code? I'd give an unqualified YES. The reality is that the end user is only one group which might have nefarious plans. All too often internal employees, whether they are business users , support staff , etc, might also have their own plans.. or made unwitting accomplices . If you deal with ANY information which requires a password to access, then you have a duty to leverage every tool at your disposal in order to safeguard that information. This includes protecting it against both external and internal people. Companies lose both data and intellectual property all of the time due to internal people with too much access. Whether those people purposely stole the information or simply lost control of their computers due to hacker attacks is immaterial. So, again, yes one step is to obfuscate in the hopes of whoever acquires the binaries has a harder time in figuring out how your application works. Of course, you should go a lot further by securing the servers it lives on; and not just production , but all the way back to source control .
