SumProduct over sets of cells (not contiguous)

I have a total data set that is for 4 different groupings. One of the values is the average time, the other is count. For the Total I have to multiply these and then divide by the total of the count. Currently I use: =SUM(D32*D2,D94*D64,D156*D126,D218*D188)/SUM(D32,D94,D156,D218) I would rather use a SumProduct if I can to make it more readable. I tried to do: =SUMPRODUCT((D2,D64,D126,D188),(D32,D94,D156,D218))/SUM(D32,94,D156,D218) But as you can tell by my posting here, that did not work. Is there a way to do SumProduct like I want?
