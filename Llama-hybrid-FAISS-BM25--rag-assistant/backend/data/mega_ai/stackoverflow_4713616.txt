yes it does it uses 2 bytes, use datalength to get the storage size, you can't use LEN because LEN just counts the characters, see here: The differences between LEN and DATALENGTH in SQL Server DECLARE @n NVARCHAR(10) DECLARE @v VARCHAR(10) SELECT @n = 'A', @v='A' SELECT DATALENGTH(@n),DATALENGTH(@v) --------- 2 1 Here is what Books On Line has: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186939.aspx Character data types that are either fixed-length, nchar, or variable-length, nvarchar, Unicode data and use the UNICODE UCS-2 character set. nchar [ ( n ) ] Fixed-length Unicode character data of n characters. n must be a value from 1 through 4,000. The storage size is two times n bytes. The ISO synonyms for nchar are national char and national character. nvarchar [ ( n | max ) ] Variable-length Unicode character data. n can be a value from 1 through 4,000. max indicates that the maximum storage size is 2^31-1 bytes. The storage size, in bytes, is two times the number of characters entered + 2 bytes. The data entered can be 0 characters in length. The ISO synonyms for nvarchar are national char varying and national character varying. That said unicode compression was introduced in SQL Server 2008 R2 so it might store ascii as 1 byte, you can read about unicode compression here SQL Server 2008 R2 : A quick experiment in Unicode Compression SQL Server 2008 R2 : Digging deeper into Unicode compression More testing of Unicode Compression in SQL Server 2008 R2
