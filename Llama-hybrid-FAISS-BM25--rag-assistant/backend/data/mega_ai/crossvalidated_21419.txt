What sense does it make to compare p-values to each other?

I have two populations (men and women), each containing $1000$ samples. For each sample I have two properties A & B (first year grade point average, and SAT score). I have used a t-test separately for A & B: both found significant differences between the two groups; A with $p=0.008$ and B with $p=0.002$. Is it okay to claim that the property B is better discriminated (more significant) then the property A? Or is it that a t-test is just a yes or no (significant or not significant) measure? Update : according to the comments here and to what I have read on wikipedia , I think that the answer should be: drop the meaningless p-value and report your effect size . Any thoughts?
