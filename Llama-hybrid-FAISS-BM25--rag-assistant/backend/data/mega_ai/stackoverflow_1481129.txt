In my last job, almost all the infrastructure was written by us instead of using some of-the-shelf products. (and by "all the infrastructure" I mean ALL of it - Logging, Messaging, Database, Containers of so on). One of the biggest disadvantages of it was that it made us spend most of our time working on the things that are irrelevant to the end-user instead of adding more features. from that job I've learned to always focus on the things your product was meant to solve . is your company developing loggers? will the quality of your logger influence your customer more than another feature? I don't think so. You have a limited budget and manpower - use it wisely. Don't reinvent the wheel. I'm sure that your company and your customers will benefit if you'll focus your attention on things that they need. in my current project I'm using NHibernate as ORM framework instead of an in-house one that is in use in other projects. instead of fixing bugs in the old ORM framework, my focus is on the main roadmap of the project. furthermore, NHibernate has it's own roadmap which means that additional features will come without much resources from my company.
