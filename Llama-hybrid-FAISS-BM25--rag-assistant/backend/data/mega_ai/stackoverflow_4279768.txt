It's possible to read the browser info based on the HTTP_USER_AGENT string, but, as mentioned above and many other places, it's also really easy to spoof that info. On the server-side we only cared because it gave us an overall view of the client browsers being used to access our sites. Trying to react to a browser on the backend and present different content was tried by sites for a while, but it fails because of how browsers spoof other browsers, but don't have the same bugs. As @Stephen Orr said, CSS is a better way of dealing with it. Sure it's hell and still error-prone, but it's better than sniffing the browser's signature. We used to cuss every release of IE because it broke the previous fixes. Luckily things seem to be getting better as the vendors creep toward toeing standards.
