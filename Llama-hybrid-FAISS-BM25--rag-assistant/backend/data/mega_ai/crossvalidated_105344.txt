Random Forests would work fine, but you have to be very careful when you tune the hyperparameters (especially if you want a realistic measure of generalization performance). The traditional OOB error estimates will be way optimistic since there is rampant "twinning" in your data. To get proper tuning and generalization estimates you need to understand what are the characteristics of any new data you expect to encounter. If you want to extrapolate to new countries, then you'll need to set up some manner of re-sample based tuning (such as k-fold cross validation) that does stratified sampling by country. You also need to be careful how you encode the data into a Random Forest. It appears that country is a categorical variable. Feeding it in as a numeric would be a bit rough, but not hopeless (especially if you ordered the IDs by something useful).
