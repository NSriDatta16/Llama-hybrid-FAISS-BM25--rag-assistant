writing more efficient code in javascript

I'm trying to write more readable and more efficient code, I've always hated if if if chains .. is it possible to write the following statement in some other more "elegant" way like maybe using ternary ops : if(text.length 1){ errtext+=" "; } errors = true; errtext += "Field cannot be empty"; } Thank you
