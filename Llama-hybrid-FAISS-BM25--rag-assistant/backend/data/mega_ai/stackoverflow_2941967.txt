Are you sure you couldn't get 32 teams :-) ? That would make things simpler - have a standard tournament structure, but have the losers from each round play in their own chart. I think this maximises the number of teams who win at least one match during the event. With 30 teams, you could have 2 teams play a 'friendly' and have a by in the first round. But the organisation becomes much more complicated.
