Convergence diagnostics for binary variables

I am running MCMC for binary/categorical variables. I know that a decent method to check for convergence is to look at the traceplot of the variance, but I don't know a good citation for this. Does anyone know where I can find an article on this, or a better method for verifying that a binary/categorical variable has converged to a stationary distribution?
