Estimate remaining time to failure based only on average time to failure

Suppose a random variable X representing time to failure. I don't know its pdf and only know its E[X]. How can I derive E[ X | X > t], i.e. average remaining time to failure? If it is impossible to do so without knowing its pdf, is it possible to come up with a decent estimate based on the knowledge of E[X] only. Human life expectancy is a concrete example of this problem. Given that the life expectancy = 75, is it possible to get a decent estimate for how much longer a person aged 80 can live? A graph below is plotted on the data points sampled from X. It shows the shape of X density function. It always is left skewed and have a right long tail.
