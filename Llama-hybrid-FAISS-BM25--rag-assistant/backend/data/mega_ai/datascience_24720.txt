XGBoost ranking file format

The xgboost package has two files that must be used for ranking: train.txt with the data train.txt.group with the group of each observation I don't understand two things in each file: What should I use as positive/negative classes? In ranking, there is no such thing as a positive/negative class... What should I use as group? Say that I have observations x1 > x2 > x3. How do I express this lexicographical order using groups?
