Can I make simplemodal contact form post across domains?

I'm using the SMCF Wordpress plugin on this site: http://fingelly.com/ As you can see it uses ajax to post the form fields to get mailed and then updates the modal. Some of the nav options at the site take you to a 3rd party IDX (real estate listings) provider. For example click on the tabs marked agents and the url changes to fingelly.idxre.com... As you can see the html is customizable there... I had tried adding the same simple modal contact form to my template there but encountered a problem because I cannot post using ajax to my wordpress driven site from this other domain. I understand this limitation is for security reasons to prevent xss. How would you suggest working around it in this case? For now we've simply removed the contact tab.
