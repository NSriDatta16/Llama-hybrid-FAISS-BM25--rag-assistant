Symfony is based on a lot of patterns, this blog post highlights a few of them: http://obvioushints.blogspot.com/2008/12/symfony-design-patterns.html Basically, it's a model-view-controller (MVC) framework and the directories are setup like that only to organize the numerous configuration and PHP files that are created during a normal, structured project. Of course, you'd need to be a little bit more specific on what makes you curious about the directory structure but if you go through the documentation , you'll find interesting facts about how your project will be divided. The directory structure is not necessarily related to a specific design pattern itself (the code is) but probably more related to just getting your files organized. Anyway, Symfony is a PHP framework like many others, and just by going through generic design patterns using classic books such as Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture or websites about PHP patterns recipes , popular patterns or extensive lists , you should get a good idea on the general structure.
