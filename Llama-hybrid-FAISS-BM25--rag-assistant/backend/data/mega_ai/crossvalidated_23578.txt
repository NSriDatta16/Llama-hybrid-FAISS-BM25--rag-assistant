Should I re-scale the PCA score before classification?

This question is about using PCA as a dimension reduction method before feeding the data into a classifier. It's a common procedure to use PCA for a data set which contains a large number of features, and to only use the first several PCA-scores instead of the original features. My question is : After the PCA score has been extracted should I need to re-scale them ? (as the scores are in descending order...and can be in different magnitude)
