Pocket PC 2003 C# Performance Issues...Should I Thread It?

Environment Windows XP SP3 x32 Visual Studio 2005 Standard Edition Honeywell Dolphin 9500 Pocket PC/Windows Mobile 2003 Platform Using the provided Honeywell Dolphin 9500 VS2005 SDK .NET Framework 1.1 and .NET Compact Framework 1.0 SP3 Using VC# Problem When I save an image from the built in camera and Honeywell SDK ImageControl to the device's storage card or internal memory, it takes 6 - 7 seconds. I am currently saving the image as a PNG but have the option of a BMP or JPG as well. Relevant lines in the code : 144-184 and 222, specifically 162,163 and 222. Goal I would like to reduce that time down to something like 2 or 3 seconds, and even less if possible. As a secondary goal, I am looking for a profiling suite for Pocket PC 2003 devices specifically supporting the .NET Compact Framework Version 1.0 . Ideally free but an unfettered short tutorial would work as well. Things I Have Tried I looked into asynchronous I/O via System.Threading a little bit but I do not have the experience to know whether this is a good idea, nor exactly how to implement threading for a single operation. With threading implemented as it is in the code below, there seems to be a trivial speed increase of maybe a second or less. However, something on the next Form requires the image, possibly in the act of being saved, and I do not know how to mitigate the wait or handle that scenario at all, really. EDIT: Changing the save format from PNG to BMP or JPG, with the threading , seems to reduce the save time considerably. . Code http://friendpaste.com/3J1d5acHO3lTlDNTz7LQzB Let me know if the code should just be posted here in code tags. It is a little long (~226 lines) so I went ahead and friendpasted it as that seemed to be acceptable in my last post.
