All I am really after is a simple way to manage connections and handling data retrieval/storage. Yes, NHibernate can be pretty verbose. I've investigated both the Unit of Work and Repository "patterns" (they're actually "facades" but that's another story) and wrote very simple implementations of them. They both greatly simplify NHibernate, but I'd suggest using the Unit of Work implementation since I feel it's generally more performant and easier to use than Repository. Download it and give it a try: http://code.google.com/p/nhibernate-unitofwork-example/
