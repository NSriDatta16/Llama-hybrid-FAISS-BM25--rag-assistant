Calculate contrasts from lme model across specified timepoints

I have an MMRM with the below structure: #la_mm2 - continuous float #arm - 2 level factor ("2mg", "SHAM") #t_months - continuous float #partI_bool - 2 level factor (1, 0) #da_bool - 2 level factor (1, 0) linr_2mg_mm2 I want to calculate the contrasts of the model estimates within arms over time. I've arrived at the below to get the estimates at specified times, but I can't figure out how to difference in the contrasts. tmp The closest I've come to obtaining contrasts as desired is the below, but this is only returning the mean estimate for the "2mg" group at each of the time points: tmp.c I've tried the "pairwise" approach as below but this reports contrasts across arm at a specified time. > contrast(tmp, "pairwise") t_months = 0: contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value 2mg - SHAM -0.528 0.389 150 -1.358 0.1766 t_months = 6: contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value 2mg - SHAM -0.820 0.401 150 -2.046 0.0425 t_months = 12: contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value 2mg - SHAM -1.112 0.434 150 -2.559 0.0115 Results are averaged over the levels of: partI_bool, da_bool Degrees-of-freedom method: containment Overall I'm trying to calculate: (2mg at 12 months - 2 mg at 0 months) - (SHAM at 12 months - SHAM at 0 months)
