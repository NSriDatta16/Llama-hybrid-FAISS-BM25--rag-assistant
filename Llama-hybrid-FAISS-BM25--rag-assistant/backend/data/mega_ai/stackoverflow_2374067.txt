Where can I find a graphical designer for linq

I'd like to allow my users to design and create LINQ queries even if they don't know LINQ. So I am thinking about having a "SQL management studio" like window with the list of tables, fields and relationships and let the user drag and drop. I could write it myself but it looks difficult. Is there a better way? Is there a solution somewhere I could use?
