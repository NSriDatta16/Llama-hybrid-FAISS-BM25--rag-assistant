.net would be a good choice for real time system but I think java is pretty much the same. Real time system are kind of different animals from normal software, they are often based on some messaging system and use only memory storage, so they are better handled by low level languages like C++/C. For normal software development (Winform/Web) .NET is well suited for professional applications. So the basic answer, if you are doing messaging application avoid high level languages in other case .NET/Java/PHP/RAIL is fine.
