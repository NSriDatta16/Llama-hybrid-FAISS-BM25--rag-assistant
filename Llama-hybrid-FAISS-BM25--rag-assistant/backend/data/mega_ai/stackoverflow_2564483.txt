Here are two simple tutorials to help you get started with drawing basic animations including touch input: balls bouncing randomly around the screen and basic drag and drop . In brief: You're right, ViewFlipper is really not suited for this. You want to draw on a Canvas by making your own custom View. This is the basic framework for 2D graphics. Canvases let you draw image files, solid colors and other things to the screen, while applying transformations ot them at the same time. Handling the user input (i.e. the finger on the screen) is done via the onTouchEvent(...) method, which lets you do something when the finger touches the screen, moves on the screen or lifts off. Have a play with those two tutorials, they should give you the basics.
