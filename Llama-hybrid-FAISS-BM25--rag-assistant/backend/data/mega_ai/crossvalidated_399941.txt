How do I code interaction terms when I have dummy variables?

I have a dataset from an AB test. It shows the conversion rate per treatment group and the categories within each variant. category group converted green control 0 green control 0 green control 1 blue control 1 blue control 0 purple control 1 purple control 1 yellow control 1 yellow control 0 green treatment 0 green treatment 0 blue treatment 0 blue treatment 1 purple treatment 1 purple treatment 1 yellow treatment 0 yellow treatment 1 I'm putting together a logistic regression to predict the likelihood of conversion as a function of the category + the group. I have about 10K records altogether. I am encoding the category as is_green (0/1), is_blue (0/1), is_yellow(0/1) and is_purple(0/1). I am encoding the group as group(0/1). I would like to see the group, but it also looks like there may be some interaction effect going on. How do I capture the interaction in the logistic model when both variables are encoded?
