You might want to include a link to your previous question on this time series . Given the likely impact of an intervention (specifically, the COVID pandemic, and people's response of staying home, and burglars' likely response to that of not breaking and entering so much), I would be very careful about looking for seasonality on the original data. If at all, regress your data on a dummy variable that is 1 since the pandemic starts, then assess seasonality on residuals from that regression. Your seasonal plot does not really show a lot of signal. Beware of squinting at such plots and convincing yourself that there is something there . Humans are amazingly good at seeing patterns where none exist. This is what a clear seasonal signal looks like. Per above, I would recommend running auto.arima with external regressors. It is quite good in applying statistical tests to decide whether or not to include seasonality.
