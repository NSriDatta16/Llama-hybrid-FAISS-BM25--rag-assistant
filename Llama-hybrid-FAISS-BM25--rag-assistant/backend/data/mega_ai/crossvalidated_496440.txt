Non-normal data transformation - what does it imply exactly and what does my results mean?

I am missing some understanding here. I am inspecting the relationship between the heart rate variability (HRV) and errors in the Sustained Attention to Response Task. When I conduct a basic linear regression with R with the original values I get close to a significant result. When I inspect my qq-plot I realise that the residuals are not normally distributed (picture 1). Then I decided to do a square root transformation to the HRV data and I find the residuals a bit more normal (picture2). Also, I find a significant result. Here I run into a dilemma. Can I justify transformation if the residuals looks a bit "better" and say I have a significant result, which I do not have with the non-transformed data. This feels a bit wrong. Is it? And what does my results mean now when transformed HRV has a significant association with the performance in this test? The HRV is, of course, a somewhat arbitrary number and the participants still stay comparable in that matter even though I do the transformation, but somehow the relationship is changed. And did the transformation made residuals normal enough that I can do linear regression? Cheers!
