extraction information from resume

I have a project in machine learning in which I need to analyze a curriculum vitae. for that I have to write a python program. It uses basic techniques of Natural Language Processing like word parsing,chunking,reg ex parser. If you run the algorithm you can easily capture information like name,email id,address,educational qualification,experience in seconds from a large number of documents. but I have a confusion between two methods LSTM (RNN) and NER? What do you think is the best method?
