Reinforcement (Q) learning: does it learn while in production?

I have a question for which I could not find the answer to it: While training reinforcement learning (using DQN), I get a model for the best reward for the next action. Now, if I deploy this model (i.e., use this model to make predictions), does it keep learning (i.e., updating the Q values)?
