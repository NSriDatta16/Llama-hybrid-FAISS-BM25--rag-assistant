Unix invoke script when file is moved

I have tons of files dumped into a few different folders. I've tried organizing them several times, unfortunatly, there is no organization structure that consistently makes sense for all of them. I finally decided to write myself an application that I can add tags to files with, then the organization can be custom to the actual organizational structure. I want to prevent from getting orphaned data. If I move/rename a file, my tag application should be told about it so it can update the name in the database. I don't want it tagging files that no longer exist, and having to readd tags for files that used to exist. Is there a way I can write a callback that will hook into the mv command so that if I rename or move my files, they will invoke the script, which will notify my app, which can update its database? My app is written in Ruby, but I am willing to play with C if necessary.
