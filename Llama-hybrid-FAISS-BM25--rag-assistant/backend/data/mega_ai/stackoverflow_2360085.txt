Jobs site search engine doubt - Sphinx is the solution?

im developing a web app to manager jobs, curriculum and etc... For example in my case: I have a CV table which contain some information about... and same fields in my table, is a reference to others tables like (Kind of company, kind of job looking for, education, languages the guy knows... a ordinary cv model) My doubt is ... the sphinx is a good search engine? i need to search like: A person, who have X years of experience in YYY area with XXX grade complete ... I dont know other websites out of Brazil... but i guess its a "ordinary job/cv search"... Sphinx can be applied for this purpose? Or build each querys is the best cause i have one or more "select box filters"?? Real tkz to all! Roberto
