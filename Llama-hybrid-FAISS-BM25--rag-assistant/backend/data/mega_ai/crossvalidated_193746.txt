Weights and hinge loss/linear SVM

Say I have a dataset with this distribution Class A: 10 Examples Class B: 100 Examples Class C: 1000 Examples Hence, i am trying to build a classifier using linear SVM. Baring all concerns about accuracy. I would like to understand the effect of weights on SVM. For example i would be giving class A a weight of 1, class B a weight of 0.1 and Class C a weight of 0.01. How does these weights affect the accuracy of the results in the sense how does it affect the output of the hinge loss. Sorry if my question is badly phrased as i am very new to machine learning.
