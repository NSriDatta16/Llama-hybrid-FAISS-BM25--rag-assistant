My MiscUtil library has variable test coverage - some parts are very thoroughly tested, and others were written before I knew about unit testing. If you wanted to learn by writing some tests for the uncovered stuff, you'd be very welcome :) It's a big of a grab-bag of useful bits and pieces - which is handy in some ways, as you can take almost any bit and study it on its own. There's no "overall architecture" to learn.
