3 approaches come to mind, only one allows you to keep your plan on using the AR1 cor structure for these data. I would heavily advise you to generate some variograms for these data to really look at what the time dependent variation in these data is. I'd also like to know how many sites are in this analysis. Use multiple imputation. Technically speaking, measurements that aren't collected at every year are missing data. You can impute these values using some MCMC models for the plant growths, although it introduces a great deal of dependence upon identifying the correct imputation model. Use an exchangeable correlation structure instead. If the variogram does not have a big disparity between the kernel and the nugget, then you see that the time dependent variation is of large influence upon the values. An important thing to remember about specifying correlation structures in GEE versus mixed models: the GEE is always consistent for the marginal mean model. That means that specifying the wrong correlation structure will not give you biased estimates, just inefficient ones (even though they may be different). Model time as a fixed effect. Using some semi-parametric modeling strategies like smoothing splines or fractional polynomials to model time, you can control for time in the same way that random intercepts / indicator variables control for site dependent variation.
