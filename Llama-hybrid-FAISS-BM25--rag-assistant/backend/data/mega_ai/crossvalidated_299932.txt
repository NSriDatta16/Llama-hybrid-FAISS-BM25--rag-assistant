Bayesian inference for parameter estimation

I am new in theBayesian inference domain, so sorry if my questions seem silly. However, I realy need some help in understanding this concept, since reading the same information each time from references is useless. As I understood, that with Bayesian inference one is able to find an "update" estimate of the parametr of model $F(\theta)=y$. Where $\theta$ represents the parameter and $y$ is the output. It is stated that to use Bayesian inference one should have a prior distribution for $\theta$ and "data" . What is meant by data? data for the output after run with $\theta$ ? what if I have only a prior distribution of $\theta$ and a distribution of $y$ derived by $F$ from a sample of the prior distribution of $\theta$ ?
