For example, if we see a lot of students in the first few hours, we can predict that today is probably a holiday and there will be more students arriving in the next hour. Therefore it's wrong to assume that "the number of events occurring in non-overlapping intervals are independent". Even if you have information about the number of students in prior hours, the number of events occurring in subsequent hours can still be independent. The information about the first few hours provides an estimate of the mean underlying rate of the Poisson process, for example if it's a holiday with a high average rate. But unless the students themselves are choosing to come into the bar based on such information, each student is still making an independent choice of whether and when to arrive. It's just that the probability of coming into the bar is high for all students , independently of each other, on that particular day. In practice, there are lots of issues in modeling this type of situation. If students use Google to see how crowded the bar is to decide whether to come, the events clearly aren't independent so a Poisson model would't do. Even with a Poisson process, the underlying rate can change during the course of a day so that there is an inhomogeneous Poisson process. If students typically come in groups, a Poisson model assuming independence won't work. But simply having information about the underlying rate doesn't by itself rule out independent events in a Poisson process.
