Is it correct to compute Bhattacharyya distance for Cauchy like, Bell shaped function?

I have the algorithm (MF (Membership function) ARTMAP Neural network). Output from this algorithm are clusters in n-dimensional feature space. Over each cluster (in n+1 dimension) there is some membership function (Cauchy like - Bell shaped function), that says the membership value of some point to some cluster. Now I want to compute overlap between two clusters. I found the Jeffries-Matusita distance. But JM use Bhattacharyya distance (I am using bhattacharyya.dist() function in R) and the reference to this R function say: Computes Bhattacharyya distance between two multivariate Gaussian distributions. Is it correct to use this Bhattacharyya distance with Cauchy like - Bell shaped function?
