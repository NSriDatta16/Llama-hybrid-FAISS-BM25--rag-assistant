With default options, Prophet detects changepoints by first specifying 25 potential changepoints at which the rate/slope of the trend is allowed to change. They are uniformly placed in the first 80% of the time series. It then puts a sparse prior on the magnitudes of the rate changes, so most of them get shrunk to zero. You can also manually specify the locations of potential changepoints. Slope changes will then be allowed only at these points, with the same sparse regularization as before. This info can be found here , with some guidance on how to set these three parameters.
