I'm posting as an answer since it's too long for a comment. If I understand correctly, you have data coming from, let's say, $N$ multiple sensors $ x_i^{(t)} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N} $ where each sensor is a time series with $T$ data points. You also have a target output variable $y^{(t)} \in \mathbb{R}^T$. You would like to perform a prediction using a linear model and you would like to adjust the subsequence sample size (or sliding window size) for each $x_i$ sensor. One option is to take a larger fixed size sliding window over your time series, $ X^{(t)} \in \mathbb{R}^{W \times N}$ where $W$ is the window size. Then, there are methods that perform regularization for all $x_i$ such as group lasso or group elastic net or ridge regression. The subsequence for a sensor is one group. In effect, this adjusts the $ b_i^{(w)} $ for all $x_i^{(w)}$ giving a specific weight to each one of the subsequence points in your window, effectively adjusting the window size or sample size separately per $x_i$.
