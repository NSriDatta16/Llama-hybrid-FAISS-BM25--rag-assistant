I looked at quite a lot of CMS's and at the end of the day I found this one. GetSimple http://get-simple.info/ Its a really great, tiny CMS that is just a very simple and efficient CMS that is easily modifiable. There is a such a great saying, "With great power comes great responsibility", for me the worst thing that could happen is if you CMS is hacked, goes down and you cannot figure out what software update caused it, I think you are going to stress a lot. Get Simple is very elegant, small and easy to work with. Highly recommended but might not be suitable for everyone.
