Bitmapped graphics are based on sampling the amplitude of light in a 2D space, where each sample is digitized to a given bit depth and often converted to a logarithmic representation at a different bit depth. The samples are always positive, since you can't be darker than pure black. Each of these samples is called a pixel. Sound recording is most often based on sampling the magnitude of sound pressure at a microphone, where the samples are taken at constant time intervals. These samples can be positive or negative with respect to perfect silence. Most often these samples are not converted to a logarithm, even though sound is perceived in a logarithmic fashion just as light is. There is no special term to refer to these samples as there is with pixels . The Bels and Decibels mentioned by others are useful in the context of measuring peak or average sound levels. They are not used to describe the individual sound samples. You might also find it useful to know how sound file formats compare to image file formats. WAVE is an uncompressed format specific to Windows and is analogous to BMP. MP3 is a lossy compression analogous to JPEG. FLAC is a lossless compression analogous to 24-bit PNG.
