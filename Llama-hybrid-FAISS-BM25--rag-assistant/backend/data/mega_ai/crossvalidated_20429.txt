What are the differences between hidden Markov models and neural networks?

I'm just getting my feet wet in statistics so I'm sorry if this question does not make sense. I have used Markov models to predict hidden states (unfair casinos, dice rolls, etc.) and neural networks to study users clicks on a search engine. Both had hidden states that we were trying to figure out using observations. To my understanding they both predict hidden states, so I'm wondering when would one use Markov models over neural networks? Are they just different approaches to similar problems? (I'm interested in learning but I also have another motivation, I have a problem that I'm trying to solve using hidden Markov models but its driving me bonkers so I was interested in seeing if I can switch to using something else.)
