Predict coordinates from input of coordinates

I'm a newbie at data science and I want to ask how can I predict a set of coordinates from a set of input coordinates? That is (x1, y1) -> (x2, y2) . To give a bit of context, I am developing an eye tracker and I trying to map the coordinates of my eye to the coordinates of my gaze. My current implementation uses 2 linear regression models, 1 to predict x values and 1 to predict y values, but I am wondering if it is possible to directly predict both x and y values with 1 model. Would appreciate any help! Thanks!
