Does the smoothing represents the true picture of probability? You are using a Bayesian estimator , that besides data considers a prior, so the estimate is biased. In this sense, it is not “true”. But on another hand, are the observed zero counts true zeros? Are those values really impossible? Likely not, so your empirical probabilities were not “true” as well. Laplace smoothing is a trick for overcoming a specific problem, we accept the bias because helps us to solve the bigger problem of dealing with zeros.
