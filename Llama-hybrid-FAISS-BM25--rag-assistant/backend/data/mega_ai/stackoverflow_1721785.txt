If you have a bunch of examples that have already been categorised, you can use these to train a classifier. This is a very simple document classfication problem, and any suite of machine learning tools will have the algorithms and tutorials for this. For instance, check out weka: http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ or rapidminer: http://rapid-i.com/content/blogcategory/38/69/ If your needs are limited, and you just want a simple API, you cannot go wrong with this Naive Bayes library: https://ci-bayes.dev.java.net/ Good luck!
