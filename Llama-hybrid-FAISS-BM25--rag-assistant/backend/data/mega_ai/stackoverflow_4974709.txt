PCA + SVM using C++ Syntax in OpenCV 2.2

I'm having problems getting PCA and Eigenfaces working using the latest C++ syntax with the Mat and PCA classes. The older C syntax took an array of IplImage* as a parameter to perform its processing and the current API only takes a Mat that is formatted by Column or Row. I took the Row approach using the reshape function to fit my image's matrix to fit in a single row. I eventually want to take this data and then use the SVM algorithm to perform detection, but when I do that all my data is just a stream of 0s. Can someone please help me out? What am I doing wrong? Thanks! I saw this question and it's somewhat related, but I'm not sure what the solution is. This is basically what I have: vector images; //This variable will be loaded with a set of images to perform PCA on. Mat values(images.size(), 1, CV_32SC1); //Values are the corresponding values to each of my images. int nEigens = images.size() - 1; //Number of Eigen Vectors. //Load the images into a Matrix Mat desc_mat(images.size(), images[0].rows * images[0].cols, CV_32FC1); for (int i=0; i
