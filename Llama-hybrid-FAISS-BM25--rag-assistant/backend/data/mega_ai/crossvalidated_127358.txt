There are two ways you can take: (1) just use the sums of scores, (2) use an Item Response Theory (IRT) based method. Using sums of raw scores is very common in social sciences but many psychometricians do not consider it being a sound approach. If you sum up the different questions from the questionnaire you assume that every answer provides you with the same amount of information - and in the real life that is not true. However, your data provides you in information on both the "abilities" of your responders and on precision of your questions, so that you can use both sources of information to gain deeper understanding of both your questionnaire and your responders. This is a pretty wide topic so you can check different resources on this topic, e.g. here , here or in this book . IRT will let you to use your data to obtain information on latent features measured by the questionnaires on continuous $Normal(0, 1)$ scale, so it also makes life easier with further analysis. It is mostly used in the area of educational research, so don't get discouraged that most examples in the books and articles are on measuring student abilities, because the method could be used for analyzing any kind of test or questionnaire data to obtain the latent profiles of the responders. There are many statistical packages for IRT, for example, in R you can use mirt or ltm .
