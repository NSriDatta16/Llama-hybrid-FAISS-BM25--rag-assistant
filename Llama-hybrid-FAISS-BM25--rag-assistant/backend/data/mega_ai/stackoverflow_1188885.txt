Format a string to display the Date correctly

I need help converting this string --> 20090727 10:16:36:643 to --> 07/27/2009 10:16:36 The original date and time are being returned by the SynchronizationAgent.LastUpdated() function, which returns a String in the above format. Original question:preserved for reference I have this --> HUD.LastSyncDate = mergeSubscription.SynchronizationAgent.LastUpdatedTime; Which is setting a property that looks like this --> public static string LastSyncDate { get { return _lastSyncDate; } set { _lastSyncDate = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,"{0:G}", value); } } Unfortunately, with or without the String.Format the date that is displayed looks like this --> 20090727 10:16:36:643 I have tried multiple variations to Format it the way I want. What am I missing? Based on the below suggestions( Mostly Joel's ), I implemented the suggested changes but I am still getting a "String is not a valid DateTime error" I also tried implementing this --> HUD.LastSyncDate = DateTime.ParseExact(mergeSubscription.SynchronizationAgent.LastUpdatedTime,"yyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss:fff",CultureInfo.InvariantCulture); but still nothing.
