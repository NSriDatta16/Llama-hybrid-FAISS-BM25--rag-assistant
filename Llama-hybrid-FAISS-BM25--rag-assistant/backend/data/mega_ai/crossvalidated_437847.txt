Do you want a proportional odds logistic regression model? https://data.library.virginia.edu/fitting-and-interpreting-a-proportional-odds-model/ There are variations on this basic idea which may/may not be a better fit for your data. The response variables are ordinal (1 to 5) and the predictor variables are quantitative (?). I think Agresti wrote the definite book on this https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Categorical+Data+Analysis%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780470463635 , I don't know if you can find a copy of the relevant chapter if that helps? I made a quick sketch as to how I understand it. Your linear predictor for any value of time gives you a random latent variable which is sketched in red (sorry they're not very smooth, very rough sketch). As you can see, the top "latent variable distribution" is to the right of the bottom "latent variable distribution". The location of this latent variable distribution is specified by your linear predictor. The cutpoints are sketched in grey. Each zone delimeted by grey dotted lines corresponds to a different satisfaction score, from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, upwards. From this, you can work out the probability that you get whichever score. So you can assess quality of fit by whether this matches the number of responses in each box. But you can also tell whether overall satisfaction has gone up or down
