You might be able to get something useful out of running CPPCheck which performs static analysis of your code. Treating all errors as warnings will also help identify which variables are unused as your code will not compile until they are resolved. The other thing you could do is create a set of unit tests to cover the expected functionality and run it through a coverage tool (such as gcov if you're using GCC), this will show which lines of code are executed and how many times.
