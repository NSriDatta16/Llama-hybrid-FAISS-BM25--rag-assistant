Peter Kofler has already discussed how you might wish to better organize constants. I'll share how to automate the transition: The eclipse "Inline" refactoring can automatically replace constants by their defintion, saving you from having to hunt down and change each usage manually. So you'd simply change the code to: public class ConstantsA { public static final String CONSTANT1 = "constant.1"; public static final String CONSTANT2 = ConstantsB.CONSTANTFOO; public static final String CONSTANT3 = ConstantsB.CONSTANTBAR; } public class ConstantsB { public static final String CONSTANTFOO = "constant.2"; public static final String CONSTANTBAR = "constant.3"; } ... and then have eclipse inline COONSTANT2 and CONSTANT3 (while all affected projects are checked out, if you can't do that, look into refactoring scripts), and you're done.
