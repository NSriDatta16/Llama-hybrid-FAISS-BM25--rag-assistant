Interdependence between leverages and residuals

According to the following online quote I read online: Itâ€™s worth noting that an observation can have a high absolute value for a standardized residual, yet have a low value for leverage. My thoughts are the following: the leverage has a direct impact on the fitted values of the model. That is, a high leverage is needed when our observed value is far away from the fitted model. That is, the residual is big. So how can there be a big low leverage and a big residual? What am I missing here?
