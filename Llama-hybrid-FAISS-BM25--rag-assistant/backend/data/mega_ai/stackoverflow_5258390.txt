connecting to webservice Using PHP & Soap

ok I'm trying to connect to a webservice which utilizes the OTA XML schema (" http://www.opentravel.org/OTA/2003/05/GetVehAvailRate ") this webservice is hosted at rentcentric.com, which is a hosted solution for taking reservations and bookings online, the system requires a username and password to connect & so far every attempt at connecting has resulted in a blank white page. no error messages no PHP output, Im still fairly new to using SOAP, (although I did have great success when using it on an estate agents site - which didnt require any authentication just a simple value to identify the company on that service) I have read and tried nearly all the examples found on this site & others with no joy! the request made to the service is outlined below, each request has a core set of arguments which are: PickUpDateTime //date ReturnDateTime //date PickUpLocation.locationCode //string ReturnLocation.locationCode //string PromotionCod //string the service url http://www2.rentcentric.com/Ota2007a/OTASrvc.asmx has all the methods available to us. # GetVehAvailRate # VehCancel # VehLocSearch # VehModify # VehRes Request -: GetVehAvailRate *USERNAME* *PASSWORD* ............ code example: $soapClient = new SoapClient("http://www2.rentcentric.com/Ota2007a/OTASrvc.asmx?wsdl"); // Prepare SoapHeader parameters $sh_param = array( 'Username'=>'username', 'Password'=>'password'); $headers = new SoapHeader('http://www2.rentcentric.com/Ota2007a/', 'UserCredentials', $sh_param); // Prepare Soap Client $soapClient->__setSoapHeaders(array($headers)); Im just bangning my head against the wall trying to get something to return, All I need is pointed in the right direction...
