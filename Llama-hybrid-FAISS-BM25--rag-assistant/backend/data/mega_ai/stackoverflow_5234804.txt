One possibility is to subclass your gesture recognizer (if you haven't already) and override -touchesBegan:withEvent: such that it determines whether each touch began in an excluded subview and calls -ignoreTouch:forEvent: for that touch if it did. Obviously, you'll also need to add a property to keep track of the excluded subview, or perhaps better, an array of excluded subviews.
