You allocated storage for your primary structure but not the secondary one. Change q[0]=(R_cidade*)malloc(sizeof(R_cidade)); to: q[0]=(R_cidade*)malloc(sizeof(R_cidade)); q[0]->fre = malloc(sizeof(Radiof)); which will allocate both. Without that, there's a very good chance that fre will point off into never-never land (as in "you can never never tell what's going to happen since it's undefined behaviour).
