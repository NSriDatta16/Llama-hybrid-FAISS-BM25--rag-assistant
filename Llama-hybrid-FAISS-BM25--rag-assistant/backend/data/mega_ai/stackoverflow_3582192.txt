Magento Dropshipping - How to automate catalog updates?

I am new to Magento and impressed by the MVC framework that powers it, making module development a well thought out solution. I am strong CakePHP developer. I am working on a project that uses a dropshipper for the physical products. As a result, every day at 4am a feed needs to be parsed and the products / categories modified, plus stock information. A CRON will be setup to do this. Additional requirements are: Upon a sucessful order, the system must upload a CSV feed to the Dropshipper via FTP with the order details for distribution. Realtime stock checks, either every hour by CRON or a lookup on the product page I can think of 2 approaches: Write everything natively into Magento. As a newbie, this is going to be a big learning curve, but it is the right solution? Write a simple CakePHP app that runs as a shell. This will use the Magento API to manage all dropshipper processes. This solution will be easier to rollout but introduces an additional system to support. Does anyone have an advice relating to dropshipping in Magento?
