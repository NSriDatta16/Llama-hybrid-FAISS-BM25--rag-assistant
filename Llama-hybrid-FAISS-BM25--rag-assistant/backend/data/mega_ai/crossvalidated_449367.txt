I would suggest to fit different distributions on your observations, and to perform model selection to find the distribution that fits your observations the best. Exponential and Pareto distributions seem to be the best candidates given your hypotheses (positivity, monotone decrease). Once you have fitted these candidates distributions, model selection criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) will give you a quantitative score for each model. The following paper will propose rules on how to interpret the evidences for the different models based on the BIC : Kass, Robert E., and Adrian E. Raftery. "Bayes factors." Journal of the american statistical association 90.430 (1995): 773-795. You may also want to have a look at this paper which deals with model inference of long-tailed distributions : Okada, Makoto, Kenji Yamanishi, and Naoki Masuda. "Long-tailed distributions of inter-event times as mixtures of exponential distributions." arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.00699 (2019).
