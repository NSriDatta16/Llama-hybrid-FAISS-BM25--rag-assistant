Using theme functions in custom module

This is a pretty specific issue which may not have an elegant answer. I want to share a menu across two sites one Drupal and one not. I'm using a custom module to implement hook_menu_link_alter and want to output a themed menu to a file. There's no discussion on this point, we need to just expose an html file for the other site. I know a brute force way to do this by just looping through and just re-creating what the theming function already does, but I thought maybe there was a way to actually use the theming function directly. Right now I'm trying... theme('links', theme('navigation-links', 'menu-name'), array('id' => 'menu-id')); but am receiving no output. I'm also receiving no errors, which is a bummer. (Note: I'm not 100% that the theming function for navigation-links is actually theme('navigation-links'')). Any ideas? (Note: I alos posted this question over at the new Drupal StackExchange site but may remove it as the community isn't there yet)
