What undergraduate degree should I take to get into data science?

I'm going to do an undergraduate degree next year. Data Science major is there but I was wondering if a statistics major with a minor in data science would be more valuable? Which degree would be more in demand? I am also planning on doing as many internships as possible to gain practical skills and experience. I am also contemplating the value of a masters degree, and whether it is worth the time and money, or if an undergrad+internships will suffice. I already know Python and I will learn R and SQL as well. Whether this is in university or otherwise (or both). I will want to specialise in data analysis using statistical analysis paired with artificial intelligence. EDIT : I’m in Australia and looking to go to the University of Melbourne (I’m pretty sure its #1 in Australia for computer science and math/statistics)
