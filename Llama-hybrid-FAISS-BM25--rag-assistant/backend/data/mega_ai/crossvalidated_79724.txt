If you're talking in terms of reproducing the same answers, then the answer is yes. The INLA (google "inla bayesian") computational method for bayesian GLMMs combined with a uniform prior for the fixed effects and variance parameters, basically reproduces the EBLUP/EBLUE outputs under the "simple plug in" gaussian approximation, where the variance parameters are estimated via REML.
