We do it by just updating the ID (more or less; we use presentation models instead of binding our views directly to entities, but you get the idea...): SomeEntity.SomeOtherEntityReference.EntityKey = new EntityKey("MyEntities.SomeOtherEntities", "Id", presentationModel.SomeOtherEntityId); EF 4 makes this more elegant, yes, but you can certainly do it in EF 1, as well.
