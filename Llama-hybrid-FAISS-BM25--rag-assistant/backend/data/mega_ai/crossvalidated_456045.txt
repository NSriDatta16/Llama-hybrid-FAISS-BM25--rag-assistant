Minimising Posterior expected loss

I am new to Bayesian statistics. I am not sure how I could find the best point estimator $T(x)$ for $\alpha$ that minimises the posterior expected loss, $$E_{\alpha|x} [L(\alpha, T(x)))] = \int L(\alpha, T(x)) p(\alpha|x) d\alpha$$ . Assuming we have zero-one loss. Thanks to anyone who may be able to help.
