what kind of Recurrent Neural Network should I use to model solar irradiance data?

I am trying to model solar irradiance data. I have data per minute for like 6 months. Naturally during the night solar irradiance = 0 and over the day it creases and then drecreases. I have many data about 400,000 observations. The main problem is what kind of architecture and type of Neural Network should I use? I would like to predict 1 day in advance what the next day is going to be like. A day is 1440 observation (60 * 24). I am using keras, on python. Any ideas/ input on how to approach this problem? Hereby a graph of the data.
