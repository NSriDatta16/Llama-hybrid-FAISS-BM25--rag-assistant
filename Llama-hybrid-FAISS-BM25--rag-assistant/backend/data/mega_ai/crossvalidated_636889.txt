Filter_values Argument - Topological Data Analysis in R

I've recently been trying to use some TDA (topological data analysis) in R, yet one limitation I have found is in the selection of the "filter_values" argument. My understanding is that they typically use the range of X-axis (or Y-axis) for the "filter_values" argument, but I've had no success. Here is a published example: devtools::install_github("paultpearson/TDAmapper") devtools::install_github("christophergandrud/networkD3") library(TDAmapper) library(igraph) #DATA n_x However, I wondered if someone could help me select the filter_values argument conceptually on something like the trial data expressed below? Therefore, as highlight by @Whuber. My concern is conceptual. Generalisable rules of thumb for the selection of filter_values in TDA that may be applicable in the toy data set below. The toy data set has range of the data is 1:3 (and much more characteristic of my own data). Would be greatly appreciated. x1 = rep(1:3, times = 100) x2 = rep(1:3, times = 100) x3 = rep(1:3, times = 100) x4 = rep(1:3, times = 100) x5 = rep(1:3, times = 100) DAT Many thanks.
