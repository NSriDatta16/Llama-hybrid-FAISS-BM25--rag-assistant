If you are familiar with XPath , that is an option. I don't know if it would give you better performance compared to a parser. For parsers, I would recommend going with the SAX parser. It is usually pretty easy to work with. If you extend the DefaultHandler , there are a bunch of functions which you can override and leverage for your purposes. Some include: void startElement() - called for each start tag, function call also passes in attributes as an argument void characters() - called for the content within a tag void endElement() - called for each end/closing tag See the API reference for additional details.
