How do I simulate multivariate non-normal time series data from existing dataset in r?

Iâ€™m trying to simulate data from an existing non-multivariate normal time series. The parameters: I need to simulate both continuous and binary variables I want the simulated data to have the same distributional properties (mean, sd, skew, kurtosis) and covariance structure as the existing data set I want the simulated data to be on the same scale as the original data set I want to be able to simulate a greater number of observations that what exist in the original data set The existing data set is ~100 observations of 18 variables (1 binary,17 continuous 0-100 scale) assessed 8 times per day for 15 days. Most approaches I've tried in r either require the assumption of multivariate normality (which these data violate) or cannot handle binary variables. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
