Open a workspace and type: | window canvas circle | window := SystemWindow new. canvas := PasteUpMorph new. window addMorphBack: canvas. canvas bounds: window bounds. circle := CircleMorph new. canvas addMorphCentered: circle. window openAsIs. This will create a circle on your desktop that you can drag and drop. Browse the CircleMorph class to find other things you can do. Also, check out the Documentation section at www.squeak.org . There's a lot of good tutorials there.
