Reporting statistical significance for voluntary sample

I’m working with a dataset (n=300) that is based on a voluntary sample, the respondents invited their self’s in (applied on a job and completed a survey). I want to analyze my data with a logistic regression. Does it makes sense to report the ‘significance’ alongside the coefficients? Is there any peer reviewed work (book, paper) available that handles this kind of question?
