When learning a new technology rich tooling gets you into things without big headaches. At this point the community at ops4j.org provides a rich toolset called "PAX" which includes: Pax Runner : Run and switch between Felix, Equinox, Knopflerfish and Concierge easily Pax Construct : Construct, Organize & Build OSGi projects with maven easily Pax Drone : Test your OSGi bundles with Junit while being framework independent (uses PaxRunner) Then there are many implementations of OSGi compendium services: Pax Logging (logging), Pax Web (http service), Pax Web Extender (war support), Pax Coin (configuration), Pax Shell (shell implementation, part of the next osgi release) and much more. .. and there is a helpful, framework independend community, - but thats now advertisement ;-)
