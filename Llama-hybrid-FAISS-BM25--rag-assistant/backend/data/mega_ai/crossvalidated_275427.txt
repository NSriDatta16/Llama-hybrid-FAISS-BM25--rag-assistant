Very low beta coefficients, but cannot understand why

I am running a logistic regression of marital status on age, age^2, religion importance, gender, race, education level, income, hours worked and residence area, using data from NLS. After doing all the work of data cleaning I am running a logistic regression and even after converting the log odds into odds I get very small coefficients. Is there any way to rescue the model? Maybe drop some variables, although all of them seem important. I am not quite sure of the reason, but I assume that this is mainly due to the many categorical variables that I have, only age income and hours worked are continuous. I cannot really think of any reason to convincingly argue about the low values of the coefficients. None of them are significant as well.
