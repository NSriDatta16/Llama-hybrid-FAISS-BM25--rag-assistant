Bayesians and Frequentists think probabilities represent different things. Frequentists think they're related to frequencies and only make sense in contexts where frequencies are possible. Bayesians view them as ways to represent uncertainty. Since any fact can be uncertain, you can talk about the probability of anything. The mathematical consequence is that Frequentists think the basic equations of probability only sometimes apply, and Bayesians think they always apply. So they view the same equations as correct, but differ on how general they are. This has the following practical consequences: (1) Bayesians will derive their methods from the basic equations of probability theory (of which Bayes Theorem is just one example), while Frequentists invent one intuitive ad-hoc approach after another to solve each problem. (2) There are theorems indicating that if you reason from incomplete information you had better use the basic equations of probability theory consistently, or you'll be in trouble. Lots of people have doubts about how meaningful such theorems are, yet this is what we see in practice. For example, it's possible for real world innocent looking 95% Confidence Intervals to consist entirely of values which are provably impossible (from the same info used to derive the Confidence Interval). In other words, Frequentist methods can contradict simple deductive logic. Bayesian methods derived entirely from the basic equations of probability theory don't have this problem. (3) Bayesian is strictly more general than Frequentist. Since there can be uncertainty about any fact, any fact can be assigned a probability. In particular, if the facts you're working on is related to real world frequencies (either as something you're predicting or part of the data) then Bayesian methods can consider and use them just as they would any other real world fact. Consequently any problem Frequentist feel their methods apply to Bayesians can also work naturally. The reverse however is often not true unless Frequentists invent subterfuges to interpret their probability as a "frequency" such as, for example, imagining the multiple universes, or inventing hypothetical repetitions out to infinity which are never performed and often couldn't be in principle.
