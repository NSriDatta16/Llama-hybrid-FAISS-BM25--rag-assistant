Sharepoint custom personalization

I am creating sharepoint custom solution that will show number of drop down in page. The drop down data is shared in may pages. I want to persist selected values of the user such that when ever he visit that page or any other page that have same drop down, he should be able to see is saved value pre selected in drop down. To implement this I have a number of options. Please suggest the best for SharePoint 1)Sharepoint User profiles 2)Sharepoint list 3) Cookie 4) Isolated storage? Options 3 and 4 here are clientside. But I am looking for any other way that SharePoint provides to save user preferences/personalization information. Which one is the correct way of doing that in SharePoint? Thanks
