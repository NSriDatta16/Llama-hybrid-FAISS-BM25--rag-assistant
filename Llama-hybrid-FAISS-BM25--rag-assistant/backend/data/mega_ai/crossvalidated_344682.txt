How to create a wave-net-like CNN?

I would like to create a CNN in a similar way to WaveNet architecture. i.e. on the first layer it takes convolves 3x3 areas. In the next layer it also convolves 9 pixels but spaced out like this: x x x ..... x.x.x ..... x.x.x And so on with the next layer spacing them out even more. Thereby not needing the max-pooling layers. The idea is that it has a similar structure to Wavenet but in 2D and you would end up with the same number of neurons in each layer. Then the output should be a map of the image with different colours for each object in the image such as a cat, a dog or a tree. Is there a straightforward way to do this in Tensorflow. Or has this already been implemented perhaps?
