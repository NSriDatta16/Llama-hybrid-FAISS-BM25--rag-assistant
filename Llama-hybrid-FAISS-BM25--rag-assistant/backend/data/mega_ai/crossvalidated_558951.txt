I will answer this question in theoretical perspective. I think you should include legitimate outliers in your statistical model. I want to share my one experience with you for my undergrad project I was building a machine learning model that could predict revenue of a private bank and transaction density at first, I intentionally removed all the outliers from my statistical modelling. But when we tried to run the model on real time data of the bank after some months the model was underperforming then second wave of COVID came and the transaction became very less than normal. So, our model gets out of the production as it couldn't understand what was going on. My professor said we can easily predict upcoming revenue using statistics but what a ML model should do is to predict anomaly in the system which is coming for this, we need some outliers to prepare our model for whatever hard situation ahead. What I am trying to say including outliers at some degree can really help your model to be robust and handle some hard truth.
