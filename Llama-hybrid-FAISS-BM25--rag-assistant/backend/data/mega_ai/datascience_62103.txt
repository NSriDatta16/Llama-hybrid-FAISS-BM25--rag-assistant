Intuition behind PCA eigenvectors

For undergraduate students who understand the definition of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, $$A v = \lambda v \;,$$ what is the intuition behind why the eigenvectors of the covariance (or correlation) matrix correspond to the axes of maximal stretching? Why specifically does that matrix lead to (e.g.) the largest eigenvector corresponding to the direction of maximal spread in the data?
