Objective measures in Factor Analysis

I am considering developing a questionnaire (to be validated) whose scales could include both self-reported subjective measures and objective measurements. Does it make sense to use factor analysis to examine both subjective and objective measurements for a questionnaire? Most example papers I have found focus on identifying the most relevant (subjective) factors in questionnaires. Others make references to the potential inclusion of objective measures, but I have not been able to find a definitive answer. This questionnaire (or checklist) would be an attempt to assess the "equivalency" between two artefacts. It would include subjective measures (say, from 1 to 7, how visually similar they appear to you) and objective (if you use them both to perform the same task, what's the average time difference on n repetitions?). Does this make sense, or would it be better to focus only on subjective measures?
