As mentioned in comments, cross-entropy is used as the loss function. Cross-entropy (the negative Bernoulli log-likelihood) is known for this blurry aspect. The use of the Continuous Bernoulli (or other distributions, such as Beta) log-likelihood might ameliorate the issue. See The continuous Bernoulli: fixing a pervasive error in variational autoencoders .
