Dear Dimitris and Jeffrey, Thank you all for your comments. I just realized now that the comparison between standard and joint survival models cannot be done in the way I described above. The main reason for this is that for each value s, the joint model provides a prediction rule P(s) = (T > t + s | T > s) which depends on the history of the markers up to s. In my example I was, unintentionally, creating a composite prediction rule P = (P(s_1), P(s_2), ...., P(s_n)) where n is the number of subjects in the validation set and I was comparing the predictive ability of this composite prediction rule P to the one of the standard survival model. Saying that, I still believe that it is very important to show, from a real validation data sets, that predictions made from joint models are better than those made from standard survival models. I came across a paper published in statistics in medicine (2018) mentioning another paper published in the same journal in 2016 where apparently this issue was addressed. They said: "In terms of survival predictions, Yang et al. have recently found increased predictive performance for a variety of joint models compared with baseline‐only and time‐dependent Cox models". I looked at the original paper of Yang et al (2016) but I didn't quite understand how they did it (it wasn't explained). The paper can be accessed here (see page 10, paragraph starting with For JM1 and JM2 models). All the best Abderrahim
