local storage and session storage

I'm taking my first step of a thousand miles with the new local storage and session storage found in html5. http://www.w3.org/TR/offline-webapps/ Q: Is there a code example of using either session storage or local storage, where the user enters a value, the value is saved locally, the user then connects to the Internet on his 56K modem and the local storage is synced with a server?
