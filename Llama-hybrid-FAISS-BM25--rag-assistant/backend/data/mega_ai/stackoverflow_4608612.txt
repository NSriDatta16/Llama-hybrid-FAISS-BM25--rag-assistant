You might be lucky by getting the context classloader and try to get its URL[]s - then streaming over the content. I don't think this would be a good idea, either. Java is not built around reflecting content this way. But what is provided is, maybe less elegant, the possibility of reading meta data files, for example with Thread.getContextClassLoader().getResources("META-INF/plugins.txt") where you can define the to be instantiated classes. Or, even more streamlined, use ServiceLoader. Depending on your claspath and jars, this is faster anyway than eager loading each and every class around...
