XGboost and regularization

Does the XGBClassifier method utilizes the two regularization terms reg_alpha and reg_lambda , or are they redundant and only utilized in the regression method (i.e., XGBRegressor )? I think that some hyperparameters in XGBoost could have no effect on specific methods (e.g., scale_pos_weight in XGBRegressor ).
