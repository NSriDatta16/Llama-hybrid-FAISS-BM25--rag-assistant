This is way too big a subject to cover adequately in an answer here. You almost certainly need to read a book (I recommend Jeffrey Richter's books for this kind of subject matter). The 4 Gb is about address space. The 756 Mb is about backing store. Quite a few things (especially the contents of executable files) use address space without using backing storage. When you execute a program, the executable file for that program (and all the DLLs it uses) are mapped to address space. Then, on a page-by-page basis, pieces of that executable are brought into physical memory as needed. The 756 Mb is extra storage to "extend" the RAM space -- but this is normally used only for data , not code; code is already stored in the executable file, so the system reads the data directly from the executable file when it's needed. The 756 Mb is used primarily for data you've created or modified as the computer is running (though the definition of "modified/created" can be fuzzy -- for example, the contents of a web page you've loaded would be included because you caused it to come into memory, even though you didn't create it or change it at all).
