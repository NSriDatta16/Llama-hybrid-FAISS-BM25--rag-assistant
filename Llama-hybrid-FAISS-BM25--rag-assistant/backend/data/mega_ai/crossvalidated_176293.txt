Normalization of a data with skewed distibution

I have a data set which has 10 features (columns). I want to normalize the data before dealing it with deep learning. Each column has a different distribution but overall they are all skewed! 1) which normalization method should i use? 2) can I use different normalization methods on different columns or should it be the same for all ?
