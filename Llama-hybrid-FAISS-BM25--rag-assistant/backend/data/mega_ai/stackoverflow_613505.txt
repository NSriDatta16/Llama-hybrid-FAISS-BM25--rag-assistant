I found this one recently. I haven't tried it out, so am not sure if it works. Could you give more info on the tool you're trying to develop? I downloaded this grammar because I'm working on an instrumentation tool so I can add coverage info for my unit test framework . After re-reading your comment... I think this tool exactly fit your needs.
