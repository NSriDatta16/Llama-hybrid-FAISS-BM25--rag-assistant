Don't ever do, FROM (SELECT * FROM table) , just do FROM table , same goes with the LEFT JOIN . What you wrote is just an overly verbose SELECT animal_name FROM animals LEFT JOIN owners_animals USING ( animal_id ) WHERE owner_id IS NULL; With that said, I often like the NOT EXISTS() option, because it keeps the owner_id IS NULL fragment out. USING (foo) is the same as foo = foo , on the joined tables, except only one of them will be in the result set.
