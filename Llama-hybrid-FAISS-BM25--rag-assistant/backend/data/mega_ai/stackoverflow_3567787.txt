I don't have a fix, but here are some debugging techniques for OOMs in Matlab that seem germane. Pack doesn't work nearly as well as its doco says it does. If memory is fragmented at a low level (not uncommon), you must restart Matlab to fix it. "Memory" and "feature memstats" will give some indication of low level fragmentation. Try restarting and running from a fresh Matlab session to see if it's fragmentation, or it's really peak memory usage. Try a "dbstop if all error" so you break in to the debugger when you run out of memory. Then you can examine the stack frames with dbup and dbdown to see what's holding down memory, and see if there are any surprisingly large arrays. OOMs are sometimes from miscomputed indexes or array sizes that end up allocating extra-big arrays. The undocumented "profile on -memory" option can tell you about memory usage during execution, which may help. And your data set might just be too big. See if you can break it in to smaller parts and loop over them, reducing peak memory requirements. Good luck.
