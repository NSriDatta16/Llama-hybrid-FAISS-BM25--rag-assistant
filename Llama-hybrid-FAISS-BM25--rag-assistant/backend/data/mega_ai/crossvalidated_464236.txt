I am not sure whether there is a specific description for this problem, but one analogous way to view your problem is as an adjacency matrix where the entries are 0 or 1 depending on the overlap (you can view it as a graph with edges/neighbors depending on the overlap). $$\begin{array}{cccccccc} & [3-9] & [5-12] & [1-4] & [6-17] & [4-5] &\\ \begin{array}{} [3-9] \\ [5-12] \\ [1-4] \\ [6-17] \\ [4-5] \end{array} \begin{array}{} \left( \vphantom{\begin{array}{} [3-9] \\ [5-12] \\ [1-4] \\ [6-17] \\ [4-5] \end{array}} \right. \end{array} & \begin{array}{} - \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array} & \begin{array}{} 1 \\ - \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array} & \begin{array}{} 1 \\ 0 \\ - \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} & \begin{array}{} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ - \\ 0 \end{array} & \begin{array}{} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ - \end{array}& \begin{array}{} \left. \vphantom{\begin{array}{} [3-9] \\ [5-12] \\ [1-4] \\ [6-17] \\ [4-5] \end{array}} \right) \end{array} \end{array}$$ And then you are interested in the average degree of the nodes (or you can look into more detail, for instance the distribution of the degree of the nodes ). Here the nodes [3-9], [5-12], [1-4], [6-17], [4-5] have respectively degree 4,2,1,2,1 and the mean degree is 2. The maximum possible degree is 4. And the ratio of the average degree with the maximum possible degree is 0.5 (you had counted one too many, "[1-4]... overlaps [4-5]")
