I am thoroughly against it. One of the biggest reasons is the first reason earino stated - it lives in one place. You can not integrate it into source control very easily. It is next to impossible to have two devs working on a stored proc at the same time. My other main complaint is that SQL is just not very good at representing complex logic. You have no concept of scope, code tends to be copy-pasted because there is a less ability to reuse code (as opposed to an OO language). You have to give developers access to the database to develop there. In many organizations I have worked at the data people are in a different world than the devs, with different permissions, etc. Keeping the devs out of the database in these cases would be harder.
