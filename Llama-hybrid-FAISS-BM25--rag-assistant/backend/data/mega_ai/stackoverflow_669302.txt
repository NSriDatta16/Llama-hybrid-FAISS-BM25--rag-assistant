The ideal background filesystem backup

I am thinking about a script/program that can run in background, and attempt to backup or synchronize a given filesystem path to a mirror location (probably located on an external/separate storage device). This should apply to Windows but it could as well be used under Linux. Differential/incremental backups are a bonus. Windows System State backups are a bonus too. Keeping the origin free of meta-data is essential. (unlike version control) Searching by file or activity date could be interesting (like version control) Backup repositories should be easy to browse and take little space. Deleted files should be available for recovery for a period of time. Windows Backup is tedious and bloated and limited. Tar-gzipping is not accessible. User interaction during backup should be nonexistent.
