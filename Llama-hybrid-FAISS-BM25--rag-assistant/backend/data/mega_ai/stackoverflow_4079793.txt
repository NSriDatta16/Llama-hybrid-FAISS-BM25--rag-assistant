you should write a test for every execution path. For example, if you have if (cond1 || cond2) {....} you should test for cond1 and cond2. Separate test methods are fine and encouraged, if it makes sense. Its ok to have testMyMethodCond1(){...} and testMyMethodCond2(){...} and whatever else you need. Also, when you say your method has 'many internal conditions', maybe you want to refactor your code so some of those conditions are handled in other, smaller methods, that are easier to test.
