I am not quite sure what you actually plan to classify using that approach. If you use the weights themselves as input to another classifier then you would classify the layer that uses these weights?! I presume you plan to use the output of the last (or some intermediate) layer of your network in another classifier. In that case you simply pass your testing data through the network, observe the output at the layer you are interested in (i.e. just compute the forward pass) and pass those along to the random forest (or any other classifier) for scoring. This process will not be optimal in the sense of some loss function, though, as you do not perform end-to-end learning (i.e. you do not pass the random forest's loss along down the neural network). If this is not what you intended then please clarify ;)
