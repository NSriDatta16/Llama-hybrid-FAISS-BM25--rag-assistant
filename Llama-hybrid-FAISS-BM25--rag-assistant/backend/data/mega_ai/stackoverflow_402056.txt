Should I do more JavaSE before jumping to JavaEE?

I'm almost finished with the book "Head First Java". The reason I'm studying this is I'm hoping to get a job developing with JavaEE someday. Now I'm thinking, should I go ahead and study EE (moving on to Head First Servlets and JSP) or should I spend more time with SE? Would it help? I'll go on and say directly that I want to learn EE in the quickest yet the most optimum time needed (a balanced ind of way). Any advice? Thanks in advance!
