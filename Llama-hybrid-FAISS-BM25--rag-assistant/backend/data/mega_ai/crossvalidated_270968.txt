How to interpret glm() result that include factor type in R

I'm using glm() function to get result of logistic regression. But i can't interpret the result. In my data, there are nominal variables and target variable is categorical variable. I know that I can use independent variable that is factor type. I implemented and this is my result. > glmresult glmresult Call: glm(formula = Creditability ~ ., family = "binomial", data = ccc) Coefficients: (Intercept) Account.Balance2 Account.Balance3 -0.64926 0.37831 0.96295 Account.Balance4 Duration.of.Credit..month. Payment.Status.of.Previous.Credit1 1.75194 -0.02833 -0.18516 Payment.Status.of.Previous.Credit2 Payment.Status.of.Previous.Credit3 Payment.Status.of.Previous.Credit4 0.60384 0.97353 1.51219 As you can see, there are same variables like Account.Balance1,2,3~~. It is a factor type data set. I realized that if i use factor type, the result is posted like above table. How can I interpret the result?
