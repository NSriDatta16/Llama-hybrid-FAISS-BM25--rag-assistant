The question asks about the relationship between hourly mortality and exponential distribution of lifespans. The universe divides time into short ticks. For each bee a die is rolled. The die has many sides, most of them blank--but one is black. Death comes for the bee whenever the black side shows. We are about to simulate this with the computer, but being lazy I don't want to slice time as finely as Death does. So instead of rolling a die every second, say, maybe I will roll a die every hour: but I will make it 3600 times more likely to show its black side to make up for the paucity of rolls. Because the chance of death in one second or even one hour is so small, this is a good approximation. To exploit the computer's ability to do a lot of calculations with arrays at once, I will simulate an entire hive one bee at a time. Let the die roll again and again, once per hour, until the bee dies. Then continue with a newly born (reincarnated?) bee, repeating until many bees are born and die. The results will be the same as if all the bees had coexisted. Here is R code. Its input is the array of bee lifetimes, bees , used to estimate the exponential rate. set.seed(17) # (Allows reproducible results) n Here is the first part of the deaths array, showing the results of the beginning die rolls (with "*" denoting the black face): paste(ifelse(head(deaths, 100),"*", "."), collapse="") ...........* ......................................................* ..............* .................. The first few times at which the black face appeared on the die: head(times) 12 67 82 120 134 147 Thus the first bee was felled at the 12th tick (so I count its lifetime as just 11 ticks), the second one at the 67th tick (for a lifetime of 54 ticks), and so on: these are the positions of the stars in the previous output. The figures plot these deaths (each is a vertical slash on the left, showing each lifetime as a horizontal gap between slashes) and the distribution of the lifetimes (on the right). The latter has an exponential distribution function superimposed. It's an excellent fit. The code to plot the histogram is hist(lifetimes, freq=FALSE, ylim=c(0, rate.hat), breaks=25, xlab="Hours") curve(dexp(x, rate=rate.hat), col="Red", add=TRUE) Why is the histogram exponential? Because on average the number of bees alive after a certain age is reduced by the same fraction during the next time slice. That means the histogram has to decrease exponentially. By the way, the reason why 1/mean(bees) is the maximum likelihood estimator is that the exponential probability distribution function is of the form $\kappa \exp(-\kappa t)$ for lifetimes $t$. To understand this, recall that a PDF is a density : it gives us probability per unit time. Since $t$ is time (in hours), $\kappa$ must be a probability (of death) per unit time: it's the rate. Its logarithm equals $\log(\kappa) - \kappa t$. Therefore the log likelihood for a dataset of lifetimes $(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n)$ is $$\log(L(\kappa)) = n \log(\kappa) - \sum_{i=1}^n \kappa\, t_i.$$ Calculus shows us (by taking the derivative with respect to $\kappa$ and setting that to zero) that $$\hat\kappa = \frac{n}{\sum_{i=1}^n t_i}$$ is the only critical point (and obviously is where the likelihood is maximized). This is the reciprocal of the mean lifetime. That is how hourly mortality fits in with the maximum likelihood machinery.
