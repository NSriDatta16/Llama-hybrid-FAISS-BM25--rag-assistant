How do I use TortoiseSVN for this? It doesn't work

svn co svn+ssh://174.13.24.17/home/svn/dragon-repos/ That's how I check out on my linux box. I would like to checkout on my Windows machine. But, Tortoise SVN asks me for the "URL" (I don't have a URL ...I just do it like that, above) Can't I just run the command line to check out, like that?
