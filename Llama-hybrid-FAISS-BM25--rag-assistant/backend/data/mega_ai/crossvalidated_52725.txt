You definitely wan't to do some kind of clustering, but there are so many algorithms now a days, it's hard to suggest one without knowing more about the data (what types of variables and number of records, for example). Can you give some more information? Such as more about the data structure, or what kind of patterns you are looking for (maybe an example of how scores can be similar but one high and one low; do you mean similar variance?) I don't think PCA is a good choice, as it only finds linear relationships(which you specifically mentioned you aren't looking for), and doesn't deal well with multicollinearity if it is present. It seems like the question asker is looking for a more robust method than using the eigenvalues of a correlation/covariance matrix.
