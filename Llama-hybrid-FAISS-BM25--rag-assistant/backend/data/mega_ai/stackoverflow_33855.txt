Ultimately I want my data stored in some reasonable format. If that data started as XML and I want to retrieve it/them using XQuery, without the XML layer, I have to write a lot of code to do the XQuery by myself, and perhaps even worse to know my XML well enough to be able to have a reasonable storage system for it. Conversely, so long as the performance of the system allows, I can forget about that part of the back end, and just worry about my XML document and up (i.e. to the user) level and leave the rest as a black box. It gives me the B-DB storage goodness, but I get to use it from a document-centric perspective.
