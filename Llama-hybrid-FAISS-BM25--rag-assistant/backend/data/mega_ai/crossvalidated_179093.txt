Would it not work to do a 2x2 chi-square test for each indicator? That would test for independence between group membership and a "yes" or "no" on implementation of the indicator. If your result from the chi-square was significant, you would reject the null hypothesis that group membership and indicator are independent. I am open to being corrected, but as far as I am aware, that would be an acceptable way to do it. As another point, relating to your sub-question about whether using averages of the three years is appropriate. I think that may be problematic because you are using time-series data but are not accounting for the temporal relationship in any way. As an alternative, you could use a cumulative measure: i.e. instead of looking at the average of yes/no through the three years, you could take the percentage of companies for which the answer was "yes" in at least one year. That would allow you to side-step the temporal angle in a way that I believe would still be justifiable.
