A logistic regression model with either logit or probit link function would be the best choice for you. You include all your possible predictive variables for classification in the model as regressor variables, as long as they are not highly correlated with each other. The explained variable is the dichotomous rock type 1 or 2. From the estimated model you obtain a prediction which is rock type 1 or 2. The predicted rock type is then compared to the original rock type of each sample and you obtain the false positive, true postive, false negative and true negative rate of your prediction. In the model you can select variables based on underlying tests or by AIC or BIC based model selection methods. The choice of what is "positive" and "negative" is arbitrary and depends on what you wish to declare as positive or negative. Rename it as "True 1s", "True 2s", "False 1s" and "False 2s" instead. "True 1s" are when you predicted type 1 and the original rock also was type 1. "False 1s" are when you predicted type 1, but the original rock was type 2. For a formal estimation how well your model works these rates are compared in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve which is a measure of quality for your whole model and its predictive value.
