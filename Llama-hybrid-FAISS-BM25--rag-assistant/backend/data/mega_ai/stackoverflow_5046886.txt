For the web service call, the HTTP response payload will contain a SOAP envelope encapsulating the application response. Basically the whole HTTP response is XML, the SOAP part and the application data. So you only need get the child of body to have the xml fragment that encapsulates the application data for your service and work on this. There can be only 1 child element of body per WS-Profile BP specification. Hopefully this helps
