It's actually pretty tricky to reorganize directory structures, and it's neither a Tortoise nor an Ankh issue, it's just a Subversion issue. The problem is that SVN understands add/delete but not "move" or "rename". So you have a folder with the same hidden .svn metadata inside it, but now moved to a different place, and this confuses SVN. UPDATE: See antik's solution, it's better than messing about with the metadata by hand.
