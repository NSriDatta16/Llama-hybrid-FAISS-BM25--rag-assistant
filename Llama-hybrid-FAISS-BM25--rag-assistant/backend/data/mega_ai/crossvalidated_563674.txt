PCA & LDA in dimension reduction

I have a dataset split into training and testing dataset. Then I preprocess the training data using scaling, PCA and LDA. As I recalled, I have to use the centre and standard deviation I get from training data on the testing data. Is it the same too for PCA and LDA? (i.e use the transformation matrix of PCA and LDA from training data?)
