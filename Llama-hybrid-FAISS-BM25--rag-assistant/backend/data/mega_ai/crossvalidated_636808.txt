If you have a single item as your dependent variable, then a good place to start would be ordinal logistic regression with that item as your DV and the other variables as IVs. If you have multiple Likert items and are adding them up (or combining them some other way) then please amend your answer. I see you put the likert tag. You could also browse the items under that tag.
