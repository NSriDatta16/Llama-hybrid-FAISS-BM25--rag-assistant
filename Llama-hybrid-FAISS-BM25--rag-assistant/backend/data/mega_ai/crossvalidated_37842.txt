I understand some of your questions but others are not clear. Let me answer and state some facts and maybe that will clear up all of your confusion. The fit you have is remarkably good. The confidence intervals should be very tight. There are two types of confidence regions that can be considered. The simultaneous region is intended to cover the entire true regression function with the given confidence level. The others which are what you are looking at are the confidence intervals for the fitted regression points. They are only intended to cover the fitted value of y at the given value(s) of the covariate(s). They are not intended to cover y values at other values of the covariates. In fact, if the intervals are very tight as they should be in your case they will not cover many if any of the data points as you get away from the fixed value(s) of the covariate(s). For that type of coverage you need to get the simultaneous confidence curves (upper and lower bound curves). Now it is true that if you predict a y at a given value of a covariate and you want the same confidence level for the prediction interval as you used for the confidence interval for y at the given value of the covariate the interval will be wider. The reason is that the model tells you that there will be added variability because a new y will have its own independent error that must be accounted for in the interval. That error component does not enter into the estimates based on the data used in the fit.
