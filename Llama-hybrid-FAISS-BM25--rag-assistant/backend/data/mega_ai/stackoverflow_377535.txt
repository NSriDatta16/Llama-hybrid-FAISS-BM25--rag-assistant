My take on this is that auto-shrink is useful when you have many fairly small databases that frequently get larger due to added data, and then have a lot of empty space afterwards. You also need to not mind that the files will be fragmented on the disk when they frequently grow and shrink. I'd never use auto-shrink on a critical database or one larger than 2 GB, as you never know when the shrink operation will kick in, and access to the database will be blocked until the shrink has completed.
