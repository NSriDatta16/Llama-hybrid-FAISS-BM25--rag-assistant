Mean and variance of a time series

Xt is a time series with the equation below: Xt = + 1/π (Xt-1)+ Zt t = 0,±1,±2, · · · where {Zt} ∼ WN(0, 1) and Zt is uncorrelated with Xs for each s I tried writing the expression of the mean; Is it correct? 1 > The expression of the mean μx = E[Xt] is E[Xt] = + 1/π E[Xt-1] 2 > Also I'm trying to write the equation of mean of the time series {Xt}. How to find the variance expression of the variance σ^2X = V(Xt).
