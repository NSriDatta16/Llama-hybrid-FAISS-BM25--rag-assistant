A question about Amazon EC2 Compute Units

I have a large EC2 server instance on Amazon. Reading on wikipedia shows the following details of a Large Instance. 7.5 GB memory 4 EC2 Compute Units (2 virtual cores with 2 EC2 Compute Units each) 850 GB instance storage (2Ã—420 GB plus 10 GB root partition) 64-bit platform I/O Performance: High API name: m1.large Q: What exactly is a compute unit? I know I shouldn't be multiplying 2 cores with 2 compute units to get 4 cores because running htop on the machine only shows 2 cores. Same with cat /proc/cpuinfo . Q:I do not see 850 G of storage anywhere on the instance. How do I utilize that? THanks
