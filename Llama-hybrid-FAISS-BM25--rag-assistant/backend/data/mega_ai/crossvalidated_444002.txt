Just for the sake of argument, I am putting my two cents here. As I find the answers above/below so far are pretty explanatory. David DN rounded your question up nicely, I think. This subject is very new and therefore, take what you get and run with it. I worked with stats and I worked in research. I also worked on predictive research. Even the big guys on the market, like YouTube, LinkedIn or any other social media using Algorithm, are not near perfect, because machine learning, although statistics is behind the calculations, all predictive matter is based on human behaviour and such bound to human research first. Then math. Then there is the learned and cultural influences. Once learned, there is a next step. In addition geographically, not everyone on the planet is on the same platform, meaning, statistically the learned differs on human behaviour outcome. And yet, machine learning is pretty intertwined from math, computational, psychology, linguistics, cultural. What would stats mean if there is no story behind it. I will suggest the approach, rather than thinking of 'the difference' as one or the other, think of the difference as how each field complements each other and what more can be done.
