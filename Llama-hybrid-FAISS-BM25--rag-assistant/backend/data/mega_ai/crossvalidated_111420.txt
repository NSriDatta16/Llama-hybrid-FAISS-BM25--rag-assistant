To circumvent the 200-players problem, you could fit whichever model you choose (logit, binomial...), without the player variable as such, but inside a discrete mixture framework. You'll have to process the data right (for instance you want to make sure that all stats of a single player are taken together, and you'll have to determine the optimal number of clusters in the mixture) but the fitted mixture model will group players into clusters, which should reflect differences in performance, or rather differences in how the conditions (home and ahead) affect performance. This is very easy and fast with R package flexmix. Building on the same idea, you could also just run an unsupervized clustering algo (k-means, gaussian mixture, self-organizing map) on the data transformed as such: each player has one vector of 8 values $(rate_{home,lead}, N_{home, lead}, rate_{home, behind}, N_{home, behind}, ...)$. In that case each player belongs to a cluster of players with similar characteristics, and you can check whether the differences between clusters are significant.
