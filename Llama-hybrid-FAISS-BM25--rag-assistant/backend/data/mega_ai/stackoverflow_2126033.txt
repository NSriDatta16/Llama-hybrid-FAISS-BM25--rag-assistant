If you are only looking for a presentation framework in pure Java then, for me, Stripes 1 is the closest of the Java MVC frameworks to the RoR philosophy: simple, elegant, and requiring minimal configuration. 1 Stripes pioneered the Convention over Configuration approach for Java web development. And while some other frameworks have adopted some of its principles (like Spring MVC or Struts2 with plugins), I still prefer Stripes because it does one thing, and does it well.
