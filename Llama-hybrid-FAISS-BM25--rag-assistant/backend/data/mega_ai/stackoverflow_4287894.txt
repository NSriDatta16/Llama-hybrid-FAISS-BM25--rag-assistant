com.github.something . I've seen projects on SourceForge use net.sf.* for package names, so there's precedent. I use li.earth.urchin.twic.* , based on my email address, even though that domain has nothing much to do with any of the code i write. I suspect it doesn't really matter. For what it's worth, i find it really annoying when a package name doesn't use a reversed domain name - when it's foobar.util rather than org.foobar.util . It makes me think the packagers were lazy or arrogant. I have absolutely no objective reason to think that, of course!
