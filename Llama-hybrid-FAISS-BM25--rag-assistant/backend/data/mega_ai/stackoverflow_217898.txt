Personally, I like the COM API and I use it to generate both Word and Excel reports. I have done some experiments with VS2005 and the results are encouraging. If you don't want to go this route, I have a couple of suggestions. If you use the charting options (Analysis > Graphs). Each graph has a tab called data grid that lets you export data to Excel and a bunch of other data formats. If you are an admin, or friendely with your admin, you can dump the whole database into access and then import into Excel. Of course, you'll loose all your table relationships, but it's better than nothing. It's also a really good way to learn the db schema.
