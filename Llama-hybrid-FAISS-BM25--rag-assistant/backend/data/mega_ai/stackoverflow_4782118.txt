Your collection is rather complex. In order to check the size though you need to know there is an element there at all, i.e. find did not return "end" of your map. If it does, you cannot use the iterator returned. Of course how you handle this is your own decision, eg return maybe -1 if the string was not found (with 0 indicating it was found but had no content). Now you have edited your code I immediately spot a bug: if (it == csvMap.end()) { /* * it = csvMap.end() > true * Either when command isn't found or command is the last */ string c = (*it).first; you cannot dereference end (which it is)
