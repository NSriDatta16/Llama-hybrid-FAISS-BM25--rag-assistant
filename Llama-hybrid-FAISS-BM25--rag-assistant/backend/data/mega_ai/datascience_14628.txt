Deploying the prediction model under missing values for test data

I have successfully built a logistic regression prediction model based on data set that is complete and clean, i.e., there is no missing values and the data is consistent. Now, for deploying the model and testing it for online use, there is missing values in the inputs, i.e., not all inputs are available to predict the target value. Is there a standard way to deal with this?
