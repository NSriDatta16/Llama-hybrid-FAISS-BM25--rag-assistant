So my question is can I make an applet read and write files without sever side scripting? Sure, and in a 1.6.0_10+(1) JRE (the 'Next Generation' plug-in), it does not even require the Jars to be digitally signed. An applet deployed using Java Web Start in a next gen. plug-in has access to the JNLP API services. The FileContents object of the API provides basic I/O. Here is a demo. of using the FileContents (the source is also available at the link). (1) Note: JWS could launch free-floating applets since Java 1.2. But with 1.6.0_10+ a JWS applet can remain embedded in a browser window (for Win. & *nix at least - I hear 'no Mac.').
