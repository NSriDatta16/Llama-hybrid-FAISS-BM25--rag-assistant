How can I apply the AIC criterion to time series data using MATLAB?

As part of the Econometrics Toolbox, how can i apply the AIC criterion to time series data using MATLAB. Is there any way without using GARCH functions such as garchfit . If the only way to AIC is to apply GARCH functions, what is meant by number of parameters??
