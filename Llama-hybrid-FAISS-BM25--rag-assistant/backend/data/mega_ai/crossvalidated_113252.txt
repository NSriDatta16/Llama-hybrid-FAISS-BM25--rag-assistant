Correlation using Logistic Regression and Pearson

I am so sorry, I am beginner in statistic analysis, I have project using R to analyze the correlation between dependent variables and independents variables. In this case I have two dependent variables (1. Extrovert, 2. Introvert). And the independent variables i have the data from (Call Log-> how long they call everyday, how many they call everyday, SMS log-> how length text in SMS body every day, how many they sent/received sms for each day). I am so confused how I can do it, please anyone can give me some good references about it. I also have some questions such as : I use the different type of variables, independent variables (data type : numeric) but dependent variable (data type is categorical), so it is possible to apply logistic regression and Pearson? Or any someone will give me some advice the better solution such as another methods for solving this problem. The example of data from dput() structure(list(sumcallin = c(462L, 998L, 335L, 179L, 34L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L), caountcallin = c(7L, 5L, 8L, 5L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L), sumcallout = c(1068L, 81L, 519L, 393L, 342L, 0L, 583L, 1902L, 358L, 1017L), countcallout = c(15L, 3L, 10L, 5L, 6L, 0L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L), sumreceived = c(322L, 75L, 20L, 35L, 8L, 35L, 135L, 103L, 471L, 173L), countreceived = c(15L, 4L, 2L, 3L, 1L, 2L, 7L, 3L, 18L, 5L), sumsent = c(171L, 31L, 25L, 23L, 8L, 55L, 87L, 9L, 400L, 258L), countsent = c(10L, 4L, 1L, 3L, 1L, 3L, 4L, 1L, 13L, 8L), personality = structure(c(2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L), .Label = c("extro", "intro"), class = "factor")), .Names = c("sumcallin", "caountcallin", "sumcallout", "countcallout", "sumreceived", "countreceived", "sumsent", "countsent", "personality"), row.names = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L, 37L, 38L, 39L, 40L, 41L), class = "data.frame") Thank you for your help.
