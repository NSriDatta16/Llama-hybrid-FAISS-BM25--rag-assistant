What is better in WPF for UI layout, using one Grid, or nested Grids

I am making a UI in WPF, I have a bunch of functional areas and I use a Grid to organize it. Now the Grid that I want is not uniform, as in, some functional area will span multiple cells in the Grid. I was wondering what the best practise is in solving this. Should I create one grid and then for each functional area set it to span multiple cells, or should I split it up into multiple nested Grids. In this image, the leftmost panel (panels separated by the gray bar) is what I want. The middle panel shows one grid where the blue lines are overlapped by a functional area. The rightmost panel shows how I could do it with nested grids. You can see the green grid has one horizontal split. In the bottom cell is the yellow Grid with a vertical split. In side the left cell is the red Grid with again a horizontal split. Grids http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/08f2711bae.jpg I was just wondering what is best practise, the middle or the right panel. UPDATE: Just for clarification, a more 'code oriented' example: The Middle panel The Right panel: Update: I have to admit that now that I wrote out the code for both approaches, the "span" solution looks a lot better.
