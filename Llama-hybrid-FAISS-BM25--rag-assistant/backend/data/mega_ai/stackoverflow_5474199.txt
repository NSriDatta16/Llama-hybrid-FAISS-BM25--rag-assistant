http://doc.trolltech.com/latest/dnd.html should lead you to pretty much anything you want to do re drag and drop. As for your specific goal, you need to implement QWidget::dragMoveEvent(QDragMoveEvent* event), which will get called every time the mouse moves within the destination tree while dragging an item. Then get the position of the cursor with QDragMoveEvent::pos(). After that, while in dragMoveEvent, use QTreeView::indexAt(pos()) to get the item under the mouse. Now, I don't know how to get the items to separate in a smooth animated way, which would be ideal. But what you can do is (temporarily) add a blank item to the list, which will have the almost identical effect. Then implement QWidget::dropEvent() to handle the drop event, and when this happens delete the blank item and insert the dragged item in the location where it was.
