What type of time series model would be good?

I am trying to fit a time series model to the following data. It seems to be seasonal. Would an ARIMA model be good? Here is the data: Count 2 1 4 5 4 8 7 11 4 4 11 7 10 7 0 19 13 13 11 9 8 16 10 12 9 7 21 9 10 6 7 19 18 9 19 15 14 17 9 10 10 13 15 20 15 12 15 16 The numbers are separated by spaces.
