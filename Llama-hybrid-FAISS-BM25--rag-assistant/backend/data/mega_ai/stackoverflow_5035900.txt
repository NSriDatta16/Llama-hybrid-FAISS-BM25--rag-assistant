How to compare two elements in a list in constant time

Suppose I have a list of elements like [5, 3, 1, 2, 4] , and I want to compare two elements by position. Whichever comes first in the list is greater, or true . So: compare(5, 3) # true compare(2, 1) # false compare(3, 4) # true How can I do that in constant time? One way I thought of doing this was using maps, where the key is the element and the value is the position in the list: order = {5: 0, 3: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3, 4: 4} Then we have amortized O(1) time, but this will be O(N) space. Does anyone have a more elegant solution?
