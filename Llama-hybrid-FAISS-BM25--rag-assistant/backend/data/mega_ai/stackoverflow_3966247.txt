How to use multiple files in a php webpage

I am creating a webpage with PHP/MySQL, and each page is in its own .php file. How should I organize the addressbar, when changing the viewing page? I have thought of two different ways to solve this: 1) www.mywebpage.com/?page=REFERENCES+pageid=GUID_TO_USE_FOR_DB_LOOKUP 2) www.mywebpage.com/references.php?GUID_TO_USE_FOR_DB_LOOKUP Which should I choose? Are there other ways to do this? Edit: When the user clicks a link to another page, I want to redirect the user to the corresponding .php file. The question is how to show this in the addressbar in the web browser. With the GUID_TO_USE_FOR_DB_LOOKUP, I want to pass parameter to the .php file
