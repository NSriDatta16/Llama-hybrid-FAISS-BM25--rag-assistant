I think the short version to your question is yes, it appears to be common practice to only reward an agent for full completion of a task, but be careful with your wording, as Sean pointed out in his answer that a reward function is defined for all possible combinations of states, actions, and future states. To add to Sean's answer, consider these snippets taken from Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto's intro book on Reinforcement Learning: The reward signal is your way of communicating to the [agent] what you want it to achieve, not how you want it achieved (author emphasis). For example, a chess-playing agent should be rewarded only for actually winning, not for achieving subgoals such as taking its opponents pieces or gaining control of the center. Although it does appear to be the recommended approach in their book, I'm sure you can find others who disagree.
