Did anybody ever use mean pooling and publish it?

I found a couple of sources which mention mean pooling for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - including all lectures I had about CNNs so far - but I could not find any paper with at least 10 citations which uses mean pooling. Do you know of a paper which uses mean pooling?
