Where is a complex root on the unit circle?

Say we have the time series $z_t=z_{t-2}/2+a_t$ where $a_t$ is white noise. then we have $(1+B^2/4)z_t=a_t$, where B is the backward shift operator. We can solve for the roots of $(1+B^2/4)$ and obtain $B=2i$ or $B=-2i$ I'm interested in the stationarity and causality of the time series, so I would like to know where these roots lie on the unit circle. Is it as simple as plotting B on the imaginary axis? In which case, both roots would lie outside the unit circle.
