Is Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede) memory usage significantly higher than 3.2?

I was happily using Eclipse 3.2 (or as happy as one can be using Eclipse) when for a forgotten reason I decided to upgrade to 3.4. I'm primarily using PyDev, Aptana, and Subclipse, very little Java development. I've noticed 3.4 tends to really give my laptop a hernia compared to 3.2 (vista, core2duo, 2G). Is memory usage on 3.4 actually higher than on 3.2, and if so is there a way to reduce it? EDIT: I tried disabling plugins (I didn't have much enabled anyway) and used the jvm monitor; the latter was interesting but I couldn't figure out how to use the info in any practical way. I'm still not able to reduce its memory footprint. I've also noticed every once in a while Eclipse just hangs for ~30 seconds, then magically comes back.
