Itzik Ben-Gan has written three excellent books on SQL Server 2008 and T-SQL. The best place to start is with 'SQL Server 2008: T-SQL Fundamentals', and then from there to move onto 'Inside SQL Server 2008: T-SQL Querying' and then finally 'Inside SQL Server 2008: T-SQL Programming'. If I could get all of the developers here to read these three books then I wouldn't need to spend half as much time as I do addressing quality concerns in our databases.
