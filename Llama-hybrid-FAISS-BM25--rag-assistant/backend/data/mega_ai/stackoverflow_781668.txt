Char to int conversion in C

If I want to convert a single numeric char to it's numeric value, for example, if: char c = '5'; and I want c to hold 5 instead of '5' , is it 100% portable doing it like this? c = c - '0'; I heard that all character sets store the numbers in consecutive order so I assume so, but I'd like to know if there is an organized library function to do this conversion, and how it is done conventionally. I'm a real beginner :)
