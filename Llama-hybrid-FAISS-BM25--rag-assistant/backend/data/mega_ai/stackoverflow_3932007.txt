how to better organize a web service interface

I have a web service that's ~200 methods strong, implemented using .Net + WCF in a standalone service. we're modelling the backing code to use different handlers for different methods, but eventually there's still that one monolithic interface... I used (and loved) RESTful interfaces in the past, especially for the way they break up a single interface into separate domains. can that be achieved using web services, without splitting the web service? would love to hear thoughts on the matter.
