How to draw in C#/WinForms with decent speed?

I'm trying to visualise a graph and allow people to play with it. I found the excellent Graph# library that can create an initial layout so that part is covered. Now I need to make a control that actually draws it and provides the necessary interactivity. Graph# comes with a nice visualiser itself, however I don't like it because it is written in WPF (while my app is WinForms), and because I want to add some more interactivity options, which would require quite a remake of it anyway. The graphs I'm drawing will routinely be pretty large, at about 100 vertices and the same amount of edges (the graphs will be trees 99% of time). That means that the resulting rendering can be up to 2000px by 2000px and even more. The users should be able to zoom in and out, scroll, highlight and drag vertices and edges, and get some popups with additional info when hovering the cursor above a vertex. I'm worried that the standard System.Drawing might not be able to deliver a decent speed for this. I would like the dragging/zooming/scrolling operations to be smooth, and the popups should open with a little animation as well. Something like 20fps should be a necessity. I know I can try to speed things up by pre-rendering a lot of the elements and keeping them as bitmaps in memory - but that would probably take up lots of RAM, and I'm still not sure if it would deliver the necessary performance. What are your thoughts?
