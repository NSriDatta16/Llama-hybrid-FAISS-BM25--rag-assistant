*Lack of control* This is the key issue as Per Jakobsen mentions . Moving along... It's not possible to just go in and edit .aspx and .master files wherever you feel like. There are consequences such as unghosting, support, and that it often just doesn't work as would be expected. A good understanding of how SharePoint composes pages is critical. There's no (supported and reliable) way to query the database directly. This is extremely frustrating for ASP.NET developers that are used to designing/working with purpose-built and well-designed databases. CAML queries are no substitute for the power of well-optimised SQL queries. (More of a 2b): Poor support for relational data between lists. Odd for an enterprise application. A little off topic but HTML markup and CSS was a nightmare in 2003 and not much better in 2007. It's painful to work with and not pretty either. You have to go to great lengths to produce a site fully compliant with web standards and best practices. To summarise, things usually need to be done "the SharePoint way". This often isn't the most efficient or elegant way that a straight ASP.NET dev prefers. Developers like elegance and they don't like giving up control. There are also gotchas right across the product ( Sean mentioned a key one ) lurking like little tripwires for the unsuspecting. The only way to know and understand them is to know SharePoint - and it's a big product. See more discussion about this at Why don't ASP.NET developers use WSS? on SharePointDevWiki.
