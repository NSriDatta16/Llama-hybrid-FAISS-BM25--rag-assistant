On the oracle-labelled dataset, you could treat the problem as a classification problem: you have four inputs, $R_1(x_1), R_1(x_2), R_2(x_1), R_2(x_2)$ and one binary valued output that takes value 1 whenever $R^*(x_1) ? You'd have far more data to train the classifier than the data that you've actually got (due to the combinatorial explosion), so it should be possible to fit a neural network or a GP or any other classifier to this really.
