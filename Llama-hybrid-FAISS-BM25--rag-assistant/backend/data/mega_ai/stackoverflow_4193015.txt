I'd consider this a misuse of the code coverage metric. Just because a test doesn't increase the metric, it is not necessarily redundant - it could test a specific execution path that consists of LOC that are covered by several other tests together, but represents behaviour that none of the other tests cover. And remember: code behaviour is influenced very much by state, but no test coverage tool I know measures the coverage of state space. Unless the runtime of your test suite is a serious problem, there are much better things you can do with your time than eliminate possibly redundant tests.
