A walk through the Commandeur and Koopman's book with R examples is available here . Also check the official book's page where links to new software and tutorials are posted. An entire JSS volume was dedicated to state space modelling in different software. See particularly the introductory paper and the R paper . Kalman Filtering in R has a good overview of available R packages for state space modeling. Sections "Dynamic Regression Models" and "Multivariate Time Series Models" in TimeSeries CRAN View contain a few more references.
