CodeIgniter Email Class - User-Agent Header

I'm trying to change the User-Agent and X-Mailer headers sent out by CodeIgniter's email class, so that there's no way that anyone can find out that the website is running on the CI framework. As per the manual, I've made an application/config/email.php file containing the following: When I look at the headers in the incoming emails, they look like this: User-Agent: CodeIgniter X-Mailer: MyUseragentHere Note that one of the headers has been changed by CI but the other hasn't?! Any suggestions on how to fix without editing the CI system files (want to keep things nice and clean in case of future upgrades etc.) much appreciated.
