Why does ACF of stationary time series drop to 0 quickly?

A 'weakly stationary' time series has the property that the autocorrelation is only dependent on the lag and its structure does not change over time apart from the properties of constant mean and constant finite variance. How does this imply that it's autocorrelation function (ACF) plots should show a decline to 0?
