Welcome to the site! Firstly, when we use any kind of predicting algorithm, then you need to have the future values of the independent variables(features for explaining the target variable), for Prediction. Secondly, If you don't have such values then you cannot use predicting algorithms, we have forecasting algorithms to do such task. To apply this you need to have data which is time series data. From the sample and graph I think your data is time series data. FYI, you can also use additional features even in time series. For Feature Engineering on Time Series data you can go through the link. If you need any additional information let me know.
