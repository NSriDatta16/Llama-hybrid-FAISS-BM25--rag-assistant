I don't know a lot about MonoDevelop; Visual Studio 2008 has an "Organize Usings" menu that drops unnecessary usings. I think the ability to reference missing namespaces automatically is a feature only in the third-party Resharper addin. Re your second question: the MSDN page for a class tells you the assembly and namespace you need in order to use that class. I normally do a Google search for "site:msdn.microsoft.com NameOfClass".
