How to read a range of bytes from a bytearray in c#

I have to read a range of bytes from a byte array. I have the starting position and the ending position to read. -(NSData *) getSubDataFrom:(int)stPos To:(int)endPos withData:(NSData *) data{ NSRange range = NSMakeRange(stPos, endPos); return [data subDataWithRage:range]; } The above code in ObjectiveC reads the range of data(bytes) from a NSData(byteArray). Is there any equivelent method in c# to do the same. or how else we can do this. Please advise!
