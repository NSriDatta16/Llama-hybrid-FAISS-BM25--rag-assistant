Get Contact Profile Information from Office Communicator (OCS) SDK in C#?

My company uses MS Office Communicator Server (OCS) 2007 R2, and I am accessing with C# with the SDK. If I right click on a contact in OCS, I get the option to 'View Contact Card'. I want access to this via the API! Unfortunately I can find nothing in the SDK documentation to get at this. There is a method called 'ViewProfile' which is unsupported, and I can find nothing out there about it. I could of course go directly to the Active Directory account of the contact, but that would require my machine to connect to the organization via VPN. Since most of us work 'offline' I would prefer not to do this. (The data I need is anyway in OCS!) Thanks in advance, Andrew
