There are a few tools for master-slave (and master-multislave) scenarios, usually trigger-based. Slony-I has already been mentioned (is stable and solid, but a bit difficult to operate). People having problems with Slony-I wrote Londiste (by Skype team) and PyReplica . Bah, and I just spotted Mammoth has been open-sourced For multimaster there is Bucardo (note: it is not that polished) or commercial offerings - for example by Continuent or CyberTec .
