JNLP desktop shortcut creation with Windows 7 : "cannot create shortcut"

we have an Java application deployed with Java Web Start (JNLP) that does a desktop shortcut. One client has issue with Windows 7 : in the end of startup/installation there is a message "cannot create shortcut". With our own Windows 7 machine we don't have problems and unfortunately we don't have much details yet. But if somebody has encountered similar issue or has some ideas to try, they are welcome =) Java version used at the client is 6u18. Br, Touko
