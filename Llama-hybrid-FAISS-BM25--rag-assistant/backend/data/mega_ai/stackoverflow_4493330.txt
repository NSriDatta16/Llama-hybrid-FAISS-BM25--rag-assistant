JAXB doesn't support references by means of xs:key or xs:keyref . The specification states that these constraints may be checked during validation, but they have no effect on data. However, you can achieve this (more or less) by using xs:ID and xs:IDREF instead. For an introduction, see the chapters 2.2.15 Referring to Another XML Element and 4.3 Assembling Data with Links (ID, IDREF) in the J AXB Tutorial by Wolfgang Laun. For your sample XSD, this would meaning changing the element definition to Note that identifiers with the xs:ID type are required to be globally unique in the XML document. In other words, you cannot have the same ID for two different elements in the same XML file, even if the elements are of different types. By default, an element or attribute of type xs:IDREF binds to java.lang.Object . If you know in advance what type the referenced object will be, you can customize the mapping, either by adding JAXB annotations to the schema or through an external binding declaration (e.g., xjc -b bindings.xjb ). Example using JAXB schema annotations (not tested): Example using an external bindings declaration (not tested):
