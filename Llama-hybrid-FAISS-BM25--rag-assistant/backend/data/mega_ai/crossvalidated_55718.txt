PCA and the train/test split

I have a dataset for which I have multiple sets of binary labels. For each set of labels, I train a classifier, evaluating it by cross-validation. I want to reduce dimensionality using principal component analysis (PCA). My question is: Is it possible to do the PCA once for the whole dataset and then use the new dataset of lower dimensionality for cross-validation as described above? Or do I need to do a separate PCA for every training set (which would mean doing a separate PCA for every classifier and for every cross-validation fold)? On one hand, the PCA does not make any use of the labels. On the other hand, it does use the test data to do the transformation, so I am afraid it could bias the results. I should mention that in addition to saving me some work, doing the PCA once on the whole dataset would allow me to visualize the dataset for all label sets at once. If I have a different PCA for each label set, I would need to visualize each label set separately.
