Help with this Linq query

I'd like to get a collection of Students whose average grade (by adding each individual subject score and dividing by the amount of subjects) is above 55. Since this year is 2011, I also need to calculate this field only for the 2011 records. private void cmbGradeParalelo_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { StudentRepository studentRepo = new StudentRepository(): dataGridView1.DataSource = studentRepo.FindAllStudents() .Where(s=>s.ScoreRecords.) } Any suggestions?
