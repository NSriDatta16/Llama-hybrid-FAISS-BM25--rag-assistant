To analyze this, think about what the best, worst and average cases actually are. You need to answer three questions to find those three cases: What is the fewest number of rolls to find the desired page? What is the largest number of rolls to find the desired page? What is the average number of rolls to find the desired page? Once you find the first two, the third should be less tricky. If you need asymptotic notation as opposed to just the number of rolls, think about how the answers to each question change if you change the number of pages in the book (e.g. 200 pages vs 100 pages vs 50 pages).
