Is this a bug or am I wrong?

/** * Returns nodes found by xpath expression * * @param string $xpath * @return array */ public function getXpath($xpath) { if (empty($this->_xml)) { return false; } if (!$result = @$this->_xml->xpath($xpath)) { return false; } return $result; } This code is taken from Magento. You can checkout the specific file in their public svn: http://svn.magentocommerce.com/source/branches/1.5/lib/Varien/Simplexml/Config.php Now I think that (!$result = @$this->_xml->xpath($xpath)) can never ever evaluate to true and thus the return false statement can never happen. Because the assignment of the return value of xpath, regardless of whether it is true or false to the variable $result always returns true and negated always returns false . So this is a bug or a completely redundant code, or am i wrong? FYI: I am currently debugging a problem where some config elements get "lost" and I assume the error is somewhere in there.
