If you really need a "Backup" then you also need database schema, like table definitions, view definitions, store procedures and so on. A backup of a database isn't just the data. The value of the mysqldump format for backup is specifically that it is very EASY to use it to restore mysql databases. A backup that isn't easily restored is far less useful. If you are looking for a method to reliably backup mysql data to so you can restore to a mysql server then I think you should stick with the mysqldump tool. Mysql is free and runs on many different platforms. Setting up a new mysql server that I can restore to is simple. I am not at all worried about not being able to setup mysql so I can do a restore. I would be far more worried about a custom backup/restore based on a fragile format like csv/tsv failing. Are you sure that all your quotes, commas, or tabs that are in your data would get escaped correctly and then parsed correctly by your restore tool? If you are looking for a method to extract the data then see several in the other answers.
