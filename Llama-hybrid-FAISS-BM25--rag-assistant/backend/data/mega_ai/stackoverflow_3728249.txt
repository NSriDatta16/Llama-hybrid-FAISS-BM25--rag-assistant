Consider that it is actually quite common for the total storage required for Indexes to be greater than the storage required for the table data within a given database. Your particular scenario however would appear to quite excessive. As others have pointed out, if you have assigned the Clustered Index for a given table to reside in a separate data file (Your Index data file) then the entire physical table itself will reside in this file also, because in a manner of speak the Clustered Index is the table. Providing details of your Table Schema and Index Structures will enable us to provide you with more specific guidance. Other posters have mentioned that: You should review your index definitions for duplicate indexes. Take a look at Identifying Overlapping Indexes by Brent Ozar . You should look to identify unused indexes. Take a look as SQL Server Pedia Article: Finding Unused Indexes Other avenues to explore include reviewing the fragmentation of your indexes, as this can increase the storage requirements. Heavy fragmentation, particularly in the Clustered Index of a table containing LOB data, can result in a significant increase in storage needs. Reorganizing the Clustered Index on tables that contain LOB data will compact the LOB data. See Reorganizing and Rebuilding Indexes
