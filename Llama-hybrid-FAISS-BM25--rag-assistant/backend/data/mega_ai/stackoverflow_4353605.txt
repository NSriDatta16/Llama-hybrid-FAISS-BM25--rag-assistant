awk: Elegant way to fetch the word after a separator

Consider the following DB schema: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX blah1 ON table1(length); CREATE INDEX blah2 ON table3(name); CREATE INDEX blah3 ON table3 USING btree(id); I want to write a small awk script that would return the names of the indices and tables, e.g.: blah1, table1 blah2, table2 blah3, table3 I need to match the word that comes after the word INDEX and the word that comes after the word ON and ends with ( or whitespace. Any idea how to do it using a regex match, without iterating over all $NF s?
