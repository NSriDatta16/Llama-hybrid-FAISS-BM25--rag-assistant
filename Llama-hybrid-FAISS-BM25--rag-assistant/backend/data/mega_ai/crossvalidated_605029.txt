As extensively already discussed by others and in the comments, the Central Limit Theorem tells us about the behaviour of the distribution of standardized sample averages $\bar X_i$ as $i$ becomes large, where $X_i$ and its space play no role. In the Central Limit Theorem, the basic underlying hypothesis is For each $n$ , let $X_1, \ldots X_n$ be independent random variables. As $n$ changes, the underlying probability space may change, but this is of no consequence since a convergence in distribution statement is a statement about convergence of a sequence of real-valued functions on $\mathbb{R}$ . Indeed, If $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ are independent with distribution functions $F_1,\ldots,F_n$ and $$ T_n = (S_n - E(S_n))/\text{var}(S_n), $$ with $S_n = X_1,\ldots,X_n$ , the distribution function of $T_n$ is completely determined by the $F_i$ , and the validity of a statement about convergence in distribution of $T_n$ is also determined by $F_i$ , regardless of the construction of the underlying probability space.
