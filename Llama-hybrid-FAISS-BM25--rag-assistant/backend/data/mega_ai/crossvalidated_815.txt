I must admit that I do not really understand your question: your raindrops example is not very satisfying since this is not illustrating the fact that the Gaussian behaviour comes from the "average of a large number of iid random variables". if the quantity $X$ that you are interested in is an average $\frac{Y_1+\ldots+Y_N}{N}$ that fluctuates around its mean in a Gaussian way, you can also expect that $\frac{f(Y_1)+\ldots+f(Y_N)}{N}$ has a Gaussian behaviour. if the fluctuation of $X$ around its mean are approximately Gaussian and small, then so are the fluctuation of $f(X)$ around its mean (by Taylor expansion) could you cite some true examples of (real life) Gaussian behaviour coming from averaging: this is not very common! Gaussian behaviour is often used in statistics as a first rough approximation because the computations are very tractable. As physicists uses the harmonic approximation, statisticians uses the Gaussian approximation.
