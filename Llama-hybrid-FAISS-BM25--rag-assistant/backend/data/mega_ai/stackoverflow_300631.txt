JMeter Tests and Non-Static GET/POST Parameters

What's the best strategy to use when writing JMeters tests against a web application where the values of certain query-string and post variables are going to change for each run. Quick, common, example You go to a Web Page Enter some information into a form Click Save Behind the scenes, a new record is entered in the database You want to edit the record you just entered, so you go to another web page. Behind the scenes it's passing the page a parameter with the Database ID of the row you just created When you're running step 5 of the above test, the page parameter/Database ID is going to change each time. The workflow/strategy I'm currently using is Record a test using the above actions Make a note of each place where a query string variable may change from run to run Use a XPath or Regular Expression Extractor to pull the value out of a response and into a JMeter variable Replace all appropriate instances of the hard-coded parameter with the above variable. This works and can be automated to an extent. However, it can get tedious, is error prone, and fragile. Is there a better/commonly accepted way of handling this situation? (Or is this why most people just use JMeter to play back logs? (-;)
