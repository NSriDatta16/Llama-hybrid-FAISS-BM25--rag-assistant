Use of Dyanmic Linear Models in Interrupted Time Series

I've been undertaking research in which I use an Interrupted Time Series [ITS] approach to attempt to quantify the effect of a policy intervention. An ITS approach segments the data into two periods, representing pre- and post-policy. The most common approach applies an OLS or GLS regression to each segment and quantifies the effect as either the difference in intercept and slope of the 2 models OR uses said model to predict the values in the post policy period, based upon the continuation of the pre-policy model unaltered. However, an alternative approach allows for the use of ARIMA models. I'm a little confused as I'm not sure how the ARIMA approach would be used. I assumed only based upon the predicted values, but wondered whether a similar comparative approach could be used where the two models are directly compared?? I had originally used a Dynamic Linear Model to model the pre-policy period and predict a future post-policy period, but this has proven problematic. As such, I wondered if there was a means by which to compare the two models fit to each segment [similarly to the ARIMA method if such was plausible]? If anyone has any ideas it would be hugely appreciated [as I'm dying here!]!
