Resizing Thumb Template Control on Canvas in WPF

I've dynamically placed a user control on a Canvas as the VisualTree root in a Thumb control. I can move the thumb control correctly, but can only correctly re-size the control while resizing from the east, southeast, and south rectangles defined in the user control. //Instantiate a new Thumb control to be placed on the canvas. var myThumb = new Thumb(); myThumb.Name = "myThumb"; //Instantiate a new ThumbTemplate and ElementFactory with my user control. var myThumbTemplate = new ControlTemplate(typeof(Thumb)); myThumbTemplate.VisualTree = new FrameworkElementFactory(typeof(MyUserControl), "myUserControl"); //Set the thumb template to the newly instantiated template. myThumb.Template = myThumbTemplate; //Point the DragDelta and DragCompleted events to local methods. myThumb.DragDelta += new DragDeltaEventHandler(myThumb_DragDelta); myThumb.DragCompleted += new DragCompletedEventHandler(myThumb_DragCompleted); //Add the thumb to the canvas control. this.myCanvas.Children.Add(myThumb); Canvas.SetZIndex(myThumb, 1); Canvas.SetTop(myThumb, 75); Canvas.SetLeft(myThumb, 50); In the DragDelta method, this approach works to resize the user control from the east resizing rectangle: var myThumb = sender as Thumb; if (myThumb != null) { var myUserControl = myThumb.Template.FindName("myUserControl", myThumb) as MyUserControl; if (myUserControl != null) { myUserControl.Width = myUserControl.OldWidth + e.HorizontalChange; } } But wherever I attempt to do that plus set the Canvas.Top of the Thumb control (Ie. from the North re-size rectangle), I don't get the results I expected: double top = Canvas.GetTop(finderThumb) + e.VerticalChange; myUserControl.Height = myUserControl.OldHeight - e.VerticalChange; Canvas.SetTop(myThumb, top); What happens then is that the control moves up and down in the canvas control but only ever re-sizes by one pixel, regardless of the Vertical or Horizontal Change. Any ideas as to why this happens and suggestions for resolving the issue? Thanks!
