A very widely used time-series identification scheme is the Box-Jenkins approach. See here . This involves establishing stationarity and decomposing seasonality, then fitting Autoregressive (Integrated) Moving Average (ARIMA) models to the resulting series. The R function ARIMA() in the stats package will do this and chooses the appropriate model and estimates parameters according to AIC. A point of clarification in your question, however: The concept of stationarity includes the variance (i.e. homoskedasticity vs. heteroskedasticity). A stationary series is, by definition, homoskedastic. See here .
