You simply cannot make some assumption that the entry points would ever be at the same ordinal. In fact it's unwise to assume they will remain the same across versions of the same DLL even on the same platform (meaning that calling to ordinal 29 on the desktop may work in theis version, but the function your after could easily move in the next build when it gets recompiled and linked). Calling by ordinal is way, way, way fragile and risky.
