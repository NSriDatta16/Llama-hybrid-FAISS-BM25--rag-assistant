I think what you are looking for is measuring the partial dependance, from the vanilla random forest r implementation manual: Description Partial dependence plot gives a graphical depiction of the marginal effect of a variable on the class probability (classification) or response (regression). You can also find a little more formal description there. This can be a little tricky to use correctly so read about it a bit. This is an example provided there on the iris data set: data(iris) set.seed(543) iris.rf
