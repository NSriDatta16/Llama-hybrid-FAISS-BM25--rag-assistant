This split-mouth design is pretty common in dental research and sounds pretty reasonable. You want to make sure the sides are truly randomly selected (and at least vaguely comparable a-priori, because otherwise e.g. comparing one side that barely needed treatment vs. side that was in a really bad shape might not be ideal) and similarly the selection of the teeth to be matched. You also want to do as much as possible to minimize bias in the outcome assessment (ideally done by a person that's not aware which side was treated which way, or for consistency reasons always by the same person for all patients). Analysis-wise, forming a subject difference is one way of proceeding that makes perfect sense. An alternative is to run e.g. a model with a subject random effect (modeling the average for each side), or to even model separately each tooth. Given that you intend to always use two teeth per side, the different options shouldn't make too much of a difference. However, this also limits you: Patients with only one side needing treatment (or only needing treatment for one tooth on one of the two sides) cannot be used (while with the last option that would be possible). You cannot adjust for any covariates on a tooth level (e.g. some pre-treatment assessment, something you can measure from an X-ray or whatever else might make sense), while with the last option you could.
