Unfortunately this is not a very straightforward operation. There is a good walk-through on how to accomplish something similar on CodeProject . Basically every disk is assigned a unique device number and every volume has a device number corresponding to the disk on which it resides. So you have to open all the volumes and query for their device numbers (IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER), then match them against the device number of the disk in question. The CodeProject code is going the other way (volume to disk), but you should be able to modify it easily enough.
