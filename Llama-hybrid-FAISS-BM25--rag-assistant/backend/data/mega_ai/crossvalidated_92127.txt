Any known example of research project being led by statistician in public health

(I am fully aware that my topic may not be relevant here, do let me know if this is true.) I am a research staff with training in epidemiology and biostatistics, working in government organization on public health matters like disease surveillance and infection control. Being a research staff here keeps giving me a feeling that I cannot lead a research project in this position, because I lack the context needed to ask sensible research questions. Doctors/PhDs in our service, although they know little about statistics, can become principal investigators of research projects, and then assign research staff to handle the technical parts. I wonder if this kind of "statistician can only take supportive role" curse is universal to other fields also? Any comment or counter argument on this, and any suggestion of breaking this kind of curse?
