I feel like I understand concurrency backward and forward. Recently, I grabbed a book off the shelf in our office and found it was VERY good. Not just at concurrency, it gives great coverage of Java as a whole. Introduction to Java Programming, Eighth Edition: Comprehensive Version, Y. Daniel Liang However, most of my understanding came from experience working with code, tackling problems, and trying examples. I never truly understood threading until I did it. Concurrency is complex and most people won't get it just from reading. Look through the API and write some test programs to try things out. Whatever book you choose, try to not just read the code, write it out and run it. After a day or two, working with it, you'll have it mostly figured out.
