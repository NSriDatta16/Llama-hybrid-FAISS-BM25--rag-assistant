Explaining generalized method of moments to a non-statistician

How do I explain Generalized Methods of moments and how it is used to a non statistician? So far I am going with: it is something we use to estimate conditions such as averages and variation based on samples we have collected. How do I explain the part where you estimate the parameter vector by minimizing variance?
