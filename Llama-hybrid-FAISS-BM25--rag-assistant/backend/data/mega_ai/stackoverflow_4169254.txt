Android Email or SMS ALerts

How could I best send a message using the Android from an external email address to the user's email address or SMS? For example, when the phone senses acceleration, it sends a message from youdroppedme@gmail.com to the user's gmail account. I would prefer to use the core API, if possible. I am also considering using a web server as a go between. What is the most elegant solution? Thank you!
