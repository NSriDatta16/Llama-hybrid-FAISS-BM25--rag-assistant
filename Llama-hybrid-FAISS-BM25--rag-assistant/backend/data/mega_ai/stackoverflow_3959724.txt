Perhaps useful, but not to prepare for the SCJP. The SCJP tests your knowledge of the java.lang, java.util, java.io, and other core packages. The language spec goes into the kind of detail that someone writing a JVM would need. It's not necessary for the SCJP. But if you're game to dive in, I would not discourage you. Just understand what you'll get out of it and weigh that against your time constraints and opportunity costs.
