Assume we fit the following quadratic function: $f(x) = w_0+w_1x+w_2(x^2)$

The full question is: Assume we fit the following quadratic function: $f(x) = w_0+w_1x+w_2(x^2)$ to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function ($w_0$, $w_1$, $w_2$), which ones are estimated to be 0? (Note: you must select all parameters estimated as 0 to get the question correct.) Here is the image: How can we compute this, please I need explanation. This is a question to an assignment in machine learning foundation course. Options: $w_0$ $w_1$ $w_2$, none of the above.
