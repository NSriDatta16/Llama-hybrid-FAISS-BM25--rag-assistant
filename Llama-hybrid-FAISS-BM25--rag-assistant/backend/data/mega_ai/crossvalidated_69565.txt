The question's not whether you can do it (you can), but what the answer means. If your items are "I sometimes enjoy a salad for lunch", & "Meat is murder", what does the average score measure? Propensity to vegetarianism? Probably not: a score of 4 for the former & 2 for the latter will be a much weaker predictor than vice versa. So the difficulty is is in convincing people (including yourself) that the average means what you say it does. If you're not using formal scale construction techniques as mentioned by @Peter, then the least you can do is examine the plausibility of the average as a measure of another unmeasured variable: consider whether each item is similar in terms of relevance, direction, & weight; & whether the ranking of response combinations by average looks right.
