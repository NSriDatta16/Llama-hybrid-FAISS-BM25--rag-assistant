Can I use Magento's Caching layer as a Key/Value Store?

Can I use Magento's Caching layer as a Key/Value Store similar to memcached or apc? It be nice to be able to not worry what caching engine is being used and still cache some of the code. On a further note, I will expect Magento to cache my Collection after I do some JOINS with it. If for some reason Magento does not cache the joined data, I'd like to hear about that as well.
