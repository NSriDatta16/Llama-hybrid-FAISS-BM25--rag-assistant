Some software exists for "pooling time series". One of them is AUTOBOX, a piece of software that I have helped develop. If you have k time series then you can string them together one after the other. You can then elect to obtain a composite estimate of the model parameters. This composite estimate doesn't predict the first observation or any subsequent observation from the last (or prior) readings in the previous time series. One should then test to see of any of the series in the pool shouldn't be as its parameters are different from the "others".
