Is it appropriate to compare a value against a Mean (average) which also includes that value?

For example for arguments sake lets say I have the production output of car manufacturers (Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Hyundai, Renault, Tesla) and for a particular category it makes up 40% of the annual output across all manufactures. Would it be appropriate to compare the output of Ford in that category against that 40% or should I exclude Ford from the overall percentage to make the comparison more valid/robust? Is there a problem with comparing means/averages (Ford + Nissan + Toyota + Hyundai + Renault + Tesla) compared to Ford or should it be (Nissan + Toyota + Hyundai + Renault + Tesla) compared to Ford
