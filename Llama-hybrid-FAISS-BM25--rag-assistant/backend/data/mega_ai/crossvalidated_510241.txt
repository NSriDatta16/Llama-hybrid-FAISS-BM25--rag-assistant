What you state is rather the law of large numbers. The CLT is rather concerned with the resulting asymptotic distribution. But I think I get what you want to know. The law of large numbers ensures the consistency for the average/mean calculation and you question what ensures the consistency of the variance etc. estimation. In general, when calculating these statistics, one swaps out theoretical moments by empirical moments. For instance, if in your formula appears E(X) we estimate empirically (1/T)*sum(X). This is also done when calculating the variance, SD etc. Hence, the consistency of the first moment (sample mean) also ensures the consistency of higher moments if they are finite.
