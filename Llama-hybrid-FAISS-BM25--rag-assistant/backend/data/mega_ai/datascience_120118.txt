Using time serie to predict another variable

I would like to analyse head rotation data in space. For this I measured at 15HZ the rotation around the X, Y and Z angles for a little more than ten minutes. I would like to use these movements to analyse a second variable, also continuous, but with a single measurement. I have 35 participants, and if necessary I can use only one of the axes that is more informative than the others (Z axis). I have already done the classic analyses (velocity, coefficient of variation etc), but I would like to explore the possibility of training a model to predict the second variable, but all I can find is to predict a data item following the time series. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!
