Is ALE plot value constant for observations in the same interval?

I have been reading Chapter 8.2 of the Interpretable Machine Learning about Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots. It includes the following formula which defines the ALE value for a given value of feature x_j: As I understand it, the second term on the right side is mean and it will be constant for all values of x_j. At the same time, the first term will be constant for all value of x_j that end up in the same interval. Based on that, ALE curve should look like a step function. However, this is not consistent with Figure 8.10 where the function is linear: I suppose, there is a mistake in my understanding of ALE curve. What am I missing?
