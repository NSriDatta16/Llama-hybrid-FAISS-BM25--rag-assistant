Imagine we begin with an empty stack of numbers. Then we start drawing pairs $(X,Y)$ from their joint distribution. One of four things can happen: If both X and Y are bigger then their respective averages we say the pair are similar and so we put a positive number onto the stack. If both X and Y are smaller then their respective averages we say the pair are similar and put a positive number onto the stack. If X is bigger than its average and Y is smaller than its average we say the pair are dissimilar and put a negative number onto the stack. If X is smaller than its average and Y is bigger than its average we say the pair are dissimilar and put a negative number onto the stack. Then, to get an overall measure of the (dis-)similarity of X and Y we add up all the values of the numbers on the stack. A positive sum suggests the variables move in the same direction at the same time. A negative sum suggests the variables move in opposite directions more often than not. A zero sum suggests knowing the direction of one variable doesn't tell you much about the direction of the other. It's important to think about 'bigger than average' rather than just 'big' (or 'positive') because any two non-negative variables would then be judged to be similar (e.g. the size of the next car crash on the M42 and the number of tickets bought at Paddington train station tomorrow). The covariance formula is a formalisation of this process: $\text{Cov}(X,Y)=\mathbb E[(X−E[X])(Y−E[Y])]$ Using the probability distribution rather than monte carlo simulation and specifying the size of the number we put on the stack.
