Put the current value of a style attribute to a variable

I have the following dynamic code. I want to put the position values "left" and "top" into variables. These values change as I drag this around the screen. What I would like to do is to store the last values so that when it gets destroyed, I can reuse the values to position it at the same place the next time. I have the selector I think but then I am a little fussy var xyz = $(".soft_add_wrapper ui-draggable").attr xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
