I don't think that what you are wanting to do is possible out of the box. This may seem like overkill for your situation, however, I have worked for a client who wanted some custom features like this. Given that Report Manager is so inflexible out of the box, we wrote a new front end leveraging the Reporting Services Service. We could then write our own extended capabilities right into the new viewer. This link describes it a bit more. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms159218.aspx
