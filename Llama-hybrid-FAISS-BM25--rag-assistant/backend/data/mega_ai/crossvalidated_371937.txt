Dealing with small sample size

The objective is to classify a variable Y which is binary, outcomes [0,1], where all the features $X_1$ .... $X_{156}$ are normalized and continuous. The methods I'm using are Logistic regression and XGBoost, I'm rather new when it come to this method. The result after using feature selection gives an AUC a bit under $70\%$ . The reason I think that the result is rather poor might be because of the data. So I've got data with the following dimension: 156 features and 625 data points. It would seem that the sample size is too small in relation to the amount of features. Thus I wonder if a resampling method would be adequate such as bootstrap?
