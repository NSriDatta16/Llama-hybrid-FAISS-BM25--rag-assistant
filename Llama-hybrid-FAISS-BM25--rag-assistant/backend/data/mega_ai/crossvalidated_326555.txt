The described time series can be modeled as $ X(t) = \sum_{i=1,...,N(t)} Y_i, $ where $ Y_1,...,Y_n,... $ are iid with the distribution function $G(y)$, $N(t)$ is a counting process with stochastic intensity $\lambda(t)$. Function $G(y)$ can be estimated from the data nonparametrically or parametrically, while intensity $\lambda(t)$ can be modeled as a function of various exogenous processes $Z(t)$ and estimated via the method of maximum likelihood... Stochastic process $X(t)$ is known as compound counting process .
