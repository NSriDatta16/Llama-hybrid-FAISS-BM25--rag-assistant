The solution is to make the container the sortable, and change the .items property to look for your items within the list. $('.items_box').sortable({ connectWith: '.items_box', items: '> .items > li' }); I have posted a working example for you (although there are issues with dragging into an empty list, but that's a new problem ;) Note also that connectWith no longer allows arrays of selectors. Seperate them with commas instead.
