analysis of bank account record

I am new to the field of time series analysis, but I would like to have a look at my bank account and determine my spending habits. I read a lot about clustering of multiple time series but I think I need to decomposition /break up only one (my cashflow) time series into its patterns and then classify them. Could you point me into the right direction? / recommend some R packages for this purpose.
