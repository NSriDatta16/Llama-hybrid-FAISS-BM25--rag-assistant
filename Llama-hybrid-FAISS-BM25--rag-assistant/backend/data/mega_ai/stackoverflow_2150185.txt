How to generate typed datasets for multiple database platforms?

I want to generate a typed DataSet for both Oracle and DB2 databases from a single XSD file. Background: When I drag a table onto the Visual Studio Dataset Designer, it generates a XSD file (e.g. DataSet1.xsd) with all appropriate information. Then VS invokes the built-in Tool (MSDataSetGenerator) to generate the Dataset classes into the CS file. Somehow (I don't know how) CS determines the Data provider and generates Dataset classes that refer to the data provider (OracleDataProvider or IBM.Data.Provider). Question: Does anybody know how I can customize VS to compile both for DB2 and Oracle code generation ? Best regards Oliver
