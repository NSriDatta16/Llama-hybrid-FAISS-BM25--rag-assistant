I would like to know the proportion of a population that has disease x. Assuming that this is your end goal, your sampling plan is not a good one. At some point I stop and then taking my positivity proportion and the number I've tested, I apply it to some distribution (skewed I would guess) and get an estimate of what the actual proportion of the population has the disease with some kind of confidence interval. The distribution that you are looking for here is dependent upon the population distribution. The magic of taking a random sample is that the sampling distribution (for simple random samples) of various population statistics tend to behave nicely in expectation even for poorly shaped population distributions . This last point is key, because otherwise you need to worry about the "worst case scenario". Since your method is not guaranteed to perform well even in the worst case scenario, let's contemplate what might happen if you attempt to do priority sampling in a particular situation. Suppose that we have a population where 90% of people have a disease, and 10% do not. Furthermore, we have 100 groups of people. For the sake of argument, let's consider the situation where those 100 groups are each either full of people who have the disease or do not. We "priority sample" the top 90 groups. What is our result? Our estimate of the percent of people who have the disease is 100%, which is incorrect. If we attempt to "account" for the discrepancy in some methodical fashion, we will still get an overestimate of the true population proportion (since the remaining population all lack the disease: the worst case scenario for your estimator). This is what is referred to as a biased estimator . Generally, we want an unbiased estimator, which means that our estimator is "on average" the true population value. Worse, accounting for the skewed sample after the fact relies crucially on the real-world problem, and isn't helped by the mathematics. To illustrate: it might have turned out that the remaining 10 groups all had the disease (100%). The priority sampling estimate therefore only tells us that the proportion is somewhere between 90% and 100%. The magic of random sampling is that we can obtain probabilistic bounds on the proportion for any population distribution, so long as we perform our sampling randomly. Since our counterexample shows that your method hinges crucially on the actual population distribution, there can be no such bounds. OTOH, if your objective was to obtain a lower bound for the proportion, then your method might be helpful. Of course, you'll have to make some very restrictive assumptions on the distributions for the groupings, which will be a hard problem to overcome, but I suppose it's not impossible.
