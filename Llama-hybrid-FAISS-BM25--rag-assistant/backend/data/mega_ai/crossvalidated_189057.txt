Statistical test to verify when two similar time series start to diverge

As from title I would like to know if exist a statistical test that can help me to identify a significant divergence between two similar time series. Specifically, looking the figure below, I would like to detect that the series start to diverge at time t1, ie when the difference between them starts to be significant. Moreover, I would also detect when the difference between the series returns to be not significant. Is there any useful statistical test to do this?
