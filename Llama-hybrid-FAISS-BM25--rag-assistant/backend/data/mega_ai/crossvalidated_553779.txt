Thank you for your comment, Gilbert. Yes, I would like to evaluate how time-varying covariates (pre-post clinical tests) can explain differences among sequences of a clinical sample. By sequences, I mean trajectories (longitudinal data) composed of different states ordered chronologically as in a life event (in my study, a state would be a type of medication). Thus, during one sequence, an individual can have several medications during a determined time period. See the picture below as an example. In social studies, one normally introduces gender or educational level as covariates for evaluating differences among educational/career sequences (how x factor explains differences among x trajectories). However, I would like to use a time-varying covariate to explain a clinical trajectory, if that makes sense. For example, how much change in physical disability (measured by pre-post clinical test) explains the differences in the medication choices taken throughout a specific period of the disease. My question was more methodologically oriented, as i am not sure the approach I want to do is valid. Any comments or suggestions would be of great help as I'm quite a newbie here... Thank you!! /Ale
