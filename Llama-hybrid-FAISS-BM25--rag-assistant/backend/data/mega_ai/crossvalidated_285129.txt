May I mix continuous/fractional, and binary variables as independent variables in logistic regression?

Doesn't the different distribution shapes of the respective variables (e.g., binary vs. fractional) influence the regression coefficients per se? As the binary variable represents only "extreme values" of the fractional variable, 0 or 1. Example: dependent variable: payment yes/no 0,1 independent variable a): gender male/female 0,1 ind. var. b): percentage of items in the basket that are green [0,1] => IV a) can only have 2 values 0 or 1, whereas IV b) can have infinite values between 0 and 1
