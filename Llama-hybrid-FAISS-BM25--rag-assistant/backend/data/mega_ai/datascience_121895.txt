comparing different approaches in machine learning

how to determine the best strategy for my machine learning model? For instance, let's consider a scenario where I am working with linear regression and want to compare three different approaches. The first approach involves using all features as inputs, the second approach entails manually selecting the most correlated feature as input, and the third approach involves implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Given these three approaches, is it appropriate to evaluate each one using k-fold cross-validation without retraining the model, and then compare the results of the cross-validation to determine the best approach without using test dataset ?
