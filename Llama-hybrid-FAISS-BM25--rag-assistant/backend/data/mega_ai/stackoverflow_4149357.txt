Pumping Lemma with Context Free Languages

I have the language {a^i b^j c^k | i,j,k>=0 & i>j & j>k} I began by assuming some m is picked for me, such that a string z = a^m b^(m-1) c^(m-2) Then the string is split up into (z =) uvwxy so that vx are not empty and #(vwx) Then when I get to pick an " i " I get confused. Say I pick i=1 then I have: uv^1wx^1y and I'm not entirely sure where to go from that because to me it looks like I could pick a vwx that IS in the language. Any suggestions?
