I'm not clear from your question but: If you want settings that you can change at run time (once deployed) then store this information in IsolatedStorage . You can use an IsolatedStorageFile or IsolatedStorageSettings depending on what is most appropriate to your data. I've done this lots by having default settings in code which I write to an IsolatedStorageFile on first run of the app. These can then be read and updated as necessary. If you just want change the values at build time, include the settings in a/the resources (.resx) file.
