Background image that shows when list is empty in Flex

How would I display a backgroundImage on a List when the List is empty? At the moment the list is populated when items are dropped inside after a drag-and-drop but I would prefer a solution that checks for any change to the data to determine if the list is empty. The List inherits a backgroundImage from its ScrollControlBase but what would be the best way to make it appear when the list is empty and disappear when an item is added. Any suggestions? Thanks!
