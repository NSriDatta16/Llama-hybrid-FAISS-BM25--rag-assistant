How do I get past the empty Xcode Organizer window in order to provision a development device?

I'm new to iOS development. I just installed Xcode 3.2.4 and the iOS 4.1 SDK on my Intel iMac running Snow Leopard. According to the docs, I first need to create a development profile by specifying a device (which in my case is an iPod touch 4G), but the Organizer window that I open up after starting Xcode comes up fully blank.
