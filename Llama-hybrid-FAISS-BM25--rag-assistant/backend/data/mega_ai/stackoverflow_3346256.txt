REST-ful Workflow Service with .NET 4.0

With WCF, we can create services that can accept leverage HTTP POST and simple accept an XElement as it's parameter. I'd like to do something similar with a workflow service so that I can use jQuery to post an xml infoset to a service, have it run through a bunch of rules and then return an xml infoset. With a WCF service, I can simply decorate the operation w/ WebInvoke and go on my merry way. Is it possible to use WebInvoke w/ a Workflow Service and if so, how should I go about?
