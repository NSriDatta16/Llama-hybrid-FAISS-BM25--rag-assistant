Is this a proper usage of the struct element in C#? Kind of confused

I'm making a class that will read information from resource files (doesn't matter the type of resource file, just for clarification) and pass the information on a Form for easy manipulation of information. My questions is should I use a struct to easily organize the information and then pass a List to a Form looking to utilize the information? A typical set of information I will be scraping is for example: [Hero Name] [Hero Type] [Starting HP] [Starting Mana] [Portrait] [Backstory] [Spell 1] [Spell 1 Description] [Spell 2] [Spell 2 Description] [Spell 3] [Spell 3 Description] [Spell 4] [Spell 4 Description ] Should I use a struct for this case? Hero name is a string, hero type as well. But for example, the [Portrait] will be an image. Can a struct hold multiple Data Types?
