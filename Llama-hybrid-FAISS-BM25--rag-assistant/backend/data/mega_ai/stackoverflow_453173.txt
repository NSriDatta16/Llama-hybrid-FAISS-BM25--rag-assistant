The registry is a no-go. You're not sure whether the user which uses your application, has sufficient rights to write to the registry. You can use the app.config file to save application-level settings (that are the same for each user who uses your application). I would store user-specific settings in an XML file, which would be saved in Isolated Storage or in the SpecialFolder.ApplicationData directory. Next to that, as from .NET 2.0, it is possible to store values back to the app.config file.
