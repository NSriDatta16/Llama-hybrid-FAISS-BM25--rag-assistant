Pay attention to the "Output" window in VS. It will tell you what assemblies are loaded and when. You may see that an older version of your assembly somewhere in the folder is being loaded. For example if you have multiple assemblies and you are currently trying to break in one of the support assemblies, the CLR will handle the assembly resolving, which may load another assembly file than the one you have referenced in the project.
