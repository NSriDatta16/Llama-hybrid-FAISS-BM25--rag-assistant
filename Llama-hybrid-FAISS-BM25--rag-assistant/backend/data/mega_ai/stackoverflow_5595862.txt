One issue I have with the following code is you have no control over the output stream, your letting PHP handle it without knowing exactly what is going on within the background: What you should do is set up an output system that you can control and replicated accros servers. For example: if (file_exists($file)) { if (FALSE!== ($handler = fopen($file, 'r'))) { header('Content-Description: File Transfer'); header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream'); header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='.basename($file)); header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: chunked'); //changed to chunked header('Expires: 0'); header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0'); header('Pragma: public'); //header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($file)); //Remove //Send the content in chunks while(false !== ($chunk = fread($handler,4096))) { echo $chunk; } } exit; } echo " Content error The file does not exist! "; This is only basic but give it a go! Also read my reply here: file_get_contents => PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory exhausted
