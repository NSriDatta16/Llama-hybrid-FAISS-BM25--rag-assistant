Yes, you can use a multilevel model in a situation like this. However, you can only include a random intercept, not a random slope, because your predictor would only have one value per cluster. In lmer model This model will give you the estimate of (between-person differences in) covariate predicting y while controlling for the non-independence of your y observations. An example would be a study where participants' mood is measured, say, 5 times a day for 10 days (i.e. 50 times). We also measure their trait Anxiety (only once per participant, because we consider it a trait). We then use a multilevel model with a random intercept of participant for predicting mood from trait anxiety because the mood observations are non-independent. The estimate for trait Anxiety would tell you how strongly between-person differences in trait Anxiety are related to momentary mood scores. Say it's negative - we'd then conclude that on average, people with higher trait Anxiety experienced more negative mood during the follow-up 10 days than people with low trait Anxiety. Edited to add: I realized I don't actually know if the results of the above would be any different from a single-level model with (e.g.) trait Anxiety predicting average mood (averaged over the 50 occasions). I ran some tests with actual data and the results were almost identical, but I'm not sure about the mathematical differences.
