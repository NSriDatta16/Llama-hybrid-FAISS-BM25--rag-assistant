How to resolve Google Maps Javascript conflict with Wordpress admin Javascript

I have this webshop that is currently deployed, and it is based on Wordpress. I have added a functionality where-in if the administrator types in the address, the Map will be shown. So far so good, things are doing great. However, I noticed that whenever I add this: wp_enqueue_script('googlemap', 'http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false', array(), false, true); which obviously is the Google Map js, the drag and drop functionality of the Wordpress Admin (most obviously the Widget area) doesn't work. I tried commenting this line, and voila, drag and drop of widgets is back, but of course no Google Maps. Have you encountered this as well? How did you go about this? Currently I am operating my admin page via the non-javascript version of Widgets. Workable, but not ideal.
