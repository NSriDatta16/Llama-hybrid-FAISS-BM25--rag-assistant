The difference between Feature selection and PCA to improve accuracy

I have a dataset of 21 features where each numeric feature has various scale something like the following: budget title_year actor_2_facebook_likes imdb_score aspect_ratio movie_facebook_likes 237000000 2009 936 7.9 1.78 33000 300000000 2007 5000 7.1 2.35 0 245000000 2015 393 6.8 2.35 85000 250000000 2012 23000 8.5 2.35 164000 263700000 2012 632 6.6 2.35 24000 258000000 2007 11000 6.2 2.35 0 260000000 2010 553 7.8 1.85 29000 250000000 2015 21000 7.5 2.35 118000 250000000 2009 11000 7.5 2.35 10000 250000000 2016 4000 6.9 2.35 197000 209000000 2006 10000 6.1 2.35 0 200000000 2008 412 6.7 2.35 0 I applied several classifiers such as SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests. However, I am getting accuracy around 60s even after adjusting the parameters of each classifier. Thus, I decided to work more with the dataset and make further preprocessing (specifically, normalization and feature selection). Kindly, I have two questions: Which one is the correct way and why: Performing feature selection after or before normalization? I understand PCA is a dimensionality reduction but I don't understand what is the difference between PCA and feature selection as both will eventually rank the features for you. Thank you very much.
