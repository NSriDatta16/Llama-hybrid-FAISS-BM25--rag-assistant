Splitting image dataset with few subjects but many data

I'm carrying out training/testing of a convolutional neural network for facial expression recognition with various datasets - all labelled by 7 emotion classes. For other datasets, there are a large number of mostly unique subjects so I randomly split. In this case, however, there are only 6 subjects but a large number of images for each subject in each class. Randomly splitting seems ineffective because of the similarity in images - think of how an emotion changes per frame. Is the best method to separate an entire subject for testing? Or something else? I did run the network with random splitting and achieved 100% validation accuracy so I believe that is unlikely to be the best method. Thanks for your time.
