Perhaps there is so many options, I am not sure anyone to considered all options in full. Usually, the choice of language comes first and then you decide how to achieve the results you want. My guess is you have good options in just about any major general purpose language. This would have been an issue 10 years ago, but not today IMHO. A good comparison of available open source technologies in Java is http://java-sources.org/ As you drill down into each category, you can see this is fairly extensive and it does even consider commercial products or C# For any scalable system, you need to consider hardware solutions as well, such as network components. My suggestion for turning a low volume app into a high volume one, is start with something fairly high volume in the first place and expect to re-engineer it as you go. What sort of volumes are you talking about? Everyone has different expectations of high and low volume. e.g. When google have lower than average volumes they switch of whole data centres to save power. ;)
