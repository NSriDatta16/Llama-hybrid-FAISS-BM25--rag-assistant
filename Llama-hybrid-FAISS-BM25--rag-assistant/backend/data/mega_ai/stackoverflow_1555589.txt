On way I would try first, is opening the EDMX in the XML editor and finding the sproc (Function) in the StorageModel element, copy it, giving it a new name. Then you can map one actual stored procedure twice once as the Insert Modification function once as the Update Modification function. I haven't actually tried this, but I can't see why this won't work. Hope this helps Alex James, Program Manager, Microsoft
