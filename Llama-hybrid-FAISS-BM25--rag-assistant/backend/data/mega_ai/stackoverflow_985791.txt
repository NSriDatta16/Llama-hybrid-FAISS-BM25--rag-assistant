Is there a charting library that supports multiple stacked column charts on the same 3D axes?

I have a very specific requirement that I can't find a charting library for. I need to show multiple stacked column or step-area charts on the same 3D axes to compare multiple periods of time to each other - for example, the y axis would show sales volume with regions stacked above each other, the x axis hours of the day and the z axis selected days to compare. In addition, I'd like the chart to be real 3D and draggable rather than a basic static isometric view. There is an expensive Java library that may be able to do an isometric version of the chart I need called EasyCharts ; it's visual quality isn't as good as I'd like. None of the Flash libraries I found ( AnyChart , FusionCharts , XML/SWF Charts ) can combine multiple stacked charts.
