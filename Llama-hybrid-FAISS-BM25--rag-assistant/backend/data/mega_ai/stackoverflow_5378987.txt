Most of the Maps API's will do what your asking easily. You should read this Google Maps API-Jscript This will get you started. This is the actual API reference and is where you will find Maps, Controls, Overlays and Services. Pay special attention to the Overlays section, this is what you need to place your points on a map as well as custom images or graphics. The rest is programming. If you have specific questions regrading programming your best bet is to try some of this in your code and come back with code examples of what you're trying. Hope this helps.
