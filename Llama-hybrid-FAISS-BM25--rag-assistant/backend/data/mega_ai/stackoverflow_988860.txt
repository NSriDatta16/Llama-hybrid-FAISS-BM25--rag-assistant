IsolatedStorage is basically a closed of area on the endusers filesystem. Compare it to cookies. Browsers can only store information on an end user's machine as a cookie, the browsers determines the location of the cookie storage. You can manipulate files in the isolatedstorage, but cannot go outside it. My question, what kind of app is it (Windows, Web, Silverlight)? If it's a windows app you can basically do anything you want, since it's installed on the end user's machine.
