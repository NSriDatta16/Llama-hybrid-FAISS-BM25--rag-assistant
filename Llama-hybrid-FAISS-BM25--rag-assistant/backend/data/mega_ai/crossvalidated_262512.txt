$\theta$ is the same random variable in both the posterior and the prior. The difference is that in the posterior you are conditioning on the data. It's your understanding of the values $\theta$ can take after you've considered the data whereas the prior is your understanding before considering the data. The $|X$ is already distinguishes the two so you don't need a subscript like $\theta_{post}$ and $\theta_{prior}$! It would be both redundant and confusing. I also strongly suggest you do not drop the $|X$ part as in $P_{post}(\theta)$. In Bayesian statisics, it's very important to remember what information you're conditioning on. Leaving the $|X$ in there will emphasis this.
