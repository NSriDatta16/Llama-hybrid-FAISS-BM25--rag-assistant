I've copied text from the Console window and pasted it into another source many times. It's there as default in a Console application; Right click the console border: Select Edit > Mark: Drag over the text you want using the mouse (Or use the arrow keys) to select the text you want: Again, right click on the console border and select Edit > Copy: From here you can paste it into another application as you would with any other text. This was taken from a C# Console application and the only code entered was the command to write to the console, no settings were changed. Hope this helps!
