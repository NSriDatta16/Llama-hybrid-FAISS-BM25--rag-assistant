I asked this question specifically to MS (via email) and have not gotten a good answer yet. The helpdesk people apparently cannot understand English. I will report when I get a good answer. EDIT I called MSDN today and they said I just get downloads - no physical media. I have found that the MSDN site has errors a lot. I also find the whole site extremely disorganized and non-intuitive. (it has been like that for years - even as a user at a company with bulk licenses) http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/d/4/4d41081a-d8d9-407a-9bae-5127e6e931ca/BizSpark%20Startup%20Program%20Guide.pdf
