git rebase --interactive will let you squash, edit, split and delete commits, it's a very powerful command (risky too). Since git rebase is a history rewriting command, beware of using it on branches that were either push/pulled. Keep in mind though that it's considered good practice to split your changes over several commits, rather than one gigantic commit.
