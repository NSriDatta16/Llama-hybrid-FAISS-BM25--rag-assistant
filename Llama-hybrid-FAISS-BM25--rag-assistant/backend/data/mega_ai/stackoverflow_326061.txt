One good test I always make for myself is opening the page and ctrl+scroll. The zooming gives you an immediate idea about how flexible and liquid your design is. In IE this tends to fail no matter what, but there you could also try to make the font bigger and see what happens (pay attention to buttons stretching vertically for example)
