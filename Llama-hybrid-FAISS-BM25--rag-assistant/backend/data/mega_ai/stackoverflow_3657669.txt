does yum keep cache of not successfull update

I would like to know does yum keep cash of downloaded packages if update was not successful, for example during update computer was restarted, but some packages were downloaded. Will it redownload already downloaded packages or will continue downloading others ? Actually keepcache option in config file says that it keeps downloaded files if installation was successful ... but what about it it is not successful ?
