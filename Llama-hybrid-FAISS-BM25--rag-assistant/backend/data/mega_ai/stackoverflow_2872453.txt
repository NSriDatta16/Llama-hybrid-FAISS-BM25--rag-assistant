Pulling the idea from Multi-tenant data storage, you can use the 'Name-Pair' values idea as described on MSDN . I somehow think that this article will be more useful apart from the specific section noted. In effect, to make this a scalable solution, you will need to define the types of data for your custom form using a metadata table wherein you define the actual type of the data you want to store (eg bool, text, int, datetime). You may also consider storing the .Net type as well since this may be able to assist you when it comes to input validation etc. Other details that may be stored as well are the the name of the fields as you would expect them to appear on your custom form. Using this approach you build a custom form based on the stored metadata. I have successfully used this approach and it works great. As an addition, we also used the metadata table to define whether the expected value for the custom field is user provided (eg name, date of birth) or a pre-defined system value in drop-downlist (eg a list of citye, countries). To support this, we have an additional table, that contains options for the list which is linked back to metadata table.
