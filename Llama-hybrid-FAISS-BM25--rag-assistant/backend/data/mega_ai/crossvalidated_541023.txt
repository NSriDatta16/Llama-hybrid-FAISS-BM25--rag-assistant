Forecasting Future Values of Time Series

I am working with the R programming language. In particular, I am using "Markov Switching Models" for the purpose modelling more complicated dataset with varying degrees of volatility. For this problem, I am using the "MSwM" package in R: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MSwM/MSwM.pdf https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MSwM/vignettes/examples.pdf I am following the first example from the "vignettes": #load library library(MSwM) #load data data(example) #plot data plot(ts(example)) #fit basic model mod=lm(y~x,example) #fit markov switching model: mod.mswm=msmFit(mod,k=2,p=1,sw=c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE),control=list(parallel=FALSE)) The above code successfully creates the model - 2 "Regimes" have been identified: Question: I checked the documentation of this package, and there does not seem to be any functions that allow you to predict future values of this time series. I did some research and it seems like the "Markov Switching Model" should allow you to predict future values of a time series, e.g. : How to forecast a Markov Switching Model OR: However, there does not seem to be a straightforward way to do this in R. Can someone please suggest how to resolve this problem? Thanks
