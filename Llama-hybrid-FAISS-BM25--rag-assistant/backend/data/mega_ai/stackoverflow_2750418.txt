can use more than 1 column in MySQL Group BY?

I want to write these SQL Query: CREATE VIEW `uniaverage` AS SELECT `averagegrade`.`mjr`,`averagegrade`.`lev`, AVG(`averagegrade`.`average`) AS `uniAVG` FROM `averagegrade` GROUP BY `averagegrade`.`lev`, `averagegrade`.`mjr`; But MySQL Query Browser gives me this error: Operand Should Contain 1 column(s) I somewhere read that I can use group by on more than 1 column!!! How can I solve this error? or how can I change the Query to get the same result?
