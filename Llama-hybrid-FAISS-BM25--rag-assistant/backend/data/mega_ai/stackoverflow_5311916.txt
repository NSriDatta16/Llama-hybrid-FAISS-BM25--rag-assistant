Normally you would check the user agent string when a user makes a request to your site. How you would do this is dependent on your server-side programming language/environment. But when you check the string you would simply compare it to known "mobile browsers" and would forward the user to the other URL accordingly. It's not really "changing the URL" to something other than a "normal URL" it's just checking a condition at the request time and forwarding the user to a different site if the condition is met.
