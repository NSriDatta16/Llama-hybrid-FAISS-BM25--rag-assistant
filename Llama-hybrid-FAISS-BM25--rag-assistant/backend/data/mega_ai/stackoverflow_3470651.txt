You could make a static server. Add a DNS entry to something like static.yoursite.com. Link to those files from your other sites -- probably you could just modify the HTML helper so that it will automatically create links to the other domain. This can help with performance, because you can run something like nginx to serve these static files. It will also parallelize the resource retrievals -- most browsers will allow 2 connections to a given server, so the static stuff competes with those connection resources that are needed by the dynamic stuff. In essence, the user will start 2 connections to your dynamic stuff as well as 2 connections to the static resources. Works pretty well IME.
