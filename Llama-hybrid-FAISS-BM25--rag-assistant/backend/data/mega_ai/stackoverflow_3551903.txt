How do you start a software architecture discussion?

I work for an organization that is pretty much a start-up within a large corporation. The team has several database engineers, and a few software engineers (in the data mining field). We're growing at a fast rate, which puts the need to have an overall architecture strategy or technology roadmap (or compass) for the next few years. As a software engineer, I've been assigned the task to start off on bi-monthly meetings to lead that discussion. So, my question is, how do you kick-off your role as an architect? how do you start off an organization-wide architecture discussion? I started reading the book "97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know", but I'd like to hear more from your experiences. So, as an architect, how did you start? Best regards,
