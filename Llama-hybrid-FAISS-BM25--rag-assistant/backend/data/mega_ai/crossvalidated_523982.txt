Is there a standard "height" (or ordinate) and "width" for a normal distribution?

I am trying to understand if/how one might be able to infer standard deviation given only a mean and a sample size (and perhaps the min and max values). I realize that mathematically this is impossible as one needs to know the individual scores of the sample to calculate SD; however, I was wondering if an SD could be approximated given the aforementioned information using the same kinds of assumptions we use for the GLM. To that end, I was wondering if there is a standard "form" that makes up a normal distribution. I.e., if an extremely low SD and high mean makes a "tall" and "skinny" normal distribution, and an extremely high SD and low mean makes a "short" and "wide" normal distribution, then is there some description for what shape the "average" normal distribution is (and I don't mean in terms of skewness or kurtosis; I'm referring more to the "height" and "width" of the curve)?
