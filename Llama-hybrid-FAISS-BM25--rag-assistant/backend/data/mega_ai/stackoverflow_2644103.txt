object won't die (still references to it that I can't find)

I'm using parallel-python and start a new job server in a function. after the functions ends it still exists even though I didn't return it out of the function (I used weakref to test this). I guess there's still some references to this object somewhere. My two theories: It starts threads and it logs to root logger. My questions: can I somehow findout in which namespace there is still a reference to this object. I have the weakref reference. Does anyone know how to detach a logger? What other debug suggestions do people have? here is my testcode: def pptester(): js=pp.Server(ppservers=nodes) js.set_ncpus(0) fh=file('tmp.tmp.tmp','w') tmp=[] for i in range(200): tmp.append(js.submit(ppworktest,(),(),('os','subprocess'))) js.print_stats() return weakref.ref(js) thanks in advance Wolfgang
