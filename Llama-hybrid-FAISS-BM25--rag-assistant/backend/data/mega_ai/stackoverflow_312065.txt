My humble experience, although not related to selling games, tells me: editors often don't use the best names for these "slugs", they don't chose them wisely. many items belong (logically) to several categories, so why restrict them (technically) to a single category? Better design item urls by ids, (i.e. /item/435/ ) ids are stable (generated by the db, not editable by the editor), so the url stands a much bigger chance at not being changed over time they don't expose (or depend on) the organization of the objects in the database like the category/item_name style of urls does. What if you change the underlying design (object structure) to allow an item to belong to multiple categories? the category/item urls suddenly won't make sense anymore; you'll change your url design and old urls might not work anymore. Labels are better than categories. That is to say, allowing an item to belong to several categories is a better approach than assigning one category to each item.
