Dimensionality reduction for high dimensional sparse data before clustering or spherical k-means?

I am trying to build my first recommender system where i create a user feature space and then cluster them into different groups. Then for the recommendation to work for a particular user , first i find out the cluster to which the user belongs and then recommend entities(items) in which his/her nearest neighbor showed interest. The data which i am working on is high dimensional and sparse. Before implementing the above approach, there are few questions, whose answers might help me in adopting a better approach. As my data is high dimensional and sparse, should i go for dimensionality reduction and then apply clustering or should I go for an algorithm like spherical K-means which works on sparse high dimensional data? How should I find the nearest neighbors after creating clusters of users.(Which distance measure should i take as i have read that Euclidean distance is not a good measure for high dimensional data)?
