PHP doesn't do much forward checking of things at parse time. The best you can do is crank up the warning level to report your mistakes, but by the time you get an E_NOTICE, its too late, and its not possible to force E_NOTICES to occur in advance yet. A lot of people are toting the "error_reporting E_STRICT" flag, but its still retroactive warning, and won't protect you from bad code mistakes like you posted. This gem turned up on the php-dev mailing-list this week and I think its just the tool you want. Its more a lint-checker, but it adds scope to the current lint checking PHP does. PHP-Initialized Google Project There's the hope that with a bit of attention we can get this behaviour implemented in PHP itself. So put your 2-cents on the PHP mailing list / bug system / feature requests and see if we can encourage its integration.
