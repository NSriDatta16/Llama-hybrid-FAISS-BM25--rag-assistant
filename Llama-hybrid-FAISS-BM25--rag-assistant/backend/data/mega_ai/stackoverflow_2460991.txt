How to interpret GestureRecognizer results sort order?

The documentation for the GestureRecognizer class in .NET states that the sort order of the results returned by the Recognize method has to do with how strong the confidence is. However, when I created my own sample (in WPF, .NET 3.5sp1) that creates a recognizer I do not see this behavior. For the record, i set the recognizer to recognize all possible gestures ( ApplicationGesture.AllGestures ). My code starts with MouseDown and then records all points on MouseMove until it receives a MouseUp event which then calls recognizer.Recognize() on a stroke generated from all these points (typically in the range of 100 points or so). What I often get is 4+ hits sorted like this (reported confidence in brackets): NoGesture (Strong) ArrowLeft (Intermediate) Square (Strong) ChevronDown (Strong) Is this a bug? Should I only pay attention to the first item in the array?
