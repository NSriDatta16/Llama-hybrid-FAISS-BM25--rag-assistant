C#: Creation of a Google Map with a line?

after three days of trying I'm near giving it up.. I try to use the Google Maps API to create a map with a longer line formed by several points. Unfortunately not even uploading a XML file worked out for me (Though I successfully authorized myself with my Google account). Can someone please give me help and post a C#/VB code (snippet) on how to create a map and draw a line on it? Thanks for you help! Norbert
