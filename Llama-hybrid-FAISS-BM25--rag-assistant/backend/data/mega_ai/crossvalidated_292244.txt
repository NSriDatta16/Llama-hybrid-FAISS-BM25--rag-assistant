[I did not read your code. I'm answering the statistical question.] Sure, you can do a Metropolis update on each of the generations from full conditional distributions; this would just be the extreme version of a Metropolis-within-Gibbs -- it's like Gibbs sampling because every one of the conditionals you want to sample from would be conditional on all the others (and it's an extreme form of M-within-G in the sense that every one of those full conditional draws is obtained via a Metropolis-Hastings step). [You can also do numerous other variations on just sampling full conditionals -- you just have to establish the usual properties of the Markov Chain you need; this is usually reasonably straightforward to argue, but in some situations you can get yourself into a situation where it's possible to screw things up (where the properties you require won't necessarily hold) so you can't just assume something works.] You should, however, consider the sampling scheme: it's better to have a reversible scheme than just to cycle through $\theta_1,\theta_2,...,\theta_k$ (for example you can randomize the order or you can go forward and then backward within each iteration -- those are examples of reversible schemes). It's not necessarily ideal to work this way, but there's nothing stopping you doing it in general.
