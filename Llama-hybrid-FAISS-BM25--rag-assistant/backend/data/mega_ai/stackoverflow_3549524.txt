Zend_Search_Lucene, how to share an index storage folder over network

I am running web application on two different servers with load balancing, and using Zend_Search_Lucene for indexing documents. Now I am facing indexing issue which a user comes to the site through server #1 and stores information, Zend_Search_Lucene stores index only server #1. So once another user comes to the site through server #2 and search, only the indexes in server #2 retrieve. Is there any way to share an index storage folder to be accessed by both servers? Or is there any way to store indexes in mysql database, not a file system?
