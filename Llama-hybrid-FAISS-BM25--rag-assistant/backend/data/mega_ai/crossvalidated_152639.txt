How to extrapolate future probability density functions if you have a time series of them as input?

This is my current situation: I am given an observations vector $\textbf{X}$ of continuous variables with a time component $T$ (not equallly distanced). My supervisor approximates densities with spatio-temporal kernel density estimation (stKDE) as part of the interpolation. I should now extrapolate future pdfs. My literature research has resulted in some areas I think could be of use to solve my problem: Methods of functional data analysis (FDA) combined with time series analysis? Methods of symbolic data analysis? (SDA) Conditional kernel density estimation? (cKDE) I only need some hints that will point me into the right direction and I would be glad if somebody can help me out.
