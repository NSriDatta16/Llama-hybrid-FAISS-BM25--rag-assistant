Is this table in 2NF?

In trying to learn about database normalization, I am confused by the following table: Name Date Organisms aging 1984-07-13 human aging 1984-07-13 worm wrinkle 1987-08-15 human wrinkle 1987-08-15 mouse hairy 1990-09-30 mouse The book I am using presents this as an example of a table in 1NF. However, after reading the Wikipedia articles on 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, I'm a bit confused. As far as I can tell, this table has two candidate keys: {Name,Organisms} and {Date,Organisms}. According to Wikipedia ( link text ): A 1NF table is in 2NF if and only if all its non-prime attributes are functionally dependent on the whole of every candidate key. (A non-prime attribute is one that does not belong to any candidate key.) By this definition for "non-prime attribute", it seems to me that this table has no non-prime attributes because every field belongs to at least one of the two candidate keys. If there are no non-prime attributes, then (since this table is in 1NF) it seems this table is in 2NF by the Wikipedia definition. However, I recognize that this table is poorly designed and prone to update errors, so I think I must be making an error in logic somewhere. If someone could explain which normal form this table is in and/or where my reasoning is faulty, I would greatly appreciate it.
