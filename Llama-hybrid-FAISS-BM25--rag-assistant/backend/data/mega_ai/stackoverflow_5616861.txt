Use HTML5: http://davidwalsh.name/html5-elements-links HTML5 presents a simpler line of thought with HTML than XHTML. And quite honestly, it's a much needed simplification. One of those simplifications is the ability to wrap block-level elements like DIVs, H-tags, and P's with basic A elements. You read that correctly: wrap block-level elements with A tags. Personally, I've never worried about this. Yea, it's technically invalid, but I'm a fan of pragmatic validation.
