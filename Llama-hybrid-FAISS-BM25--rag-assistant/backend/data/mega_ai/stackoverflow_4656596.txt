Linq to SQL foreign key mapping

I'm trying to do a basic lnq to sql foreign key mapping using attributes. This should be really simple but I'm having a hard time finding decent info on it on the net. Where am I going wrong? Say for example you have a class named User with UserId, FirstName, LastName, Location on it. Location is an object called Location Location class has LocationId, StreetNum, Name, Suburb How do I map that with Linq to Sql? Here's what I'm trying [Column] public int LocationId { get; set; } private EntityRef _location; [Required(ErrorMessage = "Please enter your suburb")] [System.Data.Linq.Mapping.Association(Storage = "_location", ThisKey = "LocationId", IsForeignKey = true)] public Location Location { get { return this._location.Entity; } set { this._location.Entity = value; LocationId = value.LocationId; } } I'm getting this error: The null value cannot be assigned to a member with type System.Double which is a non-nullable value type. Can anyone help?
