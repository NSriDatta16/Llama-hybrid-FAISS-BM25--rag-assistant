I wouldn't promote the name 'k chart' for this. That term is already used as alternative for candlestick charts . In addition, just using a single letter as a name may sound cool, but it is also gimmicky. It is not very functional. These letters as name do occur, but are often more common for well known tools and used as abbreviation. The letter as a name comes afterwards and is typically not something to start with. I would use something more descriptive, for example: waterfall Pareto chart. Sidenote 1: The use of two y-axes is not very easy and when it is used it is more often in a technical and specialist environment. I see it for instance often used in bioengineering where technologist map the changes/timeseries for multiple parameters, and they may even use a third or fourth y-axis. The usefulness of this is that the links between the multiple time series can be seen more easily. In your graph, the use of visualizing this link might not be so much necessary. In addition, the information is already shown in the height of the bars. So adding the additional level chart adds relatively little and may be mostly confusing. Sidenote 2: Another problem with this chart is that it mostly functions when displaying a data for a single case. Line graphs allow you to place multiple cases along each other in a single chart. About the bonus question: I am afraid, that I need to say that this point is not of much use. Or, at least, it doesn't have any specific or special meaning. The reason is because the two y-axis scales have not much relevant relationship with each other. The one scale is the cumulative distribution, the other scale is the density or frequency distribution scaled by the value maximum. Sure, you can attach some meaning to the crossing point (more about that later)... but the choice of the point to attach this meaning to is arbitrary and not special, we could just as well use a different point, for instance the point where the one curve is 10% above the other curve. The crossing point has a visual relevance, but there is not another principle that makes this particular point important. So what does this point indicate? When this point is early, then it relates to a density/mass curve that is dropping relatively quickly. (and at the same time the Pareto curve increases more quickly) But, instead of finding the point where it crosses the pareto curve, we can just as well use the something like the halfway point, the point where the density/mass has dropped by half (or we use any other point instead of half, e.g. the point where the curve has dropped to '42%', but the use of '50%' is just easy or convenient).
