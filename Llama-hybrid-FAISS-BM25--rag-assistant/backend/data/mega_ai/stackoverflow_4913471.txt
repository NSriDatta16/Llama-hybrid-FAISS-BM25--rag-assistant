WebSphere Application Server returns principal and remote user only if you configure it to use the JavaEE security context for your web application. Edit your web.xml to contain something like userConstraint secure /* GET POST user user secrole user and redeploy your application. After deploying your application take a look at the application's settings in the Administrative Console. You will notice "User/role mapping". Add "all authenticated users from trusted realms" to the newly added role. Restart the application. After that anonymous users can not access your application anymore. Also, the getRemoteUser and other APIs will return the user properly.
