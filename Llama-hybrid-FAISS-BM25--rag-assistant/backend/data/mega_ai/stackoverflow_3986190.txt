I could solve the problem changing the encoding from UTF-8 to cp1252 (Windows western europe). Apparently UTF-8 could not encode some Windows characters. Thanks to Michael Shopsin above for the insight. The program runs on windows and uses WxPython dialog , getting values from a line edit widget and matching the string against a database. Thank you all for the attention, and I hope this post can help people in the future with a similar problem.
