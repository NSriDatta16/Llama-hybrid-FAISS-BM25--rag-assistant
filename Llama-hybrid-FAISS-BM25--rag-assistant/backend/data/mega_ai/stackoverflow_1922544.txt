If the user knows the precise value she or he wants from a well-sorted list with type-ahead, then over 1000 items is okay. Seriously. Try it yourself: Do a search of your hard drive that yields 1000 or so files and see how hard it is to scroll or type-ahead to a file you know is there. What matters more than the raw number of items is the ratio of items in the list to the items visible in your scrollable pane, whether you’re talking about a list box or the dropdown portion of a combo box. You want at least 5% of your items visible at a time. So for 1000 items, you need a pane about 800 pixels high (at 16 pixels per line). That sets about 1000 as the limit given typical low-end desktop monitor sizes. If you’re talking about users with laptops using a web site, then you’ve only got about 560 pixels (allowing for browser controls and such), so now you’re looking at 700 items. Still a lot. We’re assuming a proper scrollable list where the list scrolls instantly with dragging the slider. I only see a need for filtering/search controls (versus type ahead alone) when the number of items is more like 1000s than 100s, although you need to make exceptions for special cases (e.g., when the user doesn't really know what s/he precisely wants and needs to explore the alternatives on various criteria, or when there's a large number of items all beginning with the same 9 letters). Always have type-ahead. There no reason not to, and even with a small the number of items, it benefits users using the keyboard only rather than the mouse (very common for data entry). Treat it as a standard. You don't want users having to guess if you chose to have type-ahead or not for a given field ("Does he think 10 items is enough? Does he ever have it?"), so just have it all the time.
