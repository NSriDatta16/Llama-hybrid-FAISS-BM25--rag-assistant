self is just a shortcut that refers to the current class. The same way $this refers to the current object. class Foo { public function bar() { new self; new Foo; } } These are both the same things, both instantiate a new object from the class Foo . It's just more elegant to use self since you can change the class name of Foo without having to rename every use of it as well. So what your ::instantiate function is doing is to instantiate a new object of the same class, set a few properties on it and return it. The call to self::instantiate is just calling the instantiate method statically, the same way $this->instantiate() would call it as a method of the current object.
