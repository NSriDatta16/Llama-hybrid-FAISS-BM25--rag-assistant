jQuery mouse events on underlying objects while dragging image

I'm trying to implement a simple drag/drop of images between panels using jQuery. While dragging I create an thumbnail image that I position under the mouse. This part all works but since the mouse now always has the thumbnail under it I don't get mouseenter/leave on the underlying drop target panels. I was hoping to use these events to highlight the drop target panel during the drag. Is there a I can make the thumbnail not obscure these events? What else could I try to get this working? (I don't want to use jQueryUI in this case, cause I don't need it for anything else and it seems overkill. Also, this is a bit of a learning exercise for me, so I want to understand the options :).
