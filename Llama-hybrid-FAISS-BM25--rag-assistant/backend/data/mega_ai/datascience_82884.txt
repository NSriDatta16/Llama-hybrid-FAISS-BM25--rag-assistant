Channels and neurons in a CNN

I am in the process of learning what a convolutional layer is, and its functions. I have a couple of questions. One is what in_channels and out_channels are. In my code, I have the following: nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=64, kernel_size=(4,4), padding=1) I understand that the in_channels for this layer is 3 because RGB, but I'm confused on why out_channels is 64, and why I can change it to seemingly any other number without the program crashing. Another question is what exactly a "neuron" is. For convolutional layers, is a neuron each filter? Also, if it is, what do the activation functions judge when evaluating each filter?
