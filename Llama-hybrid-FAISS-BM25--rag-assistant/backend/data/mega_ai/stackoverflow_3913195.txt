How define images for arrows, drag and track in the new version of jScrollPane?

I downloaded the last version of jScrollPanel (2.0 beta 5) but when opened jquery.jscrollpane.css I can't find any rules to apply images for top and down arrow, instead I found only this rule .jspArrow . I try to add an background image and it worked but the image shows on the top and down, how I can specify image for each side and also for .jspTrack,.jspDrag Just like in the old version (v1). Thanks
