Assessing and interpreting the results of a multinomial logistic regression in R

I run a multinomial logistic regression. The input data are given below: And the results are available here . > summary(factors) Call: multinom(formula = Juice_knwolege ~ Age + Gender + Education + Access_to_resources, data = Juice) Coefficients: (Intercept) Age GenderMale EducationSecondary EducationTertiary No 134.56898 -5.029697 314.1956 -15.96461 -86.39731 Use To -99.23136 3.927217 122.5766 46.57026 -10.86831 Access_to_resourcesYes No -74.66129 Use To -235.86296 Std. Errors: (Intercept) Age GenderMale EducationSecondary EducationTertiary No 3.208056e+02 5.675463e+01 9.063978e-27 4.973037e-25 5.999055e-63 Use To 4.973037e-25 2.436788e-23 4.973037e-25 4.973037e-25 8.090522e-121 Access_to_resourcesYes No 3.208056e+02 Use To 4.390071e-29 Residual Deviance: 0.0001886377 AIC: 24.00019 I would like to establish whether the results are correct given the input dataset and how to interpret them in laymen terms. What does Yes mean in the results as reference in relation to No and Use To? The same apply to male in relation to female used as reference, primary as reference in relation to other education categories and No access to resources as a reference category in relation to yes. How do i interpret the reference with comparison to other categories and what does that really mean? My understanding is that the results must speak to the input dataset, for example, there is seven Yes and only four No and one Use To for the first column of juice practice. This means more people recorded Yes or can make Juice compared to those who cannot or Use To make juice (No and Use To). But I am failing to make sense of the results and contextualize it in a sensible way. Here is my interpretation; those who can make Juice (Yes) are 134.56898 times more that those who cannot make Juice (No) and those who can (Yes) are -99.23136 times less than those who Use To (looking at the intercept). Female can make juice (Yes) 314.1956 more times than males who cannot (No), and females Use to make juice 122.5766 more times than the male? This does not make sense given that there is no Use To for female and only one Use To for male when I look at the input data? Those who can make Juice (Yes/ref) are -15.96461 times less than those who cannot make Juice with Primary education (ref) compared to those who can with secondary education, and those who use to are 46.57026 times more compared to those who can? I would also like to find out why are some values negative and others positive? And how do I interpret the age results?
