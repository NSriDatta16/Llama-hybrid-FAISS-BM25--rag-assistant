This sounds like a pretty standard supervised learning problem. In this case, your records would be businesses on site X and their actual category on site Z. Your predictors would be tags/categories for a particular business on site X, and your target variable, y (i.e., what you're trying to predict), would be the category on the other website. As far as the code goes, you have a variety of options depending on your preferred language. You could use the caret package in R, the scikit-learn library in Python, or the Weka library (maybe even Spark's ML lib because of its simplicity) in Java/Scala. Side note, in your question I think you meant to say "logistic regression" instead of "logical regression". You don't need to use logistic regression (although it wouldn't hurt). You could also try algorithms like Random Forests or Naive Bayes. Also worth noting: your target variable will have many classes (ie every possible category for the site you're trying to predict), so don't get alarmed if it seems like there are a lot of classes. That's normal for a problem like the one you've described.
