I just came across a paper that is directly relevant. Randomized algorithms and NLP: using locality sensitive hash function for high speed noun clustering (Ravichandran et al, 2005) It is actually implemented in https://github.com/soundcloud/cosine-lsh-join-spark which is where I found it. It is based on locality sensitive hashing (already mentioned in other answers). After it has reduced the feature vectors to a low-dimensional space it uses a fast Hamming distance join to find the nearest neighbors.
