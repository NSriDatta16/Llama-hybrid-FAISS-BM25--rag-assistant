How does the voting work in a random forest

I'm following this tutorial about random forest and the first figure shows three decision trees. The author states that Tree one and two would vote that she survived, but tree three votes that she perishes. If we take a vote, itâ€™s 2 to 1 in favour of her survival, so we would classify this passenger as a survivor. But I can't see this from the trees. It looks like there's a higher percentage in each of the leaves that classify the passenger as dead i.e. those with a 0.
