Does an urn's probability distribution change as you draw from it without replacement on average?

Suppose I have an urn containing N different colours of balls and each different colour can appear a different number of times (if there are 10 red balls there need not also be 10 blue balls). If we know the exact contents of the urn before drawing we can form a discrete probability distribution which tells us the probability of drawing each colour of ball. What I am wondering is how the distribution changes after drawing k balls without replacement from the urn on average . I understand that as we draw from the urn we can update the distribution with the knowledge of what has been taken out, but what I want to know is what we would expect the shape of the distribution to be after we have removed k balls. Does the distribution change on average or does it remain the same? If it does not remain the same can we write down some formula for the what we expect the new distribution to look like on average after making k draws?
