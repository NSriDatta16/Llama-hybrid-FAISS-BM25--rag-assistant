Good Resource for Embedding Weather Forecasts

I would like to add a 5-10 day weather forecast to a website. I'm having trouble finding a website that provides an embed code for forecasts. The few I've found look awful (circa 1990's). I was just wondering if there was a halfway clean-looking solution that I might be overlooking in my endless Google searches. Flash, iframe, anything... I'm realizing that pulling in a weather RSS Feed might be the only clean solution, but I am not very familiar with parsing RSS feeds, so it will require a lot of labor on my end, since I'll be digging through documentation. **I should also mention that this weather app is on it's own page. So, bigger is better. If I don't find one big enough, I'll just implement it into a floating window (jQuery Overlay, to be exact) instead of it's own page.
