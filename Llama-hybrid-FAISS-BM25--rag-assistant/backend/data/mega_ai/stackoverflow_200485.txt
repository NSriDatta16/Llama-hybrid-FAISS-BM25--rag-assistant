How can I create a windows resource to embed in a .NET assembly, starting from text?

I was looking into embedding custom version strings using in assemblies a while back, and one approach that the documentation suggested was to embed a windows resource. The only way I can see to create a windows resource is to use the 'Native Resource Template', but the template is a binary file that isn't suitable for using with subwcrev . Is there a way of creating a windows resource as part of a C# project that starts with a human-editable text file, similarly to the .rc files that C++ projects use? If so, how?
