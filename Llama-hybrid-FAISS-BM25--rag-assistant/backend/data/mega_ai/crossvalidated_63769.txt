Number of levels in categorical predictors/combining categories in logistic regression

I have an independent variable “State in the US” and it has around 16 different levels (PA, NY, NJ, etc). Now I have combined the states which appear infrequently into "others" category. But I still have around 12 levels which are equally populated. I have a very large data set (1 million observations) and no zero cell issues with the variables. Questions: I would like to know if there was a limit on the number of levels a categorical variable can have when used with logistic regression. If yes, why is it the case? And what is the best way to bin categorical variables like Zip code or occupation code, apart from binning similar levels together?
