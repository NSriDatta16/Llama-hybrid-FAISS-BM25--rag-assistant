Don't use RegEx for manipulating HTML nodes! It's not designed for it and is too fragile. HTML is not a Regular language, and even with the non-Regular features many modern Regular Expression implementations support, trying to manipulate HTML with a regex is still difficult at best. For a quick-and-dirty solution, you can do: preg_replace ( "/( ]++>)\s*+( )/gi" , "$2$1" , $HtmlText ); But that will fail with several valid HTML constructs - what you should actually be using is something like PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser to parse the HTML text into a HTML DOM, manipulate that DOM, and then output as text again.
