Yes, the within (= fixed effects) estimator (as in plm( , model = "within" ) uses OLS on transformed data (demeaned data in this case). This is the usual way to estimate this type of model, have a look at your favourite econometrics textbook. Also from the package's first vignette this becomes clear cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plm/vignettes/A_plmPackage.html . "The (quasiâ€“)demeaning framework: The estimation methods for the basic models in panel data econometrics, the pooled OLS, random effects and fixed effects (or within) models, can all be described inside the OLS estimation framework. In fact, while pooled OLS simply pools data, the standard way of estimating fixed effects models with, say, group (time) effects entails transforming the data by subtracting the average over time (group) to every variable, which is usually termed time-demeaning." NB: coeftest(mcorr, vcovHC(mcorr), method = "arellano") in your coding exampel seems to have an ill-placed ) : typically, using vcovHC function of pkg plm would look like vcovHC(mcorr, method = "arellano") , or in coefest as coeftest(mcorr, vcovHC(mcorr, method = "arellano")) .
