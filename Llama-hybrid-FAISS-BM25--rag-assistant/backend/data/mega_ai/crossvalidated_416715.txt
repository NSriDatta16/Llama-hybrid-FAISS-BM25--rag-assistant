why in SVM we have different indices for dot product?

I am confused by Lagrangian method in SVM, I can not understand why we use different indices in dot product. Suppose with using Lagrangian W is : $ W_{i}=\sum_{i}L_{i}y_{i}x_{i} $ In SVM objective function we have $min : 0.5 ( W_{i}^{2} )$ So I think we must have $W_{i}^{2} =\sum_{i}L_{i}^{2}y_{i}x_{i}.x_{i} $ why we have $W_{i}^{2} =\sum_{i}L_{i}L_{j}y_{j}y_{i}x_{i}.x_{j} $ these are very different in the second one we multiply all elements of x together which it does not make sense to me.
