Firstly, ask for clarification from your supervisor. Don't say 'What do you mean?', but ask 'Are you expecting something like this?' because it shows that you've at least thought about it. If you can't think of anything, or your supervisor is vague, perform some simple data retrieval and analysis, e.g. most active members the most / least popular songs and books. number of ads clicked etc most popular website features Just elementary analysis should suffice - you aren't doing a statistics degree. Work out the most songs downloaded in a day or per user, the average songs per user, how many users visit each day and how many sign up and never visit. The purpose is to demostrate that your website is logging all activity, so that when you are asked 'how many books did the 20 most active users download in June' you will be able to work out the answer. The alternative is a website that just runs and you don't have any knowledge of how your users are behaving and what they are doing, which means you aren't able to focus on things that they find important.
