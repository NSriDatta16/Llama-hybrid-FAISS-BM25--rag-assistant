GLM summary shows no significant difference for variable but difference can be seen in plot

I am doing a multiple regression to predict average sizes of fish between areas protected from fishing and areas open to fishing. The model also takes into account habitat parameters which are the other variables (log.comp2 + rugosity). This model was the best according to AIC. log(size) transformation was used to normalize data. mtar The output for summary(mtar) shows no significant difference for protection: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 3.370952 0.022943 146.928 but the graph shows clear differences: How can I interpret this?
