I don't think it sounds silly at all to make an action for every page. That's just how MVC works. You can ignore some routes, as Robert Harvey suggests, but then you'll have the *.html extension on your static pages but not your internal ones, and you'll be unable to use the Url. and Html. helper methods for linking to MVC actions. I think you should just go with the flow.
