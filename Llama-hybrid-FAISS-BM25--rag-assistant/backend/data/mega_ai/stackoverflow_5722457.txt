There are inconsistencies between your two draggable handlers, in the last line for the second one you use a class selector ".down_spin", where everywhere else you used id selector "#down_spin". The other big problem is that no two DOM elements should have the same id in your document, try changing all up_spin and down_spin elements to have a class by those names and change your id selectors to class selectors. Make sure you make up your mind wether you want to use classes or ids by the above rules, as you use id in your static markup, but classes in your droppable handler's html injection. Also in your down_spin draggable handler remove the '' bit from your html string concatenation, you haven't got it in the up_spin handler, and it's not right anyway. And if you're using jQuery, it's best to be consistent and use it everywhere, change: infoSelected.innerHTML = "Element: "+" "+element[val.value]+" "+"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"+"Simbol: "+" "+simbol[val.value]+" "; to: $(infoSelected).html("Element: "+" "+element[val.value]+" "+"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"+"Simbol: "+" "+simbol[val.value]+" "); After all these clean-ups, it might just magically start working.
