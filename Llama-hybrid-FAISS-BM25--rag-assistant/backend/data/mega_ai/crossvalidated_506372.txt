I'm not sure this is a mediation model as much as it's a growth curve model with a slight twist. You want to know if prior week's rumination level is associated with subsequent week's depression. Is that right? If so, then just create a "lagged" version of ruminate such that a row of data associated with week 2 has a version of ruminate that is its value from week 1. Obviously this means that you cannot include the week 1 depression because you do not have a "lagged" version of rumination. However, you still have enough data to run a growth curve model (starting w/ week 2 through week 5). To incorporate GreggH's idea, you could also calculate a person mean of the lagged rumination variable and include that as a predictor of both the intercept and the slope (via an interaction between week and person mean lagged rumination). This tests whether people who have higher average prior rumination have higher average depression (fixed effect on the intercept) and have greater/lesser change in depression (interaction effect). The coefficient on the lagged rumination tells you the association between prior rumination and the following week's depression score, accounting for an individual's linear growth in depression (random slope for time/week) and their trait depression (random intercept). If instead you want to assess whether prior week's rumination is associated with changes in depression from prior week to present week, then you likely need a different modeling approach. I'd suggest structural equation modeling for that purpose.
