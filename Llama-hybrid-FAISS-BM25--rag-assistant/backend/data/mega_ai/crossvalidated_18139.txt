No. Causal inference is an active area of research in machine learning, for instance see the proceedings of this workshop and this one . I would however point out that even if causal inference or model interpretation is your primary interest, it is still a good idea to try an opaque purely predictive approach in parallel, so that you will know if there is a significant performance penalty involved in insisting on an interpretable model.
