nicely exception handling

In our app, we use components developed by other teams. The question was how can I define a nicely way of exception handling than this try { someComponent.DoStuff(); } catch (Exception ex) { textLabel= ex.Message; } The component has no custom exception type, maybe a nicely way to do it would be to define a component specific Exception type and wrap this somehow? I know the question is very basic, but I am interested more in the let's say how it is good to do it. If you call another component with no custom defined exception types, how do you handle any potential exceptions in an elegant way?
