Wavelet analysis overcomes the problems of non-stationarity in time series by performing a local time-scale decomposition of the signal, i.e., the estimation of its spectral characteristics as a function of time. This claim is at best misleading and, if it were more specific, incorrect. First, the term "spectral characteristics" only makes sense for (covariance-)stationary series. Second, wavelet transform does not "overcome...non-stationarity" any better than, other approaches. To make the comparison concrete, take the Fourier transform as alternative approach. Fourier Transform For stationary series, one can compute the Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DFT) $a(\omega_j)$ . This in turn gives periodogram $I(\omega_j) = |a(\omega_j)|^2$ , which captures frequency content of the series at $\omega_j$ in the frequency domain. Wavelet Transform Similarly, one can also compute the wavelet coefficients $\psi_{jk}$ , using the Discrete Wavelet Transform, or DWT (the non-overlap version, say). The coefficient $\psi_{jk}$ is the " $k$ -th coefficient at $j$ -th resolution level". You can loosely view "high resolution" as analogous to "high frequency". To be more precise, for a specific wavelet basis, you may compute the corresponding filter in the frequency domain, so that a given level of resolution j roughly corresponds to a subset of the frequency domain. So $\sum_k | \psi_{jk} |^2$ , analogous to $I(\omega_j)$ , can be interpreted as the "energy content of the series at resolution $j$ . Non-stationary Series The frequency domain perspective can be extended in an ad hoc way to non-stationary series for both DFT and DWT (it's ad hoc because point 1 above). If you generate a non-stationary series and compute its DFT, you will find very large values for the periodogram close to zero frequency. Similarly, the DWT will have large values at low levels of resolution. These observations have been applied to design unit root tests (statistical tests intended to distinguish stationarity vs non-stationarity), based on the DFT and DWT. Neither approach is uniformly superior to the other. The quoted statement is not correct. Further Comment Wavelets do, however, offer advantage for long-range dependent data (e.g. fractional Gaussian noise) relative to other approaches, but that's a different discussion.
