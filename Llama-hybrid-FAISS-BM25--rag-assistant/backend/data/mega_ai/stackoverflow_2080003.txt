In terms of speed, GPUs are optimized for floats. I'm much more familiar with Nvidia hardware, but in current generation hardware, there is 1 DP FPU for every 8 SP FPU. In next generation hardware, they're expected to have more of a 1 to 2 ratio instead. My recommendation would be to see if your algorithm needs double precision. Many algorithms don't really need the extra bits. Run some tests to determine the average error that you get by going to single precision and figure out if it's significant. If not, just use single. If your algorithm is purely for graphics, you probably don't need double precision. If you are doing general purpose computation, consider using OpenCL or CUDA.
