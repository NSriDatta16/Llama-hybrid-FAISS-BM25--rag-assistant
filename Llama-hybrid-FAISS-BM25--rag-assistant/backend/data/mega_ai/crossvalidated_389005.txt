Multiple answer survey: building a regression model

I have survey data with respondents choosing up to three policy objectives to be pursued in their city district. Respondents belong to various age groups (18-24, 25-35 etc.) and live in one of the 27 city districts. I want to study the impact of age and city district, as well as the joint impact of both variables on the policy objectives chosen . Obviously, some of the objectives are more probable to be picked jointly since they have similar background (like building sports infrastructure and organising sports events). I'm doing my statistical computing in R and I came across this thread, being a perfect match to my problem: multiple choice data simple logistic regression or multinomial logistic regression . Still no chance of doing it in R? I know a logistic regression run separately for each objective as dependent variable won't do the trick. Maybe there is a second-best solution?
