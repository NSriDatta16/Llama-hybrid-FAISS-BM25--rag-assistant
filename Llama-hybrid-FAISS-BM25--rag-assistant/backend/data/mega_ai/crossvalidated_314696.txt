Understanding basic neural networks and their use in data classification

I have been working on Machine learning algorithms (SVM) and some clustering algorithms (k-means, random forest, HMM etc) for quite some time. I use these algorithms for data classification (this data is of complex form). Recently, I came across neural networks and I was suggested that NN and ANN could be used to do the same. Are there any specific requirements to start working with NN? As I am completely new to it, are there any tutorials which can help me get some basic idea about NN and ANN?
