Name of logistic regression with two dependent variables?

my understanding is that Multinomial logistic regression is where your dependent variable could take values of 1,2 or 3 where 1-3 are classes. But what isit called if you have two dependent variables your model is supposed to predict continuous values with logistic regression? for example,I am trying to predict the number of males and number females at an event given a list of conditions [weather,day of week, time of day]
