Deletion order for contained @OneToMany members

@Entity public class Organization { @OneToMany List Aobjects; @OneToMany List Bobjects; @OneToMany List Cobjects; } I have @OnDelete annotation on all the @OneToMany members. What would be the order of deletion of these objects when the parent object is removed. Is it safe to assume that it would be the order in which the objects are declared.
