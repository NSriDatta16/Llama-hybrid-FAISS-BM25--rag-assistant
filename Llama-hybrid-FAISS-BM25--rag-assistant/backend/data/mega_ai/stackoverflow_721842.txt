The strategy I normally use is to UNION with the opposite of the query, generally a query that retrieves data for rows that don't exist. If I wanted to get the average mark for a course, but some courses weren't taken by any students, I'd need to UNION with those not taken by anyone to display a row for every class: SELECT AVG(mark), course FROM `marks` UNION SELECT NULL, course FROM courses WHERE course NOT IN (SELECT course FROM marks) Your query will be more complex but the same principle should apply. You may indeed need a table of dates for your second query
