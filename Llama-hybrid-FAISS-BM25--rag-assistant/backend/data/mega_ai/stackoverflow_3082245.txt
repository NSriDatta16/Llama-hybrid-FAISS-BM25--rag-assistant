The primary advantage with stack allocation is that you get automatic memory management of the allocated variable-length array. Since memory management is one of the core challenges for any C program, you should definitely use VLA to simplify your task, if you can. I will then advocate that you should use VLA's consistenly when you can, and otherwise use malloc only if: You need to control the duration of the storage, and if you have very large allocations, and if you want to handle out-of-memory errors gracefully.
