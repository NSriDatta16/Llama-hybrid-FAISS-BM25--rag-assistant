you have a lot of work to do. Ignoring your server side model, you cashould probably use jQuery/jQuery UI/ExtJS or any other UI framework to allow drag/drop sort functionality. I am not familiar with PollDaddy but I imagine that there's a lot of code there to achieve a poll/form builder. You could look at their code too assuming its not packed. hope this helps.
