This is an illustration of sufficiency in action within Bayesian statistics: when given a sample $x_1,\dots,x_{100}$ from a $\mathcal B(2,p)$ distribution, the posterior distribution of $p$ given that sample is the same as the posterior distribution of $p$ given the sum $$x_1+\cdots+x_{100}$$ because this sum is sufficient (meaning that the likelihood functions are proportional functions of $p$ ).
