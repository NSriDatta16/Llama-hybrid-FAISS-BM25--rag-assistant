In the end it's all about your preferences. I like the clones as branches model Joel covers, but they're both valid. Here's a great article that covers a few different branching models in both Mercurial and Git (despite the title): http://stevelosh.com/blog/2009/08/a-guide-to-branching-in-mercurial/ My biggest piece of advice is to not over think it. I know you need a concrete proposal that management can buy in to, but if my experience repeats itself where you are you'll find that people are taking the decentralized piece pretty seriously. You'll have impromptu teams doing little side efforts on network shares, you'll have dev-to-dev cloning and pulling, and all sorts of ad hoc organization. So long as you have a few key repos with firm, clear expectations (e.g.: "must compile" or "must be shippable" or "must have Jim's blessing") you'll be fine.
