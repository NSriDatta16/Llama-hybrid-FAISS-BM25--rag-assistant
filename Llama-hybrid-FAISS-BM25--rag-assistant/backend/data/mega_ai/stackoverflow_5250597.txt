HTTP referer headers - mobile browsers

I seem to have a unique problem. In my apache logs (for a mobile site) I see that for some requests the referer header is null ("-"). All requests on the logs are "href" links and occur from a mobile browser by clicking/tapping . So there is almost no chance of the url being accessed from the address bar directly (in which case I can understand the absence of a referer header) . What are the other possibilities that a referer header can be null ? Are there mobile devices which have a browser feature to turn of referer headers (like desktop browsers) ? I also understand that such a thing can be achieved on a desktop browser by spoofing the the UserAgent to a mobile device. But I'm slightly hesitant as there is no motive for the user to do so. Also, will the referer header persist when a link is opened in a separate window/tab ? (Again, I'm not sure if this is possible on a mobile device) Any thoughts will be appreciated .
