Meta-analysis of a bounded parameter

I am trying to conduct a meta-analysis of a bounded parameter, say, a correlation parameter $\rho \in [0, 1]$ . I have multiple studies $i = 1, \dots, N$ , each producing a likelihood $L_i(\rho_i), \rho_i \in [0, 1]$ . And each study are with different sample size, therefore different precision of the $\rho_i$ estimates (which is probably already reflected in the flatness of the likelihood curve $L_i (\rho_i)$ . This parameter $\rho_i$ is likely close to 1 based on prior knowledge, therefore the normal asymptotics are not so valid because of the bounded parameter space. The main interests are: Assessing the heterogeneity of $\rho_i$ across studies. Produce a single summary of $\rho$ . Test $H_0: \rho_i = 1, i \in 1, \dots, N$ accounting for different precision of $\rho_i$ . Is there any reference for guiding the analysis of such problems? And if one is willing to further assume $\rho_i \in \text{Uniform}[0, 1]$ , is there some established procedure to perform a Bayesian meta-analysis on the posterior distribution $\pi_i(\rho_i), i=1, \dots, N$ ?
