Translating Ruby code to Java

I have never used ruby but need to translate this code to java. Can anyone help me. This is the code in Ruby.

In case anyone needs it static final int[] DEFAULT_PRIOR = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}; static float score(int[] votes) { return score(votes, DEFAULT_PRIOR); } private static float score(int[] votes, int[] prior) { int[] posterior = new int[votes.length]; for (int i = 0; i
