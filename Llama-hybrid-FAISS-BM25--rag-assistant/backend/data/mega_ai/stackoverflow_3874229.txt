Magento : How to retrieve option information from a bundled product?

I have a bundled Product that contains 3 virtual products as options. I have an observer that is listening to an event when an item is added to the cart and I'm having a hard time figuring out how to get the option information that I selected when looking at the product: the start of the observer looks like this: public function checkSubscriptionHierarchy(Varien_Event_Observer $observer) { $event = $observer->getEvent(); $product = $event->getProduct(); ... the call to $product->getSku() returns the sku of the bundle product. I'd love to be able to grab the sku of the option that I selected, but cannot figure out how to do that. Thanks!
