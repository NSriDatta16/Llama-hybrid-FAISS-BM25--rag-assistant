Removing elements that have consecutive duplicates

I was curios about the question: Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements , and how it should be implemented in Python. What I came up with is this: list = [1,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1,2] i = 0 while i Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2] Which I guess is ok. So I got curious, and wanted to see if I could delete the elements that had consecutive duplicates and get this output: [2, 3, 5, 1, 2] For that I did this: list = [1,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1,2] i = 0 dupe = False while i But it seems sort of clumsy and not pythonic, do you have any smarter / more elegant / more efficient way to implement this?
