Broadly speaking, there are four main areas of change: Semantic markup, including the following tags: This also covers changes to the , and tags, as well as link relations (the rel attribute on an tag). Improved form support - mainly semantic additions to input types, and a few neat things like field autofocus and placeholder text. Multimedia tags - , and . and are intended to improved better support for embedded media in the page; is for programmatic two-dimensional bitmap drawing on the page through JavaScript. Changes to the DOM that are just accessible through JS - navigator.geolocation , window.localStorage (storing user data offline), window.applicationCache (storing app data offline), web workers (multithreaded JavaScript, with some caveats) Different parts of HTML are in different stages of specification and implementation - the form changes are poorly supported outside of Safari, the tag is basically unusable in a cross-platform environment (without multiple video formats), and IE has built-in support for next to none of these changes. The best place to read up on HTML5 that I've seen is Mark Pilgrim's excellent book in progress, Dive into HTML5
