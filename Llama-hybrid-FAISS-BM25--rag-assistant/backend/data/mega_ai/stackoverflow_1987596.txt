Being pedantic... The requirements are not quite specified perfectly unambiguously. What does the business mean by "within the last month"? Most people would take that to mean "within the current calendar month" in which case I'd use: TRUNC(SYSDATE,'MM') Otherwise, perhaps they want an arbitrary period of 1 month prior to the current date - but then how do you define that? As you've found, INTERVAL '1' MONTH simply subtracts one from the month portion of the date - e.g. 15-JAN-2009 - INTERVAL '1' MONTH returns 15-DEC-1999. For some dates, this results in an invalid date because not all months have the same number of days. ADD_MONTHS resolves this by returning the last day in the month, e.g. ADD_MONTHS(31-DEC-2009,-1) returns 30-NOV-2009. Another possibility is that the business actually wants to use an average month period - e.g. 365/12 which is approximately 30.4. They might want you to use SYSDATE-30 , although of course twelve iterations of this will only cover 360 days of the year.
