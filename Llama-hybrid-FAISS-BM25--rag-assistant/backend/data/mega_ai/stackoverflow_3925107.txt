In addition to the technical details of the other answers, instead answering the complaint in your first paragraph: one way to get quality answers to "why" C++ questions is to ask in one of the Usenet groups, because, like with StackOverflow there are Real Experts hanging out there, but unlike StackOverflow even a beginner's question is likely to get an answer from a member of the standardization committee, and if you're lucky even from those who have penned the standard (like Andrew Koenig or currently Pete Becker). In earlier times Bjarne was there too. But recent years he hasn't posted much. Basic novice "why" questions: alt.comp.lang.learn.c-c++ . Francis Glassborow hangs out there. He's a committe member and author of several successful C++ introductory books. He also knows a bit of math, and since the posting frequency there is low (what with StackOverflow!), you are almost assured that any halfway interesting question will be answered almost immediately -- and correctly -- by Francis, in a snap. :-) General questions about the C++ language: comp.lang.c++ and/or comp.lang.c++.moderated . The latter group is moderated and has a charter. The moderation reduces noise -- e.g. no spam -- but adds delay. Some committee members prefer to post mostly in the unmoderated group (e.g. James Kanze), some, like Pete Becker and Howard Hinnant, post in both groups, and some well known experts, e.g. Andrei Alexandrescu, now apparently only post in the moderated group. Questions about what the standard means, reports about errors in the standard and so on (in earlier times this was also where you formally reported defects in the standard): [comp.std.c++]. This is also a moderated group, and unfortunately the mod delay is now almost unbearably long. But as a novice you're probably less interested in the formal details, and more interested in rationales and explanations, for which [comp.lang.c++] and [comp.lang.c++.moderated] are great groups (I think StackOverflow's main advantage is when you're wondering "what's the bug in this code" or questions that in principle can be resolved by just reading the relevant documentation). Finally, I've linked to Google Groups which provides a web based interface, but you can access these groups more directly from a Usenet client like Thunderbird (or e.g. the Opera browser, which has a built-in client). All you have to do in order to access Usenet via a local client is to configure the client, telling it about a server, like the free EternalSeptember. Or AIOE. Cheers & hth., â€“ Alf
