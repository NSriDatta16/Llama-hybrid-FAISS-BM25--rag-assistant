We use the following project structure in SVN (but this applies to CVS as well). + tags + branches > trunk + build (build scripts) + lib (external libraries) > src (source code) >> Organization.App (solution name) >> Organization.App.Core (code library) + Config > Domain > Model > Persistence > Queries > Services > Persistence > Services >> Organization.App.Web (mvc web app) > Assets + Images + Scripts + Stylesheets + Controllers + Views + ViewModels We put all our 3rd party dependencies into the lib folder. Including MVC, which can be bin deployed. See this article by Phil Haack . So when a new developer comes online all they have to do it check out the trunk, and they should have everything they need to get going. Using a CI server is a cinch because all of the projects dependencies are encapsulated by the lib folder and all of the visual studio projects make reference to those dll's in that lib folder. Does that make sense? Never mind the core folder and the web folder. That's just how we structure our projects within the solution. But that's a whole other conversation . :)
