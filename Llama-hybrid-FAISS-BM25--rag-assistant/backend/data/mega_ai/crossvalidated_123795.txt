You are going to wind up with anti-conservative estimates of the errors of parameters in the non-linear mixed effects model. In larger samples, we presume that your model would behave more stably. These bootstrap replicates which are diverging to $\infty$ would necessarily be larger estimates than those in the normal range of estimates which are properly converging. To convince yourself of this, you can take the simple issue of separability in bootstrap estimation of confidence regions for logistic regression. See the example code below which honestly has kinks, but can be modified to answer this question. Bootstraps make some assumptions about the distribution of your test statistic. If there is a non-zero probability weight at $\infty$ according to the bootstrapped distribution of parameter estimates, you should consider a better way of creating resampling based statistics, such as a parametric bootstrap, or possibly a permutation test. set.seed(1) n
