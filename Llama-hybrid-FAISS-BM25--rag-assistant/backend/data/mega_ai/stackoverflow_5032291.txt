It ultimately depends on how you serialize your objects. One convenient option is to store them as hash (key-value pairs). This way, if to class Dog having property name I add another property breed , existing objects won't be invalidated. They'll just have have breed = nil . Exact storage format (xml, json or separate 'properties' table) is not important in this case, the important thing is how you convert objects to it and back. But I don't think anyone could give specific suggestions without knowing specific platform.
