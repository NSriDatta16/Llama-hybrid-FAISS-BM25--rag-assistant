if your time series non-stationary, then quite likely that $|a_1|>1$. when $|a_1| $a_1$ is not a problem for differencing, but it's not very useful when $|a_1| to compute ACF you don't need the process be stationary, it's just the ACF would not make much sense, it'll be exponentially growing with a lag.
