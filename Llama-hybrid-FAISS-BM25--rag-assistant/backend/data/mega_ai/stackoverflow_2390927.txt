How can I install and ideally run an iPhone app entirely from the command-line?

I'm porting an existing game engine to the iPhone. As a result of a large and complicated build process that isn't really conducive to Xcode I'm developing my own build system that calls the same programs and does the same build steps as Xcode does. This is generally working pretty well, referring heavily to xcodebuild's output for reference. The one big thing I can't do is install stuff programatically. I can use Xcode's Organizer window to install manually, but I know of no way to duplicate that behavior via the commandline, nor to run the installed program directly on the iPhone afterwards. I can script it with a GUI macroing system if I have to, but I'd rather not. I've found the program "iphonesim" to run iPhone apps in the simulator from the commandline, but nothing equivalent for actual hardware development. Any suggestions? (To stave off the inevitable suggestions: nothing involved is jailbroken in any way, and I don't really plan to jailbreak it.)
