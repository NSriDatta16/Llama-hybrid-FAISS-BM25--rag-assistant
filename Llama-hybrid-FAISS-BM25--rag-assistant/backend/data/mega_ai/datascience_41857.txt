What are the best suited books for A Beginner to learn Data Science?

I'm an undergraduate student studying data science. My goal is to understand the fundamentals of this field and then move on to complex and more advanced topics. I'm interested in knowing: What are some of the books I should consider reading? (from basic to advanced) which are best suited for this task? The books should build strong fundamental knowledge about the concepts involved and should gradually take through to advanced concepts. (Multiple combination of books can be suggested as well, but the order should be preserved ). Mentioning some books I found, for your reference: Data Mining: The Textbook, by Charu C. Aggarwal The Elements of Statistical Learning, by Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning, by Christopher M. Bishop Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, by Kevin P. Murphy Computer Age Statistical Inference: Algorithms, Evidence, and Data Science, by Bradley Efron and Trevor Hastie Links to other answers, blogs and articles is welcomed, Thanks
