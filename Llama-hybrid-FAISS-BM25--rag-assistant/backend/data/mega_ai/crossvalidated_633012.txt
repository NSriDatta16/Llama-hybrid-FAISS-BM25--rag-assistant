As Peter implied, trusting the data to inform you about normality is trusting them too much. And it implies that you think that the Wilcoxon or Kruskal-Wallis tests donâ€™t work well with normal data when in fact they are 0.95 efficient as parametric tests when normality holds . Similarly a simple hypothesis test on the variance ratio has problems. I would use a generalization of Wilcoxon-Kruskal-Wallis that allows one to test or compute confidence intervals for any contrast of interest, and also to adjust for covariates while doing that. Such a generalization is ordinal semiparametric regression models such as the proportional odds model. An alternative is the Bayesian $t$ -test which allows the degree of non-normality and the variance ratio to move with the data while taking into account all uncertainties in constructing uncertainty intervals.
