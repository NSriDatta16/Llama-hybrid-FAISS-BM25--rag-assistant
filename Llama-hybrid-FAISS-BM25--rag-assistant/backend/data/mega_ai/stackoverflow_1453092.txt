That is a lot of email. First of all, it's unlikely you will ever be sending out that many emails so I wouldn't architect your system for that kind of volume. You should consider configuring your service so that fewer emails are necessary (daily summary, more selective targeting, rss feeds). But even if you're sending out 500,000 emails per day, you're going to need a heavy duty infrastructure or pay an ESP like VerticalResponse a lot of money. Free mail transfer agents (MTAs) include Postfix and SendMail. Commercial options include Strongmail and PowerMTA. With that much email, you'll probably need to watch out for spam complaints (depending on how your project review process). ReturnPath is useful for that.
