I see your problem consisting of two parts: Predicting which users will participate. Predicting the number of groups and what individual group composition will be. For the first part, you can use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for each user id which basically model the probabilities such that given the prior knowledge of user participation ('PNNPPPN') it predicts how likely a user will participate next time. [where 'P' stands for Participated, 'N' stands for Not-participated and the sequence is a 1 week history of a particular user.] For the second part, you can use Word2vec with which you can get vector embeddings of each user. When you visualise these vectors (in a 2-D space) you could see the clusters where the users who tend to form groups more often would be closer to each other. So, from above two things now you know that whether a particular user will participate today or not and which other users, who have similar vector embeddings, are also likely to participate, you can predict the groups for a particular day. (This is one approach, of-course there can be others.)
