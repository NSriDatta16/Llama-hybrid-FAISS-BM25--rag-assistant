random forest: omitting variables with high importance does not change test error

I wished I could post a reproducible example but the following is observed in a specific large data set that I cannot share. A set of variables shows consistently high variable (permutation based) importance in random forests. However, leaving out those variables leads to unchanged OOB and test MSE. Note that replacing these variables with their residuals from a regression (or even a RF) on all the other variables does not change the variable importance ranking much. I cannot think of a sound explanation of this apparent contradiction.
