By "[t]he program" I am assuming that you are referring to a C# compiler, and probably csc installed with Visual Studio 2008. The syntax that you are using to set the properties of the ColumnAttribute is outdated; I believe that syntax was correct when LINQ was released as a CTP. The correct syntax now is: [Column ( Name="ID", Storage="_ID", DbType="Int NOT NULL IDENTITY", IsPrimaryKey=true, IsDbGenerated=true ) ] That is, Id has been replaced by IsPrimaryKey and AutoGen has been replaced by IsDbGenerated .
