Access denied, pattern match SurveyBot at HEADER? What does this mean?

in my error log files I read following over and over: [Thu Feb 03 03:14:32 2011] [error] [client 64.246.165.200] mod_security: Access denied with code 500. Pattern match "SurveyBot" at HEADER("USER-AGENT") [hostname "mywebsite.be"] [uri "/nl/home"] [Thu Feb 03 03:18:12 2011] [error] [client 64.246.161.190] mod_security: Access denied with code 500. Pattern match "SurveyBot" at HEADER("USER-AGENT") [hostname "mywebsite.com"] [uri "/en/home"] on and on and on What does this mean?? Should I be taking any actions?
