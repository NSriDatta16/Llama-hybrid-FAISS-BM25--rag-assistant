Count process with standard deviation proportional to its mean

What is (is there) the count process, which has its standard deviation proportional to its mean? Note that I am not talking here about Poisson process, which has its variance proportional to mean. That is the process in question is overdispersed (in comparison to Poisson) for the average number of counts greater than 1, but underdispersed otherwise. Background: One often speaks of count processes in terms of how they modify the variance of a Poisson process: e.g., negative binomial is seen as overdispersed Poisson, while generalized Poisson process is claimed to represent the underdispersed Poisson. The question is thus whether there's a particular modification for modeling the situations where the standard deviation (rather than the variance) is proportional to the mean.
