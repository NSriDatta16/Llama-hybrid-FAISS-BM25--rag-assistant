As @whuber notes in a comment, you do need to deal first with what seem to be incorrect premises in your approach. Most important, if your samples aren't truly random then "you can't use any of these methods to make inferences," as he put it. Fix that first. In terms of mean versus median as a measure of central tendency, the choice is yours based on your understanding of the subject matter unless your data are from a distribution like the Cauchy distribution , which has a median but not a mean. Skewness per se has nothing to do with it; the Cauchy distribution is symmetric about its median. As @carlo put it in a comment, non-overlap of 95% confidence intervals is much too stringent a test for a difference between two values at p this classic answer from @whuber for details in the case of t -tests. The associated suggestion to use bootstrap directly to test your hypotheses about differences is worth pursuit. This answer goes into detail about several ways to use bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals. You clearly can compute BCa confidence intervals for any data set regardless of underlying distribution, but the question is whether 95% confidence intervals determined that way represent true 95% confidence intervals. BCa is designed to deal with bias and skew, and might perform the best of common ways to estimate confidence intervals via bootstrapping, but you can't necessarily be sure. The problem is that confidence intervals are based on a null hypothesis: there is no difference in the value of the parameter of interest between the two populations. In contrast, the data from which you are sampling might actually represent two different populations with respect to that parameter. For bootstrapping to provide reliable confidence intervals in that case you should be evaluating a parameter that is pivotal . As @AdamO has put it: "This means that if the underlying parameter changes, the shape of the distribution is only shifted by a constant, and the scale does not necessarily change. This is a strong assumption!" In that sense, the BCa confidence intervals are not assumption-free. It might be impossible in some cases to get reliable bootstrapped estimates of confidence intervals, as when sampling from a lognormal distribution without transformation . The answer linked at the beginning of the previous paragraph provides several references on these matters.
