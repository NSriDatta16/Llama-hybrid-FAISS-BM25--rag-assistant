I think you might need to use the -L switch to tell it to follow redirects. I'm not sure if you can do this directly from PHP or whether you need to follow this approach http://php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php#95027 . It is always possible that the site you are scraping blocks by user agent or something as well. Maybe try one of the links in a browser while running Fiddler or similar to see if any redirection is actually taking place.
