I'll answer your question pragmatically because you've chosen a relatively risky path after weighing the performance gains against the possible downsides (at least I hope you have!). If portability and robustness against future changes to those compilers have also been considered then an empirical approach would be the best guard against problems. Ensure you are using initializers for the enums (your examples do this) in all cases. Do empirical testing to see how the data is interpreted on the receiving side. Record the version numbers of the build tools on both sides and archive them with the source code. Preferably archive the tools as well. Document everything you did so unforeseen maintenance in the future is not handicapped. Pray for the best! ;-)
