Weird problem with UIBarButtonItem in Interface Builder

First of all, sorry: I'm pretty sure there's something incredibly stupid I'm doing here, and that I should absolutely go to sleep right now. The problem is that I added an UIBarButtonItem to a nib and wired it to the right outlet, but after my view has been loaded, the ivar I connected is still nil . Is this supposed to work at all, or it only works when you drag the bar button inside a navigation bar in Interface Builder?
