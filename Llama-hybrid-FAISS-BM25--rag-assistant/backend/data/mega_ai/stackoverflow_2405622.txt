I use the omp_get_thread_num() function within my parallelized loop to print out which core it's working on if you don't specify num_threads . For e.g., printf("Computing bla %d on core %d/%d ...\n",i+1,omp_get_thread_num()+1,omp_get_max_threads()); The above will work for this pragma #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(a,b,c) This way you can be sure that it's running on both cores since only 2 threads will be created. Btw, is OpenMP enabled when you're compiling? In Visual Studio you have to enable it in the Property Pages , C++ -> Language and set OpenMP Support to Yes
