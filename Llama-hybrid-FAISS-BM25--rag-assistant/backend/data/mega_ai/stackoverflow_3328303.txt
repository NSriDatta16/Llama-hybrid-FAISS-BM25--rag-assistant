Question 1: The images or links in DB debase is old and still unresolved. There was a microsoft white paper that came out that recommended (for SQL Server 2008, so your mileage may vary) that for images/binaries under 150k DB storage is a good compromise. If most images are over, go with links, if under, store in DB. Question 2: The webservice will have an http context object, so you could simply use the Response.BinaryWrite method, that takes a byte[] . You will still need to write the correct headers (for mime type etc). For a file on disk, the simplest thing to do is use the Response.WriteFile method that takes a file path argument. In either case, you will need to intercept this on the client and convert back to an image.
