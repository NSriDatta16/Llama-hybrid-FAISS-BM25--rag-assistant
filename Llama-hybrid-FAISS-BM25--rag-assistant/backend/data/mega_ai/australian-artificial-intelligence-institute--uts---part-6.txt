Controversies Diane Jolly harassment scandal (2021) In 2021, the former Dean of Science Diane Jolley was found guilty of causing financial disadvantage by deception after orchestrating a campaign of intimidation – against herself – while pushing to cut the UTS traditional Chinese medicine degree. Cutting of the traditional Chinese medicine degree was hotly disputed and a petition of 9000 students and alumni fought to keep the course running affecting more than 20 staff and 250 students at the time. Jolley was sentenced to 2 years 6 months, to be served by way of Intensive Corrections Order for dishonestly causing financial disadvantage by deception by conveying information likely to make a person fear for the safety of a person, knowing that the information was false or misleading.
