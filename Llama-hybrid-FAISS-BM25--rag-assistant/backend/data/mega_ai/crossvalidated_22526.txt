In neurophysiology, one records a time series from one or more individual neurons. Recordings from the brains of living animals cannot be exactly reproduced for several reasons: the state of the animal and the cell you're recording from is changing over time (may be highly nonstationary); even if you could record the same cell in the same state, it would be difficult to locate the same single neuron again; in some experiments, the cell is dying over the course of the experiment (especially if you're trying to record from within the cell body); in many experiments, the animal itself may be sacrificed.
