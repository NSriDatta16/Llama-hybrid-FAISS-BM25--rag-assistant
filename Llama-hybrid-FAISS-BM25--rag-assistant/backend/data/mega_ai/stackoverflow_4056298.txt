Rails/MySQL lazy writing on .save(updates/writes)

I'm working on a pretty large data migration project which involves moving data between servers and different active record schemas. The whole migration literally takes days. How can I implement a caching solution where my Ruby migration code when it calls the Active Record save method writes to a cache (which then updates the MySQL database asynchronously). Memory is not a limitation. All of the caching solutions in Rails seem to deal with loading/query reads well but writes is something I haven't been able to find much on. Is this something that is easily doable in MySQL by tuning config params? Or is there a caching solution for Ruby/Rails that exists? I've looked at Delayed Job though it's not a caching layer (and it's not apparent that anyone has used it for lazy writes to the database). I've looked at MEMORY storage tables in MySQL but of course, they are not written to disk. Memcached isn't built for this. Please advise!
