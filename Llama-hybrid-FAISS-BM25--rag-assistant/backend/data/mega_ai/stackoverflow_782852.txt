OK, first to answer the 20 millis question. You can get quite a lot of game logic done in 20ms. But I'd say it's too frequently to be updating the display. You should also bear in mind that the OS generally dishes out CPU in the order of 10-20 ms timeslices-- in other words, another process at any moment could easily delay your process by about that amount of time. Have a look, for example, at my article on the behaviour of Thread.sleep() -- notice from the graph that as the system is moderately busy, the OS can't honour the sleep time we asked for. If you need an average sleep between frames of 100ms, then 20ms or so jitter here and there won't be too bad. But 20ms jitter when you asked for 20ms will probably be more noticeable... So I'd probably start at 10 frames per second (100ms pauses) and see how that looks. As far as the code is concerned, if your game logic will take more or less the same amount of time each tick, then I'd start with logic-repaint-sleep on each tick. Remember you need to synchronize on the things you're painting, so in your game logic thread, you ideally need to avoid holding on to locks for too long.
