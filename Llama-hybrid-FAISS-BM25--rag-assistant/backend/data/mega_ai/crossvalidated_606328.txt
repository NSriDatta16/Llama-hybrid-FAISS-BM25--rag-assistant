What is nonlinear p-value in Wald Statistics?

I am running a binary logistic regression with splines in R (using the rms package). I do not know what p-value I can report in an article. Should it be the nonlinear p-value or the main p-value? > knots1 [1] 284.00 314.55 366.15 640.00 > knots2 [1] 19.00 24.85 45.90 109.00 > knots3 [1] 32 104 139 ... model2
