I want to print statements to the java console(the one that can be opened using the java icon in taskbar) You need to realize that servlets actually runs at the server side , not at the client side . Those are in fact two physically different environments which communicates with each other through the network using the HTTP protocol. That Java console will only work for Java programs which runs at the client side , such as applets and JNLP . In your case, you just need to read the server logs. That's where the stdout will by default print to, or use a better configureable logging framework such as logback . The server logs are usually found in a straightforward folder/file in the server installation directory, such as /logs in case of Tomcat.
