First of all have you checked the SQLite limits ? If this is of no concern for you application, I would still chose the FS for storage needs simply due to overhead from getting large BLOBS from DB vs. reading a file from FS. You can mark the files as read only and hidden to lessen the chance of them being renamed... You can also store the file hash (like MD5) of a file in the DB so you can have secondary lookup option in case someone does rename the file (of course, they could move it as well in which case this would not help much)...
