Moving that sort of table into a separate database sounds like a perfectly valid approach to me. At work we have one database server for our operational content (orders, catalogue etc) and one for logs (web logs and copies of emails) and media (images, videos and other binaries). Even running separate instances on the same machine can be worthwhile since, as you mentioned, it partitions the buffer cache (or whatever your storage engine's equivalent is).
