Need Help Studying Running Times

At the moment, I'm studying for a final exam for a Computer Science course. One of the questions that will be asked is most likely a question on how to combine running times, so I'll give an example. I was wondering, if I created a program that preprocessed inputs using Insertion Sort, and then searched for a value "X" using Binary Search, how would I combine the running times to find the best, worst, and average case time complexities of the over-all program? For example... Insertion Sort Worst Case O(n^2) Best Case O(n) Average Case O(n^2) Binary Search Worst Case O(logn) Best Case O(1) Average Case O(logn) Would the Worst case be O(n^2 + logn), or would it be O(n^2), or neither? Would the Best Case be O(n)? Would the Average Case be O(nlogn), O(n+logn), O(logn), O(n^2+logn), or none of these? I tend to over-think solutions, so if I can get any guidance on combining running times, it would be much appreciated. Thank you very much.
