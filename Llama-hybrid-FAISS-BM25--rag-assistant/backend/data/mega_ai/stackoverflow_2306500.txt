What are the split characters in Silverlight's TextWrapping?

The TextWrapping feature in Silverlight is described here . However, I'm trying to find out the details of their line-breaking algorithm. Obviously a space will cause the text to break (or split), encouraging the text to wrap to the next line. And through trial and error I've found that these characters also cause a split: \t (tab) - ! ? But I doubt this is the full list. Has anyone found the full list of split characters (including Unicode)? Or do you have any clever suggestions for figuring this out that I haven't thought of yet? Trial and error can be slow.
