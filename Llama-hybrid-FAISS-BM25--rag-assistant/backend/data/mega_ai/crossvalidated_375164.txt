You have four groups (A1, A2, C and D) to do it at first. After fitting the model with 4 groups, you can test if A1 and A2 groups have the different means. If not, the A1 and A2 groups can be merged together and fit a new model with 3 groups (A, B, and C). If A1 and A2 have different means, it is meaningless to have an average effect of A1 and A2.
