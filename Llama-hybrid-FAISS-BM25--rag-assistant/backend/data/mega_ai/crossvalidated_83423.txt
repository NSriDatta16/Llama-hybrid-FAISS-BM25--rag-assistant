Given that you are a programmer you probably should not bother with the dummies' style books and take advantage of your skills to simultaneously learn R and statistics. I found the most insightful book for the pure programming side of R and as a reference to be The Art of R Programming . Great books to get you going on both the stats theory and R are: Linear Models With R , Extending the Linear Model With R and Generalized Additive Models in order of progression. The three books seem to be built around first thoroughly but succinctly explaining the theory and then getting down to business with some R code. So it should be a good way for you to learn. If you feel you need more basic statistics and the stats books above seem to be a bit much for you to kick off with, try All of Statistics , Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis or Mathematical Statistics with Applications . Youtube has plenty of good 101 Statistics courses at a useful level MIT , MIT2 , UCIrvine and machine learning courses as well. For Machine Learning I like Elements of Statistical Learning and Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning . Of course R has many more aspects than the ones covered in these books but they should keep you busy for quite a while. www.stackoverflow.com has the R programming topic covered. This list is subjective and based on personal encounters. It aims to be helpful and does not claim to be definitive in any way.
