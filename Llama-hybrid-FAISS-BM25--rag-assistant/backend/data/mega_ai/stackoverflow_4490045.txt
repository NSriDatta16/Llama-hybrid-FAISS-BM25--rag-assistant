Layout Designer - Drag and Drop in PHP

I would like to build a Layout designer in PHP or would like to use a readymade script( even if it is a paid one ) Basically I would like to create a sort of Layout where users could choose fields to add from a "field chooser". Each field could be of any type... and we would like to provide a field group too, where the user could choose the number of columns, and make the columns of this "panel" droppable. We should drag a field from a list, and drop the field to a placeholder on a Form (Panel?). Finally, is it possible to "read" the form layout in order to store it for later use? thanks kabir
