On stationarity It is not uncommon to find highly persistent volatility in GARCH models. Sometimes it may be caused by neglected structural changes or other types of model misspecification, but at least the finding is generally not surprising. I do not know much about the estimation of EGARCH models, but could it be that $\omega_3$ is restricted (by the estimation procedure) to be below one? If so, a value close to one could indicate that the coefficient might have been higher absent the restriction. In other words, the estimation procedure tries to squeeze the features of the data into a predefined feasible range when these features (such as persistence of volatility) do not quite fit in there. On residual diagnostics ARCH patterns being absent from residuals is encouraging; from this perspective you could keep your model.
