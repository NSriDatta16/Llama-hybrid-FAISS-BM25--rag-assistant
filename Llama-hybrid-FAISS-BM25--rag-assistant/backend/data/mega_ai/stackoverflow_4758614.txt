Cleanup erb files by abstracting/moving ruby code

I was wondering if it would be possible to cleanup or reorganize my views so that I have less Ruby code. The HTML often becomes cumbersome to work with because it has so much Ruby code. I thought about moving all the Ruby stuff into helpers and assign each function (links, tags etc.) to methods. Example. Problem becomes much worse with a more complicated layout. true, :class => "prev" unless @previous.nil? %> true, :class => "next" unless @next.nil? %> Would become: Helper: def link_to_previous link_to "Previous", art_path(@previous), :remote => true, :class => "prev" unless @previous.nil? end def link_to_next link_to "Next", art_path(@next), :remote => true, :class => "next" unless @next.nil? end This seems to work with simple examples.. but I am wondering how I should organize stuff when I have to do loops or similar. UPDATED: Loop example added "> "/comments/index", :locals => {:resource => art} %> What would you do?
