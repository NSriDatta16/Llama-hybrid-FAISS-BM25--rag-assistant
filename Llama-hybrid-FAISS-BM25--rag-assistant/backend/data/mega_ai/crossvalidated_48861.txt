First of all, your definition is not entirely correct. Here is the correct definition from wikipedia, as suggested by Cyan. Periodicity (source: wikipedia ) A state i has period k if any return to state i must occur in multiples of k time steps. Formally, the period of a state is defined as k = $gcd\{ n: \Pr(X_n = i | X_0 = i) > 0\}$ (where "gcd" is the greatest common divisor). Note that even though a state has period k, it may not be possible to reach the state in k steps. For example, suppose it is possible to return to the state in {6, 8, 10, 12, ...} time steps; k would be 2, even though 2 does not appear in this list. If k = 1, then the state is said to be aperiodic: returns to state i can occur at irregular times. In other words, a state i is aperiodic if there exists n such that for all n' â‰¥ n, $Pr(X_{n'} = i | X_0 = i) > 0.$ Otherwise (k > 1), the state is said to be periodic with period k. A Markov chain is aperiodic if every state is aperiodic. My Explanation The term periodicity describes whether something (an event, or here: the visit of a particular state) is happening at a regular time interval. Here time is measured in the number of states you visit. First Example: Now imagine that the clock represents a markov chain and every hour mark a state, so we got 12 states. Every state is visted by the hour hand every 12 hours (states) with probability=1, so the greatest common divisor is also 12. So every (hour-)state is periodic with period 12. Second example: Imagine a graph describing a sequence of coin tosses, starting at state $start$ and state $heads$ and $tails$ representing the outcome of the last coin toss. The transition probability is 0.5 for every pair of states (i,j), except $heads$ -> $start$ and $tails$ -> $start$ where it is 0. Now imagine you are in state $heads$. The number of states you have to visit before you visit $heads$ again could be 1,2,3 etc.. It will happen, so the probability is greater 0, but it is not exactly predictable when. So the greatest common divisior of all possible number of visits which could occur before you visit $heads$ again is 1. This means that $heads$ is aperiodic. The same applies for $tails$. Since it does not apply for $start$, the whole graph is not aperiodic. If we remove $start$, it would be.
