What would be a good Coldfusion-based bug tracking software?

What I am looking for is a tool that easily or automatically sends coldfusion error messages to their system. Then I can use the web-based interface, to manage priorities, track who fixed what and so forth. But I want to use this to help us deal with errors better, but also to show the importance of a bug tracking system to my fellow works. System Requirements: Apache, Windows, Coldfusion 8 Standard, Sql Server 2005. Financial Requirements: Free or Open Source Goal Or Purpose: To encourage my fellow workers to want and use a bug tracking system. Does this re-write make more sense? Thanks Craig
