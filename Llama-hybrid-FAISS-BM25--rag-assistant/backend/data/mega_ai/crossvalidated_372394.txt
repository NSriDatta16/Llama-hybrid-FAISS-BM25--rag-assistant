Is it possible to derive the total (aggregate) Income of a region from the deciles of single individuals incomes and total population?

I would need to derive the total (aggregate) Income of a certain region (to then compute the average). I have data on: disposable income for each individual of the region, but in deciles: 1st decile: \$ 18.000 2nd decile: \$ 21.000 ... ... 9th decile: \$ 54.000 total population of the region: 119.312 individuals From these pieces of information, is it possible to compute the total (aggregate) income of the region?
