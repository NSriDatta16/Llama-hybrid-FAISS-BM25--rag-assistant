"InterlockedExchange" for strings

I need an equivalent to InterlockedExchange, which I can use for assigning a string to string. This equivalent should be usable in c++. I know that I can start implementing my own mutex-based solution, but was wondering if there's anything ready and elegant. Thank you.
