Get All Elements in an HTML document with a specific CSS Class

What's the best way to get an array of all elements in an html document with a specific CSS class using javascript? No javascript frameworks like jQuery allowed here right now, and I could loop all the elements and check them manually myself. I'm hoping for something a little more elegant.
