Probability Bayesian CDF greater than true CDF for Gaussian random variable

A Gaussian random variable $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ has known variance $\sigma^2$ but unknown mean $\mu$. The cumulative distribution function of $X$ is denoted $F(x) = P(X $$P(F_B(x) > F(x)) = F(x)$$ Do you know of any literature that considers this problem or similar? Can you suggest why this might be the case?
