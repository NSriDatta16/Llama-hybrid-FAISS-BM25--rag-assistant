SSH is the best way to execute a command on a remote Unix box. How you use SSH from Java is another question. A while ago, I used the Ganymed library, which worked pretty well, but apparently that's not being maintained anymore. There are other similar libraries, but I don't know anything about them. Another option is to call the native SSH client through Runtime.exec().
