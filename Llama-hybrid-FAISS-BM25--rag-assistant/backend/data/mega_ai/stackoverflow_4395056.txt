I) Some elegant ways: 1) Doxygen ( http://www.doxygen.nl/ ) might be able to give you what you need. (If it doesn't already give this information, you could hack Doxygen's C++ parser a bit to get what you need). 2) There are also existing ANTLR grammar files for C++ as well. II) Quicker way (perhaps the right approach here): Regex should just be fine for your purpose as others suggest. Consider the following pseudo code: rm -f result_file; foreach source_file do sed 's/[ \t\n]\+/ /g' $source_file > temp_file; ## remove newlines, etc grep -o -P -i "friend [^;]*;" >> result_file; ## you can improve this regex for eliminating some possible unwanted matches or post-process result_file later done Now you have all friend relations in result_file. You can remove "friend functions" using another simple regex and/or process the result_file further as per needs.
