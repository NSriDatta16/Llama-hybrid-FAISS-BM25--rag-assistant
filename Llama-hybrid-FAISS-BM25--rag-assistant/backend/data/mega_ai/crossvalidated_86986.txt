How do I estimate the average size of objects

We have a large number of (physical) legal files, and want to get an estimate of the average number of pages per file. I do not know what distribution of pages to expect, the number of pages will range from 1 to a large finite number. My thought is to take a number of samples, count the number of pages in those files, and then use the average from that, but how many samples should I take to get a mildly accurate answer (no more than 20% off)? Does it matter which distribution I assume? I assume it does, but given that those files grow until they are viewed as done, at uneven rates (some letters contain more pages than others), what would most likely be the distribution to describe this?
