Normalization before or after resizing

I'm training deep learning network using images (to be exact - I'm solving semantic segmentation problem). What's the proper order of resizing (I need to resize images to fixed width X height ) and normalization (dividing by 255 value) of images in preprocessing? Does it make more sense to do first resizing and then normalization? Or first normalization and then resizing?
