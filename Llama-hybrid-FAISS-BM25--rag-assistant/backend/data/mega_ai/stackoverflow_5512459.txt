Sql join 2 aggregate columns

I have a table which looks like this: Name | Quantity | Unit -------+-------------+---------- Water 10 Lt Water 5 Lt Water 3 Lt Snacks 20 Kg Snacks 15 Kg Beer 7 Lt Beer 12 Lt Pizza 1 Piece Pizza 2 Piece Pizza 5 Piece I need to get these results: Name | Quantity_Unit -------+------------------ Water 18 Lt Snacks 35 Kg Beer 19 Lt Pizza 8 Piece So I need to select sum of quantities by products AND add unit of measure in the same column. It is pretty simple and that's how I do it: select name, cast(sum(quantity) as nvarchar) + ' ' + max(unit) as total from goods group by name My question is how can I add units of measure to aggregated column with sum(quantity) not using aggregate functions like max(unit) or using max() is fine for this case? Basically all goods in group by will have the same unit of measure and I'm looking for most elegant query. Thanks.
