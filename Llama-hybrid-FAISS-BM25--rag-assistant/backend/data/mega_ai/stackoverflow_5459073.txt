Android, GTE Cybertrust Root and the Keystore

Im seeing some strangeness with the GTE CyberTrust Global Root on android 2.1 and 2.2. If i add the cert using the CertificateInstaller from a WebView it claims the cert is a 'user certificate' and puts it in the user store: From the android source i can see: cert location = KEYSTORE_SPACE + Credentials.USER_CERTIFICATE If i add a self signed CA cert it adds it to the correct store: cert location = KEYSTORE_SPACE + Credentials.CA_CERTIFICATE So, im using ca_cert from wifiManager for EAP wireless auth source : public EnterpriseField ca_cert = new EnterpriseField("ca_cert"); If i set it to "keystore://CACERT_gteCert" it fails. If i set it to "keystore://USRCERT_getCert" is works. Any ideas on this behavior? Its going to make programming a wpa_supplicant configuration app for non rooted devices difficult. Im hoping i misunderstand something?
