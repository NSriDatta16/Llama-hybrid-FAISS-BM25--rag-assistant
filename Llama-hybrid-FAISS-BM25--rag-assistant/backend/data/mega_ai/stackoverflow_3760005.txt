If you mean working array as in the extra storage required over and above the final array, you don't even need that. To sort two lists which are already sorted, you only need to merge them and that requires only two values (one per source list) rather than n/2 . The algorithm is as follows: create empty list newlist set idx1 to start of list1 set idx2 to start of list2 while idx1 within list1 or idx2 within list2: if idx1 beyond list1: append list2[idx2] to newlist increment idx2 else if idx2 beyond list2: append list1[idx1] to newlist increment idx1 else if list1[idx1] is less than list2[idx2]: append list1[idx1] to newlist increment idx1 else: append list2[idx2] to newlist increment idx2 If you mean "Can you combine two n/2 -size arrays into another n/2 -size array?" then, short of doing some trickery where you can combine two elements into one (such as tow 16-bit integers into a 32-bit element), no, it's not possible.
