Is it possible to override/Update Prototype version 1.4 to version 1.7 on another site via javascript?

(I'm not quite sure how to title this question, feel free to edit). I'm embedding a JS widget on another website that uses Prototype.js Version 1.4. I'm using jQuery in my widget, so it's running in no-conflict mode already. (I read somewhere that version 1.4 of prototype "just doesn't play well" with jQuery, even in no-conflict mode. I can elaborate, but that is probably a different question.) I can't change which version of Prototype the client website included, but if I could "unload and reload" prototype with the latest version 1.7 that would fix my conflict woes. Any ideas if this is possible? Thanks
