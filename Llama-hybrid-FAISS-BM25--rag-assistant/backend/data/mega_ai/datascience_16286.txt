Firstly your data's amount is very small for any kind of analysis, so if it was posssible to get more data then that would be better. Secondly as you mentioned that your data was imbalanced then the accuracy metrics you have posted lose all meaning, since 140 samples are of the same class, the algorithm is predicting that class for every sample. So for better evaluation calculate precision, recall and f-score. Thirdly, since your data is already less than needed don't undersample, instead oversample using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique) implementation . Using a stratified KFold, and a Random Forest will mostly be your best bet here. But remember with this less than needed data, it would be impossible to achieve a model without underfitting or overfitting.
