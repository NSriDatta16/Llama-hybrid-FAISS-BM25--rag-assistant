Embedding YouTube videos/playlists to WSIWYG Editor

Coding in ASP.NET/C#/jQuery/Javascript Third Party Editor used: Innova Studio WSIWYG Editor I am embedding youtube videos in the WSIWYG editor with the help of YouTube Embedded Player Parameters My question is, what are the embedding parameters for playlists? Are they both similar? Are there some reference sites we could look at?
