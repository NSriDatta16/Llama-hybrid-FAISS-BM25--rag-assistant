Is this a one-time action (like "just import those 368 new customers once") or do you regularly have to do 368 sproc calls? If it's a one-time action, just go with the 368 calls. (if the sproc does much more than just updates and is likely to drag down the performance, run it in the evening or at night or whenever no one's working). IMO, premature optimization of database calls for one-time actions is not worth the time you spend with it.
