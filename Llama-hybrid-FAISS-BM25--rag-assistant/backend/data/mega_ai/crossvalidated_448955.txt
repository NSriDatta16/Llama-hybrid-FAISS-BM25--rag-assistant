Up to the last paragraph, the setting appears to be entirely Bayesian. I will first respond to the questions raised up to (but excluding) the last paragraph from a Bayesian perspective. ...for the same physical process of tossing fair coins in a row, one person thinks that the tosses are independent and the other doesn't, while I know that they are all IID. Does this make independence subjective? In your example, the difference between persons arises not because they treat the same information differently, but because of the different (amount of) information they have. The first one is conditioning on $p=0.5$ (using $p$ to denote the probability of heads), while the second one is not. Another, perhaps more relevant question is: Were the two persons given the same information, would they necessarily arrive at the same conclusion regarding independence? If having the same information implies having the same priors and likelihoods (does it? I do not have an answer right now), then the answer is in the affirmative. Should we assess independence based on an idealized true data generating process or based on what we currently know about the process? As Bayesians, we should assess independence based on what we currently know about the process. According to Lindley "Understanding Uncertainty" (2006) p. 37-38, Probability describes a relationship between you and the world, or that part of the world involved in the event. It is not solely a feature of your mind, it is not a value possessed by an event but expresses a relationship between you and the event and is a basic tool in your understanding of the world (emphasis is mine). Since independence is defined by probabilities, I think the same logic and interpretation extends to independence. (It is also not entirely clear to me how to express the statement assess independence based on an idealized true data generating process rigorously in statistical terms.) Regarding the last paragraph and the treatment of independence from a frequentist perspective, there are two steps to the process: How real world events/phehomena are modeled probabilistically How independence is defined and understood within the models (regardless of their connection to the real world). In step 1, questions can be raised regarding some simplifying assumptions taken when moving from the real world to models. A relevant one for us is about the plausibility of an assumption that the outcome of the first toss does not affect the physical properties of the second toss; this can form a basis for a formal assumption of independence defined on the model level (step 2). In step 2, independence can be assessed formally using laws of probability, and that is relatively easy, I believe (given a complete job in step 1). Regarding ...it is quite perplexing that if question was posed as randomly picking a coin from an urn containing one biased and one fair coin (not knowing which one you picked) and then tossing the same coin N times, the frequentist would probably agree that the tosses are not unconditionally independent, which means independence [is assessed] based on what they know about the situation instead of the ground truth that the tosses actually don't affect each other, the problem is with step (1). The real world phenomena are more complicated than just throwing the same coin several times; there is also the action of picking one of two coins in the beginning. Taking proper account of the latter yields (after being formalized in step 2) unconditional dependence. After some thought, one will probably not find it counterintuitive. Now, if we are only looking at tosses of a single coin, then we have independence, whether we define it conditionally on having selected a concrete coin in the experiment you describe or we define it unconditionally in an experiment where only one coin exists (so not your experiment). So in my understanding, there is actually no clash with the ground truth -- as long as we are identifying the phenomena we are modelling / taking into account correctly.
