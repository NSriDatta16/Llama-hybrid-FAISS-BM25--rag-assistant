All fields that are not in the GROUP BY clause have to be aggregate expressions such as AVG(...) or SUM(...) or MAX(...) etc. So this is wrong: SELECT RLS.RoleId, UIR.UserId, UIR.RoleId, USR.UserName (...) GROUP BY RLS.RoleId because the last three expressions in the SELECT should either be aggregated somehow or added to the GROUP BY clause. This is logical because by specifying GROUP BY RLS.RoleId you say that RLS.RoleId should be unique in the end result, so only one row per value. But for each RLS.RoleID there could be multiple values for UIR.UserId, UIR.RoleId or USR.UserName. So you need to tell the DBMS what to do to make them into one row: average, maximum, minimum... OR you add fields to the GROUP BY clause, so that not RLS.RoleID but the combination of column values should be unique. See also this example .
