I think you could iterate through the subviews property in any UIView , then to check if it's specifically a UIButton you can use - (BOOL)isKindOfClass:(Class)aClass . To differentiate between the UIButton s you can apply tags to them or check other properties. EDIT : By the way, why not just sub-class UITableViewCell, add your button(s) as IBOutlet properties, then when you want to access them you can just do myCell.someButton ? Here is an article on how to sub-class UITableViewCell and use it in your UITableView. If you do it this way, then everything will be organized. The UITableView will only worry about its UITableViewCells, and each UITableViewCell will worry about its individual UIButtons.
