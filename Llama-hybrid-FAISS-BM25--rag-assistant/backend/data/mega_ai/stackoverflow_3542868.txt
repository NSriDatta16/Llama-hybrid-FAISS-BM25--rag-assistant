UITableView is redrawing only some of custom cells

For quite a bit of time I am struggled with a kinda stupid problem. Hope someone can give me a hand. UITableView is being implemented. The UITableViewCell is drawn in .xib and connected to a textEditCell property. in the main program there is a simple code: - (UITableViewCell *) tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { return textEditCell; } Yet when the view is drawn, only some cells (after the view is started - last cell) is drawn. If the view is dragged beyond the top end of the screen, the top cell is been drawn, the bottom one is gone; when dragging to the bottom the behaviour is opposite. Given the example in Apple cookbook ? that is Listing 5-7. what am I doing wrong? Appreciate your help.
