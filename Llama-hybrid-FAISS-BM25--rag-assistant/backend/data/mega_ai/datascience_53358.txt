Non-separable assignments of the vertices of a hypercube

I have a question regarding exercise 14.17 in An Introduction to Information Retrieval by Manning et al. The problem is: "Assuming two classes, show that the percentage of non-separable assignments of the vertices of a hypercube decreases with dimensionality M for M > 1. For example, for M = 1 the proportion of non-separable assignments is 0, for M = 2, it is 2/16. Solve the exercise either analytically or by simulation." The total number of assignments of vertices of an N-dimensional hypercube is: $2^{(2^N)}$ And as I found in here the number of separable assignments is O( $2^{(N^2)}$ ). So the percentage of non-separable assignments is increasing with N (which is the opposite of what is said in the exercise). What am I missing here?
