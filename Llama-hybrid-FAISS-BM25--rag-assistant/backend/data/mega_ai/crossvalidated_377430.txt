Careful: Two additional points are worth noting. First, 80 of the original 92 DD papers have a potential problem with grouped error terms as the unit of observation is more detailed than the level of variation (a point discussed by Donald and Lang [2001]). Only 36 of these papers address this problem, either by clustering standard errors or by aggregating the data. Second, several techniques are used (more or less informally) for dealing with the possible endogeneity of the intervention variable. For example, three papers include a lagged dependent variable in equation (1), seven include a time trend specific to the treated states, fifteen plot some graphs to examine the dynamics of the treatment effect, three examine whether there is an "effect" before the law, two test whether the effect is persistent, and eleven formally attempt to do triple-differences (DDD) by finding another control group. In Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan [2002] we show that most of these techniques do not alleviate the serial correlation issues. (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004, 253)
