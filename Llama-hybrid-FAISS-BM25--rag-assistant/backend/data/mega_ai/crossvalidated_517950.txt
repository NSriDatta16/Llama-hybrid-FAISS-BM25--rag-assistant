Setting up a linear regression: plant height as a function of time period and soil pH

The following is from Hoff's "A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods" book. The data set tplant mentioned above appears below. I am trying to use an ordinary least squares to fit a regression line, modeling the plant height as a function of both time (measurement period) and pH level, but I have some concerns about my model. EDIT : I interpret the entries of column V2 to indicate the time period (0 or 1 - corresponding to the initial or latter height measurement); V3 indicates the pH levels (the duplicates appear since we are using the same pH for the second measurement); V1 indicates the height measurements (alternating between times 0 and 1). Based on 1), my linear model is $$y_i = \beta_1 x_{i1}+\beta_2 x_{i2}+\varepsilon_{i},$$ where $y_i$ is the height of the ith plant measurement, $i=1,...,20$ ; the values $x_{i1}$ correspond to the time period, so $x_{i1}=0$ if $i$ is odd and $x_{i1}=1$ otherwise; the values $x_{i2}$ correspond to column V3 (pH level). I.e., $$11.80=y_1=\beta_{1}0+6.39\beta_{2}+\varepsilon_{1}=6.39\beta_{2}+\varepsilon_{1}\\ 11.54 = y_2 = \beta_{1}1+6.39\beta_{2}+\varepsilon_{2}=\beta_{1}+6.39\beta_{2}+\varepsilon_{2}\\ \vdots \\ 8.86 = y_{19}=\beta_{1}0+\beta_{2}2.02+\varepsilon_{19}=2.02\beta_2+\varepsilon_{19}\\ 12.24 = y_{20} = \beta_{1}1+\beta_{2}2.02+\varepsilon_{20} = \beta_{1}+2.02\beta_{2}+\varepsilon_{20} $$
