Is the inductive bias a prior?

Wikipedia defines it like this: The inductive bias (also known as learning bias) of a learning algorithm is the set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict outputs given inputs that it has not encountered. Can this be seen as a prior in the Bayesian framework, and if not, why?
