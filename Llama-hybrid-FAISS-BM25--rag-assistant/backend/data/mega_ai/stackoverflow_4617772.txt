cannot remove backslashes added by streamReader.ReadLine - c sharp

the text I've got from the file has the following string: 1"-DC-19082-A3 after getting that line I get the following string (got it while debugging): "\"1\"\"-DC-19082-A3\"" as I'm searching on the DB it's not of any use like that any idea how can I get back to the original? I've seen that StreamWriter.WriteLine would do the job, but I don't want to create any file for this. I tried the following, but it didn't work StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.Append(@"\"); sb.Append('"'); string strToReplace = sb.ToString(); string lineNumberToSearchFor = lineNumber.Replace(strToReplace, string.Empty); hopefully there's an easy way of achieving this many thanks!
