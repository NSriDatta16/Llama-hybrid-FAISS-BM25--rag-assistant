Aside from additional CPU utilization for the duration of the collection, forcing a garbage collection does not result in an impact to other .NET processes. However, forcing a garbage collection will not - in most cases - result in a release of physical memory. The mapping of physical memory to the address space of a process is a complicated thing. A garbage collection in a .NET process may increase the free space in the managed heap - but it isn't guaranteed to result in a decrease in the working set size (the memory your Win32 process is given from the OS). Even if you could get such a scheme working - it would be fragile at best, and may not work under all circumstances. There is a Win32 method called SetProcessWorkingSetSize() which allows you to control the minimum and maximum physical memory allocated to a process. You may want to look into this in conjunction with the forced collection scheme you are exploring.
