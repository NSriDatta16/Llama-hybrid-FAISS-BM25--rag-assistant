Post parameters are becoming null (at random)

My web application is developed with Struts2 and it was working fine till recently. All of a sudden one of the modules has started malfunctioning. The malfunctioning module is 'Update Student details' page. This page has a lot of fields like 'schoolName', 'degreeName', etc . School 1: School 2: ..... School n: As mentioned earlier, the page was working perfectly fine till recently. Now, one/many of the values of 'schoolName', 'degreeName', etc are being received as "" (EMPTY STRING) on the server-side. For debugging, I used firebug and remote-debugging in eclipse. I find that the post-parameters are correct on the client-side. For instance, during one of the submissions the post-parameters were as below (i noted them from firebug). Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------2921238217421 Content-Length: 48893 -----------------------------2921238217421 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="schoolName" ABC Institute -----------------------------2921238217421 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="schoolName" Test School -----------------------------2921238217421 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="schoolName" XYZ -----------------------------2921238217421 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="schoolName" Texas Institute -----------------------------2921238217421 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="schoolName" XXXX School -----------------------------2921238217421-- But on the server-side, the request params were as below: schoolName=[ABC Institute, Test School, XYZ, , XXXX School], "Texas Institute" was received as "" (EMPTY STRING) in this particular case. This is not happening consistently. The parameters that become NULL (or EMPTY STRING) seem random to me - during one instance, parameter schoolName[3] became null as illustrated above, parameter schoolName[2] became null during yet another submission, etc. At times, none of the parameters are nullified. The following is the list of the interceptors in the action definition. List of interceptors: ---------------------- FileUploadInterceptor org.apache.struts2.interceptor.FileUploadInterceptor ServletConfigInterceptor org.apache.struts2.interceptor.ServletConfigInterceptor StaticParametersInterceptor com.opensymphony.xwork2.interceptor.StaticParametersInterceptor ParametersInterceptor com.opensymphony.xwork2.interceptor.ParametersInterceptor MyCustomInterceptor com.xxxx.yyyy.interceptors.GetLoggedOnUserInterceptor This issue appears rather weird to me and I have not been able to zero-in on the exact cause of the issue. Any help in this regard would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Thanks, Raghuram
