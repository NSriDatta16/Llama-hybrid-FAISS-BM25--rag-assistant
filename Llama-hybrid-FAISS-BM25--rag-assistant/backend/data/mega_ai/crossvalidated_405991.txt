what's the use of lag? when using it do I have to lag my dependent variable or is it only the independent variable?

I am confused about the usage of lags. I have a problem on multicollinearity and someone propose that I should use lag or conduct a first difference on my model. ***My method of estimation is a simple OLS regression with a time series sample size of 28. When I conduct VIF to test for multicollinearity, I found that my variables have very high multicollinearity issue as one of it has a vif of 204. To remedy for it, I tried to log-transformed my model but high multicollinearity issue still exists. Then upon searching the net I found that one of the solution is to lag transformed it but I was confused on how to interpret it. I am contemplating whether to drop one of my variables but as much as possible i tried to avoid it...so I was finding some ways to resolve this issue. I also don't know how to regress lags. Like do I have to do it this way: loggini = logvar1(t) + logvar1(t-1) +logvar2(t) + logvar2(t-1)... logvar6(t) + logvar6(t-1)? or should I remove the logvar1(t) and just use logvar1(t-1)?
