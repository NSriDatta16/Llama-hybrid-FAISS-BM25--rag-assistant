I believe, when you embed the export-symbol in your flex-app, it would be taking care of size and perhaps just embedding the png directly. As your symbol-class extends BitmapData, it has to be instantiated by passing required arguments in constructor. So whatever error you get, is by design and work as expected. You can wrap png in some other type of symbols (sprite, movieclip, etc) and export. That should work fine when used in setStyle (..,..)
