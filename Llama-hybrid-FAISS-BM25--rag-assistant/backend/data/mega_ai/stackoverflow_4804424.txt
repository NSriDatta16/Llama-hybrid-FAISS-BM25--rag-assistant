PHP extract part from array keeping previous keys

I have the array with specific keys. I want to get the first 5 array elements. I use array_splice() . All OK, but keys in the new array is 0, 1, 2, 3 ,4. And I want to keep the previous array keys. I can do it with foreach , but i am finding the elegant method. My code: $levels = array('a' => 1, 'b' =>2, 'c' => 3, 'd' => 4, 'f' => 5, 'g' => 6); $levels = array_splice($levels, 5); Thank you in advance. Sorry for my english.
