You need to talk with your hardware vendor - especially the storage one to see if they provide some sort of hardware based replication. Looking at the volume of the data, I don't think software based solution will be optimal. Here is how I handle it for 3 databases (11, 17 and 23 TB) right now. We are hosting the database in a EMC SAN. Every 12 hours the databases are cloned on different luns located on the same same SAN and then mounted on different servers. This is the backup in case the primary servers get hosed. These databases are generally 12 hours behind the primary databases. We use them for reporting where we can live with 12 hours old data. Every 24 hours, the clones in 2 are copied to a different SAN in a different building and mounted. This is a the secondary backup. In these databases we run the diagnostics, DBCC checks etc. In total we are running a total of 9 SQL Server Enterprise Edition (3 prod, 3 first line DR and 3 second line DR) instances. We decided to go this way, as we could live with upto 24 hours of lag in the data. This is certainly doable, but it will require a fair bit of planning as well as investment in your part. For us the cost for 9 EE license was not much compared to the price of two SANs and the interconnect between them.
