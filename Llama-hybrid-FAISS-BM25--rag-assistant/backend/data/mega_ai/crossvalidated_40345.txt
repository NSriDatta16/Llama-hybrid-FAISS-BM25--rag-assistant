The probability all $3$ are distinct is $\frac{(D-1)(D-2)}{D^2}$. The probability the third is not equal to the first two is $\frac{(D-1)^2}{D^2}$. Imagine choosing $C$ first. Then there are $D-1$ choices for $A$ so that $A\ne C$, and $D-1$ choices for $B$ so that $B\ne C$. If you are given that the first two are distinct, the conditional probability that the third is different from both is $\frac{D-2}{D}$. You are correct that if you are given the first two are equal, the conditional probability that the third is different is $\frac{D-1}{D}$. If $D=10$, these are $72\%, 81\%, 80\%,$ and $90\%,$ respectively. The $81\%$ is naturally a weighted average between $80\%$ and $90\%$, weighted by the probabilities that the first two are distinct or not. The $72\%$ can also be viewed as a weighted average between $81\%$ and $0$, weighted by the conditional probability that the first two are distinct from each other given that they are distinct from the third.
