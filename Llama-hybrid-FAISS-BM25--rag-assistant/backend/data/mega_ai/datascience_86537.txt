scikit-learn classification report's f1 accuracy?

When I run scikit-learn classification_report() on my 2-class y and yhat , I get the following: precision recall f1-score support 0 0.84 0.97 0.90 160319 1 0.67 0.27 0.38 41010 accuracy 0.82 201329 I understand F1, macro-averaged F1, etc. But what is the accuracy value of 0.82 under the f1-score column? I already read other questions about this function: How to interpret classification report of scikit-learn? Sklearn classification report is not printing the micro avg score for multi class classification model macro average and weighted average meaning in classification_report
