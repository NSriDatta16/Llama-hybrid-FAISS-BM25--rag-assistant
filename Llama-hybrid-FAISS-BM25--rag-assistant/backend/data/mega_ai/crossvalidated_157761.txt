The problem using your approach is it lacks generability and would require the additional access to model errors and historical observations. However all ARIMA models can be restated as a weighted average of the past. Some software actually presents/restates the equation in this form for a better understanding by the human that is involved in creating a narrative about the equation. The PI weights is the formal name for this re-expression. You can find out more about the pi weights by reviewing quality textbooks like http://www.amazon.co.uk/Time-Series-Analysis-Univariate-Multivariate/dp/0201159112 You might need to incorporate level shift or time trend variables into your equation or seasonal dummies. I would suggest that you try and duplicate the conversion of ARIMA models into PI weights. AUTOBOX, a piece of software that I have helped develop, performs this tour de force. You can download either a live unrestricted 30-day trial version or a pure demo version (data restricted) which allows you to use hundreds of delivered data sets. edit: I would like to repeat that all ARIMA model can also be represented as a pure AR model. These weights are referred to as the Pi weights as compared to the pure MA form (Psi weights) . In this way you can view (interpret) an ARIMA model as an optimized weighted average of the past values. In other words rather than assume a pre-specified length and values for a weighted average , an ARIMA model delivers both the length (n) of the weights and the actual weights (c1,c2,...cn). Y(t) =c1*Y(tâˆ’1) + c2*Y(t-2) + c3*Y(t-3)+.... cn*Y(t-n) + a(t) In this way an ARIMA model can be explained as the answer to the question How many historical values should I use to compute a weighted sum of the past Precisely what are those values.
