Please refer a GUI Modelling tools for a .Net object database?

I am planning to use an object database, say eloquera ( http://eloquera.com/page/home.aspx ). If I use RDBMS as storage, there are a lot of GUI modelling tools. But I cannot find one for object database. In other words, a GUI modelling tools to generate .Net (C#) code. If you know one, please tell me. Thanks, Ying Actually I have had a look at a few UML tools. They lack some features I need. I rearranged my idea and create a new question here, A component/tools of knowledge based modeling for .Net ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3227543/a-component-tools-of-knowledge-based-modeling-for-net ). Sorry, this question is closed. Thank you, Ying
