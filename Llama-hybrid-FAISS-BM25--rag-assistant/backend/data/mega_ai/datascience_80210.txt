There is no Special reason that neural networks are suitable, if anything it could be too much (depending on the complexities of your time-series). In any case, you need to deal with you Nan values and if you are looking for a fast model, that imputes that automatically, I would suggest lgbm . Since it will impute NAN with values that reduce the out of fold loss the most (making the highly optimal imputation).
