Advantages of breaking down a logistic regression in multiple steps?

I am wondering what are the advantages/disadvantages of breaking down a logistic regression in multiple steps, when they are available. Let me explain what I mean by multiple steps : Think of it like the customer journey: A cold lead ( A ) becomes a prospect ( B ) who then becomes a customer ( C ). A -> B -> C I'm interested in predicting the conversion from A to C , which can be done with a logistic regression. I wonder if I could also do two logistic regressions, first from A to B , then from B to C , and multiply the predictions. What are the differences between the two approaches? Things to consider: What if the conversion rate from A to B is small? (Then the sample size for the 2nd model is small as well) Where does most of the signal come from? Maybe my explanatory variables explain most of A to B but nothing of B to C , or the other way around.
