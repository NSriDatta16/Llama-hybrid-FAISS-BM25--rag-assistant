Command Pattern: Executing multiple commands in sequence

I want to issue a series of Command executions, but only when the prior command succeeded. Right now i am raising an event within the command object indicating whether the command succeeded or failed. I am using this to control execution, but it feels inelegant. Example: command1.CommandSucceeded += delegate { command2.Execute(); }; command1.Execute(); This works, but it feels clumsy and unintuitive. I could pass a boolean back on Execute() indicating success or failure, but that is along the same path. I could throw exceptions on failure, which would might result in cleaner code, but might be overkill. Any suggestions?
