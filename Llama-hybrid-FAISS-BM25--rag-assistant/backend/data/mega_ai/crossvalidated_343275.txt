Constructing a discrete time stochastic process with certain autocorrelation

I am trying to construct a discrete time stochastic process from which I can generate time series to work with. The stochastic process should have low autocorrelation everywhere but on certain lags (e.g at lags 7, 14, 21, etc. the autocorrelations should be high / significant and at the other lags the autocorrelations should be small / not significant). This is the only requirement on the stochastic process. Is there a simple way to do this?
