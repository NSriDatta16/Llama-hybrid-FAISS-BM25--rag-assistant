How can I embed arbitrary integers and real numbers into the same space as words?

I'm trying to build a recurrent neural network (specifically a BiLSTM) where at each time step the input could be an integer, a real number, or a word from a large vocabulary. Since low-dimensional word embeddings work well for word-only RNNs, I'd like to be able to embed integers and real numbers in the same embedding space as the words. I think it would make sense for frequent numeric values (like small integers 1 and 10) to be treated exactly like new words in the vocabulary and be given their own embedding. But how should I handle numeric values that occur infrequently (or not at all) in my training corpus? For infrequent words, I'm backing off to a character-based RNN to get the embedding like in Ling et al. , but making an equivalent digit-based RNN seems less principled. Do I have any other options?
