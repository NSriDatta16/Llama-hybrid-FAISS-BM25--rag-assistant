I would say it depends on the solution design. If the idea is that your base class handles those events and in between gives the chance to the derived classes to do their own things, then you can declare a method like onTouchesBegan, call it from your base class' touchesBegan implementation, and implement it in your derived classes as needed. This is less error prone than relying on the derived class to call the base. Also the base will be in control of the order of things.
