I know its a bit of an old question but given the fact that I saw a lot of programmers still don’t know how to get started. Thus, I created "A complete daily plan for studying to become a machine learning engineer" repository. This is my multi-month study plan for going from mobile developer (self-taught, no CS degree) to machine learning engineer. My main goal was to find an approach to studying Machine Learning that is mainly hands-on and abstracts most of the Math for the beginner. This approach is unconventional because it’s the top-down and results-first approach designed for software engineers. Please, feel free to make any contributions you feel will make it better.
