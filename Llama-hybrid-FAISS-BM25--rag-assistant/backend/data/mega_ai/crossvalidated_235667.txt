Partial Dependence plot interpretation for Categorical variables

I am using partial dependence plot from random forest. The partial plot doesn't make sense to me. 10th completed people have only 62 out of 933 people as 1. But the partial plot shows positive bar, while doctorate have 3/4 of the population under 1 and partial plot shows negative bar. Data: Count falling under each category of education
