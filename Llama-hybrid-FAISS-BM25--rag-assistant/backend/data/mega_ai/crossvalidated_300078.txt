Bayesian conditional probability question

My girlfriend asked for my help on a probability problem, and I'm kind of stumped. I don't want to let her down so I was hoping I could get a tip. This is the question: Suppose we have two hypothesis $H_1$ and $H_2$ with disjoint probabilities such that $P(H_1)=0.2$ and $P(H_2)=0.8$ Now we observe an event $E$, which would be unlikely given $H_2$. Specifically, the probability of seeing event $E$ given $H_2$ is 40%, $P(E | H_2)= .4$. How can I calculate the conditional probabilities $P(H_1|E)$ and $P(H_2|E)$$? I know Bayes theorem is: $$P(A | B) = (P(B | A) * P(A)) / P(B)$$ And when I try to apply this to the question at hand: $$ P(H2 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_2) * P(H_2)}{P(E)} \\ =\frac{ 0.4 * 0.8 }{ P(E) }\\ = \frac{.32 }{P(E)} $$ However, $P(E)$ is not given. Similarly when I attempt to use Bayes formula for the other conditional probability: $$ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) * P(H_1) }{ P(E) }\\ = \frac{P(E | H_1) * 0.2 }{ P(E)} $$ Again, I do not know $P(E)$, let alone $P(E | H_1)$. If I try to use the information I already have and Bayes formula to derive some new information, I solve for nothing useful: $$ P(E | H_2) = \frac{P(H_2 | E) * P(E)}{ P(H_2)} = 0.4\\ = \frac{P(H_2 | E) * P(E) }{ 0.8 } = 0.4\\ => P(H_2 | E) * P(E) = .32 $$ Is is possible that I am missing some information needed to solve the problem? I appreciate any help, thanks!
