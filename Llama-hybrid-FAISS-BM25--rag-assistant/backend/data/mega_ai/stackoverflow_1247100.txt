Get Search Engines to link to sub-pages instead of index

I wrote a blogging system from scratch ( http://seanhess.net ). I have the last 10 posts displayed on the index page / , and each post has it's own page /post/a_simple_post . I'm getting a good rank in google when I search for specific info from my posts, but google links to the index page instead of the post page. How do I get the search engine to drill into those post links? Framework PHP Tutorial August 03, 2009 Example Post Paragraph
