Multiple HTTP GET parameters with the same identifier

Let's say I am getting requests such as: http://www.example.com/index.php?id=123&version=3&id=234&version=4 Is it possible to extract these in a simple way inside my php code? I realize I could get the entire querystring with javascript using window.location.href and handle it manually but I'm looking for something more elegant. The requests can contain any number of version/id pairs but I can assume that the query is well-formed and have no obligation to handle invalid strings.
