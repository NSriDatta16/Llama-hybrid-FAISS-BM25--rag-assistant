Default Accessor Needed: Custom ConfigurationSection

I am totally confused by a simple Microsoft error message. When I run XSD.exe against an assembly that contains a custom ConfigurationSection (which in turn utilizes a custom ConfigurationElement and a custom ConfigurationElementCollection, as well as several ConfigurationProperties), I get the following error message: Error: There was an error processing 'Olbert.Entity.Utils.dll'. There was an error reflecting type 'Olbert.Entity.DatabaseConnection'. You must implement a default accessor on System.Configuration.ConfigurationLockCollection because it inherits from ICollection. Yet the class in question has a default accessor: public object this[int idx] { get { return null; } set { } } I realize the above doesn't do anything, but I don't need to access the element's properties by index. I'm just trying to work around the error message. So what's going on?
