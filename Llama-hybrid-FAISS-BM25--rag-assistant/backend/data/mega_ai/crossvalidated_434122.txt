Linear regression to answer causal questions

At a news agency, I want to understand whether the number of breaking news infuence the number of citations other media make relative to the news agency. I do not measure citations of exact news, but only numbers per day totalling to the agency. The red line stands for regular news, green line is the number of breaking news, and the thick black is the number of citations. I know the number of news articles where the media mention the news agency ( cite_cnt ) daily. I also know the number of regular news ( news_cnt ) and breaking news ( flash_cnt ) that the news agency made daily. I build this linear model: tass_lm |t|) (Intercept) 276.37487 17.96854 15.381 To my surprise I found that the number of breaking news is significantly linked to the number of citations. For other news agencies I have the data from, this coefficient is not significant. So, on top of average level and influence of the regular, I see that breaking news relates to higher number of citations. Q: I am prone to conclude that 1) breaking news matter a lot if we want more citations. 2) (this is my main question) increasing the number of breaking news will increase citation number if all other factors (including those out of scope) do not change. Is such a causal reference vaild in this case? Update: tass_lm |t|) (Intercept) 283.66023 15.67226 18.100 Update 2 (GLM): Using GLM with the Possion family resulted in even higer t-statistic for the breaking news counts. tass_glm |z|) (Intercept) 5.647e+00 1.754e-02 322.026
