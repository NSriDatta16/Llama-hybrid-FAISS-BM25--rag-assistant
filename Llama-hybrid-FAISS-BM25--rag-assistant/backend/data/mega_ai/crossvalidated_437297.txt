Calculating error values in an MA(2) process

I have a numerical MA process that I am struggling with. I have been given a $t = 119$ time series and must forecast the next 5 terms using a MA(2) model as shown $$_ = 2 + _ + 0.5_{−1} - 0.1_{−2}$$ I know to forecast the next term I can use this equation $$E(_|_{−1}) = 2 + 0.5_{−1} - 0.1_{−2}$$ I have the formula for the errors $_ = _ − E(_|_{−1})$ where $_{−1}$ is all of the information up to that point. So if I want to calculate $_{−1}$ for example must I then recursively calculate the errors for all previous elements? Or if my last element is say $65$ , can I say $$_{−1} = _{-1} − E(_{-1}|_{−2}) = 65 - 2 = 63$$ Seeing as the expectation of my process is 2. Sorry if this all over the place Ive been working on it for 2 hours to no avail.
