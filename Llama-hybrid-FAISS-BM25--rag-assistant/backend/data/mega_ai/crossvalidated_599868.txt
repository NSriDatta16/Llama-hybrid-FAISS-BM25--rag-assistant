Laplace is able to solve the problem because it is robust to outliers. Check the figures above: observe how Laplace fares against outliers compared to that of Gaussian. As explained in $\rm [I], $ heavy tails assign higher likelihood to outliers, without having to perturb the straight line to “explain” them. More importantly, as noted in the lecture note linked by OP, the mle involves the minimization of absolute difference while that of Gaussian involved quadratic penalization of the outliers.
