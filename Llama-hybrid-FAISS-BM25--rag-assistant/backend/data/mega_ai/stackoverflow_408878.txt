I use reflector during development to examine how the compiler turns C# into IL, as I do a lot of work with things like Reflection.Emit and Expression . I also use it to quickly look at my code; when you have a large dll library, I find it quicker to simply drag the dll+xml from the build server into reflector than it is to load each project into VS, especially if I'm not 100% sure where a bit of code is... You can also use with with plugins like snippy as a test rig for snippets of code.
