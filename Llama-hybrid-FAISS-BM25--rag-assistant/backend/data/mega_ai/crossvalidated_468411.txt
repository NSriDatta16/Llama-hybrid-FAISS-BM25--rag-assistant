Time series methods to compare quantitative continuous data (e.g., heart rate) and qualitative/subjective data (e.g., self-reported stress)

I work with a lot of data from sports wearables (e.g., heart rate). I ran a study where people wore a heart rate tracker whilst doing an activity. Every 5 minutes they were prompted to rate how much stress they felt on a scale of 0-10. I'd like to see whether there is a relationship between heart rate (quantitative data) and self-reports (qualitative data). Are there any methods (e.g., for correlation) that I can try? I have looked into dynamic time warping, but it seems it only works for the same quantitative data (e.g., voice recordings). I've also tried calculating the percent change and correlating them, but since my qualitative variable has 0 some percent changes were inf values
