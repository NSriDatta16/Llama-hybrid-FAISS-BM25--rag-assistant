Something to try: group your class into - say - worst 10%, best 10%, and the rest. Deliver the lists to your management, saying, "I predict the majority of bugs over the next quarter will be found in the first set." Based on length, cyclomatic complexity , test coverage - whatever tools are handy and comfortable to you. Then sit back and watch - and be right. Now you've got some credibility, some leverage when you say, "I'd like to invest some resources in making our bad code better, to reduce bugs and maintenance costs - and I know where to invest that energy, see?"
