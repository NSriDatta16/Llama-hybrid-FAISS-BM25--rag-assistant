Reading dynamically generated HTML element value in codebehind in ASP.NET

I have an asp.net page where I have the below markup. Basically this markup is generated from codebehind by reading records from a table and looping through them. For each record in table, there will be a div block. Basically this form is to read/show settings for a user. The settings entries are stored in a table. Name Domain name URL Some other value is enabled ? The id's of each input element will be unique. Now in codebehind I want to read the values of each input element to save the changes user made. How can I read the elements here? Since the mark up is generated in codebehind as a string and appended the the INNER HTML of the external div, I can't read values like we do for a control which we drag and drop in the IDE.
