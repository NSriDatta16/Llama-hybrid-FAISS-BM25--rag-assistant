TCP/UDP and ethernet MTU Fragmentation

I've read various sites and tutorials online but I am still confused. If the message is bigger than IP MTU, then send() returns the byte sent. What happens to the rest of the message? Am I to call send() again and attempt to send rest of the message? Or is that something IP layer should take care of automatically?
