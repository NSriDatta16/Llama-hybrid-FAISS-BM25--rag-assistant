The static method situation in Python is a rather direct consequence of the design decisions of first-class everything and everything is an executable statement . As others have stated, staticmethod only became available with new semantics allowed by the Python 2.2 descriptor protocol and made syntactically sweeter by function decorators in Python 2.4. There's a simple reason why static methods have gotten so little attention - they don't extend the power of the language in any way and make syntax only slightly better. Semantically they are the equivalent of plain old functions. That's why they were only implemented when the power of the language grew enough to make them implementable in terms of other language features.
