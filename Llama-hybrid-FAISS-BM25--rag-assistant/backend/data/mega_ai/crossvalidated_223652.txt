Different results with "xgboost" vs. "caret" in R

I am new to R programming language and I need to run "xgboost" for some experiments. The problem is that I need to cross-validate the model and get the accuracy and I found two ways that give me different results: With "caret" using: library(mlbench) library(caret) library(caretEnsemble) dtrain Using the "xgboost" package and the following code: library(xgboost) printArray But the results differ very much on the same dataset. I usually get 99% accuracy on student performance dataset with the second snip of code and ~63% with the first one... I set the same seed on both of them. Am I wrong with the second? Please tell me why if so!
