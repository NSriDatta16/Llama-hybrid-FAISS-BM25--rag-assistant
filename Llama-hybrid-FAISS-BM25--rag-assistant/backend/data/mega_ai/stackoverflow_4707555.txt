Yes, there are some, though I'm not sure if they're suitable for your use case: but it seems none of them are what you asked for. BioPython has a Trie implementation in C. Ah, here's a nice discussion including benchmarks: http://bugs.python.org/issue9520 Other (some very stale) implementations: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/radix py-radix is an implementation of a radix tree data structure for the storage and retrieval of IPv4 and IPv6 network prefixes. https://bitbucket.org/markon/patricia-tree/src A Python implementation of patricia-tree http://pypi.python.org/pypi/trie A prefix tree (trie) implementation. http://pypi.python.org/pypi/logilab-common/0.50.3 patricia.py : A Python implementation of PATRICIA trie (Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric).
