It is likely that derivating/integrating wrt to discrete variables may be problematic. Nevertheless, considering the continuous analogous to the discrete model for derivated the associated Jeffreys is a situation discussed by Berger in https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~berger/papers/discrete.pdf (among others). Moreover, in this paper, it is stated that the solution for your problem is $p(N)\propto 1/N$ (first paragraph of Section 1.2.1). However I found the same result as yours. Nevertheless (assuming that everything go well with the Heaviside step function), the alternative definition of Fisher information gives the expected result: $$ (\frac{d log(f)}{dN})^2=\frac{1}{N^2} $$ Then integrating: $$ I(N)=\int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{N^2} \frac{1}{N} 1(y But I do not know why (but as the switch to continuous may be a bit problematic, I would not be so surprised that some of the conditions related to the Fisher information formulation are not met)
