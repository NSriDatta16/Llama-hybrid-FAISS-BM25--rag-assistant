You could then switch to using a BitArray . You would lose all the "features" of an enum such as the default string formatting and parsing ability. A BitArray would be fundamentally similar to having a bunch of boolean fields except that the storage is much more efficient. Indeed as Jeff says in the comments with that many independent bit states it seems like an Enum is the wrong solution anyway. A BitArray may be much more suitable for your particular scenario.
