To frame that problem to be solved with reinforcement learning (RL), first define an agent. The agent will try different policies in the environment. Policies that result will higher rewards will be used more often. That problem is relative straightforward (for a RL problem) because the environment can be modeled as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a fixed set of discrete nodes. Brute force policy search could possible work.
