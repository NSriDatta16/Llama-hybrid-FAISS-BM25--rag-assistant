What is the difference between a Hidden Markov Model and a Mixture Markov Model?

From what I understand, Hidden Markov Models are those that relate observable and unobservable states, whilst Mixture Markov Models are techniques to cluster sequences according to which Markov model out of a set of them is able to approximate it better. However, I am having trouble understanding boundaries between both terms. Can I define a Hidden Markov Chain without following the Mixture approach, and conversely, can I have a Mixture Model without considering hidden states? Thanks for your help!
