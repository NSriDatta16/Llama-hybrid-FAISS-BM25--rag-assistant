Predicting Sales Over Time

I'm pretty new to including time in any sort of modeling, so forgive me if any of my questions are basic. I'm trying to predict a final sales number over a certain period of days using the incremental sales and how far out from the final date I am. Here's a sample of my data: EVENT.DATE SALES.DATE SALES.TO.DATE DAYS.OUT FINAL.QUANTITY 1 4/2/2014 3/18/2014 0 15 42 2 4/2/2014 3/19/2014 2 14 42 3 4/2/2014 3/20/2014 4 13 42 4 4/2/2014 3/21/2014 4 12 42 5 4/2/2014 3/22/2014 4 11 42 6 4/2/2014 3/23/2014 4 10 42 7 4/2/2014 3/24/2014 4 9 42 8 4/2/2014 3/25/2014 6 8 42 9 4/2/2014 3/26/2014 6 7 42 10 4/2/2014 3/27/2014 6 6 42 11 4/2/2014 3/28/2014 8 5 42 12 4/2/2014 3/29/2014 8 4 42 13 4/2/2014 3/30/2014 13 3 42 14 4/2/2014 3/31/2014 13 2 42 15 4/2/2014 4/1/2014 15 1 42 16 4/2/2014 4/2/2014 26 0 42 17 5/3/2014 4/18/2014 10 15 412 18 5/3/2014 4/19/2014 12 14 412 19 5/3/2014 4/20/2014 20 13 412 20 5/3/2014 4/21/2014 36 12 412 21 5/3/2014 4/22/2014 44 11 412 22 5/3/2014 4/23/2014 47 10 412 23 5/3/2014 4/24/2014 60 9 412 24 5/3/2014 4/25/2014 66 8 412 25 5/3/2014 4/26/2014 75 7 412 26 5/3/2014 4/27/2014 95 6 412 27 5/3/2014 4/28/2014 111 5 412 28 5/3/2014 4/29/2014 120 4 412 29 5/3/2014 4/30/2014 128 3 412 30 5/3/2014 5/1/2014 174 2 412 31 5/3/2014 5/2/2014 207 1 412 32 5/3/2014 5/3/2014 263 0 412 I'm assuming that I can't just use OLS because the 16 observations for each event date are not completely unrelated from one another. I've been looking into modeling that involves panel data, but I'm not sure if that is applicable. I've looked into time series as well, but I can't figure out if I can use that because my dates are often irregular. I'm willing to do the research myself, I'd really just like some jumping off points. If anything is unclear, please let me know.
