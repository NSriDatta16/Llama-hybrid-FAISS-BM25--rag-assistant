MCMC sampling from a convex set

Suppose that we are given the matrix, $$ A = \begin{pmatrix}6/5 & 3 & -3/10 & -4/10\\ 7/5 & -7/10 & 7/10 & 14/5\\ -6/10 & -7/10 &-1/2 & 3/10\\ 12/5 & 1 & 2 & 3/2\\ -3/5 & 4/5 & -1/2 & 12/5\\ 4/5 & 2 & -1 & -3/10\\ -1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1\\ 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$ I've been given a problem asking to sample points using a Metropolis Hastings algorithm in $\textbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^4$ from the polytope, $$ R = \{\textbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^4 : Ax \geq b\} $$ where $b = \begin{pmatrix}-1,&-1,&-1,&-1,&-1,&-1,&-1,&-1,&-1\end{pmatrix}^T \in \mathbb{R}^9$. I really have no clue how to begin here: How are we supposed to find a suitable transition function $q(\textbf{y} | \textbf{x})$ for such a complicated set? Typically we require some function that is proportional to the density of $\textbf{x}$. How can we find such a function as well? Some help would be greatly appreciated.
