One option is to make a Language Model with a corpus of many example sentences, then for each word in your dictionary compute the Perplexity of the sentence with that word in the blank spot. The ones with the lowest perplexities are the ones that are the best words to fill in the blank with. I needed to do the same thing and with a big enough corpus this works pretty well for me.
