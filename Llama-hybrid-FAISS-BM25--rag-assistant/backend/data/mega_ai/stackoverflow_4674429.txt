For this particular example, all you need is to loosen up the weight of the edges between the top 3 edges: graph g{ n1 [label="+"]; n1 -- n2 [weight=0]; n2 [label="/"]; n2 -- n3; n3 [label="*"]; n3 -- n4; n4 [label="1"]; n3 -- n5; n5 [label="2"]; n2 -- n6; n6 [label="3"]; n1 -- n7 [weight=0]; n7 [label="**"]; n7 -- n8; n8 [label="4"]; n7 -- n9; n9 [label="5"]; } Output: In more complex cases where invisible nodes and edges and setting weights gets difficult to manage, you may try Emden R. Gansner's gvpr script to layout binary trees as described in an answer to this question .
