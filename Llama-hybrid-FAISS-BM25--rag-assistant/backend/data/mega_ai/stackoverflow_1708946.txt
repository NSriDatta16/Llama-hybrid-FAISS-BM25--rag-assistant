Assuming you're using the built in .net XML serialization you should take a look at the following attribute: System.Xml.Serialization.XmlIncludeAttribute It allows you to instruct the serializer to include other types when serializing/deserializing. Adding new types to the list and not updating the serialization meta data is a common source of mistakes, make sure you have adequate test coverage.
