My experience with regression modeling, in general, involves also the exercise of judgment and in that regard, it is something of an art, especially when it comes to constructing good forecasting models. My observation is that actually parsimonious models appear to be superior, overfitting a model is not the apparent optimal best approach. My experience includes time series modeling and reading of the works of Box-Jenkins both of which expound judgment based parsimonious modeling. If one reads the original work on beta regression, “BETA REGRESSION FOR MODELLING RATES AND PROPORTIONS”, the authors suggest several link functions or the use of no link function. The idea that the odds ratio link function is the most appropriate, or the only choice, given its singularity at O and 1, with many such (or near such) points in the data, is just bad judgment in my view. I just noticed comments by Neil, "Do those statistics make sense for your data? If you have so many zeros and ones, then it seems doubtful that they do.." which appears to echo my point.
