Contradiction between Pearson's correlation coefficient and t-test results

I've been analysing data between cliff height and average erosion rate. The data is parametric so I used Pearson's correlation and found that I got a coefficient of 0.017. When I applied a 2-tailed t-test to the data I found that I had a t value of 28.22 with 128 degrees of freedom. The t-test is saying the data is significant when the correlation result is saying it is not Any ideas?
