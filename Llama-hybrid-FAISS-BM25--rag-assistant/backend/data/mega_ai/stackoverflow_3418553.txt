Based on this post i'd say it can't be done. Excerpt: you can't define the level of nearness, nor can you specify separation distance by word, sentence, paragraph, page, chapter or book the way you can in other Microsoft Search products. This was supposed to ship in SQL 2008 but was cut. After 50 words of separation distance the contribution to rank is 0 but they will still show up in searches.
