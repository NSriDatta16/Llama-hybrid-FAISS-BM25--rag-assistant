magento rewrite not working

I created a module that used a custom widget/grid/column for my admin grid to display a thumbnail image and everything worked. Now I need to create another module in the same project that does the same thing, but the image column will not work. It appears like its not even loading my new class, since it won't execute any stmt I put into the file. I know its properly loading data, b/c if I change the type to text, then the correct info from the DB is populated into the field. But when I change to my new 'image' type the cell is empty. does anyone know why it wouldn't be working? ABT/Background/etc/config.xml .... ABT_Background_Block ABT_Background_Block_Widget_Grid_Column .... the module I copied to get me up and running has the exact same config setup, but yet it works fine ABT/Feature/etc/config.xml .... ABT_Feature_Block ABT_Feature_Block_Widget_Grid_Column ....
