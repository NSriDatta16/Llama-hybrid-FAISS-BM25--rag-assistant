Conditions for weak stationarity of AR(1)

I don't know if it is my lack of understanding, or it is a misconception in time series analysis. Here is a definition of an AR(1) process $\{X_t\}_{t \in T}$ : $X_t = \omega + \psi X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ where $\omega, \psi$ are constants. $\{e_t\}_{t \in T}$ is a white noise process $WN(0, \sigma^2)$ , and $cov(e_t, X_s)= 0$ $(\forall t > s)$ I saw many people wrote that AR(1) is (weakly) stationary if and only if $|\psi| . It does not seem to be right for me at all. It should be necessary to state the distribution of $X_t$ at a specific time t as anchor, or at least the first and second moments of $X_t$ . Without that, I do not think we have enough information to conclude that $\{X_t\}_{t \in T}$ is stationary. Here is what I have in my mind: An AR(1) process $\{X_t\}_{t \in T}$ is defined as follows: $X_t = \omega + \psi X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ where $\omega, \psi$ are constants. $\{e_t\}_{t \in T}$ is a white noise process $WN(0, \sigma^2)$ , and $cov(e_t, X_s)= 0$ $(\forall t > s)$ . $\{X_t\}_{t \in T}$ is said to be (weakly) stationary if and only if: $|\psi| $\mathbb{E}[X_t] = \frac{\omega}{1 - \psi}$ $\mathbb{V}[X_t] = \frac{\sigma^2}{1 - \psi^2}$ $cov[X_t, X_{t+h}] = \psi^{|h|}\mathbb{V}[X_t]$ Conditions 2 and 3 already imply 1. My first question : Am I correct? My second question : Regarding other definitions of AR(1) process, is it always true that they all assume $cov(e_t, X_s)= 0$ $(\forall t > s)$ ?
