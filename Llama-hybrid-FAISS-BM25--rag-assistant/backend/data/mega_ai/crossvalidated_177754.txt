Elasticity and Forecasting for Cyclical Data

I'm looking at a set of time series data. Because the data is a time series data, there's also seasonality within it. I believe this is impacting my elasticity (showing at unit elasticity @ 1.08). Would it make sense to use this elasticity, calculate the % change in disconnects (I have historicals and forecasts), previous spend $, and the elasticity to project the forecasted spend? Is this a way to optimize? Thanks!
