en OpenAI and the IndiaAI Mission to establish OpenAI Academy, which would provide AI education training materials in Hindi, English, and four regional languages for students, developers, educators, civil servants, nonprofit leaders, and small business owners. It will integrate with IndiaAI FutureSkills Initiative and iGOT Karmayogi platform. One million teachers will receive training on how to use GenAI in the classroom. Additionally, 50 startups or fellows recognized by the IndiaAI Mission will get API credits from OpenAI worth up to $100,000. OpenAI has extended its AI for Impact Accelerator program by giving 11 NGOs a total of $150,000 in technical funding to develop AI solutions for underserved industries like healthcare, education, and agriculture. Finance and insurance In India's banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) industries, AI is already in use as of 2024 and the use of AI by BFSI companies is growing. Banks in India are using it for predictive analytics, fraud detection, and personalisation services. In capital markets, AI is being used for high-frequency trading and quantitative analysis. AI is being used by insurance companies for underwriting, fraud detection and damage assessment. However, with the growth of AI usage in the BFSI sector, the Indian government has also stated that AI, including deepfakes and prompt hacking of large language models, is being used for cyberattacks on BFSI companies. AI companies of India The following is a list of notable AI companies of India, along with their corporate headquarters location. Safety and regulation In order to determine whether to create an AI Safety Institute (AISI) that can establish standards, frameworks, and guidelines for AI development without serving as a regulatory body or stifling innovation, MeitY conducted consultation process with Meta Platforms, Google, Microsoft, IBM, OpenAI, NASSCOM, Broadband India Forum, Software Alliance, Indian Institutes of Technology, The Quantum Hub, Digital Empowerment Foundation, and Access Now on 7 October 2024. It was decided that instead of focusing on regulation, the AISI would focus on damage detection, risk identification, and standards setting for which interoperable systems are necessary to prevent the development of silos which may eventually influence future policies. The Safe and Trusted Pillar of the IndiaAI Mission has been allocated â‚¹20 crore, which the AISI may use for the inaugural budget. More money from the IndiaAI Mission's other verticals may be used in the future. In order to develop an AI policy report tailored to India and assess the country's AI ecosystem's strengths and future prospects, UNESCO and MeitY began consulting on AI Readiness Assessment Methodology under Safety and Ethics in Artificial Intelligence from 2024. It is to encourage the ethical and responsible use of AI in industries. The study will help find areas where government can become involved, especially in attempts to strengthen institutional and regulatory capabilities. Minister for Electronics & Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the creation of an IndiaAI Safety Institute on 30 January 2025, to ensure the ethical and safe application of AI models. The institute will promote domestic research and development that is grounded in India's social, economic, cultural, and linguistic diversity and is based on Indian datasets. With the help of academic and research institutions, as well as private sector partners, the institute will follow the hub-and-spoke approach to carry out projects within Safe and Trusted Pillar of the IndiaAI Mission. Among the major safety-related initiatives are eight ongoing projects to implement a techno-legal strategy to protect data privacy while conducting an ethical audit of algorithmic effectiveness. First round of projects are as follows: Themes for second round of projects include watermarking and labelling, ethical AI frameworks, AI risk-assessment and management, stress testin
