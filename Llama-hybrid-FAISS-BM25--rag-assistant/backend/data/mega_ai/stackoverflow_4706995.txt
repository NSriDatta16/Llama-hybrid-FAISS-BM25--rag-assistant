Web Application - Authentication / Login Framework

This is a very simple, probably a most asked question and frequently developed as part of any web application. Say I'm planning to build a web application and some of the functional requirements include (apart from the usual hard hitting security reqs), - Need to have users sign up for a new account profile - Authenticate user using the native app authentication / Facebook or Google or Yahoo or OpenId login - Allow lost password retrieval - Session handling needs Is there an out of the box frameworks (Drupal, Liferay, Tapestry with Tynamo, Wicket ??) that I can use to wrap my application which can be a bunch of JSP's or HTML's with JS? I know I'm asking a very simple and maybe a naive question. But this is a topic every web developer guru will go thru. Any help, advise and pointers much appreciated.
