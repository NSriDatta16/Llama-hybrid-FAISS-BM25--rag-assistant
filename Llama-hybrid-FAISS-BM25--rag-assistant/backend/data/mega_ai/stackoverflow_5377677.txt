Raphael element selection problem

Hopefully this is a simple question for any Raphael experts! I've created a route map where users can click on each country to see the details. It works fine except that passing the mouse over the red line triggers the mouseout event. I need the red line to effectively be just an image on the map and not an interactive element. How do I achieve this? See the map in action: http://www.martyn-roberts.co.uk/cycleafrica/route Thanks!
