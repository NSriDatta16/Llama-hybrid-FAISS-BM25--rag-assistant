row.getString() does not allow any specification of the encoding - so the OS code should be doing the right thing when retrieving a string from the database. My experience with SQLite on BlackBerry is that OS builds around 5.0.0.4xx have a bug where the database encoding is not respected on retrieval. I've had to work around this by doing new String(row.getString().getBytes(), "UTF-8") But of course, only on the problematic OS versions, as this would break any correct implementation of row.getString(). The versions with this issue that I've encountered so far are: 5.0.0.442 and 5.0.0.423
