You can make this automatic in Visual Studio so that the user of your DLL can't forget this. The typical DLL header file could look like this: #undef MYEXPORTS #ifdef BUILDING_MYDLL # define MYEXPORTS __declspec(dllexport) #else # define MYEXPORTS __declspec(dllimport) # pragma comment(lib, "mydll.lib") #endif MYEXPORTS void SomeFunction(); // etc.. The #pragma directive injects a linker option into the .obj file that ensures the linker always looks for the .lib when a client program #includes the header file. This is the same mechanism by which it always looks for the correct version of the CRT .lib file even though you never explicitly mention it on the Additional Dependencies setting. This is otherwise non-standard, but using DLLs is non-standard anyway.
