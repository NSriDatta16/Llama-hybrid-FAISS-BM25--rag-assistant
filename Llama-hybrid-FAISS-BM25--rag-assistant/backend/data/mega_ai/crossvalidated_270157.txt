Tutorial recommendations for understanding GANs

I understand that generative adversarial networks (GANs) can synthetically reconstruct the input using a generator and a discriminator in a zero-sum game. However, I feel that I do not fully understand the mathematics or usefulness of GANs. Are there any good tutorials or explanations on understanding GANs? I have found few videos to help.
