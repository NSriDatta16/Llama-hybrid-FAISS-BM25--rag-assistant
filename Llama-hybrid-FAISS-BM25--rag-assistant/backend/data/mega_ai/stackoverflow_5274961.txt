WPF Dashboard best practices?

I am building a dashboard where a user can add panels and also resize and move the individually. Then end result might look something like this: Basically I want it to be like Blacklight's " drag drop panel " but with resizable panels. What is the best practice to use if I don't want to use a dock manager control? I thought about using a collection of user controls made of stackpanels, or some sort of grid, but I am afraid I'm over-thinking it.
