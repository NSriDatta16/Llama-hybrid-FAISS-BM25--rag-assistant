If NServiceBus is properly using MsmqSubscriptionStorage, then after iisreset, the bus should initialize and load the existing subscriptions from the configured storage queue. This queue name can either be set by configuration or, if omitted, should default to a name based on an assembly plus "_storage". However, having never used this from a web application, I don't know what that would be in that scenario, since there is no class that implements IConfigureThisEndpoint. That said, trying to publish an event from a web application is a very icky business, and it's generally advised that you avoid just that .
