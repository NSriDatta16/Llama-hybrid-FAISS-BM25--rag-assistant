If this is on google app engine as the tags indicate, make sure you are using this idiom def main(): #do stuff if __name__ == '__main__': main() Because GAE doesn't restart your app every request unless the .py has changed, it just runs main() again. This trick lets you write CGI style apps without the startup performance hit AppCaching If a handler script provides a main() routine, the runtime environment also caches the script. Otherwise, the handler script is loaded for every request.
