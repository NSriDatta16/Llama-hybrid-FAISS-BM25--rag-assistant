I guess it will depend on how you define Simpson's paradox. I suppose the essence of the paradox is that it occurs when the result of looking at a data set broken into groups gives the opposite impression of looking at the data set as a whole. The electoral college case given in the question is somewhat similar to the batting average example on Wikipedia , but I don't think your example follows the paradox as I roughly sketched it out above. You could probably come up with a scenario that is more Simpson's-like. Perhaps if it were the case that one candidate loses the popular vote in each state, but still wins the popular vote in aggregate (similar to batting average example). Or one in which one candidate loses the electoral college in a majority of states, but still wins the overall college (which probably happens in reality on occasion †). † I thought this might be a common occurrence in U.S. presidential elections, with perhaps the Democrat winning fewer, but more populous, states. Working backward, the first occurrence I found was 1976, with Carter winning only 23 states + DC, (out of 50 +DC), but winning 297 electoral votes (out of 537) [usually 538].
