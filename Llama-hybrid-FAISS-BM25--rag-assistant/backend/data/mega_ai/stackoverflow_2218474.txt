Magento - Add CMS Block to One Page

I have this code in a xml layout file: aw_blog/menu.phtml I want to add a cms static block to the blog pages using this code: brand_list If I add it in directly after this line: It works but it is then displayed on every page. How can I get it to show only on the blog pages? Thanks. Edit: Here is the entire xml file: aw_blog/menu.phtml aw_blog/menu.phtml skin_css aw_blog/css/style.css
