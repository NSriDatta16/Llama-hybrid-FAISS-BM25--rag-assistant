If you can update the state key by key then any of the DBM databases will work. If you need really high performance and compact storage then Tokyo Cabinet - http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/ is the cool toy. If you want to save and load the whole thing at once (to maybe keep old versions or some such) and don't have too much data then just use JSON. It's much nicer to work with than XML. I don't know how the JSON implementation is in Python, but in Perl the JSON::XS module is insanely fast.
