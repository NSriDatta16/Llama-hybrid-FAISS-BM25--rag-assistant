what is the usage of the following function?

Take a look to this function please function CheckHost() { $url = parse_url($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']); $host = $url['host']; if($host == $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']) return true; return false; } i saw it somewhere, but can't understand it's usage. is it for security reasons, or what?(as i see, it just verify is the last request from the same server as the script) Thanks for attention
