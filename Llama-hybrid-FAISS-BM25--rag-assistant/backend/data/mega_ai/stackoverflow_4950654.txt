PHP + PDF Line Break

I have the below code in my Magento store it adds the customers address to the invoice PDF's. Sometimes the lines of the address would be too long for the address labels so I added the $value = wordwrap($text, 10, " \n"); line thinking this could create a new line. However, this doesn't seem to work in PDF docs and i just end up with a funny symbol where I'd like the line to be. does anyone know how I can get a new line? P.S - My PHP knowledge is very basic. if (!$order->getIsVirtual()) { if ($this->y newPage(); } $this->_setFontRegular($page, 6); $page->drawText('Ship to:', 75, 222 , 'UTF-8'); $shippingAddress = $this->_formatAddress($order->getShippingAddress()->format('pdf')); $line = 185; $this->_setFontRegular($page, 12); $num_lines = count($shippingAddress); $curr_line = 0; foreach ($shippingAddress as $value) { $curr_line += 1; if ($curr_line drawText(strip_tags(ltrim($value)), 75, $line, 'UTF-8'); $line -=14; } } } }
