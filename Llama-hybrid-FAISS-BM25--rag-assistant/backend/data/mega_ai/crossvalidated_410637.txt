ISLR - linear regression, error of coefficients and resample method

ISLR is the famous book "Introduction to Statistical Learning - with applications in R", used for many people that are studying data science as me. Reading the 3rd chapter of ISLR, I have a question about error of coefficients. If I have some training data, if I assume there is a linear model, then the error of the slope and intercept are easily given from the formulas in chapter 3. So, for example I do an experiment in physics, 100 data ----> b0 + b1 (with errors!) are the best estimating of the real b0 and b1. But, is it a good model? Why do we use resample method if we have already these errors? Maybe resample method gives me a more accurate model? (errors of coefficient lower or not?). Do we use resample only for prediction and not inference? Or, to better find a more accurate linear model in the experiment above, should I use CV with k = 10 and not consider errors explained in the chapter 3? So for example 10 observations for testing, 90 for training, fit, get b0 and b1, and then repeat for ten times and then do an average for the 10 b0 and 10 b1 found for every test set?
