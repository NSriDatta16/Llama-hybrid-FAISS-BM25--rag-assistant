Looks like they are aware and working on it. Quoted from http://wpf.codeplex.com/wiki/comments/view?title=Home I spoke to the Office Licensing team about this and this is what they had to say: "Yes, unfortunately our web site hosting group has reorganized some of the sites and pages on the backend and unfortunately our ribbon UI licensing pages got disconnected. They are working to remedy the situation and we hope to have the pages back up very soon." I will post back here as soon as I hear that the page is back up. I apologize for the delay. yesterday by SamanthaMSFT
