Show custom options in Magento products list

I have a bunch of simple products listed on the homepage and I want to display the custom options for each one of them. The custom options are added by me from the admin and they show on the individual product page but I just can't display them on the listing page. I tried this but it didn't work for me. I'm using Magento 1.4.1.1. Thanks
