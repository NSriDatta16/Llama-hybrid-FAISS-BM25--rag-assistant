How to interpret mixed effects logistic regression of 2 categorical predictors?

if A is the Group reference level & Noun is the Class reference level, is this summary telling us GroupC is significantly different from GroupA at only the level of nouns (intercept)? Or is it an overall sig difference considering all levels of the second categorical predictor?
