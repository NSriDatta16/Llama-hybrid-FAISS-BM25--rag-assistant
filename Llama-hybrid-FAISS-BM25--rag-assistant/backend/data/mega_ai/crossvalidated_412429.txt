How to plot paired data that has small deviations?

I am showing that applying a certain method leads to improved performance on a machine learning problem, and that this effect is consistent across different datasets (in this case, datasets collected across different days). However the effect is small (on the scale of 0.01), and when plotted out, is dwarfed by the large variation across the different datasets. Are there any alternative plots/visualization methods I can use to demonstrate my effect? This seems to be a common problem when the effect is smaller than the variation between subjects/days.
