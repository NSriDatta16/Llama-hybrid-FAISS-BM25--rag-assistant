Cross-platform, cross-language messaging system?

I'm developing a set of applications that work together to create a system for processing metering data. There's several reasons I want to have them loosely coupled and the system should be extensible by third parties, so the apps will be tied together via messaging. I'm looking for a messaging system that offers bindings in (at least) C#, Java and Python and supports messaging patterns like Publish-Subscribe, Guaranteed Delivery, Selective Consumer (like Peek in .Net Messaging). As far as I could find out, there's nothing wrong with JMS or .Net Messaging, it's just that they are for .Net / Java only. The system should give me control over which transport mechanism (Sockets, Message Queues, etc.) to use when setting up a channel. I want to be able to both scale out to remote machines and speed things up with local transport facilities. If I can't find anything suitable, I'll have to roll my own. I'd probably use Google's protocol buffers for serialization. If anybody has other recommendations for technology options, fire away. Oh, yes - and I would like to have optional encryption on a per-channel or per-message basis. ETA: Thanks for all the quick replies. I'm working my way through the docs & propaganda now. Has anybody used the technologies below, and for what / with what results?
