How to Use Different META-INF/context.xml Files For Development and Production Environments

In Tomcat (and some other servlet containers) I can store information about my JDBC DataSource in META-INF/context.xml . This is very useful. However, the settings for my JDBC DataSource can be different in my development and production environments. I'd like to know how other people deal with these differences in an elegant way, specifically how can I set up a context.xml for my development environment and one for my production environment in the most hassle-free manner.
