Your lack of understanding pointers is obviously weak... you are using a double pointer variable, in which it is passed by reference, so you used a double de-reference which is incorrect - that should be a single de-reference, as the other asterisk indicates an address-of that variable... If this is what's tripping you up, why not do it this way, read into a separate variable and stuff the variable into the by-reference parameter of array instead to make it easier to avoid the complexity and confusing the issue with pointers See below ... error checking is omitted.... void readfile(FILE* fp,int** storage_array,int lines) { int i=0; for(i=0; i
