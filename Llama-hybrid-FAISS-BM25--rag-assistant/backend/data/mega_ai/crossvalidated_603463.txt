This is a chunk test . It can be accomplished by testing nested logistic regressions (or whatever models you use, maybe probit). Your "null" model is the model that has both categories but no interaction. Then your "full" model includes those terms but also the interactions terms. The "chunk test" then tests if all of the coefficients on the interaction terms are zero. I would do this with a likelihood ratio test, and there is fairly simple R code for doing it. library(lmtest) set.seed(2023) N This example has no relationship between y and the categorical features, so the p-values are high, but this would work for your case where you do expect some relationship between y and the features. I have heard this approach called a "partial F-test" when it has been applied to traditional nested linear models.
