How do distribution functions (e.g. Gaussian, Bernoulli, Poisson, etc.) relate to deep learning?

I know that neural nets use activation functions, but where do distribution functions play into deep neural networks? For example, the h2o.deeplearning() function in R has the variable distribution = c("AUTO", "gaussian", "bernoulli", "multinomial", "poisson", "gamma", "tweedie", "laplace", "huber", "quantile") . Where does this apply in deep learning? Also, I came across this quote from an h2o tutorial that says "H2O Deep Learning supports regression for distributions other than Gaussian such as Poisson, Gamma, Tweedie, Laplace", but again I am confused as to where a distribution function plays into the concept of multilayer perceptrons.
