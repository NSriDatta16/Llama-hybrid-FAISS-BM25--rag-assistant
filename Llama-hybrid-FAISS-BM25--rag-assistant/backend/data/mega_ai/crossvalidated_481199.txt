How to intuitively visualize measure theory concepts via diagrams?

Visualizing Measure Theory via Diagrams / Drawings / Geometry Hi, I'm starting to learn about Measure Theory in order to study more advanced topics in Data Science. However, the explanations are always very Mathsy and have little to no geometrical intuition or understanding. When I say geometrical, I mean diagrams, images, drawings that help you visualize Measure Theoretic concepts in an intuitive way. EDIT : I'm happy with diagrams that represent finite measure theoretic concepts! The concepts that I'm trying to visualize are: Sample Space Event Space Probability Measure Probability Space Random Variable Probability Distribution Probability Density Function Markov Transition Kernel Any help? I can give an example for the sample space and the event space: Sample Space Suppose I have a sample space $\Omega = \{\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3\}$ then I can visualize it as follows: Event Space Similarly, the event space is a Sigma algebra, which means it is non-empty, closed under complementation and closed under countable unions.
