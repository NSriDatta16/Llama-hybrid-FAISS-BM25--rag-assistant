Welcome to CV! There are several options you could use. One relatively simple way in your situation would be ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) in which you would predict the final temp/pH from the concentration level having the initial temp/pH as the covariate. This way, you would get the predictions for change for different levels of concentration. I'd probably just run separate analyses for pH and temperature. It's perhaps more elegant to analyze them simultaneously (e.g. with a multilevel model or a structural equation model), but with only two dependents, I don't think it's necessary. I use pH as the example dependent below, you would then do the same things with temperature. For ANCOVA, for example in R, you'd organize your data like this (sample= sample identifier, conc=concentration, prepH=initial pH, postpH=final pH) sample conc prepH postpH 1 2 0.5892052 0.3658990 2 4 -0.1070532 -2.3020591 3 6 1.0498823 0.7784372 4 8 0.1777278 -0.2202755 5 10 -1.3852736 0.5106044 6 2 0.2505689 1.3162620 7 4 0.3392950 0.2606596 8 6 -0.4703248 -0.2850500 9 8 -0.8250730 0.6677811 10 10 0.3909296 -0.6779350 ...etc. Then, you can run the ANCOVA modelPH Then, you can use emmeans package to find out whether pH change differs for different levels of concentration. Because you have a linear hypothesis (i.e. higher concentration = higher change), you could specify linear or consecutive contrasts: #For linear contrasts, you first need to extract the emmeans grid for your predictor: library(emmeans) #loads the emmeans package gridph Another way would be to use "consec" contrast. This will tell you whether the consecutive concentration groups differ from each other (i.e. whether 2% differs from 4%, whether 4% differs from 6% etc.): phconsec If you want all pairwise comparisons (2% vs. 4%, 2% vs 6%, 2%vs 8% etc), use emall If you have SPSS, you can do all this by using the menus, you just need to click around a little. EDIT: To do ANCOVA in SPSS, use Analyze...General Linear Model...Univariate. Then, put the final pH to the dependent variable box, concentration to the Fixed Factor(s) box, and initial pH to the Covariate(s) box. Then you need to decide what do you want to know about the effects of concentration: do you want to know whether change (initial --> final) increases linearly when concentration level increases? Or do you want to know whether change differs between each "concentration pair" (i.e. whether change for the 2% samples differs from change within the 4% samples, whether change for the 2% samples differs from change within 6% samples etc...), or something else. This is something you would do using the EM Means menu or the contrast menu (contrast menu if you want to test the linear increase, em means menu if you want something else). Again, I recommend you run separate analyses for pH and temp. Don't do MANOVA, it's almost never a good idea.
