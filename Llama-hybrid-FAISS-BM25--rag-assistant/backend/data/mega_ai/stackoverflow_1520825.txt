Vertical-align image

I have a div that contains an image and a p tag (seen below). I want to align the image in the middle of the div vertically depending on how many lines the paragraph is. Vertical-align doesn't work. I am using JavaScript right now to figure out how much to add to margin-top, but would rather use CSS. Any ideas? Multi-line
