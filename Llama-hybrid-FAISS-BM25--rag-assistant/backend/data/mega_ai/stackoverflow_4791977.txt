( The following answers the original version of the question. ) Do you realize that the two code snippets are NOT semantically equivalent??? Consider what happens if a is "earth". The first snippet calls foo() and then bar() . The second snippet calls foo() and skips the bar() call. And this explains why the generated machine code is different. It has to be to implement the different semantics of the respective code fragments! Personally, I feel that else is redundant ... Unfortunately, your feeling is incorrect. Lesson - write your code simply and clearly and leave optimization to the compiler ... which is going to do a far more accurate job than you can achieve. FOLLOWUP The snippets in the updated version of the question are now semantically identical, and the else is redundant. However: any half decent optimizing compiler will generate identical code for the two snippets, and it is a matter of opinion (i.e. subjective) which of the snippets is easier to understand.
