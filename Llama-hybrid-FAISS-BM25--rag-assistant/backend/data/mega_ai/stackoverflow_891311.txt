If you organize your code into some core modules and some phone-specific modules which depend on the core modules then it doesn't really matter which VCS you use. I would recommend a decentralized VCS anyway (Mercurial, Bazaar, Git). You could consider describing how do you want to achieve what you want (different app versions with different feature sets) to get a more reasonable advice
