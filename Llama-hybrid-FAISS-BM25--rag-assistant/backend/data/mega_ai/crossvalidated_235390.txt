The function MuMIn::dredge simply returns a list of models with every possible combination of predictor variable. As for your results, allow me to disagree with what you said: I understand that model 2 is the best model and shows lND to have a negative effect on diversity. that's partially right, 1ND indeed has a negative effect on diversity, but from the delta (=delta AIC) you cannot distinguish model 2 from 3, 1, and 5 since (using the common thumb rule) they have dAIC No value means no effect. That's not correct. dredge returns a list with every possible combination of variables, if a variable doesn't have a value, it means it was not included in the model. For example, model 3 only has 1NN, besides intercept obviously. AIC values show that these model are not very informative. Is this interpretation correct or am I missing something? Since the first four models have similar support (notice also that their Akaike weight, wich varies from 0 to 1, are not relatively high) I strongly suggest that you use model averaging, take a look at MuMIn::model.avg and also read Chapter 4 of Burnham & Anderson (2002) . I hope this are clearly enough, but feel free to ask again
