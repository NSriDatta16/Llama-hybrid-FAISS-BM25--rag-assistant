Magento - Have different set of fields and labels for cart and checkout (order review) screens

In the Magento default theme's cart page we see the following totals box towards the right mid of the screen: My Problem is to show the Tax and Grand Total Including tax fields to appear in the cart, because the tax is calculated once we know the shipping address. So, we want to show it only in the Checkout Screen under Order Review . However, when overriding the template/ file mentioned above, also modifies the Order Review field in checkout , so that it looks like this: and onepage checkout order review screen like which means that these fields are being controlled from one set of file(s). However, I want these two (totals box in cart AND order review in checkout) to be different. By turning on the template path hints I know that the child templates for each of subtotal, tax, total... are being called from: Cart: /checkout/cart.phtml Checkout (One page): /checkout/onepage/review/info.phtml Both of these have this common line, which I believe does the trick $this->getChildHtml('totals') Can someone help me in knowing how does getChildHtml looks up the 'totals' file. I am confused because there is a totals.phtml in checkout/onepage/review folder, while both of them are actually using template files in /tax/checkout I am using Magento 1.4.1.1 and background to this question is a previous question
