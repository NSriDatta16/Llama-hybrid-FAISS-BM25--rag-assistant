Most likely the jar file you got is actually the generated java beans (jaxb) and stubs (jax ws and the likes). So you should be able to figure our an entry point class there and use that to call the webservice. But as others suggested very little information to really give an answer. JaxWS docs are here http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnayl.html
