How to address sessions in mixed-liner model?

I am performing a mixed-linear model and I am unsure how to address my sessions in this model. The main question in my research is finding if psychological factors can predict neurofeedback success. I have 40 subjects that undergo 6 sessions of Neurofeedback training. My data: I have the average neurofeedback success for each subject, for each session. Also for each subject and session, I have the correlation between their brain activity and the feedback they received in the session (this variable represents in a way the "group"- if they were in the test group the correlation value is high, and in the control group it's low). I have for each subject 4 psychological factors that were collected before they started neurofeedback training. Therefore I have one value for each subject (for all sessions!) that represents the psychological factors. I tried a couple of models: The first one was a three-way interaction: model1 The dependent variable is neurofeedback success (NF_Success). I put factors (F1_ANH, F2_MOT, F3_PUN, F4_MUS), the correlation between their brain activity and the feedback (corr), and session (SESS) as a fixed effect, while the subjects (SUB) are random. However, I'm not sure if a three-way interaction is reasonable to use. The second model I tried: model In this model, I put the session as a random effect and not an interaction. I'm not sure what is the right way to address it and would appreciate any insights about which model to use. An extra question: In the results, I get for the first model only a significant main effect for F1_ANH, while in the second model, I get a significant main effect for F1_ANH and a significant interaction F1_ANH:corr. I would love your help also in interpreting these results in the manner of understanding the model- why when the session is random the interaction between F1_ANH:corr turn out to be significant? I'm adding an example of how my dataset looks, if it helps: | SUB | SESS | NF_Sucess | corr | F1_ANH | F2_MOT | F3_PUN | F4_MUS | | --- | --- | ------- |-------|---| ---| ---| ---| ---| | 1| 1 | 0.119590154| 0.868314423 | 0.5102 | 0.64539 |0.28982 |-0.40175 | 1| 2 | 0.224365201| 0.856238894 | 0.5102 | 0.64539|0.28982|-0.40175 | 1| 3 | 0.388824392|0.75901501|0.5102|0.64539|0.28982|-0.40175 | 1| 4 | 0.073829 |0.8258684|0.5102|0.64539|0.28982|-0.40175 | 1| 5 | 0.341638878|0.802587415|0.5102|0.64539|0.28982|-0.40175 | 1| 6 |1.020422691|0.828045639|0.5102|0.64539|0.28982|-0.40175 | 2| 1 |0.007833176|0.063571708|-2.8383|1.02389|0.50746|1.55911 | 2| 2 |0.409888286|-0.043458464|-2.8383|1.02389|0.50746|1.55911 data
