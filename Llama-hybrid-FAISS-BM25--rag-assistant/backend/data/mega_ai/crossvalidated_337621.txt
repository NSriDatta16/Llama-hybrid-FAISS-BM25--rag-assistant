Where Should We Extract Feature Vector from Neural Network

Suppose we have a NN whose last several layers are: ... previous hidden layers ... -> conv layer -> BN layer -> ReLu layer -> dropout -> FC classifier Originally the FC layer is used as classifier. If we want to apply some other classifiers instead, such as SVM, Joint Bayesian, or whatever, which takes the feature vector from last hidden layer as input. In such a case, where is the feature vector supposed to be taken from? after conv layer, because we do not want the feature vector to be normalized after BN layer, it is better to have the feature vector normalized, but we do not relu it so the negatives are kept as is after ReLu layer, since it generally comes with conv layer after dropout layer, since we are only replacing the classifier, and here is the input to classifier I personally consider 4. makes more sense, since we are only replacing the classifier. However, neither am I certain about the answer nor can I state why other 3 options are not preferred (or incorrect). Could anyone please help explain how we could make the choice?
