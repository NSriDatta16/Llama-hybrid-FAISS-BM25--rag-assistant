You do not need to make assumptions about the distribution of covariates in order perform regression, but you do need to make assumptions about the distribution of covariates in order to simulate results of regression modeling. The latter is the point of performing a power analysis: to make a minimum number of reasonable assumptions to illustrate the feasibility of an analysis. It is more apparent when you calculate power using simulation, which is effectively the same thing as using MCMC integration to calculate quantiles of non-central distributions according to critical values for null hypothesis significance testing. In general, the greater the variability of the covariates, the more power you have. That is why a stratified sample can improve power. A random sample of 100 people 65 and over will be result in very precise estimate of trends in people close to age 65 because of the distribution of age. Older ages will be undersampled giving these people highly influential values, possibly skewing analyses. On the other hand, If you sample 10 people in each 5 year age segment from 65 to 110, the estimates are equally precise in each age stratum, the distribution of age is considerably more variable, and the overall analysis is more efficient. A power analysis should reflect the advantage of design strategies even if the same type of model is ultimately applied. Even in descriptive studies, design can significantly reduce margin-of-error. The most famous example of Gallup poll blowing national estimates out of the water with a mere 3,000 carefully picked people remains the most pertinent example. Read more here .
