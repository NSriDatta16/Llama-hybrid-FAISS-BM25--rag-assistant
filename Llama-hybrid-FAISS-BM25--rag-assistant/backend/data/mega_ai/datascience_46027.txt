Kmean clustering on text data

I have a large raw dataset on crime and I want to cluster the data using k-means, However, I get an Error when I enter this code: Rawdata.3means Error: Error in kmeans(Rawdata, centers = 3) : more cluster centers than distinct data points. In addition: Warning message: In storage.mode(x) How can I resolve this error?
