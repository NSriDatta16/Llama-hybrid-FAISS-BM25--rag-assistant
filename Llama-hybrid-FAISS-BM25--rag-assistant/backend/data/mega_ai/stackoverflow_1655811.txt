Is there a way to improve this pointcut?

I have come up with the following pointcut that I use for tracing method entry/exit. It's not broken and also does what I want but: 1- I find it looks clumsy or could be more elegant; and 2- I don't know if it is bulletproof. // tracing the execution of all methods except: // - toString and descendants // - methods identified with @NotTraced and descendants pointcut theMethod() : within(*.*) && !within(tracing.*) && execution(* *(..)) && !adviceexecution() && !cflow(adviceexecution()) && !execution( String *.toString() ) && !cflow(execution( String *.toString() )) && !execution( @NotTraced * *(..) ) && !cflow(execution( @NotTraced * *(..) )); Any thoughts?
