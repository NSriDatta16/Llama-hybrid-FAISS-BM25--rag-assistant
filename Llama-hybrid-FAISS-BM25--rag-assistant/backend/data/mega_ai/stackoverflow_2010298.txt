Perhaps you can make things a bit easier. I just replicated the desired effect by setting my paragraph rules to: p.highlight { position:relative; background-color:#ffffff; z-index:10; } And my overlay to: div.overlay { position:fixed; background-color:#000000; z-index:5; // lower than my paragraph, higher than all else top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; } -- I'm a paragraph. I too am a paragraph.
