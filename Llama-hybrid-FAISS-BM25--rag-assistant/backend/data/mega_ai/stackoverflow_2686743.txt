Make sure to have an Clustered Index on those columns. and partition your table on these date columns an place the datafiles on different disk drives I Believe keeping your index fragmentation low is your best shot. I also Believe having a physical view with the desired select is not a good idea, because it adds Insert/Update overhead. on average there's 3,5 insert's per minute. or about 17 seconds between each insert (on average please correct me if I'm wrong) The question is are you selecting more often than every 17 seconds? That's the key thought. Hope it helped.
