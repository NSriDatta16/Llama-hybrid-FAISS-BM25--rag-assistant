Your question has to do with how the flows of floats work... If two images are floated and the sum of their widths is wider than the containing element, they will wrap (similar to the way words in a paragraph wrap). Visual references describing the flow of "float"ed elements (way too difficult to describe in a few words): http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/introduction.htm
