Syntax of the bmrs package, specifically the model structure ...+(1 | V1 | V2). Complementing the R's lmer cheat sheet

Much discussion has been made about the syntax of different mixed models with the lmer package. This link describes a great summary on the subject. But I didn't find anything talking specifically about the following structure: ... + (1 | group 1 | group 2) or following the language addressed by Barr et al. (2013) mentioned by @Livius , following structure: ... + (1 | Subject | Item) Could you explain what a model with this structure means? Thank you for your attention.
