.net app looks in the /bin of the project, and the GAC (Global Assembly Cache) where you put system shared DLL-s. If your app is one .net app (configured in IIS as one app), but you have aspx files in subfolders, they should see the root /bin folder. i'd stick with keeping dlls in /bin, if that isn't several tenths of bins (which would mean that you have a problem with your app organization).
