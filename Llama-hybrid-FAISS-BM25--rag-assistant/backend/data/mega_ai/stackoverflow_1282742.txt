Planning and development steps for first program

I am in the preparation stages of writing my first real program. I've designed a set of tables to store my financial data. I know 1) what data goes where in the tables 2) what relationships exist between tables and fields 3) what queries are needed 4) what the forms should look like to write data to the tables 5) what output I need and how it should be organized I've decided on C#, with WPF for the GUI, and a SQL database for the data. If I understand correctly I'll be needing ADO.NET to interface with the SQL db. The problem for me is that right now I am only familiar with writing non-GUI C++ using text files (or the keyboard) for input. I'm not desiring to become a programmer with varied and marketable skills, so I'd rather avoid spending time learning things that won't apply to this project. I'm looking for the most direct route from here to a useful working (and maintainable) program. So that's the situation I need help with. Please let me know if I left out anything relevant. My question is, what are the steps I need to take from here to get it done? Thanks for your help.
