Backward message passing in variational Bayesian inference

I have come across in a research paper that, I do understand the logic. But the paper has't mentioned about the way of updating $\eta_{t}$. When I asked from the authors they said when we equate the first derivative to be zero, we could find how to update $\eta_{t}$. But, I couldn't exactly figure out how to relate $\eta_{t}$ and $\eta_{t+1}$ from the first derivative. Any insight about this is greatly appreciated. Thanks. Note: and
