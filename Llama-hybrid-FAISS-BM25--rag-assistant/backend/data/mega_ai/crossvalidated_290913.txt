Correlation and Variable importance in Random Forest

I have a dataset, which has 5000 observations and 100 variables, of which many are correlated. It is a classification problem so I am thinking of going for Random Forest for prediction and variable selection. My doubt is do I need to take care of multicollinearity before putting the data in the RF model or does RF automatically takes of multicollinearity problem?
