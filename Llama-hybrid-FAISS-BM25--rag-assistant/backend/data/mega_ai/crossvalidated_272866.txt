Condition on the sign of the dependent variable

I have a dataset on two series $X_{i,t}$ and $Y_{i,t}$. Plotting the average value of $Y_{i,t}$ defined as $\bar{Y_i}=\frac{1}{T} \displaystyle \sum_{t=1}^{T}{Y_{i,t}}$ against $\bar{X_i}$ clearly shows a U shape relationship with $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$ being negatively correlated when $\bar{X_i} I would like to test this in a linear model, and my goal is to keep it very simple if possible. So the first thing I did was to run the following: $$ \bar{Y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \bar{X_i}+ D_i \gamma + \varepsilon_{i}, $$ $D_i$ is a set of control variable. And to run it for $\bar{Y_i} 0$ separately. This gives me exactly what I want, but I am pretty sure this violate the OLS condition to get unbias coefficient since there is clear selection bias. I have also allowed $\beta_1$ to vary with the sign of $\bar{Y_i}$ and run the regression on all observations but here again I think this makes the covariate being correlated with the error term. I have tried looking for indirect predictor of the sign of $Y_{i}$ but did not find anything convincing.
