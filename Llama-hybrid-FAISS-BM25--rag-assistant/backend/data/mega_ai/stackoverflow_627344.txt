I think your DISPLAY variable looks all right. I don't think it is being set by a configuration file. Normally you have a launchd configuration file such as /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.x.startx.plist . This contains a section: Sockets :0 SecureSocketWithKey DISPLAY I believe this causes launchd to open a socket and set the DISPLAY variable to its path. When a program contacts this socket, startx is invoked by launchd.
