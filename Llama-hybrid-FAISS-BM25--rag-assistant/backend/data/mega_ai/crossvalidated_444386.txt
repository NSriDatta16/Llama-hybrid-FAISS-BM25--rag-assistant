Activation function in the mean and variance layer in VAE?

I have come across several different codes of vae just confused about should I apply activation function or even batch normalization to mean and variance layer? For example, the most common is the following one without specifying the activation function in the mean layer. However, I also looked at this following code, it applied batch norm and relu to it Which is correct? Many thanks!
