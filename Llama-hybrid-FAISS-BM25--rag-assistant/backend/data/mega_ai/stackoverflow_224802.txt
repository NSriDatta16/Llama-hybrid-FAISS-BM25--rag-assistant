It seems that __declspec(thread) isn't supported by CLR . Take in mind that .net threads aren't necesarily native threads, but can be also fibers , so standard API's for threads don't work on them. If you have a managed class, then you should use managed threading API's for thread local storage . There are a lot of articles regarding this difference. This is just to get you started. As a tip: You could use the ThreadStatic Attribute instead of the TLS in order to improve performance . In case you are working with ASP.NET applications, you need to remember some things about TLS.
