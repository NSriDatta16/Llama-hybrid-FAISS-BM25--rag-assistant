Time series analysis of electricity load questions

I have hourly data of electricity load (MW) that span 8 months (that is, 5760 data points). I also have predictions from a regression model for the same period. My goal is: to examine some properties of the time series (stationarity, seasonality, trend) to assess the performance of the regression model. To check whether the time series is stationary I used the Dickey-Fuller test. The results of the test are: Test Statistic -3.85795 p-value 0.00236705 #Lags Used 34 Number of Observations Used 5725 Critical Values {'5%': -2.86204498529, '1%': -3.43149274838,... It seems that it is safe to reject the null hypothesis of the test (i.e. that the time series is non-stationary) as the test statistic lies beyond the critical values. I have also plotted the ACF values. I used lags up to T/4 (that is 1400) and I am not sure that this makes much sense. The plot is shown below: Finally, a residual plot is shown: The plot does not seem to indicate problem with the equality of variance assumption. My questions are: Is it possible to draw any conclusions from the ACF plot and is this the proper way to do it (i.e. use the complete time series and a lag up to 1400 or would it be possible to perform the test using a subset of the series)? Do the findings in the ACF plot in any way contradict or reinforce the results of the Dickey-Fuller test? What would the "proper" approach to analyzing such time series data be?
