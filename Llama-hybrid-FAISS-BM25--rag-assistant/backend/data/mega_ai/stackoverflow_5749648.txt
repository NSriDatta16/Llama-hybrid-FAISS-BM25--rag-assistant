A widget receives a move event when changes its position. The position of a child widget is relevant to its parent. When your QLineEdit has no parent & you drag it around it changes it position, because its position is relevant to the desktop. When your QLineEdit is a child widget & you drag around the the parent widget, the position of your QLineEdit is not changing, it is relevant to its parent and only parent's position is changing. Except this one time - after its creation.
