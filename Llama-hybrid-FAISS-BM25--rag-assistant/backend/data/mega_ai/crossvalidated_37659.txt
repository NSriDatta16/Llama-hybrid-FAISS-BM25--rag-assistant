Scaling mixed models for PCA using dudi.mix

I am trying to do a kselect model from the adehabitatHS which uses commands from ade4 package. I am trying to determine if I need to scale my variables. My surface understanding is that the k-select is basically a fancy PCA. In their example they scaled their variables, but their variables were only continuous measures. I have mixed categorical and continuous variables. In their example, they scale their variables before they use the command dudi.pca which from my understanding this is needed to set up the k-select. I know from reading the dudi help in the ade4 vinette that I should use dudi.mix here instead of .pca , but what to do about scaling? Do I need to scale my variables? Do I need to scale all variables? Do I need to scale all the variables EXCEPT the categorical variable? I can't find reading material that explains what is happening in the dudi/pca mixed process in sufficient detail. Below is the example code from the k-select help if you would like to see what I am referring to. data(puechabonsp) locs Again, their example only used continuous variables. Does the dudi.mix scale the variables appropriately in the code that we don't see?
