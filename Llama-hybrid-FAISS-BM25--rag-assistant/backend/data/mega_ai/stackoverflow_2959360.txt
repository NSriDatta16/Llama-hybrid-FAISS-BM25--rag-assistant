So I assume there is a Java EE container in play, like Tomcat. If you want it to listen on some other port besides or in addition to 80, sure. You would make a new Connector in server.xml , in Tomcat's case, and specify whatever port you like. If you want this connector to speak a custom protocol, you need to implement and register your own customer Connector . I've not done it, but seems straightforward. If you're answering substantially the same requests via two protocols, it makes sense to use one server with different endpoints. I imagine it makes it far easier to share all that common logic. Even if you want to run a separate app, it still probably pays to go this way, since you'll be leveraging the container's management of connections and such.
