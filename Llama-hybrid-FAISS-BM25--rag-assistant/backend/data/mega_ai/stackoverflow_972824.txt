The PropertyEditorManager looks for the property editor (JavaBean spec): by looking if an editor has been registered explicitly. Since you are using drag and drop I suppose this is not a good solution for you. looking for 'package.BlahEditor' where 'package.Blah' is your JavaBean. So the names have to be correct for the IDE to find the editor. looking for BlahEditor in a searchlist defined by the container. Again, since you are using drag and drop this is not a solution. I don't think that there is a problem using different jars, or packaging the editor in a separate jar. I do not have enough information to give a conclusive but I can only suggest to check the naming conventions of your property editor against the name of your JavaBean.
