Bivariate/multivariate models for multinomial response variables

I need to fit two categorical (potentially correlated) response variables (each has three classes) on a set of explanatory variables, while considering for the response variables' correlation. What type of models do you think I should better use (ideally implementable in R)? I have seen literature on copula-based joint models, but they seem to be mostly on the theoretic side, rather than being implementable. Also, Bayesian multivariate logistic regression models could be an option if they were developed for the multinomial case, but apparently they are not.
