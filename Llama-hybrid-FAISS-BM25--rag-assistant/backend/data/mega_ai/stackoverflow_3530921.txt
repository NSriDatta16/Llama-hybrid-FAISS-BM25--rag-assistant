PHP library for native GWT RPC

I can't find solution for parsing GWT RPC request with PHP. Request has strange format. I need find specifications for that format (parsing and expected response) or working server-side PHP library. Sample of GWT request: 5|0|5| http://tracker/gwt/war/trackingsystem/|6F50E78F07D452C741455B0CA20F764D|client.rpc.RPCApiInterface|getIssue|I|1|2|3|4|1|5|12|
