Sanitize a string with non-alphanum repetition

I need to sanitize article titles when (creative) users try to "attract attention" with some non-alphanum repetition. Exemples: Buy my product !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Buy my product !? !? !? !? !? !? Buy my product !!!!!!!!!.......!!!!!!!! Buy my product Some acceptable solution would be to reduce the repetition of non-alphanum to 2. So I would get: Buy my product !! Buy my product !? !? Buy my product !!..!! Buy my product This solution did not work that well: preg_replace('/(\W{2,})(?=\1+)/', '', $title) Any idea how to do it in PHP with regex? Other better solution is also welcomed (I cannot strip all the non-alphanum characters as they can make sense). Edit : the objective is only to avoid most common issues. The other creative cases will be sanitized manually or sanitized with an other regex.
