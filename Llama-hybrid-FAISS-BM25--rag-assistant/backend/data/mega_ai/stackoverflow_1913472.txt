Take 2: same as above, but override the methods as follows: -(void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { hasMoved = NO; [[[webView subviews] objectAtIndex:0] touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } -(void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { hasMoved = YES; [[[webView subviews] objectAtIndex:0] touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event]; } -(void) touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if(!hasMoved) [self toggleToolbar]; [[[webView subviews] objectAtIndex:0] touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; } -(void) touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [[[webView subviews] objectAtIndex:0] touchesCancelled:touches withEvent:event]; } This works...sort of. This allows you to drag the web view around. But it isn't handling other touch events properly (following links, pinching, anything). So. Probably not very useful, but it was progress to me!
