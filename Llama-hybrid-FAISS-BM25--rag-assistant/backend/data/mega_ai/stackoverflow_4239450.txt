All these files you have mentioned are parts of compiler's headers and libraries and are shiped with any one you're using. They do present both in gcc and visual studio compilers. You just use 'em like that: // for any compiler #include #include // VisualStudio-specific #pragma comment(lib, "glu32.lib") With GNU compiler you should pass linker args like this (taken from opengl.org): -lGLU -lGL -lXmu -lX11 Hope this will help =)
