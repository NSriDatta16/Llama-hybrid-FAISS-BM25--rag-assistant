How can I stay organized when writing CSS?

Possible Duplicate: How to Manage CSS Explosion One of the most difficult things I find is keeping my stylesheets organized. I usually start out with writing a small reset section. I then write the layout blocks, and continue progressively adding styles as I write my HTML blocks. After the first two steps, though, everything turns into a mess. Styles get add, removed, forgotten, based on my whimsical HTML coding, which is changed often. I can't find a logical way to separate and classify my CSS. I found myself creating separate sheets for the default style, the navigation, and the layout. After I wrote my footer's CSS, I couldn't figure out if it should go into the default stylesheet, the navigation one, or the layout file. Its container was certainly part of the layout, its navigation menus were part navigation, but it had styles that should go into the basic stylesheet. I found myself thinking about seperating the CSS accordingly but that can't be right. I can't find a logical way to organized my ideas into orderly classifications. Can someone offer me any insight?
