An alternative to serializing your classes is to use the an ADO.NET Dataset for data storage which has built in facilities for persisting to an XML file. The code will be minimal, and you can store only the relevant data you need by designing tables that fit the model of the operation you are performing. Additionally, you will be able to use the same code if you decide to later persist the UI state to a database instead of a local file. You would only need to have an alternate function to save the Dataset.
