Mentioned in dimitriy's answer , but deserving of a little more detail: if you want to find a target inventory or capacity, you will typically not only want to satisfy average demand, but achieve a higher service level. (Note that there are different definitions of "service level" in inventory theory, not all of which make sense in any given situation.) For instance, you might run a quantile regression in order to forecast what the conditional 95th percentile of total demand in a supermarket is, where you condition on predictors like day of week, day of year, price or promotional activity. This quantile prediction then becomes your target inventory. (Whether the 95th percentile is actually the one to maximize your profit, or maybe you had better aim for a 90th or 98th percentile, is a difficult question that depends on your logistics and on the behavior of your customers. The question is easy to answer in a newsvendor situation , which is not always what you are facing.) This is why the recent M5 forecasting competition , which explicitly focused on retail forecasting and used Walmart data, required submitting quantile forecasts in its "uncertainty" track.
