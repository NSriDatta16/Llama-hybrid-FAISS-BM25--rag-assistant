I don't think running a test per time step is a nice way of doing this. I would instead, in each experiment, average the value of your indicators over all the time steps. Now each individual has 1 value per indicator which is independent as the sample are individuals out of the population. I dont understand why you would test for equal variance as equal variance is not a requirement for Mann-Whitney U, it is nonparametric.
