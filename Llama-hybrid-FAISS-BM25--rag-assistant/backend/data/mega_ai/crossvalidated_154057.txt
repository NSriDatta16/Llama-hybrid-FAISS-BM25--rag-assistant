Some pointers that I hope adress your question: It is true that when estimating the success probability for a simple binomial distribution the standard error is smallest when the probability is 0.5. Since it's really the same thing this includes intercept-only logistic regression, but note that logistic regression usually operates on the log-odds scale so you will need to transform the predictions to success probabilities. Consider simple linear regression. The confidence bands grow wider as you begin to extrapolate outside the range of data observed. For example, if you built a model using subjects age 30-40 your error bands will be larger for age = 60 than for age = 35. That is because you extrapolate and is caused by correlation of the intercept and slope. See Wikipedia . When you consider a logistic regression with a predictor then you get a combination of both effects. For example, your plot shows the narrowest band at a bit below 0.5. That is due to the distribution of AGE.
