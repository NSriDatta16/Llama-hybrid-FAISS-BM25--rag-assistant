There are several options in dealing with multicollinearity. Excluding highly correlated variables, using Principal Components Analysis to create uncorrelated predictors, using shrinkage methods (i.e. ridge regression), excluding common variance from one of the offending predictors but keeping it in another (by regressing one on another and keeping the residual as a predictor in the main model), and so forth. Using Bayesian methods is yet another approach. An excellent paper in this regard can be found here: http://srmo.sagepub.com/view/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-social-science-research-methods/n586.xml The exact choice depends on the specifics of your research. The paper should be a good starting point.
