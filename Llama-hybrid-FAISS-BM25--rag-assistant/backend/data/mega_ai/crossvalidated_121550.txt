Since you have labeled data, a supervised approach will usually outdo any unsupervised approach. I agree with Peter Flom, who in the comments noted that you "misunderstand the purpose of cluster analysis". Clusters are not meant to find regions with maximum prices. Chances are that by partitioning your data into clusters without paying attention to price, your multiple regeression approach will be worse, because it only sees part of the data; and it may have discontinuities at the borders. But in other cases, exactly this can help. Why not just give it a try and see for yourself? But beware of overfitting, don't increase the number of variables too much.
