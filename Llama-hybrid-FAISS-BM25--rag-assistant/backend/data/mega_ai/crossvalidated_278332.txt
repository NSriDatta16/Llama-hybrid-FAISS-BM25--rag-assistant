What value is needed to keep average above a certain value?

My watch keeps track of the number of active calories I burn each day. My weekly mean daily calories burned by Saturday last week was 1004. However by Sunday night, my weekly average ended up being 997 and I was disappointed not to keep average above 1000. How could I have calculated what total I needed on Sunday to keep average calories burned above 1000 for the week?
