What level of measurement are names by letters?

A respondent had to correctly recall the name of a character from the scenario. Both the first and the last names consisted of 5 letters each. For each letter, the respondent would get 0.2 points. If the respondent got correct the full first name of the character, the respondent would be awarded 1 full score. If the respondent got both the first and the last names right, the respondent would be awarded 2 full scores. In this context, what is the level of measurement of the data derived from such question? In addition, what would be the appropriate test to use for determining and comparing averages of the respondents' performances on the question?
