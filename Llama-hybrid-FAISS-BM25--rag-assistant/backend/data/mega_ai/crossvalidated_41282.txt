Dynamic conditional correlation in Stata

I am testing the co-movement between 2 exchanges by using the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) developed by Robert Engle (2002). I want to apply this method in stata 12 and used this command: Mgarch DCC (var1 var2=), arch(1) garch(1) distribution(t) I read that it should give me a column with correlations per time unit. But i am not getting this colums. Does someone have any idea how to apply the DCC in Stata 12?
