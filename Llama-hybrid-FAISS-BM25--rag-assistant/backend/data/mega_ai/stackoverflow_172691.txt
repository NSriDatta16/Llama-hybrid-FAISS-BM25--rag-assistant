How to tell if the user's using 24 hour time using Cocoa

I'm trying to determine if the user is using 24 hour or 12 hour time, and there doesn't seem to be a good way to figure this out other than creating an NSDateFormatter and searching the format string for the period field ('a' character) Here's what I'm doing now: NSDateFormatter *formatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init]; [formatter setTimeStyle:NSDateFormatterShortStyle]; NSRange range = [[formatter dateFormat] rangeOfString:@"a"]; BOOL is24HourFormat = range.location == NSNotFound && range.length == 0; [formatter release]; Which works, but feels kinda fragile. There has to be a better way, right?
