Interesting question, but quite broad. I do recommend looking at some existing literature on automatic bird song identification. (Yup, there are a bunch of people working on it.) This paper (edit: sorry, dead link, but this chapter by Dufour et al. 2014 might be even clearer) uses a basic two-stage pattern recognition method that I would recommend trying first: feature extraction (the paper uses MFCCs), then classification (the paper uses a GMM). For each frame in the input signal, you get a vector of MFCCs (between 10 to 30). These MFCC vectors are used to train a GMM (or SVM) along with the corresponding bird species labels. Then, during testing, you submit a query MFCC vector to the GMM, and it will tell you which species it thinks it is. Although some have applied image processing techniques to audio classification/fingerprinting problems (e.g., this paper by Google Research ), I hesitate to recommend these techniques for your problem or ones like it because of the annoying temporal variations . "What tools should I use for this analysis?" Among many others: feature extraction: MFCCs, onset detection classification: GMM, SVM Google Sorry for the incomplete answer, but it's a broad question, and there is more to this problem than can be answered here briefly.
