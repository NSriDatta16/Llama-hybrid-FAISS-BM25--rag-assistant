As well as the problem explained by oedo, you've also got severe SQL injection problems. You need to use mysql_real_escape_string to encode strings for insertion into an SQL statement, not htmlspecialchars. Or use parameterised queries. htmlspecialchars() is for HTML-encoding text just before you output it into an HTML page. You should not HTML-encode strings for storage in the database.
