Get version of installed Flash ActiveX in Win32/C++

Is this even possible? I'm embedding Flash inside an IE frame in my application and would like to check if Flash and what version of it is installed. The application needs to run without admin privileges. Bonus question: Can I also check if ActiveX controls are enabled in the IE settings?
