JSP may be the closest to PHP indeed but I'd like to encourage you to look at JSF, a component-orianted Model-View-Controler framework which is part of Java EE, the standard that GlassFish implements fully. There's also JAX-RS, another Java EE technology to expose Java object are RESTful resources. Both of them are built on top of the Servlet technology.
