After reading the extended explanation I'll try my shot: context = $('body > *:not(div#do-not-modify-me)'); $("*:first",context); You can even do: context = $('body > *:not(div#do-not-modify-me)'); context.find( "*:first"); To get number of element you can do: var len = context.length; To access to element number i in the collection you can use: context.get(i); And there are tons of useful information on api.jquery.com , also read this probably you will want to create your own selector. EDIT: After, I saw your recent update I think what you are looking for is for ability iterate over context results elements, so it could be done as I've mentioned here several time by: for ( var i = 0; i This, doesn't look that clever, but should work, you can encapsulate this by extending $.fn and implementing function for your purpose. EDIT #2: Let's try another way: (function($) { $.fn.tagName = function( ) { return this.get(0).tagName; }; $.fn.pick = function( tag) { return this.filter( function( ) { return $(this).tagName == tag; }); }; } })(jQuery); After this you can do contex.pick( "p"), so it will return you all paragraph inside your result set, but this code is incomplete, so you need to look some more into jquery code, for example to implement it in a way you will be able to use complete jquery functionality with pick function, probably you need to consider to use xpath DOM parser .
