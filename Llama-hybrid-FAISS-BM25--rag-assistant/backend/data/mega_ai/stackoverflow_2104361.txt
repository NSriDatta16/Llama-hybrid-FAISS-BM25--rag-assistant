because there is a different in size and storage tinyint = 1 byte smallint = 2 bytes int = 4 bytes bigint = 8 bytes so if you know you only need to store up to a certain range there is no need to use bigint and incur overhead of storing extra bytes per row same holds for strings (char, varchar etc etc) also built in constraints...can't store the letter A in an int...data will be clean..
