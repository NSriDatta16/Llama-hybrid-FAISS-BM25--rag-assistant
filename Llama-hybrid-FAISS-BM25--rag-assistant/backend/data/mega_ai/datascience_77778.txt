It is fine to apply feature selection technique on one hot encoded variables. Because if one particular segment of that variable is correlated with your target, then it is a good news. Your model will understand the scenario better. Or, You can label encode your categorical variable first so that you still have 30 variables (29 numerical + 1 label-encoded categorical variable). Now try to find the importance value of each variable, and take the relevant ones (Use any method for it: be it RFE, random forest feature selection, pearson's correlation etc). Once you have the final list of variables, and the label-encoded variable is also coming as relevant, it is ok to put it into the model.
