Such thing as a weighted correlation?

I have some interesting data on the most popular musical artists streamed divided by location into about 200 congressional districts. I want to see if it's possible to poll a person on his or her musical preferences and determine whether he or she "listens like a Democrat" or "listens like a Republican." (Naturally this is light hearted, but there's real entropy in the data!) I have data on about 100 artists, plus the average percentage votes for Republicans and Democrats in each district over the past three election cycles. So I ran a correlation on each artist to see which ones were most disproportionately listened-to as a function of vote share for Democrats. Those correlations run from about -0.3 to 0.3 for any given artist, with plenty in the middle that have little or no predictive power. I have two questions: First, the overall number of streams per district varies widely. Right now, I'm correlating percentage of all streams per district belonging to, say, Beyonce, against the percentage of votes cast for Democrats. But total streams in one district might be in the millions, while another is in the low 100,000s. Do I need to weight the correlation somehow to account for this? Second, I'm curious how to combine these correlations into a composite guess as to the user's politics. Let's say I take the 20 artists with the highest absolute correlative values (positive and negative), ten in each direction, and poll a user on how much he or she likes each artist. So I have up or down votes on each artist plus the correlation to the politics for all 20 values. Is there a standard way to combine these correlations into a single estimate? (I'm thinking something like the NYTimes' famous dialect quiz , where it combined the regional probabilities for 25 questions into a heat map. But in this case, I just need a single value on how Democratic or Republican one's taste in music is. Thank you!
