Is it possible to use anything other than GridLayout on Eclipse preference pages?

The following simple preference page fails with a ClassCastException : @Override protected Control createContents(Composite parent) { Composite container = new Composite(parent, SWT.NONE); container.setLayout(new FillLayout()); List list = new List(container, SWT.NONE); return container; } The same code works fine with a regular SWT application. If I replace the FillLayout with a GridLayout , it works, but that doesn't satisfy me. Is there no way to use a FillLayout or RowLayout in Eclipse preference pages? Edit: I'm very sorry, I did not pay enough attention when preparing the example. The above code does indeed work fine. In my code, I returned the list, not the container (!). For some reason, that worked in normal SWT, but it's really nonsense.
