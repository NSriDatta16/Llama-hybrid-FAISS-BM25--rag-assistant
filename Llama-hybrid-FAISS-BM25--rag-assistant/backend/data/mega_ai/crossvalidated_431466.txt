Does Neural Net with Softmax activation function violate the IIA assumption?

Multinomial logistic regression have assume the IIA (independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), IIA assumption: difference logit and probit ); but I'm wondering if using Neural network in which the last layer has Softmax activation with negative-log-likelihood as loss function and perform gradient descent also assumes IIA? If so; is there anyway of make neural net violates IIA ?
