Displaying a Django query result in HTML - table, list, css divs?

I am working on an django application that will return what historically was a table of information: ISSUE DESCRIPTION INITIATOR INITIATEDDATE ASSIGNEE FORECASTDATE STATUS REMARKS That will be the entrance point for users to sort / filter, etc the list of issues. The columns like ISSUE, DATES, NAMES are of relatively fixed width, but others can be a paragraph or more. What is the best way to render this in HTML? As HTML Tables, lists or with a lot of CSS spans/divs? I eventually hope to make the issues list sortable or filterable with javascript as well.
