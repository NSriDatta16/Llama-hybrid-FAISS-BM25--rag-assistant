Normally you would do that with CHECK constraint: foo_test VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (foo_test <> '') Prior to Version 8.0 MySQL had limited support for constraints. From MySQL Reference Manual : The CHECK clause is parsed but ignored by all storage engines. If you must stick to an old version use triggers as a workaround, as people have pointed out. In future, you may want to take a look at PostgreSQL , which is considered to have better support for data integrity (among other things ) by many people .
