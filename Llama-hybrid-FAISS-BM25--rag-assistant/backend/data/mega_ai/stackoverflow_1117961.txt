C#: How to use a Type Converter to localize enums

I'm trying to understand how to use Type Converters after reading this answer to one of my other questions. But I'm not sure if I quite get it... In my particular case I would like to "convert" an enum member into a localized string by getting a resource string depending on what enum member it is. So for example if I had this enum: public enum Severity { Critical, High, Medium, Low } or this: public enum Color { Black = 0x0, Red = 0x1, Green = 0x2, Blue = 0x4, Cyan = Green | Blue, Magenta = Red | Blue, Yellow = Red | Green, White = Red | Green | Blue, } How would I create a Type Converter that could convert those members into localized strings? And how would I use it? Currently I would need to use it in a WinForms application, but more general examples are welcome as well.
