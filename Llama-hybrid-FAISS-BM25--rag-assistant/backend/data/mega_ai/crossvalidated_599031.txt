As rightly pointed out by @whuber, the question was underspecified. However, I believe that with the additional information provided in the comments that the sources are weighted linearly , it has an objective solution. I found this solution first by intituitive guessing, but it turns out that its more formal derivation is straightforward. One idea is to say that there is a third "source", the "guessing source" with probability 0.5, which only comes into play when I can neither fully trust source A (i.e. $a ) nor source B ( $b ). What I need then is a formula that weighs the probabilities $p$ , $q$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ in accordance with the conditions stated in the question. I can first specify the most general linearly weighted form as follows: $$P=(\alpha_1 a+\alpha_2b+\alpha_3 ab+\alpha_4)p + (\beta_1 a+\beta_2b+\beta_3 ab+\beta_4)q + (\gamma_1 a+\gamma_2b+\gamma_3 ab+\gamma_4)\frac{1}{2}$$ Using condition (1), i.e. if $a=b=0 \;\rightarrow\;P=0.5$ , it is immediately clear that $\alpha_4=0$ , $\beta_4=0$ and $\gamma_4=1$ . Thus $P$ simplifies as follows: $P=(\alpha_1 a+\alpha_2b+\alpha_3 ab)p + (\beta_1 a+\beta_2b+\beta_3 ab)q + \frac{1}{2}(\gamma_1 a+\gamma_2b+\gamma_3 ab+1)$ Using condition (3), i.e. if $a=1$ , $b=0 \;\rightarrow\;P=p$ it is $\alpha_1 p+\beta_1 q+\frac{1}{2}(\gamma_1+1)=p$ From this I can conclude that $\alpha_1=1$ , $\beta_1=0$ and $\gamma_1=-1$ Using condition (4) and by symmetry of $a$ and $b$ , it must also be that $\alpha_2=0$ , $\beta_2=1$ and $\gamma_2=-1$ . Thus, my probability simplifies as follows: $$ \begin{align} P & = (a+\alpha_3 ab)p + (b+\beta_3 ab)q + \frac{1}{2}(\gamma_3 ab-a-b+1)\\ & = a(1+\alpha_3 b)p + (1+\beta_3 a)bq + \frac{1}{2}(\gamma_3 ab-a-b+1) \end{align} $$ Now, conditions (2) to (4) imply more generally that if I trust one source completely (i.e. $a=1$ or $b=1$ ), I discard the "guesser". For instance, if $a=1$ and $b=x$ with $0\le x\le 1$ , I know that the guessing term must be zero: $\frac{1}{2}(\gamma_3 ab-a-b+1)\stackrel{a=1, b=x}{=}\frac{1}{2}(\gamma_3 x-1-x+1)=0\;\rightarrow\;\gamma_3=1$ Thus: $$ \begin{align} P & = a(1+\alpha_3 b)p + (1+\beta_3 a)bq + \frac{1}{2}(ab-a-b+1) \\ & =a(1+\alpha_3 b)p + (1+\beta_3 a)bq + \frac{1}{2}(1-a)(1-b) \end{align} $$ For the final paramaters $\alpha_3$ and $\beta_3$ , I can make use of the rationale that if I trust one source fully, the other source can contribute at most half of the weight. For instance, if $a=1$ , I know that the factor $1+\beta_3 a$ in front of B's probability $q$ should be $\frac{1}{2}$ irrespective of the value of $b$ : $1+\beta_3 a \stackrel{a=1}{=} 1+\beta_3 = \frac{1}{2}\;\rightarrow\;\beta_3=-\frac{1}{2}$ By symmetry between $a$ and $b$ it must also be that $\alpha_3=-\frac{1}{2}$ . Thus, the final probability is: $$ P=a(1-\frac{b}{2})p + (1-\frac{a}{2})bq + \frac{1}{2}(1-a)(1-b) $$ I'm sure this is not the most elegant proof, but for me personally it's only important to know that the formula can be proven.
