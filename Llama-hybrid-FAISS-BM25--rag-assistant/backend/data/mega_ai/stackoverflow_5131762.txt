Many languages have reflection to the level that they allow replacement of arguments and such (including Java, C#, Smalltalk, and Ruby, I believe). However, there are separation of concerns issues when you have one part of the program mutating another. You could put a default value for callback that just returns value ; that would be a more elegant solution that would remove the conditional expression.
