I absolutely recommend you to forget putting effort on C/C++ for this purpose, and convert to R programming language. In R, there are huge number of packages already developed and freely available for any purpose and you can reuse them easily. Doing a hard-to-develop statistical test, running a Principal Component Analysis, learning a Neural Network or finding the Support Vector Machine are all done with SINGLE commands! For the areas you have mentioned there is almost no need to develop the basic things in R. You should only develop your car on the base of available wheels!
