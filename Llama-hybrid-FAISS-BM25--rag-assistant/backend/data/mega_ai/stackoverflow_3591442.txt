I love Django, but I'm not sure that it would benefit you here. Maybe I don't completely understand how you plan to use it, but it seems like if you already have your data access and logic done in PHP then you would have to re-code that in Python in order to leverage Django. If what you really want is clean urls and simple url mapping then you could probably use CodeIgniter or CakePHP . That way you don't need to rewrite your existing code in Python or having the same code in 2 different languages.
