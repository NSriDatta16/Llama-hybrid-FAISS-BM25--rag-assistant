There is no standard deviation of a categorical variable - it makes no sense, just as the mean makes no sense. E.g. in your example, what is the "average color"? But there are ways to estimate the error of a binomial or multinomial proportion. It isn't clear which you want, since your title seems to ask for the latter while your text seems to ask for the former. Even for the binomial proportion, it's trickier than many people think. The classic formula for a 95% CI for a binomial proportion is $CI=\hat{p} \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$ but this may not be best. See e.g Brown, Cai & DasGupta
