Updating conjugate priors with noisy observations

I'm considering a problem that has been partially addressed elsewhere: Bayesian updating with conjugate priors using the closed form expressions but now I have an added twist. My samples are drawn from distributions of unknown mean and variance, and I wish to estimate this mean and variance. However, instead of direct access to the samples, I only have noisy observations of them, which I model by addition of Gaussian noise of ~N(0,s) to the each sample independently, and s is known. How do I incorporate this additional noise term to the posterior worked out for the original problem above?
