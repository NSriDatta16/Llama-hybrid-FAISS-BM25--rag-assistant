Should a two-sided binomial confidence interval for an observed frequency of zero have a right-tail probability of $\alpha$ or $\alpha / 2$?

Suppose you have n Bernoulli trials and zero observed successes. The lower bound on a $1-\alpha$ two-sided confidence interval for the proportion of successes will of course be zero. By the definition of the Clopper-Pearson interval, the upper bound is $\{ \theta | P[Bin(n, \theta) \geq 0] \geq \alpha/2 \}$ . My question is: isn't the coverage of this interval $1-\alpha/2$ instead of $1-\alpha$ ? Note: In R, binom::binom.confint returns an upper bound such that $ (1 - UB)^n = \alpha/2 $ when a $1 - \alpha$ confidence level is specified.
