Adding a quadratic term: should I use the squared original (and not the squared standardized?)

In a multiple logistic regression I need to standardize one of the variables because I need to add a quadratic term. Whether I add the quadratic term as the squared original or the squared standardized, I get very similar models, same AIC. Why? The estimates of the linear term change. When I square a standardized variable, I get positive numbers after squaring half of the data (which are negative) and that should completely mess up my data. Why does it not? Can someone please explain the mathematical reason behind it and tell me if I definitely should use the squared original and if I can use the squared standardized, why does it work? I notice this is a mathematics question rather than anything but I searched and could not find anything related to this.
