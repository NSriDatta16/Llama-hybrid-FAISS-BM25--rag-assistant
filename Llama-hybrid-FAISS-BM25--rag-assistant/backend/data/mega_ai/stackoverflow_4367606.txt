Stackpanels are useful when you have a certain amount of items that you want to be in line with each other. Very simple to use and effective when dynamically adding items, however it's simplicity means it doesn't really have any resizing abilities. Dockpanels are useful when when placing and organising several different items onto a window, specifically when anchoring items to the top, bottom, left, right and then fitting to the remaining space in the centre (I recently discovered they're quite handy when used in conjunction with expanders). No real downsides, could well be effective for you. If you have no need for dynamically changing the layout I would suggest that grid controls would be your best bet though as you can split the grid into the matrix you require. Using an asterisk (*) for each side would mean that all boxes would re-size evenly to fit the window you have. Functionality is limited but by the sounds of your requirements a grid would cover it. A useful tutorial on layouts can be found here.
