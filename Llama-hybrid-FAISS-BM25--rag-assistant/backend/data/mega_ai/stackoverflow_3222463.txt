How to prevent my app from running in the background on the iPhone

Is there any way to cause an app to quit instead of going to background when the home button is pressed? For security reasons, it would be better if the app did not run in background but actually closed when home is pushed. This is not for users' security, but rather for company data on the app, so it is not a user's choice. I could not find any way to quit other than forcing an exit, which Apple discourages.
