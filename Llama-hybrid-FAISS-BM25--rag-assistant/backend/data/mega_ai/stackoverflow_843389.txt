The Pimpl Idiom in practice

There have been a few questions on SO about the pimpl idiom , but I'm more curious about how often it is leveraged in practice. I understand there are some trade-offs between performance and encapsulation, plus some debugging annoyances due to the extra redirection. With that, is this something that should be adopted on a per-class, or an all-or-nothing basis? Is this a best-practice or personal preference? I realize that's somewhat subjective, so let me list my top priorities: Code clarity Code maintainability Performance I always assume that I will need to expose my code as a library at some point, so that's also a consideration. EDIT: Any other options to accomplish the same thing would be welcome suggestions.
