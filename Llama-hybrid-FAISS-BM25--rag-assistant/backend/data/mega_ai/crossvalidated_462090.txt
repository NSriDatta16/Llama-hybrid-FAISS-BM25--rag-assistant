Backpropagation is the reverse-mode differentiation and it only applies to acyclic networks with directed edges(as stated in this article: Back-propagation, an introduction ). RBMs are equivalent to infinite directed belief networks(see this article: Learning Deep Architectures for AI ), then we cannot apply backpropagation to the infinitely deep neural network.
