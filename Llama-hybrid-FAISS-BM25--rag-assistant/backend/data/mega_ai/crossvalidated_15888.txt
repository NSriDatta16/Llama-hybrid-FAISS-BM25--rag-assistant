Allow data to dictate the priors and then run the model using these priors? (e.g., data-driven priors from same data set)

It is my understanding that we should not be allowing the same data set we are analyzing to drive/define what the prior distributions look like in a Bayesian analysis. Specifically, it is inappropriate to define prior distributions for a Bayesian analysis based on summary statistics from the same data set that you are then going to use the priors to help fit a model to. Does anyone happen to know of resources that specifically discuss this as being inappropriate? I need some citations for this issue.
