You might try some tree based models, such as randomForest or GBM in R. Both models are good at picking up non-linear effects and interactions, and both also produce variable importance measures that will probably be useful in your analysis. GBM in particular might be useful, as it fits each successive tree to the residuals of the model. In this way, after the model captures the effects of geometric dimensions, it will explore how the various treatments might be used to explain the "leftover" (or residual) variance. On the other hand, random forests require very little tuning and are harder to screw up than GBM models. I would make sure each treatment is its set of variables, e.g. total time in fire, min/mean/median/max/cumulative bending and pulling pressure, etc. Particularly in GBM models, more variables are better, so be thorough! How are you measuring how "good" your models are? Are you cross-validating them?
