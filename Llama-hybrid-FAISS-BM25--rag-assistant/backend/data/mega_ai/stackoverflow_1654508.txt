My view is that you should just use whatever style you feel most comfortable with. Embedded comments are intended to be read by you and other developers trying to understand the implementation details of your code. So long as they are clear and intelligible, it does matter if they style is a bit unusual, the grammar is a bit poor, or there are a few spelling errors. The folks who are reading it should be beyond caring about such things. Comments that are extracted to form API documentation deserve a bit more attention to the niceties of style, grammar and spelling. But even here accuracy and completeness are far more important.
