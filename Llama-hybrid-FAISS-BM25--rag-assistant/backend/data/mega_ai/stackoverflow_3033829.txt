Google chrome extension: local storage

I'm developing an extension for Google Chrome, and have run into some trouble.I created an options.html page and added it to the manifest.json file.The page shows properly. I saved the options, and then went back to the page on which the extension is supposed to run. Unfortunately, the Local storage for the options was returning a 'null' instead of the option. If I set the local storage option directly from the extension's JS script, it works fine but not if it was set from the options page. Any idea how i can access the options.html local storage values from my Javascript file in the extension?
