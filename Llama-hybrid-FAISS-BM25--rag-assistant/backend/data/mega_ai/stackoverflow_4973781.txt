Had the same problem last night. Solved this morning.. Flash CS5's new interface for embedding a font looks highlighted but you need to ensure that the checkbox is also selected. Flash Builder 4, (and Flex), files need to be manually refreshed after updating your SWC file, as the system lags for some reason. These two things together can lead to some unnecessary back and forth.
