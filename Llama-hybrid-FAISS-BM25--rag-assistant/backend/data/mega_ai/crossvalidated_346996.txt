There are a bunch of issues here You can't compare likelihoods / deviance / AIC between models with continuous vs. count data, see, e.g. Can WAIC be used to compare Bayesian linear regression models with different likelihoods? . Moreover, do you have discrete k/n or continuous proportions? In either case, applying an lm on the raw data is usually not a good idea (see What are the issues with using percentage outcome in linear regression? ), at least use a transformation (e.g. logit is sometimes used for continuous proportions, also arcsine, but see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21560670 ). Better use a glm, for k/n binomial, for continuous proportions it is common to use beta regression or a pseudo-binomial. About the decision what to do - in doubt, I would simply go for the data-generating model, i.e. in case of k/n for a binomial. Check the model fit, e.g. with DHARMa , and with k/n binomial, you also have to check for overdispersion.
