Why is the convolutional filter flipped in convolutional neural networks?

I don't understand why there is the need to flip filters when using convolutional neural networks. According to the lasagne documentation, flip_filters : bool (default: True) Whether to flip the filters before sliding them over the input, performing a convolution (this is the default), or not to flip them and perform a correlation. Note that for some other convolutional layers in Lasagne, flipping incurs an overhead and is disabled by default â€“ check the documentation when using learned weights from another layer. What does that mean? I never read about flipping filters when convolving in any neural network book. Would someone clarify, please?
