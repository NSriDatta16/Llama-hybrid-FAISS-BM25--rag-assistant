Use an id to refer to a specific element. Use class to refer to all elements of a specific type. I think [you should use id on a paragraph tag] if you know you're only using that kind of paragraph once on the page. You shouldn't use id just because you only happen have one of them on your page. You should use id when you want to be sure to only affect that one specific element, both now and in the future when other people add more paragraphs. If you have a specific "kind" of paragraph there is nothing wrong with using a class to represent this, even if that class currently only has one member.
