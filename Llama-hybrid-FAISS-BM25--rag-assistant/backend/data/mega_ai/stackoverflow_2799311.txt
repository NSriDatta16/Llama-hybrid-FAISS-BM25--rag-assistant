You may find that NHibernate suits your needs. NHibernate is an ORM that basically persists your objects in a database (which can be nearly any flavor, but SQL Server Compact Edition would be an appropriate choice for a stand-alone desktop application) and reconstitutes them for you. I personally do not like or use ORMs, but they are a well-established and popular technology, and because they opaquely encapsulate the underlying database/storage mechanism, they make this decision much less important to an application developer. You could start with NHibernate on top of SQL Server CE, and if SqlCe doesn't work out for some reason you can switch databases without changing the rest of your program. You don't have to use NHibernate, of course, and the ADO.NET classes provide essentially the same database independence.
