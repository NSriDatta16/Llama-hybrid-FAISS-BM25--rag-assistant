Dynamic graph dataset

I'm working with dynamic graph embedding but I can not seek the dataset for my problem. Can you help me find dataset with some requires: A series of graph which represent for dynamic graphs. Each graph in series of graph is static graph with both directed and undirected Label for each node (vertex) of graph to evaluate the embedding algorithm. Thank for helping!
