By virtue of simply including the jQuery script, you do indeed get some overhead. jQuery builds itself up inside an immediately executed function . In 1.3.2 the biggest things it does are for IE support: creates a temporary form element with one input element inside it, to check to see if the browser returns elements by name when querying by getElementById - [ Source ] creates a temporary div with a empty comment node in it, to check to see if the browser returns only elements when doing getElementsByTagName("*") - [ Source ] creates a temporary anchor element, to see if getAttribute returns normalized href attributes - [ Source ] creates a temporary div with this html in it: ' a text ' and proceeds to read off a bunch of characteristics from that structure. This is to build the jQuery.support object that was created in lieu of deprecating jQuery.browser - [ Source ] It also does some smaller things like: creates a whole whack of regular expression objects parses navigator.userAgent for some deprecated browser sniffing support gets the current Date from the system ( +new Date ) Keep in mind all this barely adds up to any noticeable lag, as others have suggested.
