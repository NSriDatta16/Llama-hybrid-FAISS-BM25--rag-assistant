Finding the posterior distribution of a Bayesian analysis prior

I have a prior distribution $f(x)=\pi cos(\pi x) $ where $x$ is the probability of getting tails in a coin toss. Should a coin toss result in tails, how would this be reflected in the posterior distribution? Would the posterior distribution simply be $f(x)=\pi cos(\pi/2) $ , as $P(x)=1/2$ ? Thank you!
