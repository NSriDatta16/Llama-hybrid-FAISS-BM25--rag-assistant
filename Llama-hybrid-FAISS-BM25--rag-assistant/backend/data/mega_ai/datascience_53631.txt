This thread might interest you: Adding Features To Time Series Model LSTM . You have basically 3 possible ways: For example, weather data from two different cities: Paris and San Francisco. You want to predict the next temperature based on historical data. But at the same time, you expect the weather to change based on the city. You can either: Combine the auxiliary features with the time series data, at the beginning or at the end (ugly!). Concatenate the auxiliary features with the output of the RNN layer. It's some kind of post-RNN adjustment since the RNN layer won't see this auxiliary info. Or initialize the RNN states with a learned representation of the condition (e.g. Paris or San Francisco). I wrote a library to condition on auxiliary inputs. It abstracts all the complexity and has been designed to be as user-friendly as possible: https://github.com/philipperemy/cond_rnn/ The implementation is in tensorflow (>=1.13.1) Hope it helps!
