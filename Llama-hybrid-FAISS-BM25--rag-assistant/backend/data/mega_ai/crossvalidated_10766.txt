Two poisson random variables and likelihood ratio test

I have two cases: Two random poisson variables $X_1 \sim \text{Pois}(\lambda_1)$ , $X_2 \sim \text{Pois}(\lambda_2)$ , and testing: Null Hypothesis: $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2$ Alternate hyp: $\lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2$ Two random binomial variables $X_1 \sim \text{Binom}(n_1, p_1)$ , $X_2 \sim \text{Binom}(n_2, p_2)$ , where $n_1=n_2$ : Null Hypothesis: $p_1 = p_2$ Alternate hyp : $p_1 \neq p_2$ I started with likelihood ratio test for both cases, where I calculated maximum likelihood estimates for both cases, and then estimated likelihood ratio test statistics. But while reading some literature and discussion, I learned likelihood ratio test may not be a valid test in all cases, such as at low lambda values or one lambda low and other high, so for first case (poisson case), I could also explore the option of poisson random variable condition on sum of $X_1+X_2$ which will be $\text{Binom}(X_1+X_2, 0.5)$ and can be tested using Fisher exact test. Similarly for second case with two binom random variables a good choice will be McNamara test. And there are also some Bayesian tests which can be used (I do not know of any). So I am wondering how could I do Fisher exact test for two poisson r.v condition on sum of them, and McNamara test for two binom, and if there is any bayesian test which i could use. Preferably, i will try these test in R as I am trying to learn R.
