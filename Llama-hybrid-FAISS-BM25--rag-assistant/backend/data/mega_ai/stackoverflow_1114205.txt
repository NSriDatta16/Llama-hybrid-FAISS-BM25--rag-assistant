How should I use debug/release mode in Visual Studio?

I usually test my code locally on my work machine and then move it to development environment and then finally to production environment. What is the best way to use debug/release mode for this scenario? Do I only need to care about debug mode in my machine? Should I publish debug mode or release mode to development? I know probably I should publish using the release mode to production. I didn't really pay attention to all of this before so I have been working only in debug mode all the time, which I know I shouldn't. Edit: Thanks for the answers. It looks like it's a good idea to only use debug mode in my own machine. Even though it's in development machine, it's basically releasing to the public (co-workers, qa) so it should be in release mode. And of course it should be release mode when releasing to prod.
