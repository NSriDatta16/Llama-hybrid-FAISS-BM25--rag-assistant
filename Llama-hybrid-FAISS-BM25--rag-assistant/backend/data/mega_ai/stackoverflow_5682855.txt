Depending on the implementation of new and delete (or free() and malloc()) your memory might not given back to the OS after a delete/free. A memory allocator is not required to do so. The memory might still be reclaimed by a subsequent new, or after a internal memory defragmentation or garbage collection the memory usage might decrease again.
