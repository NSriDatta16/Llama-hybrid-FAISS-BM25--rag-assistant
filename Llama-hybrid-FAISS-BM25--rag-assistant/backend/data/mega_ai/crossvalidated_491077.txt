Biase of ASE estimation Kernel Regression

I'm trying to calculate the bias of the estimator $p(h)=n^{-1}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{j}-\hat{m}_{h}(X_{j})^{2}w(X_{j})$ of the averaged squared error. The result I find in the literature is this: but I am not able to calculate the expectation of the term $C_{1n}(h)$ . Any idea of how to proceed or where to find it?
