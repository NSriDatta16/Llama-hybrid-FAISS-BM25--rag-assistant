The reason that the validation error does not increase at some point in Fig. a) is that overfitting does not occur - as the training data size is much larger than the trainable parameters in the network. On p. 473 of Neural Network Design it is stated that if "the number of data points is significantly larger than the number of network parameters, then there will not be a problem of overfitting." There is therefore no "guarantee" that the validation error will start to increase at some point. Also, by increasing the number of hidden nodes in Fig. b) beyond $N_h$= 98, the training error continues to decrease, while the validation and testing error levels off (does not increase or decrease further).
