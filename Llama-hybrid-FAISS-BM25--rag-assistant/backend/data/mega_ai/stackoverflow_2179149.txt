Where are you storing your client variables? If in a database, then you might be able to work by passing the user's CFID & CFTOKEN values in the link that takes them to the eshop. (Then, when CF looks up the client variables that correspond to those identifiers, it will find the records previously stored by the client domain's code.) This would require both sites to use the same client variables database, though, which may or may not be feasible for you. If you're using cookie or (god help you) registry storage for the client variables, though, you're going to need to come up with some other mechanism to transfer this information. (You could, say, pack up all of the information into a WDDX string, store it into a database table for this purpose, pass the record's ID in the link to the shop, and have the shop's code unpack to the WDDX.)
