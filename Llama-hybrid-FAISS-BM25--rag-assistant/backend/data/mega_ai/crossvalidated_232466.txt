The approach I would take would be similar to option 2, but I'd use logistic regression . What I would want to model would be the probability of a person posting on a given day as a function of the colour of the page. So, for each person, I would have seven observations, one for each day. In the regression I'd include a random effect for person (because each person may have a different probability of posting) and a random effect for day (as different days are likely to have more posts). Of course, as you point out, given the sheer number of users FB has, this is likely to generate vast amounts of data and will be highly likely to give you a significant result. Consequently, I'd be more interested in the effect size , which in the case of a logistic regression would be something like odds ratio .
