How to analyse a number of tracks with multiple coordinates and classify the tracks as a whole with machine learning?

This is a small sample of the dataframe I am using: track time UTM_WGS84.Longitude UTM_WGS84.Latitude 1 1 2015-10-14 23:59:55.711 5.481687 51.43635 2 1 2015-10-14 23:59:55.717 5.481689 51.43635 3 1 2015-10-14 23:59:55.723 5.481689 51.43635 4 1 2015-10-14 23:59:55.730 5.481690 51.43635 5 1 2015-10-14 23:59:55.763 5.481691 51.43635 6 1 2015-10-14 23:59:55.804 5.481691 51.43635 7 1 2015-10-14 23:59:55.840 5.481692 51.43635 8 2 2015-10-14 23:59:55.882 5.481692 51.43635 9 2 2015-10-14 23:59:56.031 5.481693 51.43635 10 2 2015-10-14 23:59:56.041 5.481693 51.43635 11 2 2015-10-14 23:59:56.047 5.481693 51.43635 12 2 2015-10-14 23:59:56.053 5.481694 51.43635 13 3 2015-10-14 23:59:56.081 5.481695 51.43635 14 3 2015-10-14 23:59:56.121 5.481695 51.43635 15 3 2015-10-14 23:59:56.165 5.481695 51.43635 In the actual dataset, there are on average about 150 lines of coordinates per track. I'm not very advanced in Machine Learning yet, and I have no idea where to begin for analysing this data. The goal is to classify each track based on the walking pattern. I need to classify it to something like potentially aggressive or not. I want to do this with a few supervised learning methods in R, like k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Neural Network or Support Vector Machine. Which method would be easiest to begin with? Can someone please show me an example or tell me how to deal with classifying this kind of data?
