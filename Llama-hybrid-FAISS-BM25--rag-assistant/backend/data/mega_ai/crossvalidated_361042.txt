Cosine-Similarity vs non-linear measures

In NLP, people often use cosine similarity to measure how close two vector spaces are to each other. However, we know that cosine-similarity is the same thing as Pearson correlation, for centered vectors ( Is there any relationship among cosine similarity, pearson correlation, and z-score? ). To me, this means that we can view each vector as a random variable, and the values of the vector as realizations of the underlying distribution of that random variable. In that case, we also know that correlation only measures linear dependence. So, my question is, why would cosine similarity be preferred to perhaps nonlinear measures of association between random variables, such as distance correlation ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_correlation )?
