Since you mention the data are on a likert scale (from good to bad or something similar), the data would be ordinal . For example: "It is alright for a couple to live together without intending to get married?" 1. Totally alright 2. Alright 3. Neutral 4. Not alright 5. Totally not alright Hence, using ordered logistic regression preserves more information than using multinomial logistic regression, which essentially considers the data nominal (i.e. no order). The latter would be more appropriate for a survey with answers like: yes , no , no opinion , since these categories have no logical order to them.
