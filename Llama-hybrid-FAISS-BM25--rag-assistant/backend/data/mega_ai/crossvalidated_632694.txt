GLM or GLMM design for different tasks

I am conducting a study involving 70 participants diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 75 without MCI. All participants were engaged in taxonomic semantic, thematic semantic, and phonemic fluency tasks, where they were asked to articulate as many words as possible related to the categories ‘animals’, ‘supermarket’, and starting with the phoneme /p/, respectively. For each task, I collected identical features (e.g., average number of syllables, average concreteness, etc.), resulting in each participant having three values per feature (one for each task). I am interested in identifying which specific feature, associated with a particular task, exhibits a significant difference in predicting group membership. Additionally, I intend to control for age, sex, and education variables as covariates in this analysis Which is the optimal modeling approach between GLM and GLMM for this scenario? Additionally, could someone assist by providing R code? I'm new to this and eager to learn.
