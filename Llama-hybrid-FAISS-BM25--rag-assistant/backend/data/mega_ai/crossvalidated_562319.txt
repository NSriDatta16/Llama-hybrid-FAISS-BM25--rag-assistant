Not a direct answer (unless there is a mix-up of confidence vs prediction intervals here), but pulling out the quantiles from the individual trees in your example does produce approximately correct coverage (actually a bit better coverage than expected) for individual level prediction intervals. library(ranger) friedman $predictions,1,quantile,0.05) #90% interval upper predictions,1,quantile,0.95) mean((lower $y) & (test$ y You get these for free with random forests. For very extreme quantiles will need to up the number of trees, but those are typically very difficult to get good coverage for extreme percentiles in real data examples in my experience across projects.
