Journal reference for time series analysis and forecasting

What is the lay of the land of statistics journals that cover time series analysis? I would like to start reading journal articles on time series analysis and forecasting. My interest is in stochastic processes as opposed to deterministic processes, thus i am more interested with the coverage and application of time series as in statistics, economics than with its coverage in say astronomy or physics. For example, I have little interest in Fourier representation (for deterministic functions) but a lot of interest in its analogue for Stationary stochastic processes - spectral analysis. Are all journals that cover time series doing the same thing and some just do it better, in which case the selection is a matter of figuring out which journal has a higher impact index? Or are different journals concerned with slighly different matters? Which journal should I turn to if I wanted to say better understand what ergodicity is (something most textbooks are terse on)? Which journal should I turn to in order to understand what are the latest developments in time series analysis? When say the ARIMA or GARCH or ECM or Hidden Markov models were developed, what journals did they first appear in? Which journal should I turn to in order to clearly understand what time series analysis is concerned with as opposed to forecasting?
