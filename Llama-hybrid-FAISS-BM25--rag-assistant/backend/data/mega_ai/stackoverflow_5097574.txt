PHP MYSQL while change field name each time

I have a database to store people's quick links. This is a very basic quick link storage method. The database looks like this: full_name | 1url | 1name | 2url | 2name | 3url |3 name | 4url |4name | 5url | 5name ^This goes on until 10. I know this is a bad way, but this is for an unprofessional website. I will want to put the result into an ordered list. But I am unsure how to change the number (1url or 2url) each time? So currently I have it set up like this in PHP $result = mysql_query(SELECT * FROM `links` WHERE `full_name`='$loggedin')or die (mysql_error()); while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)){ echo ' '; } But I am having no luck with that! I'm very unsure of what I should do. I want it to display another with an and the link plus name of the link for each row found. Thanks! Please be specific with me, as this is new ground! :D EDIT: I have also run into another problem. I have used code from peoples' answers and most of them work. However, If one of the fields is blank (so a user has only 6 quick links) it still shows an . Now I can't see anyway round this issue. :/ SOLUTION: Here is what works: while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)){ for($i = 1; $i '; echo $row[$i . 'name']; echo ' '; } //end of didn't trim }//end for for }//end of while
