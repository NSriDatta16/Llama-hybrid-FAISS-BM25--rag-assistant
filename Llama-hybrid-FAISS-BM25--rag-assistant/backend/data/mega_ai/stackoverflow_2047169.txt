ad 1. I think that it is not possible but I am not sure ad 2. Yes, you can use parameter but pay attention on it because it is constant. All variables and parameters in XSL are constants. Look at W3School - variable cite: Once you have set a variable's value, you cannot change or modify that value! The same thing is for parameters. You can call template with ( constant ) parameter: Look at W3School - with parameter it is really good reference page.
