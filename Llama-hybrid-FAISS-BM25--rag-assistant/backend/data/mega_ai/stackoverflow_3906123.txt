First of all, prcomp does a principal component analysis. A principal component analysis makes as many components as there are variables. What you're looking for, is a factor analysis: ff see ?factanal If you want to keep only the first 20 principal components as a new dataset, you can easily select them from the predict() function. Or even calculate them yourself : x But be aware of the fact that a factor analysis reducing your dataset to 20 factors is NOT the same as keeping the first 20 principal components of a PCA.
