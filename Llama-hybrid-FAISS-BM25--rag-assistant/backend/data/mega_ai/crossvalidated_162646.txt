Averaging ROC curves over folds in cross-validation

I have data from 10-fold cross-validation experiment: for each fold I have a predictor and a response variable so I can generate ROC curve and compute area under the ROC curve. I have a series of three such experiments, so in general I can generate 30 ROC curves. I wonder if anybody has an idea how to average ROC curves over 10 folds for each experiment and then test if differences between three averaged ROC curves are statistically significant.
