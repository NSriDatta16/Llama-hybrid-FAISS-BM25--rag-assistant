You can't avoid the inconsistencies you are worried about just by using a ConcurrentDictionary . You need something much, much stronger and robust to guarantee that. Ask yourself if you really need that level of consistency before embarking on solving the problem. Dragons be there. To repeat myself a little differently: ConcurrentDictionary only ensures multiple threads hitting the dictionary won't muck it up. It doesn't guarantee anything about consistency of the values when pulled successively by multiple threads. It can't keep you from shooting yourself in the foot.
