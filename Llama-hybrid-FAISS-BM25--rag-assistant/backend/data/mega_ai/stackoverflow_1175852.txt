If deployment is a concern, you could always embed an XML file inside your assembly. This allows you that same level of constantness, as users will not be able to muck around with the data. Any file can be embedded as a resource using VS, just add the file to the project and select: Build Action => Embedded Resource from the properties. Then on startup you could call: // name is the name of the embedded resource Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(name); To get a stream to the embedded data. The advantage of this approach is that you can keep your constant data in whatever format you want, which would make maintenance much easier. On startup you can do all the indexing and organisation so the data has a proper API.
