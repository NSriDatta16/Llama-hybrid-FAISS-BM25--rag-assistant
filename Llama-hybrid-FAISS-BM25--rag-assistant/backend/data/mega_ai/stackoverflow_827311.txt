It looks like the file might have been generated by VisualWorks Smalltalk: [BOSS 7.5] Contains the Binary Object Streaming Service, which supports efficient storage and retrieval of objects, including code, to and from files. Note that for code storage, the parcel system now supercedes BOSS. I tried to load the file using the IDE provided at http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/ and it generated a meaningful exception: The identifier MediaCollectionDictionary has no binding The file does contain: MediaCollectionDictionary MediaCollection* CallMediaVehDict2 etc which means, if I could now figure out what the rest of the files do and learn enough SmallTalk, I could disentangle this mess. Of course, I am not sure if this analysis is correct. So, please if you have any other ideas, let me know. Thank you. Much later: So, my initial assessment seems to be correct. I got some useful tips on comp.lang.smalltalk: http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.smalltalk/browse_thread/thread/5d55d857e2f80158#
