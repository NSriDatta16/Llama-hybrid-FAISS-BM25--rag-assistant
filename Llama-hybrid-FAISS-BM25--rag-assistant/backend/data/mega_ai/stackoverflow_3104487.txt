Is To Manually Assign An Entity's IDs A Good Idea?

We're developing a system to replace an old application from our clients. Actually there are many entities (like merchants, salesmen, products, etc) that must have a manual assigned ID -so they can be integrated with other existing systems. i.e. accounting. We think the best solution is simply allow the user to assign the entities IDs manually when the entity is being created; we're going to suggest him the next available ID, and the user will be able to change it if they want. no updates allowed! (muahahaha) We'll be glad to hear your thoughts about. Pros / Cons Thanks in advance :) PD: Do you know any documentation about? -Entities and IDs- UPDATES We think there should be cases when this applies and do not. so... Additionally there are cases when the client literally wants that a given entity has an Id they bring. organization internal codes I think.
