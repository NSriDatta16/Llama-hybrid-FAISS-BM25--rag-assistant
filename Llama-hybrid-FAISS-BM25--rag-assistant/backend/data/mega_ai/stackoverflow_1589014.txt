This code is valid and standard compliant. String literals are stored in read-only memory, and the function just gets the address of the chosen string. C++ standard (2.13.4) says : An ordinary string literal has type “array of n const char” and static storage duration They key to understand your problem here, is the static storage duration : string literals are allocated when your program launch, and last for the duration of the program. Your function just gets the address and returns it.
