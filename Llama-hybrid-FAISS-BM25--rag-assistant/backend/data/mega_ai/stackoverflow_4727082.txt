Obviously cookies have been around a long time and are a proven approach to this scenario, but what about isolated storage? Is it going to work for all browsers and in all environments? Ah - .NET isolated storage is SERVER SIDE. Like a database. It is meant as a small way to store small amounts of data( ONE user, not all users, viewstate) on the side the .NET application runs (in asp.net case = the server). As such it is totally irrelvant to your question. Put the data in a database. I know of VERY few usages of isolated stoage for ASP.NET applications, it craetes a TON of long term problems. It is not meant for server side apps.
