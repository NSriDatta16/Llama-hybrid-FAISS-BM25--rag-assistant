How to handle a highly right skewed dataset without 'hurting' it too much?

I have a freemium mobile app usage dataset. I want to perform a regression with the average spending per month (continuous) as a dependent, and if they came via referral program (binary) as the independent variable. However, the average spendings per month are highly right skewed (lots of 'minnows', only a few 'whales'). I've read about methods like winsorizing or log-transformation - however, also about the critics. As it is the nature of the freemium business, I don't want to winsorize or trim too much. Is there anything I can do with a non-naturally distributed and heteroscedastic dataset? Any experiences?
