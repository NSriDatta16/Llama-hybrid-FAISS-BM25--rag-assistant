If you want to compute the expected value, just compute : E(X) = Integral of xf(x)dx over the whole domain of X. The integration can easily be done using the function integrate(). Say you're having a normal density function (you can easily define your own density function) : f You calculate the expected value simply by: f2 Pay attention, sometimes you need to use Vectorize() for your function. This is necessary to get integrate to work. For more info, see the help pages of integrate() and Vectorize().
