What is the mean average of $y=kg^t$ from $t=a$ to $t=b$

Mean average of $y$ in $y=kg^t$ from $t=a$ to $t=b$ . $g$ is a constant, $t$ varies. I have looked this up in textbooks and online and all I can find is the mean average of a function where $t$ is a constant and $g$ is variable. But that is not what I want. Some approximation clearly shows that the mean average is not the value of the mid-point where $t=(a+b)/2$ . My calculus is too basic to solve this.
