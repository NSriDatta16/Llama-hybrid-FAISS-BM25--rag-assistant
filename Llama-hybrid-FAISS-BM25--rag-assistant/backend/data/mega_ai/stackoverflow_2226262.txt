In terms of performance, my understanding is that exceptions actually reduce the size and increase the performance of the normal execution paths of code, but make the exceptional/error paths more expensive. (often a lot more expensive). So if your only concern is performance, I would say don't worry about later. If today's CPU can handle it, then tomorrows will as well. However . In my opinion, exceptions are one of those features that require programmers to be smarter all of the time than programmers can be reasonably be expected to be. So I say - if you can stay away from exception based code. Stay away. Have a look at Raymond Chen's Cleaner, more elegant, and harder to recognize . He says it better than I could.
