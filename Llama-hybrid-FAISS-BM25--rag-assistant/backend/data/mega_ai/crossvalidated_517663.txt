Can diagnostic accuracy measures be used in case-control studies?

I want to assess the predictive ability of biomarkers in a nested case-control study. The primary analysis with use conditional regression. I’d some questions: 1)Can I determine the AUC, sensitivity and specificity for the biomarkers? I’ve seen it done before using standard logistic regression adjusted for the matching variables to generate the probabilities. 2)I would like to examine prediction of an outcome which wasn’t used for the matching using the full population, should this be done using conditional or standard logistic regression? My understanding is that subgroups should use standard logistic regression.
