Can my build stipulate that my code coverage never get worse?

I am using hudson CI to manage a straight java web project, using ant to build. I would like to mandate that the unit test coverage never be worse than the previous build, thereby making sure any new code is always tested, or at least the coverage is continually improving. Is there a hudson plugin that works this way? Edit: I am currently using Emma, but would be willing to switch to another coverage app. Also, as a clarification, I've seen the thresholds in some Hudson plugins, but that's not exactly what I'm after. For example what I'd like is that if coverage for Build #12 was 46% overall, and someone checked in Build #13 with 45% coverage, the build would break. The reason I want to do this, is that I have a codebase with low test coverage. We don't have time to go back and retroactively write unit tests, but I'd like to make sure that the coverage keeps getting better. UPDATE: Dan pointed out an edge case with my plan that will definitely be a problem. I think I need to rethink whether this is even a good idea.
