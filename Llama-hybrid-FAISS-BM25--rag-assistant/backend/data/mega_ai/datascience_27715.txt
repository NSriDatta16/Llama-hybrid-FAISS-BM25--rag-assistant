Using Generative Adversarial Network to generate Single Image

Most generative adversarial networks learn the distribution of the dataset and then generate a sample of 10's to 100's of images with similar distributions. I am curious if there is any research regenerating a single image. I have looked into Super Resolution GAN's and they somewhat model this. They try to estimate a highly resolved image from its lower resolution counterpart. Could that be used to recreate an image? Thanks for the help.
