Winsock alternative (no, not WinPCAP)

Are there any viable alternatives to Winsock for C++? The reason I need of is because Winsock's raw sockets are not behaving properly (no, this is not fixable, don't waste your time asking) and WinPCAP can only monitor network traffic, not actually receive packets. I need something that can receive complete packets including any IP, UDP, TCP headers, etc. Does such a thing exist, and if not, why not?
