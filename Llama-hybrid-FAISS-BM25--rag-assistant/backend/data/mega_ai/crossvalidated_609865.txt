Can I calculate ROC AUC from Mann Whitney U tests when I am comparing unequal sample sizes?

I know I am able to calculate Mann Whitney U tests when comparing 2 samples unequal inside but I am wondering if I am able to carry this same principle when calculating ROC AUC via the formula: AUC = U / (n1*n2) where U is the U statistic, n1 is number of positive examples, and n2 is the number of negative examples I am trying to compare test scores by disease status and, ideally, want to be able to say something about discrimination, beyond just association. For example, I have 525 cases and 1770 controls. With a p-value of 0.5, I know that there is no association between the test scores and disease status. But with a U statistic of 471313.5, would it be valid to calculate AUC = 471313.5 / (525*1770) = 0.5071977 and conclude that the test has poor discrimination this disease? I scanned through some papers and StackExchange posts but was unable to find much about the assumptions of the AUC/MWU relationship when it comes to sample size. It was only brought to my attention as a potential issue when I...consulted ChatGPT.
