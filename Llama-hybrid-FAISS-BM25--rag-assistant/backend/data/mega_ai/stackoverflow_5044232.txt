What do lockFocus and unlockFocus actually do?

Warning: I'm a Cocoa newbie. I'm reading "Cocoa Programming For Mac OS X" by Hillegass. On p.301 it's written: To make the drawing appear on the image instead of on the screen, you must first lock focus on the image. When the drawing is complete, you must unlock focus. The code I have, inside -(void)mouseDragged:(NSEvent *)theEvent of an NSView is as follows: [resizedImage lockFocus]; [sourceImage drawInRect: NSMakeRect(0, 0, resizeWidth, resizeHeight) fromRect: NSMakeRect(0, 0, originalSize.width, originalSize.height) operation: NSCompositeSourceOver fraction: 1.0]; [resizedImage unlockFocus]; Without the lock/unlock, this does not work, but I still don't understand exactly what is going on. I see that the 2nd line of code has no mention of resizedImage so does that mean when I use lockFocus it makes sure any 'drawing' that happens takes place there? Could someone explain this better?
