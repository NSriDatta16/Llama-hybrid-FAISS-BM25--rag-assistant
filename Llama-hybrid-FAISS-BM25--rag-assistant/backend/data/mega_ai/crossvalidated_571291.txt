'ar' part of model in not stationary error

I have been trying to plot a time series model for the equation $X_t = 0.5 X_{t-1} + 0.5 X_{t-2} + \epsilon_t$ set.seed(87364) series5 But I keep getting this error: Error in arima.sim(n = 1000, list(order = c(1, 0, 0), ar = c(0.5, 0.5)), : 'ar' part of model is not stationary Could someone please help me figure this out? I'm totally new to time series modelling in R
