convert time series data set to supervised for deep learining

I have dataset like so I want to use that for prediction of time series with deep learning. I have this function to make it supervised def to_supervised(train,n_input,n_out): #falten data data=train X,y=list(),list() in_start=0 for _ in range(len(data)): in_end=in_start+ n_input out_end=in_end + n_out if out_end I am not sure about functionality of this function. Do you have replacemment for this function?
