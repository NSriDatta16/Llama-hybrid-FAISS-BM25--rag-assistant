ID=99(?!\d) (?!\d) is a negative lookahead ; it asserts that either the next character is not a digit or there is no next character. You didn't say what regex flavor you're using, but most of the so-called Perl-compatible flavors support lookaheads. As for learning resources, the tutorial at regular-expressions.info is a great place to start. For advanced study, the Goyvaerts-Levithan book recommended by others is excellent, but Mastering Regular Expressions is still the best. Get both if you can afford them; you won't regret it. EDIT: To be on the safe side, you might want to use \bID=99(?!\d) to avoid matching something like FOO_ID=99 .
