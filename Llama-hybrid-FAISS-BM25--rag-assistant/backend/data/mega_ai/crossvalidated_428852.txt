How to set a lower limit @ 95% CL for a measurement

I have a result of a measurement, A(1.029) Â± s(0.048), where s is one standard deviation. In a theory, A is restricted to be in range of [0,1]. The question is what is the correct way to set a lower limit on A at 95% Confidence level? A similar discussion: Can one-sided confidence intervals have 95% coverage Thanks, MJK
