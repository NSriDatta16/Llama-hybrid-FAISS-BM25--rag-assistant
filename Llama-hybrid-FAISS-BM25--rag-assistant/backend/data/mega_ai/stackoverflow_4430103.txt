I agree with @Kirk Broadhurst that this is technically a bug, as the result of sqrt(4)-2 is strictly 0, while Calc gives a different (albeit extremely close) result. The fact that usually we can live with this imprecision is irrelevant here. Strictly speaking, the programmers should have seeked different approaches for solving this kind of problems. IMHO, what many people here fail to see is that 4 and 2 are precisely representable in IEEE floating point format. Being a natural power of 2 makes it representable to infinite precision, so the arguments blaming the FP format are irrelevant as well. The problem comes from the sqrt() function algorithm and not from the FP storage format.
