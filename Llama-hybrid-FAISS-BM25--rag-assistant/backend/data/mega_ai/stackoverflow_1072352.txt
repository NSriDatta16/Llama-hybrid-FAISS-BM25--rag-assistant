Instead of using the navigation controller's toolbar, add one directly to the window and resize the navigation controller's view's frame to avoid it. That single global toolbar will then always be visible. If you're using the Navigation-based Application template, and are using Interface Builder, the following steps should do it: Open up your app delegate's .h file. Add an IBOutlet UIToolbar * toolbar; to the app delegate's instance variables. Switch to the .m file. Find the line that reads [window addSubview:[navigationController view]]; and add after it: CGRect frame = navigationController.view.frame; frame.size.height -= toolbar.frame.size.height; navigationController.view.frame = frame; Add code to release toolbar in the -dealloc method. Open MainWindow.xib. Open the window. Drag a toolbar onto the bottom of the window. Connect the toolbar to the app delegate's toolbar outlet Now set up the toolbarâ€”add whatever items you need to it, then create whatever outlets and actions you need in the app delegate and connect them. Since the toolbar is part of the window, not part of the navigation controller, the navigation controller shouldn't touch it.
