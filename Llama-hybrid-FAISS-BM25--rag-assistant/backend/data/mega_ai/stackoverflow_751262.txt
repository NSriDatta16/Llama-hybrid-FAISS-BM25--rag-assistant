RadGrid losing track of current Edit Item after insert operation on DataSource

I have a RadGrid bound to a LinqDataSource. The grid has auto generated Edit and Delete columns. It displays a simple table without any hierarchical organization. I am taking the following steps. Populate a RadGrid using a LinqDataSource Click Edit on the last row of the grid From another control on the page, update the linqdatasource and call rebind on the grid The grid loses track of the current editing item, and opens a different item in edit mode Please help.
