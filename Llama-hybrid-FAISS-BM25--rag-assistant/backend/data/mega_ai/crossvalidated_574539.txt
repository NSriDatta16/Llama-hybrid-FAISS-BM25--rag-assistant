Since you mention probabilities, I assume you are thinking about a binary classification, in which case the trees all operate in the log-odds space, the $x$ s in your notation. So the $\hat{y}$ and $f_t$ are actually log-odds not probabilities. See also What is the "binary:logistic" objective function in XGBoost?
