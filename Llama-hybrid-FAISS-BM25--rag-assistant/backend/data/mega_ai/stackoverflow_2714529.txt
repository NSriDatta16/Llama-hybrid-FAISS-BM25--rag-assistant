When i need to model simple things, bring them to memory and manipulate them, i usually create classes that represent each table in the database, that is, table person, class Person. With some code you can leverage a solution like that, but it is still "dirty". I'm discovering the power of ORM (object-relational mappings) and you can take a look at NHibernate, Fluent Hibernate, among others.
