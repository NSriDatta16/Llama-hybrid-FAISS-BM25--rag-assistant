java: sampleoutofbounds exception

I am writing a program for school that reduces noise in a sound file. So far i have written this code which I think takes n number of samples before a set one and n after and then averages the two. My problem is that everytime my second for loop runs i get a sampleoutofboundexception. I am guessing this means that it cant find the sample that i am asking it to look for, but i dont understand why. for (int s = 0; s = -level; j--){ sSize2 = aSound.getSample(j).getValue(); total1 = total1 + sSize2; } avg = (total1 + total) / level*2; for (int i = 0; i I get the error every single time this line is run and I can't understand why. any help? thank you sSize2 = aSound.getSample(j).getValue();
