References showing that, in general, detecting interactions in linear and logistic regression models requires larger samples sizes than main effects

I have always been told that we need larger sample sizes to obtain the same power compared to main effects. Previous posts here confirm that: Why is power to detect interactions less than that for main effects? Do you know by heart any published references (e.g., peer-reviewed articles, book chapters)?
