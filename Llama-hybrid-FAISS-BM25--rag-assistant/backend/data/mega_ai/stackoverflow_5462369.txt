FileNotFoundException while getting the InputStream during downloading file to SD card using URLConnection

I'm working on application which has workflow like this: 1.parsing home page (using HttpURLConnection, connect(), do stuff, disconnect(), use data), 2.after click on links I made, parsing article or download file based on link. First step works perfect & 2nd too in case of article, but when I'm trying to download file from specific url and save it to SD card, I got fileNotFoundException in this line: InputStream inputStream = urlConnection.getInputStream(); My guide for doing it (downloading file) was code explained here http://goo.gl/GTBOP and I set permissions in manifest as required for this action, plus before any download operation I checked MEDIA_MOUNTED & MEDIA_MOUNTED_READ_ONLY state and it seems like that fits nice. So..I read a lot about this problem on stackOverflow and other places and I tried different suggestions like adding these: urlConnection.setRequestProperty("User-Agent","Mozilla/5.0 ( compatible ) "); urlConnection.setRequestProperty("Accept","*/*"); or System.setProperty("http.keepAlive", "false"); but with no success. I'm still stucked with fileNotFoundException. I tried to catch response code from webpage and it says 404.. ?! It's strange that if I hardcode link to file for downloading from any other site it downloads file without any troubles. So to make it clear I pickup clicked link to fileurl variable but in a next step I just say fileurl="somesite/somefile.ext" everything goes smooth.. From web browser I can download any file that make troubles in my application so I'm confused where is the problem.. Any suggestion please..? 10q
