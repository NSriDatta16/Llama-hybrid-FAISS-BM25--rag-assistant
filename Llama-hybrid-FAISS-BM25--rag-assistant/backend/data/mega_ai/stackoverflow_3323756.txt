In Java (and some other languages), you still use the for keyword for a "for each" loop: for (String s : myListOfString) { // code code code } So you might want to rephrase the question, but if you mean "do you think we'll stop using for (int i=0; i loops, then you might definitely be right. In Python, the equivalent of for (int i=0; ... loops ( for i in range(len(myList)) ) is discouraged for iterating over a collection (see delnan's comment -- well put), more or less for the reasons you mentioned in your original question.
