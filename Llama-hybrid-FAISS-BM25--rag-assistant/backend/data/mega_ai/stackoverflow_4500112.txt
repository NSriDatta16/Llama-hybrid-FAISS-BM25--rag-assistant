To quote the similar discussion on the Sitepoint forums . It's the caching, if you select no-cache IE can't find the file to save it, but if you allow caching it works. Annoying as the same file can be downloaded at different times and may well be different if things have changed, so caching is a little dangerous (I'll have to suffix the filename with a timestamp to avoid this, I think). http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316431 so this fixes it Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Private); but it still doesn't explain why it sometimes works, esp directly from the web page link "This behaviour is by design" - translation "we can't get this to work and CBA to get it working" - amazing how firefox, opera and chrome don't have this problem......
