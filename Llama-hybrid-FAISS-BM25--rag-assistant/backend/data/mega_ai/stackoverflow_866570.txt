No, its easy to do this. In Xcode, set the Active Configuration to Release. Change the device from Simulator to Device - whatever SDK. If you want to directly export to your iPhone, connect it to your computer. Press Build and Go. If your iPhone is not connected to your computer, a message will come up saying that your iPhone is not connected. If this applies to you: (iPhone was not connected) Go to your projects folder and then to the build folder inside. Go to the Release-iphoneos folder and take the app inside, drag and drop on iTunes icon. When you sync your iTouch device, it will copy it to your device. It will also show up in iTunes as a application for the iPhone. Hope this helps! P.S.: If it says something about a certificate not being valid, just click on the project in Xcode, the little project icon in the file stack to the left, and press Apple+I, or do Get Info from the menu bar. Click on Build at the top. Under Code Signing, change Code Signing Identity - Any iPhone OS Device to be Don't Sign.
