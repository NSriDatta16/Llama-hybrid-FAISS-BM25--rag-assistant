This answer considers another approach to the case where you want to force the variates to lie in a specified range and additionally dictate the mean and/or variance. Restrict our attention to the unit interval $[0,1]$. Let's use a weighted mean for generality, so fix some weights $w_k\in[0,1]$ with $\sum_{k=1}^Nw_k=1$, or set $w_k=1/N$ if you want standard weighting. Suppose the quantities $\mu\in(0,1)$ and $0 First we draw some variates $y_1,...,y_N$ from any distribution, like $N(0,1)$. This distribution will affect the shape of the final distribution. Then we constrain them to the unit interval $[0,1]$ using a logistic function: $$ x_k=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(y_k v-h)}} $$ Before we do that, however, as seen in the equation above, we transform the $y_k$'s with the translation $h$ and scale $v$. This is analogous to the first equation in @Macro's answer. The trick is now to choose $h$ and $v$ so that the transformed variables $x_1,...,x_N$ have the desired moment(s). That is, we require one or both of the following to hold: $$ \mu=\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{w_k}{1+e^{-(y_k v-h)}} \\ \sigma^2=\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{w_k}{(1+e^{-(y_k v-h)})^2} - \left( \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{w_k}{1+e^{-(y_k v-h)}} \right)^2 $$ Inverting these equations for $v$ and $h$ analytically is not feasible, but doing so numerically is straight forward, especially since derivatives with respect to $v$ and $h$ are easy to compute; it only takes a few iterations of Newton's method. As a first example, let's say we only care about constraining the weighted mean and not the variance. Fix $\mu=0.8$, $v=1$, $w_k=1/N$, $N=200000$. Then for the underlying distributions $N(0,1)$, $N(0,0.1)$ and $\text{Unif}(0,1)$ we end up with the following histograms, respectively, and such that the mean of the variates is exactly $0.8$ (even for small $N$): Next, let's constrain both the mean and variance. Take $\mu=0.2$, $w_k=1/N$, $N=2000$ and consider the three desired standard deviations $\sigma=0.1,0.05,0.01$. Using the same underlying distribution $N(0,1)$, here are the histograms for each: Note that these may look a bit beta-distributed, but they are not.
