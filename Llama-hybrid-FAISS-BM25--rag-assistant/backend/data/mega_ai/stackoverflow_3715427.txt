how to create static lib and include in other xcode projects as well??

I am trying to make static lib but no success. I followed him http://blog.stormyprods.com/2008/11/using-static-libraries-with-iphone-sdk.html but of no use. According to him drag class file in static lib and then delete so what's the point of dragging?? After my lib is generated I am getting error ld: library not found for -ltestlib collect2: ld returned 1 exit status Command /Developer/xcode3.2/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 failed with exit code 1 Please help me from scratch as how to generate and use static library using xcode. Thanks.
