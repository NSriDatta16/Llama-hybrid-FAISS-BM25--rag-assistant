NoSQL (sometimes expanded to "not only sql ") is a broad class of database management systems that differ from the classic model of the relational database management system ( rdbms ) in some significant ways. NoSQL systems: Specifically designed for high load Natively support horizontal scalability Fault-tolerant Store data in a denormalized manner Do not usually enforce strict database schema Do not usually store data in a table Sometimes provide eventual consistency instead of ACID transactions In contrast to RDBMS, NoSQL systems: Do not guarantee data consistency Usually support a limited query language (a subset of SQL or another custom query language) May not provide support for transactions/distributed transactions Do not usually use some advanced concepts of RDBMS, such as triggers, views, stored procedures NoSQL implementations can be categorized by their manner of implementation: Column-oriented Document store Graph Key-value store Multivalue databases Object databases Time Series Triplestore Tuple store Free NoSQL Books RavenDB: Inside RavenDB CouchDB: The Definitive Guide DBA's Guide to NoSQL and Apache Cassandra The Little MongoDB Book The Little Redis Book Related tags ravendb nosql-aggregation oracle-nosql mongodb neo4j arangodb redis
