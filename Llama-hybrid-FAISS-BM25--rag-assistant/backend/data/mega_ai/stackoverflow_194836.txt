What is the code-coverage percentage on your project?

What is the % code-coverage on your project? I'm curious as to reasons why. Is the dev team happy with it? If not, what stands in the way from increasing it? Stuart Halloway is one whose projects aim for 100% (or else the build breaks!). Is anyone at that level? We are at a painful 25% but aspire to 80-90% for new code. We have legacy code that we have decided to leave alone as it evaporates (we are actively re-writing).
