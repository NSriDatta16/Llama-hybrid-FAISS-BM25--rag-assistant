I think the best way forward at this point is to decide where you want to specialize, start reading academic articles from the top journals, and familiarizing yourself with the methods you encounter. If you want to go medical, read the biostatistics journals like biometrika. If you want to go finance/econ, read econometrika. Other topics in statistics Generalized linear models Stochastic processes and time series Bayesian probability and estimation Semiparametric estimation theory (Cox models, sandwich estimators, quasilikelihood) Nonparametric estimation theory (minimax, smoothing) Survival analysis Survey design Power analysis, simulation, and so on Other great books McCullogh & Nelder: Generalized Linear Models. Boos and Stefanski: Essential Statistical Inference. Wakefield: Frequentist and Bayesian Regression Models. Agresti: Categorical Data Analysis. Hosmer Lemeshow: Logistic Regression Models, Hosmer Lemeshow & May Survival Analysis. Diggle Heagerty Liang & Zeger: Longitudinal Data Analysis. Sheldon Ross: Probability Models. Ferguson: A Course in Large Sample Theory.
