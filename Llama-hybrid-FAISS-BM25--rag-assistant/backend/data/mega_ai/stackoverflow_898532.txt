MySQL docs mention "MySQL performs rounding when storing values" and I suspect this is the issue here. I duplicated your issue but changed the storage type to be DOUBLE: CREATE TABLE test (val, DOUBLE); and the retrieved value matched the test value you provided. My suggestion, for what it's worth, is use DOUBLE or maybe DECIMAL. I tried the same original test with: CREATE TABLE test (val, DECIMAL(8,2)); and it retrieved the value I gave it: 858147.11.
