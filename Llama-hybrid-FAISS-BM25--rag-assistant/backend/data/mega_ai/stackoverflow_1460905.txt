I think you might be looking to use the Containable behavior. That will let you specify conditions that will apply to the model's data retrievals. I can't quite discern the rest of your code, as the formatting didn't make it from the OP very well, but I think your conditions are limited to form_id=$formid, right? I'd suggest (before that line) dynamically attaching a Containable behavior that limits the forms to just $formid. I'm not 100% that this is what you're after, but I might be understanding the question incorrectly.
