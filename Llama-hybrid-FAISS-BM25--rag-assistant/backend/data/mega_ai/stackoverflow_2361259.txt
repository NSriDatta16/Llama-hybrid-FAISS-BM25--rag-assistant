It could be virtual address space fragmentation. One way to check is to call HeapCompact(GetProcessHeap(), 0) . If that frees up enough memory, then that's the likely cause. Another similar cause would be launching from the debugger; that causes Windows to use the debug heap, which has really really bad memory behavior over a long period of time. To disable that behavior, set _NO_DEBUG_HEAP=1 in the environment and run.
