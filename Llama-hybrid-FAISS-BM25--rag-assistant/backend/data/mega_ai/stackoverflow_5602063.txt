You can't use one comparator to sort by two criteria at the same time, so there is no real way to go better than two TreeSets in your case. Of course, you can wrap them in one data structure. (Alternatively you could use two HashMaps, each having one of the strings as key - this will be faster on average, but is more complicated to program.)
