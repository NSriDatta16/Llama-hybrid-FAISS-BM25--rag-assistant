Multiple Logistic regression with binary random variables

I am attempting to do logistic regression on a data set of patients. The dependent variable is disease status (binary, yes or no). There are multiple independent variables some binary such as susceptibility gene (y/n) and others continuous such as patient age. When I have looked up logistic regression, in all the books I have read the examples given always have all the independent variables being continuous. Therefore is it mathematically valid for me to do logistic regression on my data set with continuous and binary random variables? Or is there an alternative regression model I should use?
