Create A Product Review In Magento

I am trying to import product reviews from an older site to our new Magento site. I am having troubles trying to create the actual product review in a script. Has anyone tried doing this before and know how to accomplish this? It looks like reviews use the entity models and I can't seem to get the review object to do what I want it to do. Here is what I have tried doing so far and its throwing back some an error about foreign keys not being respected. Not sure how to make this work. Any help would be appreciated. $review = Mage::getModel('review/review'); $review->setEntityPkValue(141292); $review->setStatusId(1); $review->setTitle("This is an inserted title"); $review->setDetail("This is an inserted detail"); $review->setNickname("First Last"); $review->save();
