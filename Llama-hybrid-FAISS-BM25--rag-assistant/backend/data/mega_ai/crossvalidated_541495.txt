If it takes the sensor 10s to achieve a reliable measurement and it gives an output each second, there is probably already an internal (physical) smoothing in place. In this case, an additional smoothing would not be necessary or useful. If the sensor gives you the raw data every second but the producer specified that a 99% reliable measurement would take 10 seconds, then you have to compute a moving average over 10s to get the correct readings. In this case, the peaks might be unreliable outliers, so it would be bad to preserve them. If you are unsure, a little experimentation would be in order. Heat up something to a certain temperature, set up the sensor in a controllable environment and expose it to 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s of heat from this source, always giving it 30s of cooldown time after exposure. Note the exact timestamps on which you exposed it. Then, look at the data stream and adjust the post-processing (moving average, window position, peak retainment) so it matches the actual series of events best.
