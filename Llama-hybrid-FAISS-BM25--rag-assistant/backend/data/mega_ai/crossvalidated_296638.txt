I suspect what would be more helpful than trying to learn a bunch of analyses in R or Python would be to determine the kind of analyses that you would be likely to perform in this position. Understand what the organization does, what kind of data they are likely to have, and how you could benefit the organization by bringing your skills. Maybe try to think in terms of broad categories of data science. Like performing simple tests and regressions on small data sets, data mining, or machine learning. Which would be applicable for this organization? Also, if there is a certain subject matter, looking up the R packages in that field are helpful to get a sense of what kinds of issues that field deals with. R has packages that are specific for e.g. psychology, fisheries, economics, or agriculture. They really do use approaches specific for their field. What is the organization trying to accomplish with this position, and how can you help them accomplish this? Is it about improving profitability, reducing workplace accidents, improving marketing, scientific research? What question would help achieve this, what data would you need, how would you get the data, what analysis would you perform? I think you will have to think through these questions to have sense of where to begin whatsoever. There are simply too many types of analyses too learn and too many packages available in R to try to learn it all without narrowing down what you are trying to learn about. It might also be helpful to look up in what situations people use R and in which people use Python. You might also think about how you would work with others in the organization, and your philosophy on testing code, making readable code, having code double-checked by others. I believe there was some discussion on these topics in the July 23, 2017 and July 16, 2017 episodes of this podcast: Linear Digressions podcast .
