Searching for an appropriate data set for my needs I have just stumbled across two sites that are pertinent to this discussion. Datacite.org which describes itself as... We are an international organisation which aims to: establish easier access to research data increase acceptance of research data as legitimate contributions in the scholarly record, and to support data archiving to permit results to be verified and re-purposed for future study. DataBib.org which describes itself as... Databib is a tool for helping people identify and locate online repositories of research data. Users and bibliographers create and curate records that describe data repositories that users can search. Thought it would be worth adding it to the list here for others. Now to find something within its links that fits my needs!
