Enabling tabs in xcode? Or lessening the pain of not having them?

I am currently using xcode and I find it's lack of tabs quite disturbing. I currently use command-shift-d to search through all the files, or ctrl-1 to open the history of files that were recently opened. It works but I find it less effective than just tabbing through the few files i am currently working on. Is there any way, third party or not, to enable some sort of tabbed organization? If not, is there any other way to quickly navigate through a subset of files?
