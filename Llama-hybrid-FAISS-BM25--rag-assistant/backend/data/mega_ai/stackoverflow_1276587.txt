how to create custom sections in a tableview based on coredata entities

I'm just starting to learn coredata. In my core data model I have a date stamp (of type NSDate) which includes the date and time (I need this information). Now I would like to organize the Core Data table into sections by days. How can I do this. The only samples I found directly use a core data entity to create the sections, in this case this gives me a section for every entry in the table. Any help would be very welcome, especially with a code sample.
