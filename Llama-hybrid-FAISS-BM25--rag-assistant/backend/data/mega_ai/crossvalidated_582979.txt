(1) This is correct because the total loss function is $$L=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n L_i$$ This is even sometimes defined as the sum of losses, not the average. Differentiation simply spreads over the sum/average. (2) You have a mistake in differentiation (in single sample case as well). If you have a function $f(x,y)$ and you want to differentiate $f$ wrt another variable $t$ , the chain rule is as follows: $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$$ Using this, your chain rule for the single sample case should have been written as follows: $$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{mn}}=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial L}{\partial o_i}\frac{\partial o_i}{\partial w_{mn}}=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{10}\frac{\partial (o_i-y_i)^2}{\partial o_i}\frac{\partial o_i}{\partial w_{mn}}$$ because $L$ is a function of $o_i$ , $i\in \{1,2...10\}$ . So, you can't get away with only $o_1$ . If you reflect this into the mini-batch formula, you can't get away with only $o_{11}$ either. The differentiation should include all of them.
