You could look at some of the work being done with Self-Organizing maps (Kohonen's neural network method)... the guys at Vienna University of Technology have done some work on distributed calculation of their growing hierarchical map algorithm. This is a little on the edge of your clustering question, so it may not help, but I can't think of anything closer ;)
