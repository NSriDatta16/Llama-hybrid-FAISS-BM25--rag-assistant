{embed="shared/head"} - include the template head from the template group shared if the URI segment (EE/CI works with segments eg site.com/segment1/segment2/xxx) is empty (you are on the home page (www.site.com), then add no body class. else, the user is on a page (in EE this is a template group), so set the class to be the name of the template group. site.com/about-us produces class="about-us" - handy for page specific styling. {embed="shared/masthead"} - include masthead and so on. The rest are conditionals to check if the variables have values, and outputs them I presume you're using EE2.0, I'm not sure what {organizaton} is specifically, but that style: {organization} {foo} {/organization} in code igniter at least, is generally the equivalent of a foreach or looping through a recordset: foreach($organizations as $organization) { // do something }
