I changed all four instances of to because self-closing and then having another closing tag didn't seem to make much sense. However, that didn't change anything. You said: children of the child divs (div.collectibleMiniHead) with position: absolute but no left/top values (so relative, really) and I can refactor to use position: relative and it works but this does not make the bug/behaviour go away Simply adding position: relative to div.collectibleMini makes it work as I think you want it to, and doesn't require much work in refactoring. Live Demo (also with self-closing divs fixed) I think I've either elegantly solved your problem, or alternatively I've got completely the wrong end of the stick. Here's hoping for the former!
