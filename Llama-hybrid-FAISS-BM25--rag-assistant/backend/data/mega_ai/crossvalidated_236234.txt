To the good answer of Ilan man I would add that there is a quite straightforward interpretation of your principal components, although in this simple 2D case it doesn't add much to what we could have interpreted just looking at the scatterplot. The first PC is a weighted sum (that is, a linear combination where both coeficients are positive) of temperatura and ice-cream consumption. In the right side you have hot days where a lot of ice-cream is sold, and in the left side you have colder days where less ice-cream is sold. That PC explains most of your variance and the groups you got match those two sides. The second PC measures how temperature and ice-cream consumption moves away from the close linear relation underlined by first PC. In the upper part of the graph we have days with more ice-cream sold compared with other days of the same temperature and in the lower part days with less ice-cream sold than expected according to temperature. That PC explains just a little part of variance. That is, we can tell a story from principal components, although with just two variables it's the same story we could have noticed without PCA. With more variables PCA becomes more useful because it tells stories that would be harder to notice otherwise.
