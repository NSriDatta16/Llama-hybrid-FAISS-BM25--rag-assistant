Given MCMC samples, what are the options for estimating posterior of parameters?

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a class of algorithms for sampling from probability distributions. In the end, given a parametric model explaining the data, MCMC could also be used for parameter estimation, in which case I wonder what the different options for processing MCMC samples are. For monomodal distributions for instance, I can think of averaging the $n$ last samples of a run, averaging the last sample of different MCMC runs. What are the options for estimating posterior of parameters?
