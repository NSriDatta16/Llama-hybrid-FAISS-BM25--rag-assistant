yeah, I'd scale the numbers (0-100)(0-1000) or whatever fixed size you need if you're worried about such things. It also makes for faster math computation in most cases. Back in the bad-old-days, we'd define entire cos/sine tables and other such bleh in integer form to reduce floating fuzz and increase computation speed. I do find it a bit interesting that a "0.7" fuzzes like that on storage.
