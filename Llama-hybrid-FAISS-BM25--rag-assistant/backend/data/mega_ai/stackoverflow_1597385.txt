Mozilla's Rhino JavaScript engine is pretty easy to embed; it allows subclassing of Java classes and implementing interfaces, as well as just doing some quick n' dirty JavaScript object trickery. I've been working on embedding it into GeoServer in my off moments for a couple of months now. You can take a look at both the Java code that embeds Rhino and a few JavaScript examples in our SVN repository. Rhino also has a pretty nice guide to getting started.
