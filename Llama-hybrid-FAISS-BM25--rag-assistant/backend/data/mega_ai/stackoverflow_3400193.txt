When your manager decides which technology you have to use, your manager should be able to understand the technical reasons. Otherwise, he should trust the developers (they have the knowledge to make the decision) to decide. I can think of more useful things for a manager than making technical decisions he does not understand enough. When your boss is like Dilberts pointy haired boss, I would go for the time and money saving argument (for every technical decision the manager wants to be involved in).
