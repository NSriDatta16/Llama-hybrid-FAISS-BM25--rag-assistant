Why am I getting Debug assertion failed after strcpy_s?

im just starting to learn about sockets and i have been given this code, and i have to make the port lookup logic work. But the problem is i keep getting this run time error and I dont know why? // portlookup.cpp // Given a service name, this program displays the corresponding port number. #include #pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32.lib") #include using namespace std; int main (int argc, char **argv) { char service[80]; // This string contains name of desired service struct servent *pse; // pointer to service information entry short port; // Port # (in Network Byte Order) of desired service if (argc s_port; } else { cout
