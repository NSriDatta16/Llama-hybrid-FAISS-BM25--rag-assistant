There's nothing wrong with using typedef s. Good, in fact, in case you need to replace the underlying container later on. One thing that always concerns me with nested map s is to ensure the copy construction of keys and values is efficient, or use single-instance storage ( shared_ptr , for example) to obviate this. Especially if you are doing a lot of inserts/removes, the cost in housekeeping can be heavy.
