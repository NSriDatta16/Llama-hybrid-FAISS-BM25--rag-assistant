I ran across this blog entry that looks like it will work and it uses the Event Handler concept from D2VIANT Answer http://www.dotnetcurry.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=125 Summary: Step 1: Create a new Windows application. Open Visual Studio 2005 or 2008. Go to File > New > Project > Choose Visual Basic or Visual C# in the ‘Project Types’ > Windows Application. Give the project a name and location > OK. Step 2: Add a n ew form to the project. Right click the project > Add > Windows Forms > Form2.cs > Add. Step 3: Now in the Form1, drag and drop a button ‘btnOpenForm’ and double click it to generate an event handler. Write the following code in it. Also add the frm2_FormClosed event handler as shown below: private void btnOpenForm_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { Form2 frm2 = new Form2(); frm2.FormClosed += new FormClosedEventHandler(frm2_FormClosed); frm2.Show(); this.Hide(); } private void frm2_FormClosed(object sender, FormClosedEventArgs e) { this.Close(); }
