One approach is by embedding a TableLayout within another TableLayout's row and putting the header in the preceding row as seen below. Aligning the data and the header requires the layout_width property of the header View objects and the data's View objects to be set to the same dip values. Also, the layout_weight property of the inner TableLayout's View objects must match its corresponding header. Now, in the XML below, I have placed 3 TextViews in the inner TableLayout in a single row to match with the column headers. This is just to show how the alignment can be done. You can populate that data programmatically by inflating a layout and adding it at runtime.
