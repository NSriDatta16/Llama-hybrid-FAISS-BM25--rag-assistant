I faced the same problem today java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: File /test.txt contains a path separator and when i tried the following it worked. File inputFile = new File("/storage/new/test.txt"); FileInputStream isr = new FileInputStream(inputFile); DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(isr); if(!inputFile.exists()){ Log.v("FILE","InputFile not available"); } else { while((line = in.readLine()) != null) { ........ //parse } } (Btw, I was getting this problem outside /root dir and while searching i saw this post)
