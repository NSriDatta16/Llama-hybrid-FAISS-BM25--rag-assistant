Cocoa iPhone SDK development - touchesBegan method not working if the UIImageView has CABasicAnimation attached

I've created a class derived from UIImageView (class name Customer). Within this Customer class I implemented the method "touchesBegan" . Also, I applied a CABasicAnimation to the layer of the Customer class . (the animation simply moves the imageview. it's neccessary because i want to track the animationDidStop event) . the problem is that the touchesBegan doesn't work when i touch the current position of the imageview. it works only when i touch the original frame (where it was created). My suggestion is that touchesBegan not applying on the presentationLayer, but on the original frame . Do you have a way of solving this issue ?? I really would like to solve this from within the Customer class , and not from the main UIViewController . Thanks a lot, Shahar.
