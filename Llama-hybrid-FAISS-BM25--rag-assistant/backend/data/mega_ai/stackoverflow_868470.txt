Implicit conversions, explicit conversions and static_cast are all different things. however, if you can convert implicitly, you can convert explicitly, and if you can convert explicitly, you can cast statically. The same in the other direction is not true, however. There is a perfectly reasonable relationship between implicit casts and static casts. The former is a subset of the the latter. See section 5.2.9.3 of the C++ Standard for details Otherwise, an expression e can be explicitly converted to a type T using a static_cast of the form static_- cast(e) if the declaration T t(e); is well-formed, for some invented temporary variable t (8.5). C++ encourages use of static_casts because it makes the conversion 'visible' in the program. Usage of casts itself indicates some programmer enforced rule which is worth a look so better use static_cast.
