Protecting a Xml file

I'm fairly new to coding, and I just got help figuring out how to create a Xml file; now I want to know, is there a way to protect my Xml file from being edited? I'm making a simple Command Prompt game, and I'm going to include an Xml file for info storage purposes. Although I don't want the user to be able to change the info contained in the file.. Is there a way to achieve this? It doesn't need to be extensive at this time, due to the program only being a small project. Anyway, I'm making the program with Visual Studio Pro 2010, and I'm coding it in C#. Thank you, for any help in advance.
