Thanks to the help of david , I can now answer my question #2: When clicking right mouse button > " Run/Debug Grails Command... " from within NetBeans, simply double-click " interactive " from the list. Then, in the new shell, type the test you want to run without grails . E.g. only test-app unit:spock -coverage ExampleController Everytime you want to execute the test again just hit ENTER within the shell/console. Note that Grails won't be able to handle certain changes correctly. In this case you willl most likely see unexpected exceptions and the like. If that happens, just close the shell , clean the project, rinse & repeat.
