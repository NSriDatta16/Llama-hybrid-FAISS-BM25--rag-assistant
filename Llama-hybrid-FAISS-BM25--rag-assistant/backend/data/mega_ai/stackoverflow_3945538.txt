Parse and change a file line-by-line while preserving EOL characters in Java

One hell of a long question :) Here's how I usually do it: StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder(); BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new StringReader(s)); while ((String line = r.readLine()) != null) b.append(doSomethingToTheString(s) + "\n"); However, this replaces all the new line characters in the file with a line feed, plus it adds one at the end if there wasn't one. What I want is to preserve EOL characters, even if it's mixed up like this: Hello\r\n World\n This is\r Messed up What would be the most elegant/efficient way to do this?
