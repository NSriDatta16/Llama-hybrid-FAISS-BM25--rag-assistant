You could write a filter that stores the current request and response in static ThreadLocal , so that you can use them later from within the same request. You can then implement your own static method forward that uses them and dispatch to another page. This is somehow the approach taken in JSF where FacesContext.getCurrentInstance can be accessed anytime. But I wouldn't qualify that as an elegant design. Rather try to follow @BalusC advice and refactor your logic.
