This isnt so much an answer as a follow up. I am a developer working on a web app that uses aLOT of Flash files, I too keep AS code in separate files (as far as possible). There are PHP files also and some javascript, libraries, graphics etc. I have really just been creating a trunk/branch system on my local drive to avoid breaking older versions and allow me to safely experiment with features etc. This gets busy quickly however. I have been advised to use GIT for source control and can see the benefits of this for larger organisations with more developers, as it is I am a sole developer so really just want a good solution for backup and keeping track of changes I have made. Ive never used GIT before and it seems to have a steep learning curve... so I looked at Adobe Version Cue, much simpler to set up. Has anyone got experience using version cue? Is it easy to revert to previous versions? My main problem with SVN (which Ive used when working in a team of developers) is that it doesn't suit Flash as you have pointed out.
