There are previous results that RNNs are turing complete: Siegelmann 1992 , Korsky 2019 . (They have some slight technical differences). I found this answer which goes into more technical detail about the proof. Turing completeness should be a stronger statement than universal approximation, since there are perfectly computable but unbounded or discontinuous functions. I am aware of the results that any computable real-valued total function is continuous ( see here ). I don't really have the expertise to comment on this, except to say that I'm still sure turing completeness is still strictly more powerful than universal approximation.
