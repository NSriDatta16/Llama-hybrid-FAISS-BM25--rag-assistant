Don't do transformations for error control! Ditch the ANOVA and go with the linear model. Use robust standard errors to account for heteroscedasticity (unequal variances). Adjust for fixed effects for site by creating binary indicators for your three regions. How many observations per site and how many total sites? If the number of sites is relatively large relative to the total number of observations, trust robust standard errors to just give you a population averaged response.
