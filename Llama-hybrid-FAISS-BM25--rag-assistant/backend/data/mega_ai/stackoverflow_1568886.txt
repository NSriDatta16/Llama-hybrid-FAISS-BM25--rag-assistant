MySQL Order by NULL join

I'm trying to do an ORDER BY where I want any rows without an entry in the join table to appear at the bottom of the list and then organised by name. Simplified tables are: users (id, name) photos (id, filename, user_id) So far I have: SELECT name FROM users LEFT OUTER JOIN photos ON photos.user_id = users.id ORDER BY *ANSWER HERE*, name DESC Many thanks.
