What does the csrss.exe process do?

What is the purpose of the csrss.exe (Client/Server Runtime Server Subsystem) on Windows? Maybe someone could give a good explanation or pointers to documentation? Unfortunately Google results are pretty noisy when searching a core process of Windows. The reason I'm asking is that I got a BSOD from my service application which seems to be related to the csrss.exe process, at least this is what the analysis of the memory dump shows: PROCESS_OBJECT: 85eeeb70 IMAGE_NAME: csrss.exe DEBUG_FLR_IMAGE_TIMESTAMP: 0 MODULE_NAME: csrss FAULTING_MODULE: 00000000 PROCESS_NAME: PreviewService.
