Hypothesis testing with exponential distribution

I am stuck trying to solve the following problem I can do the first part, but I am struggling to find the test in the second paragraph. So far I have: $$ L(H_0, H_1) = 3^n\textrm{exp}\left(-2\sum_1^n x_i \right) $$ which is decreasing in the statistic $$ T(\mathbf{X}) = \sum_1^n X_i \sim \textrm{Gamma}(n, \theta) \sim \frac{1}{2\theta} \, \chi^2_{2n} $$ I have tried to use tables for $\chi^2_n$ but I am finding difficulty since I seem to need lower points of the distribution, rather than upper points.
