jQuery conflict in WordPress Plugin - jQuery vs. WordPress Core

I have a custom developed WordPress plugin that is using jQuery 1.4 and for some reason it is conflicting with the core of the WordPress js code... not sure, but I think it's also jQuery, no? Anyway, I assumed it was this datepicker script I was using called "anytime.js" however, after debugging it turns out that the conflict was still happening after removing the link within the plugin to "anytime.js" but finally resolved when I got rid of the link to jquery.1.4.min.js ... So, Any ideas for how to avoid the conflict? Is WordPress jQuery-based and that's the cause or is it something else? Here's the relevant code found within the plugin: function datepicker_header(){ $theme_dir = get_bloginfo('wpurl').'/wp-content/plugins/postevents/js/';?> anytime.css" /> ui.css" /> anytime.js" type='text/javascript'> $(function(){ AnyTime.picker( "startdate", { format: "%m-%d-%Y", firstDOW: 1, baseYear: ' ', earliest: ' ' } ); AnyTime.picker( "enddate", { format: "%m-%d-%Y", firstDOW: 1, baseYear: ' ', earliest: ' ' } ); }); EDIT I think I may have caused some confusion. I should explain functionality. There is a plugin called "Post Events" that has a jQuery based datepicker. The datepicker relies on jQuery to run. The specific and unusual problem is that while the plugin is active, it causes the new WordPress 3.0 draggable menus to fail from the WP admin panel. All other functionality is working, however, disabling the datepicker does not result in the menus becoming draggable. Instead, only deleting the link to "/libs/jquery/1.4.2..." in the code above causes the menus to become draggable again. EDIT #2 While I can only indicate one correct answer, both @Matthew as well as @ polarblau 's corrections below were required to fix the problem!
