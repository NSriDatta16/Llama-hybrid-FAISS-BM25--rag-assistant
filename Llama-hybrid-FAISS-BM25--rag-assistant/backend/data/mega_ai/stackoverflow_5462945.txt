Make sure you have the jQuery object and NOT the element itself. If you select by class, you may not be getting what you expect. Open up a console and look at what your selector code returns. In Firebug, you should see something like: jQuery( div.draggable ) You may have to go into an array and grab the first element: $('.draggable').first() Then call draggable() on that jQuery object and you're done.
