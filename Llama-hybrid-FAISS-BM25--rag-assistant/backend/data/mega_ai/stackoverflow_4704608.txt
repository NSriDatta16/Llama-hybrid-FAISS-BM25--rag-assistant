I for one can't think of any technical reason to chose C over C++. Not one that I can't instantly think of a counterpoint for anyway. Edit in reply to edit: I would seriously discourage you from considering, "...C code is basically C++." Although you can technically compile any C program with a C++ compiler (in as far as you don't use any feature in C that's newer than what C++ has adopted) I really try to discourage anyone from writing C like code in C++ or considering C++ as "C with objects." In response to C being standard in Linux, only in as far as C developers keep saying it :p C++ is as much part of any standard in Linux as C is and there's a huge variety of C++ programs made on Linux. If you're writing a Linux driver, you need to be doing it in C. Beyond that...I know RMS likes to say you're more likely to find a C compiler than a C++ one but that hasn't actually been true for quite a long time now. You'll find both or neither on almost all installations. In response to maintainability - I of course disagree. Like I said, I can't think of one that can't instantly be refuted. Visa-versa too really.
