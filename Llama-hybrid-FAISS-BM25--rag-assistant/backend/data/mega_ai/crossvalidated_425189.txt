Varriational autoencoder latent space and editing the images

In VAE we encode the image and take its statistics (mean and variance) I hae two questions about them: 1) How these two vectors are defining acording to what? How the dimensions of these vectors be formed? 2) if we want to edit a image with using VAE for example changing the color of skin or adding make up, how do we know the exact place of these fetures' places in the latent place?
