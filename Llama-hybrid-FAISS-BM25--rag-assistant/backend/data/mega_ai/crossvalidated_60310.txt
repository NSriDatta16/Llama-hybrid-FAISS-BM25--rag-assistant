From what I can see, the equation $SE_{est} = SD\sqrt{reliability(1-reliability)}$ is an attempt to construct a measure more akin to a credibility interval used in Bayesian statistics, i.e. the probability of the parameter given the data. A confidence interval is, as you say, the long-run frequency - if you repeated the test a large number of times, the confidence interval would include the true score in 95% of those tests. From the abstract of the Dudek article, it seems that people had used the formula $SE_{est} = SD\sqrt{1-reliability}$ to assess the variability in scores. Dudek argues that this gives the variability of the observed scores when the true score is held constant (which would be what we traditionally use for a confidence interval), but that what is actually desired is a measure of the variability of the true score when the observed score is held constant (at the measured value). Dudek states that "the [resulting] interval is around the estimated true score rather than around the observed score". Reference: http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/86/2/335/
