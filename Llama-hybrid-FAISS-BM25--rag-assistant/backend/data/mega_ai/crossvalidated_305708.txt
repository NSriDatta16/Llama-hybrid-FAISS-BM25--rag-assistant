No. Logistic regression makes no assumption about the probability distribution of the input features(variables), so you can have skewness, non-normality, etc. among your features. Logistic regression is also not a linear method, and in fact is based on logarithms -- so it's multiplicative, i.e. based on log(x), exp(x). Make sure there are not more features than records, i.e., $p \gg n$, or the program you're using will drop features due to singularity issues.
