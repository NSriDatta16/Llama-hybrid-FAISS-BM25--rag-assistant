Depending on the amount of data, any classification algorithm can be suitable. LSTM, however, are likely to be an overkill, considering that you probably won't be having much variation in the time series for each object. Instead of pondering about the algorithm, you'd better think of useful features you can extract from your data. My guess would be that speed, accelerations, and altitude would be most informative.
