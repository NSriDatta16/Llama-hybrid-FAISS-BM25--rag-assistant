PHP can return the number of rows only if the result set returned by the query is buffered on the PHP side. But prepared queries are unbuffered by default. So in order to get the number you need to call the get_result() method first: $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT id, name, status, type FROM organization WHERE id=?"); $stmt->bind_param("s", $id); $stmt->execute(); / *** HERE ***/ $result = $stmt->get_result(); $num = $result->num_rows(); but in reality you don't actually need that number. Given you will fetch the selected data anyway, using either fetch_assoc() or fetch_all() methods, you can always use that data instead of $num.
