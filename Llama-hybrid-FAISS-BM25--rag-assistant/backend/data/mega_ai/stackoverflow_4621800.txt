Here's my take on both after using them at length: JSch: Ultimately more flexible, but at the cost of being much more low level. It is also not well documented (no JavaDoc tags) but is none-the-less very stable. Ganymed: Provides good support for most of the standard SSH operations you might need (port forwarding, reverse port forwarding, SCP file copying etc.). Documentation is decent in the form of Javadoc of primary public classes. The biggest difference, in my view, is that Ganymed provides a more intuitive and encapsulated API that maps directly to high level SSH operations. //Nicholas
