Let's look at a simulation. library(ggplot2) set.seed(2023) # Length of each time series # N The visual evidence convinces me of a correlation. We can also do a formal hypothesis test of the correlation via cor.test(d$ts5, d$ts6) to get a p-value $\approx 0$ . This makes sense. By defining the time series as autoregressive, you are specifying the sixth point as being equal to the fifth point plus some noise, so there is certainly going to be some dependence between the two points. If you want to be rigorous about the math, calculate the covariance between consecutive points, knowing that a random variable will be correlated with a linear combination of itself and the Gaussian error term. (My selection of the 5th and 6th points was arbitrary but sufficient to show the lack of independence. If the 5th and 6th points are correlated, then the time series is not IID.) Also, the "identical" part of $IID$ is violated. As you go further out in the series, the variance increases, as each subsequnt time step adds an additional noise term.
