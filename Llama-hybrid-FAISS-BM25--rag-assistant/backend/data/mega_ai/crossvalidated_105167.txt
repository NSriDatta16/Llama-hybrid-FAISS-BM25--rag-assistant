Geweke diagnostic of a Markov chain: why does the first window have to cover the burn-in?

I read the following statement in this document $^{[1]}$, at the bottom of page 11: Too wide A will some times “hide” the burn in part within the converged part of the chain and the difference in means may not be large enough for the diagnostic to give an indication of non convergence. where A is the first window in Geweke diagnostic. Geweke statistic is defined as: $$Z_n=\frac{(\bar \theta_A - \bar \theta_B)}{\sqrt{\hat S_\theta^A(0)/n_A+\hat S_\theta^B(0)/n_B}}$$ where $A$ and $B$ refers to the first window and second window respectively, $\bar \theta$ is the mean value, $\hat S_\theta(0)$ is spectrum density, $n$ is the number of data points. What I don't understand here is: since this quantity should converge to $N(0,1)$ if the two intervals have the same distribution, why does interval A have to cover the burn-in to give an indication of non-convergence?
