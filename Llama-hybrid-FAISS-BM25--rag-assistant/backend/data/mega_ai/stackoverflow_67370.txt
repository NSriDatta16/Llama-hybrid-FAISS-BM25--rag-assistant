Dynamically Create a generic type for template

I'm programming WCF using the ChannelFactory which expects a type in order to call the CreateChannel method. For example: IProxy proxy = ChannelFactory .CreateChannel(...); In my case I'm doing routing so I don't know what type my channel factory will be using. I can parse a message header to determine the type but I hit a brick wall there because even if I have an instance of Type I can't pass that where ChannelFactory expects a generic type. Another way of restating this problem in very simple terms would be that I'm attempting to do something like this: string listtype = Console.ReadLine(); // say "System.Int32" Type t = Type.GetType( listtype); List myIntegers = new List<>(); // does not compile, expects a "type" List myIntegers = new List (); // interesting - type must resolve at compile time? Is there an approach to this I can leverage within C#?
