make bash array from incrementally adding another array

So if I have a bash array: ar=( "one" "two" "three" "four") What is the best way to make a new array such that it looks like this: ar-new=( "one" "one two" "one two three" "one two three four" ) I cooked up something that use a for loop inside a for loop and using seq . Is there a better/more elegant way to accomplish this?
