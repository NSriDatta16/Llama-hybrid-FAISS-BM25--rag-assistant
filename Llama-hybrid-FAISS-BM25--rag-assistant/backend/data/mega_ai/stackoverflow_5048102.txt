Continuation of a process after a system crash/restart - Drools Flow

I've been playing with examples I downloaded with the book Drools JBoss Rules 5.0. To my relief they work :) Drools Flow has been my point of interest as a possible workflow engine replacement. As I'm trying to wrap my head around things, I've been wondering how a premature death of a rulesflow process gets restarted? What I'm mean is say a process is bouncing from one node to another like expected, then the containing process dies due to a crash, restart or whatever. Is the current node/place of the ruleflow process retained, and can it just continue from that point on system restart? If so how? The group I work for is very Java EE centric with JBoss being our favorite application server. I see examples of Drools leveraging Spring's persistence and bean lookup support. Are there examples of doing the same with JBoss?
