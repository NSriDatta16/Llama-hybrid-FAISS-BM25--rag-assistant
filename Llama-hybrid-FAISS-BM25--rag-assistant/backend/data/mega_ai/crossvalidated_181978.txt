Plot angles around $360^\circ$ (North)

I want to plot wind angles. I typically have around 25 observations (the amount is not important here). I want to use a line chart to quickly see the trend (veering or backing) and the amount of oscillation. I also calculate statistics of the values. Mostly this is trivial. But how to manage the situation when wind is around North? E.g. I have observations 5, 10, 350, 345, 355, 0, 5. This produces a non-informative plot because the values are seemingly so separate although in reality they are not. Calculating average produces wrong result (153, the right should be 359). OK, I get it right using negative values for the big numbers. (350 = -10) Now the question: what kind of algorithm should i write to make a decision about when I need this value changing or is there another means to handle this?
