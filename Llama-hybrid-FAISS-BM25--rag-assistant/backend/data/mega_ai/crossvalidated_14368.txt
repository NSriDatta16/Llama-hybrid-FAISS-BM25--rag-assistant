How to compute the gradient for logistic regression in Matlab?

I'm trying to minimize function f , firstly I was using fminsearch but it works long time, that's why now I use fminunc , but there is one problem: I need function gradient for acceleration. f = @(w) sum(log(1 + exp(-t .* (phis * w'))))/size(phis, 1) + coef * w*w'; options = optimset('Display', 'notify', 'MaxFunEvals', 2e+6, 'MaxIter', 2e+6); w = fminunc(f, ones(1, size(phis, 2)), options); phis size is NxN+1 t size is Nx1 coef is const Can you help me please construct gradient for function f , coz I always get this warning: Warning: Gradient must be provided for trust-region algorithm; using line-search algorithm instead.
