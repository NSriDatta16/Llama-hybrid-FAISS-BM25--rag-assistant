I'm not a Bayesian expert, but I think this is simpler than it appears. Your data seem to be binomial , and the uninformative prior for a binomial has an expected value of $.5$â€”albeit with equal likelihood for all probabilities. The conjugate prior is beta , and you get the uniform with a beta if $\alpha = \beta = 1$, which I believe is what you are referring to. The posterior in a Bayesian analysis can be thought of simply as a weighted average of your prior and your data. So as you observe $0$s, your posterior will slide from $.5$ towards $0$. More $0$s will make it slide further. Thus, with more observations in A , the posterior will be dominated by the data, whereas with few observations in B , the posterior is dominated by the prior, and the analyst believes $Pr(Y=1|A) To think about this by analogy using frequentist techniques, consider the task of forming a confidence interval for $p$ from binomial data with all $0$s. A simple approach to determining the upper limit of a 95% CI (the lower limit is obviously $0$) is to use the rule of 3 ; viz .: $3/N$. For your data, the frequentist 95% CIs are, $[0,\ .03]$ for A , and $[0,\ .3]$ for B .
