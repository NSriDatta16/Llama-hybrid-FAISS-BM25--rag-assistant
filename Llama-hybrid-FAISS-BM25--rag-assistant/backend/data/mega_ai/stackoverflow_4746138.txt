Refactor this Ruby and Rails code

I have this model: class Event I have a feeling that this can be done shorter and more elegant. Does anyone have an idea? Jacob BTW. Can anyone tell me what the asterisk in front of CUSTOM_FIELDS does? I know what it does in a method definition (def foo(*args)) but not here...
