You have a bigger problem than that, because there's no method in ImmutableMultiMap that will return an ImmutableMultiMap -- therefore it is impossible to add elements to it, and the constructor does not provide support for creating it with elements. Please see existing implementations and pay attention to the companion object's builder and related methods.
