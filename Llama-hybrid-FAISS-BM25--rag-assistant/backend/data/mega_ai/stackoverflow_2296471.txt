As per my comment on @ykaganovich's answer, SHA1 is (surprisingly) slightly faster than MD5. From your description of the problem, you are not trying to create a secure hash - merely hide the file in a large namespace - in which case use of a salt / rainbow tables are irrelevant - the only consideration is the likelihood of a false collision (where 2 different files give the same hash). The probability of this happening with md5 is very, very remote. It's even more remote with sha1. However you do need to think about what happens when 2 independent users upload the same warez to you site. Who owns the file? In fact, there doesn't seem to be any reason at all to use a hash - just generate a sufficiently long random value.
