In answer to 1) are you sure its meant to be "" (double-quote, double-quote) and not '"' (single-quote, double-quote, single-quote). This would make more sense, as you would be wuating whatever inputString is. (E.g. if input string is 'hello' then your line would be queryString: "hello" What I think is happening above is that you are appending and prepending an empty strings to inputString . I'm not entirely sure what you're asking with (2), but in general, the storage of JSON data in a hidden input is accepted practice. From there you can use a JSON parser to turn it into a JavaScript object for use. Edit: I've done a jsfiddle mockup if you want to have a look: http://jsfiddle.net/gRQMy/5/
