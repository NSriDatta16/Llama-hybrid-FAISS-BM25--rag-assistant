Completely delete the library from the Xcode project and then re-add it, along with re-adding it to your link phase. Sounds like Xcode is stuck trying to link with a library that no longer exists. Failing that: Add a new build phase: Right click the target, Add -> New Build Phase -> New Copy Files Build Phase. Set the destination to "Products Directory". Drag your library into this build phase, and then; (Important!) drag the position of the new build phase so it's ordered before the compile phase. This is needed if the library isn't actually installed in a system path. There are other ways to achieve the same effect, but this one is nice and portable.
