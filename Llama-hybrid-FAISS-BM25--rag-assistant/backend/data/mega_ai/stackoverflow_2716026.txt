I typically try to make use of the primitive boolean wherever possible. The only possibility that I can think for a developer to want the Boolean class is boxing/unboxing (but I would think you'd want to prevent boxing/unboxing whenever possible rather than encourage it everywhere) and the possibility for null values.
