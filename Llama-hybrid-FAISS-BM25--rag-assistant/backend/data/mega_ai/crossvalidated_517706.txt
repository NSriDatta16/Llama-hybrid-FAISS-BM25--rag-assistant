The use of a word embedding is almost never to be visualized. The visualization is just a diagnostic and interpretation tool. And 2 dimensions is just not enough in language. The only reason you want 2 dimensions is because that's what you can print on paper. If you learn extremely low-dimensional embeddings, they're probably going to be useless. Consider the consequences of dimension-2 embeddings. There are only two axes on which meaning can vary, so you'll wind up with a lot of word pairs with similar dot products. It will be hard to properly distinguish between meanings. My point is that your embeddings will be bad for whatever your task is (language modeling, translation, sentiment analysis, whatever) if there are so few dimensions to your embedding that it cannot capture major distinctions in language. That's the motivation for learning high-dimensional embeddings.
