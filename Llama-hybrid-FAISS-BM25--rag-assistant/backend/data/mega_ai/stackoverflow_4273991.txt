How to make the jQuery UI Draggable "auto scrolling" with jScrollPane

Just seeing if anyone ran into this issue. We are using the awesome new jScrollPane in combination with the jQuery UI Draggable element. One cool feature of the Draggable element, that we lost when moving to jScrollPane, is that when you are dragging near the edge of the containing element it will scroll that element if possible. It does not do that with jScrollPane. Has anyone else tried to fix this? Thanks!
