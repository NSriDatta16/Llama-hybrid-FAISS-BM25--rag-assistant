RNN classification - unknown symbols at test time

I am working on a classification problem and have built an LSTM network (character-level RNN). It has been trained and performs well. Now, when predicting, there are sometimes characters that are not in the original alphabet the model was trained on. What is the best practice to treat these characters? Should we ignore them ? I tried this and did not seem to work well. DO we need to retrain the model to also have an unknown character?
