First I recommend reading about Naive Bayes. a-simple-explanation-of-naive-bayes-classification You tube video of Naive Bayes in NLP class Why does score 0.55 correspond to 0 (instance#2) but a smaller score 0.519 correspond to 1 (instance#7)? NaiveBayes decides according to values of two probability predictions not according to if they are near to one. For example class A probability is 0.1 and class B probability 0.12 then class B is the prediction. Here score means posterior probability of class given prior probabilities of features. In the above stack overflow example: Posterior probabilities (scores) was 1/20 and 1/60. Higher one is chosen. Where is the output documented? You may look to class source file. But not everything in weka is well documented. This output is fairly simple therefore I do not think you will find a documentation. Is there a way to produce the csv score file? Use following to get csv prediction output. java_command=java -Xmx6g -cp /usr/share/java/weka.jar $java_command weka.classifiers.Evaluation weka.classifiers.bayes.NaiveBayes -l irisNaiveBayes.model -T test.arff -classifications weka.classifiers.evaluation.output.prediction.CSV We use Evaluation class instead of using Naive Bayes directly. First argument to Evaluation class is classifier to use, here NaiveBayes. -classification switch allows to output CSV. Another example with well known iris data set. java_command=java -Xmx6g -cp /usr/share/java/weka.jar $java_command weka.classifiers.bayes.NaiveBayes -t iris.arff -d irisNaiveBayes.model $java_command weka.classifiers.Evaluation weka.classifiers.bayes.NaiveBayes -l irisNaiveBayes.model -T iris.arff -classifications weka.classifiers.evaluation.output.prediction.CSV This command gives following output. === Predictions on test data === inst#,actual,predicted,error,prediction 1,1:Iris-setosa,1:Iris-setosa,,1 2,1:Iris-setosa,1:Iris-setosa,,1 3,1:Iris-setosa,1:Iris-setosa,,1 4,1:Iris-setosa,1:Iris-setosa,,1 5,1:Iris-setosa,1:Iris-setosa,,1 6,1:Iris-setosa,1:Iris-setosa,,1 7,1:Iris-setosa,1:Iris-setosa,,1
