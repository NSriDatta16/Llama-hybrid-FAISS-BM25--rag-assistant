Neural network residuals plot analysis

I am new to neural networks, and i am interested in whether residual (standardized residuals vs. predicted values) plot should not form any pattern (ex.: correlated, U-shape) even in the case of neural networks (not just lin.reg.)? So is it worth to check whether the residual points distribution normally distributed around 0 mean? If so, does it mean no deterministic errors are captured? Thank you!
