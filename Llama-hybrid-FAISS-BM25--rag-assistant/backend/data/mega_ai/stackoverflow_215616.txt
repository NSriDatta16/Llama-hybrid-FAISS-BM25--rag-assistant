I have used memcached a little bit in one of my projects. I think it's a very efficient and scalable caching platform. By changing small configurations, you're able to replicate the cached objects in more than one server. Facebook uses memacached for their in-memory storage and it's a large scale entity on the web. This gives a thumb up for memcahced. The only problem I faced in implementation is that doesn't automatically accept objects to store. You will need to serialize the objects before storing which may be a little bit confusing at the beginning. FYI, there is a nother caching platform produced by Microsoft called: Velocity. You may need to take a look on it: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=B24C3708-EEFF-4055-A867-19B5851E7CD2&displaylang=en
