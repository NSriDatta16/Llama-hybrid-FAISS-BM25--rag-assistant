svcutil giving errors when trying to create proxy from complex wsdl

I am working on a WSDL published by standards organization (IHE). It is very complex with over 60 XSDs included in it for data types. When I try to use svcutil to generate client proxy, I am getting the following error Warning: The optional WSDL extension element 'body' from namespace 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap12/' was not handled. XPath://wsdl:definitions[@targetNamespace='urn:ihe:iti:pixv3:2007']/wsdl:binding[@name='PIXManager_Binding_Soap12']/wsdl:operation[@name='PIXManager_PRPA_IN201304UV02']/wsdl:output* If required, I can post the wsdl and associated files. Thanks
