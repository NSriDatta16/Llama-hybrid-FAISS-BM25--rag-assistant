Why the prediction of neural network doesn't change?

I've created two neural networks for a prediction purposes, the first is a network with one hidden layer and the second is two hidden layers, I use the cross validation techniques, the training error for both networks is around 2E-4 but at the test step, for the two topologies, the prediction values do not change over the time, (just a small change in a fraction of 5). I've tried different functions for the hidden layers (between tangh and sigmoid) and a sigmoid for the output layer. So, where is the problem? Thanks.
