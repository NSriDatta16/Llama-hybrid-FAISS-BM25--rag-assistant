This is quite a multi-part question, but I may be able to help with some part of it. You can use a ScrollView, and I prefer to do it that way as it allows you to define as many UI elements as you want. Adding/Removing Elements First I'd create an XML layout for each individual list element. When you need to add an element, you can inflate this layout like so: LinearLayout clone = (LinearLayout)View.inflate(this, R.layout.sample, null) Then you can set the element's information by accessing widgets in the XML you inflated clone.findViewById(R.id.NameSpace).setText("This is element Johnny") I would set the clone's ID to a randomly generated number or some kind of incremental index and store that number somehow (ie a List or int[] ), keeping the ID of the "older" elements in the front of the storage device. Then, when you need to access elements to remove them you can just call ScrollView.removeView( findViewById( Storage.get(0) ) ) for the first element.
