I guess this sort of functionality is not added in any framework/runtime since it would create a big overhead (think on how many times you modify a variable holding a primitive type within the average application) while being not used under normal circunstances. Anyway, in .NET at least (and I guess that in other OO environments as well), you can define properties , which are accessed as normal variables but can have associated code that reacts when its value is read or modified.
