Making no assumptions about anything else (because you haven't provided any additional details), the only reason why you would get a $\pi_0 > 1$ would be a $\lambda$ value which is too small. Looking at the source code of qvalue , we can see that the pi0est.R function has the following code: https://github.com/jdstorey/qvalue/blob/master/R/pi0est.R # Determines pi0 if (ll == 1) { pi0 = lambda)/(1 - lambda) pi0.lambda Given ll is length of $\lambda$, lambda is your $\lambda$ value, and p is the vector of $P$-values. Assuming that you have a l of length 1, the $\pi_0$ is estimated to be $$ \frac{\text{mean of all P values larger than } \lambda}{1-\lambda}$$ It is then redefined as the minimum between the above value and 1, so if the above quantity is larger than 1, it is reported as $\geq 1$. I would encourage you to perhaps rethink your $\lambda$ selection or look into alternate methods for estimating $\pi_0$. Storey's 2011 paper accompanying the qvalue package provides a good intro and references. Additionally, full code for the qvalue package is found here .
