UI Layout problem/algorithm

I am trying to solve a problem where i need to fit a set of rectangles(views) in a bigger rectangle(window frame). Each View has a minimum size and a maximum size. Is there a general algorithm to solve this kind of problems. My current code does not look elegant although it works for most of the situations, i some times get into situations where i have empty rects(unoccupied regions) or overlapped rects (views overlapped). I am sure someone has already solved this problem, i just cannot find any yet. Thanks, -Abhinay.
