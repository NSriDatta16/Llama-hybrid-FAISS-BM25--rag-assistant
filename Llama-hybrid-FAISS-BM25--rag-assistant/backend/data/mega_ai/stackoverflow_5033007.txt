This can occur when the Windows user account that SQL runs under (e.g. SqlServerAccount) doesn't have permissions to access the shared file (\servername\wwwroot\Upload\LDSAgentsMap.txt). One way we've worked through this is to go to the machine where shared file resides. On that machine, add a Windows user account with the same user name and password as the account that SQL runs under. For example, If your database resides on MyDatabaseServer, and runs under a Windows user account SqlServerAccount with password Foo, then go to the machine where your shared file resides, e.g. MyFileServer, and create a Windows user account named SqlServerAccount with password Foo. Last step: go into the folder share on MyFileServer and go into sharing properties for that folder. (On Win7, right-click the folder->Properties->Sharing->Advanced Sharing). Then add read permission for SqlServerAccount that you created.
