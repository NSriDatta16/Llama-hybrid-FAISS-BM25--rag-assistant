Help With Construction of DID MLR Model - Dataset Contains 20.2 Million Observations

First: apologies in advance for the length of this post. I am just attempting to provide as much detail as possible. I am in the middle of a research study using Zillow ZTRAX data. I am using Assessed Home Values from the data to explore whether or not the construction of SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles impacted home values based on proximity to the location of the stadium. Here is look at the data I am looking at. I currently have 20,299,879 observations of this. The 'distance' variable is the distance, in miles, the house is from SoFi Stadium. TotalAssessedValue AssessmentYear TotalBedrooms BuildingAreaSqFt distance BuildingAge 1 7357 2018 0 1040 9.706832 49 2 81976 2018 2 1633 15.349301 79 3 262723 2018 2 1003 17.491314 75 4 358704 2018 2 1455 19.894094 63 5 389676 2018 6 4041 1.996699 66 6 5303077 2018 5 6917 13.869397 27 My goal, using this data, is to use a DID approach to determine if the assessed value of those houses closer to the construction site of SoFi Stadium were impacted differently than those further away. To start, I created the treatment variables: did.coding$post14 = as.numeric(combined.data$AssessmentYear >= 2014) did.coding$over5 = as.numeric(combined.data$distance >= 5) Construction of SoFi Stadium started in 2014 ... and I have randomly picked 5 miles. I am still not sure if there is a better way to do this or not. After that: mean.info = aggregate(did.coding$TotalAssessedValue, list(did.coding$AssessmentYear, did.coding$over5 == 1), mean) names(mean.info) = c("Year", "Over 5 Miles", "Value") mean.info$Treatment[1:9] = "Under 5 Miles" mean.info$Treatment[10:18] = "Over 5 Miles" I am gathering the yearly averages of assessed value for those homes under five miles away from SoFi Stadium and those over five miles away. And, if you are interested, here is the plot: After that, I did the following DID regression model: regression.model = lm(TotalAssessedValue ~ post14 + over5 + post14*over5 + TotalBedrooms + BuildingAge + BuildingAreaSqFt, data = did.coding) ... with the following results: Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -442056310 -185108 -65044 76741 1222247947 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 1.402e+05 2.632e+03 53.265 And this is where I get lost. It doesn't seem "correct" that every coefficient has a significant relationship. Moreover, I don't know how to interest this in terms of deciding whether or not the construction of SoFi Stadium impacted assessment values based on proximity to the construction site. As you can probably tell, I am a newbie to the world of statistics. Any help and/or advice you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Following up on Thomas' answer from below First and foremost, I have since switched to using sales transactions rather than assessments/value. I have not done it yet, but it seems that a log transformation on the SalesPrice variable might be a good idea? Anyways ... I created a distance_ord variable as seen below. I also limited the distance to just those houses within 50 miles of SoFi Stadium and ran the lm model. sofi.cleaned % mutate( distance_ord = case_when( distance = 6 & distance = 11 & distance = 21 ~ "Very Long" ) ) model The summary of the model is as follows: Call: lm(formula = SalesPrice ~ distance_ord * post14 + age + TotalBedrooms + TotalCalculatedBath + SqFt, data = sofi.cleaned) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -22687953 -191325 -70854 79903 590473400 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -43933.876 9218.212 -4.77 0.000001879 *** distance_ordModerate -28619.902 36953.243 -0.77 0.4386 distance_ordShort -168079.774 38853.043 -4.33 0.000015182 *** distance_ordVery Long -24318.502 7809.238 -3.11 0.0018 ** post14 338533.332 17388.591 19.47 However, I'm not sure how to interpret the results. Is this indicating that those houses closest to SoFi Stadium sold for $33,130 more relative to the same distance PRIOR to 2014? And what do I make of the post-14 moderate number? $982,868 seems like a massive jump ... but it does make me think that it highlights that homes closer to the stadium were, in fact, impacted. Again: sorry for such "newbie" questions. Still trying to wrap my head around all these numbers. Results from Example Code Below Call: lm(formula = SalesPrice ~ relevel(distance_ord, ref = "Short") * post14 + age + TotalBedrooms + TotalCalculatedBath + SqFt, data = sofi.cleaned) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -169836430 -228399 -80839 98344 850249201 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
