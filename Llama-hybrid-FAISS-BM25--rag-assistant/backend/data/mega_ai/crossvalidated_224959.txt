To clarify things here consider a study where you weigh men and women. You could report Men weigh on average 80kg and women weigh 70kg The average weight of a person is 75kg and men are 10kg heavier than women In each case there are two independent facts. You cannot add a third which is independent of them. In your case you are trying to do just that and it is not possible.
