Do some browsers encode cookies?

This is sort of a follow-up to Why are my cookies containing JSON occasionally malformed , which we have resolved. I have a 3-value cookie, and we're url encoding the main value. The other two values are a timestamp and a hash. It looks like this in our response header: foo=d=634027688530013385&v=%7b%22HasDog%22%3afalse%2c%22Greeting%22%3anull%2c%22RecentRecipes%22%3a%5b%5d%2c%22Remember%22%3afalse%7d&h=ARv5QGf4Cnftc4tFaPoy/VH8Pbo=; path=/; HttpOnly In our logs, we see cases where we can't parse the three values correctly because the entire cookie is now encoded: Cookie looks mangled: d%3D634027653097874122%26v%3D%7B%22HasAcceptedTerms%22%3Afalse%2C%22RecipeBoxCount%22%3A0%2C%22Remember%22%3Afalse%7D%26h%3DR85mJ%2FTdA6yrVe5pVCVpfG2jumM%3D Unfortunately, we're not capturing the user agent to see if this is related to a specific browser. I have several options to fix this. I just think the behavior is odd enough to warrant a question.
