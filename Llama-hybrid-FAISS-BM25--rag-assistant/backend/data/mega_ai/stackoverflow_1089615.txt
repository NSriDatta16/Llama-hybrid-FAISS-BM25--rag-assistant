The fine answers here suggest that a benefit of yield return is that you don't need to create a list ; Lists can be expensive. (Also, after a while, you'll find them bulky and inelegant.) But what if you don't have a List? yield return allows you to traverse data structures (not necessarily Lists) in a number of ways. For example, if your object is a Tree, you can traverse the nodes in pre- or post- order without creating other lists or changing the underlying data structure. public IEnumerable InOrder() { foreach (T k in kids) foreach (T n in k.InOrder()) yield return n; yield return (T) this; } public IEnumerable PreOrder() { yield return (T) this; foreach (T k in kids) foreach (T n in k.PreOrder()) yield return n; }
