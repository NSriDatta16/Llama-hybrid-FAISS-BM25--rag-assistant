So that's two questions. To know where your finger is pointing in the text you need to know where the UITextView has laid out the characters. This is not something the UITextView is documented to support, so next up is drawing text yourself. This stackoverflow question on embedding a custom font has a few links and even some code that will do the trick. What you need to add is keeping track of character advances so you know exactly where each character is rendered (or you could even use other core graphics functions to get exact bounding boxes of each character). Clearly once you know what character has been tapped you also know the word it is part of. You'll would probably have the best quality if the sentence is recorded both in full and as single words, so that you can play back either when needed. This other stackoverflow question on playing sounds loaded from the internet has a few links and snippets which relate to loading and playing back audio.
