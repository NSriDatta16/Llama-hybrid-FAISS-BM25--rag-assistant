A very popular Econometrics textbook is Econometric Analysis by W. Greene, now in its 8th edition, ISBN-13: 9781292231150. It is written in a crystal clear style and is essentially complete in terms of topics coverage. For the computations, Greene seems reluctant to stick to a particular software. Using his words (pag. 39): A more extensive list of computer software used for econometric analysis can be found at the resource Web site, http://www.oswego.edu/~economic/econsoftware.htm . With only a few exceptions, the computations described in this book can be carried out with any of the packages listed. NLOGIT was used for the computations in most of the applications. This text contains no instruction on using any particular program or language. Many authors have produced RATS, LIMDEP/NLOGIT, EViews, SAS, or Stata code for some of the applications, including, in a few cases, in the documentation for their computer programs. There are also quite a few volumes now specifically devoted to econometrics associated with particular packages, such as Cameron and Trivediâ€™s (2009) companion to their treatise on microeconometrics
