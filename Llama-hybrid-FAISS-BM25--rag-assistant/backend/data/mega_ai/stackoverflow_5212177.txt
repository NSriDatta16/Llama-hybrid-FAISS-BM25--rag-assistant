If you want to do this with jQuery and it's always the last paragraph (and wrapped in div like you said in the title), then this might work. $("div p:last-child").remove(); This finds last in and removes it. How about this then?: If you have structure like this: I want to keep this I want to find and remove this string I want to keep this I want to find and remove this string Then you can delete each last paragraph containing a link with this: $(document).ready(function () { $("p:last-child > a").parent().remove(); }); This would result to output: I want to keep this I want to keep this
