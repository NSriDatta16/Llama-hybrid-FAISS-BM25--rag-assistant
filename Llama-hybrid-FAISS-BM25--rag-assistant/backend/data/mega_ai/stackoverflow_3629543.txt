You might want to confirm that the cookies have the same domain when being created. That can sometimes cause problems. If you are going to the website www.example.com and the OAuth callback points to example.com, then it's possible you have two separate cookies, one for www.example.com and one for example.com Turn on "Always Ask" on your browser and pay attention to the cookie details. Make sure that the value for the "Host:" field is the same both times. The fix is entering something like .example.com for SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN in your settings.py file.
