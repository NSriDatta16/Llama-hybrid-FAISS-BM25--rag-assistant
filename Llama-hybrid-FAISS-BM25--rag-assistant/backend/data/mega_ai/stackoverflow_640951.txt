I'll second suggestion to use JAXB, or possibly XStream (former is faster, latter has more focus on object serialization part). Plus, I'll further suggest a decent JSON-based alternative, Jackson ( http://jackson.codehaus.org/Tutorial ), which can fully serializer/deserialize beans to JSON text to store in the column. Oh and I absolutely agree in that do not use Java binary serialization under any circumstances for long-term data storage. Same goes for Protocol Buffers; both are too fragile for this purpose (they are better for data transfer between tigtly coupled systems).
