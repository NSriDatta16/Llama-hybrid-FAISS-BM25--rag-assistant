In order to do remote data storage, you don't typically rely on the PhoneGap or Appcellerator inherent data storage mechanisms, but more on your remote server's abilities. You can take advantage of the local data storage for offline use. I would set up my mobile app so that it does the following: Checks to see if it's networked/online If offline, reads/writes data to a local db on the device If online, reads/writes data to a remote server via an HTTP call and provides/retrieves a JSON object from the HTTP server's API/DB This introduces other issues around syncing that you'll need to begin to think about. That's the basics anyway, and I think it answers your question. Let me know if you need more detail.
