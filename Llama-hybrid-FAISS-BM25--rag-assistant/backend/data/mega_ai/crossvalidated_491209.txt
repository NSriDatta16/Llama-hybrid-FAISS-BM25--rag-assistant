Drop or impute predictor that is missing around 70% of values, but which is known to be highly relevant?

Suppose we have a medical dataset and we are interested in predicting blood pressure using the following variables: age, sex, weight, height, volume of circulating blood, cardiac output, parent with high blood pressure (bwhbp). The last variable bwhbp is either true or false depending on whether a person has at least one parent with high blood pressure. Now, assume we are missing around 70% of values for this variable in the dataset. If this was just any old variable we could consider dropping this column altogether, but suppose having a parent with high blood pressure strongly predisposes a person to have high blood pressure. Thus, bwhbp is highly relevant for 30% of the dataset. Is it 'safe' to impute the bwhp in this rows in which it is missing, i.e. impute it for 70% of the dataset? Or should we drop it altogether because we only have 30% coverage of the dataset? What is the best practise in this situation?
