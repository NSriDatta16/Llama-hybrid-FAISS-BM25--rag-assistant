VS Team Tester failed to run dynamic web test

I have a Testing project that contains a csv file which a webtest uses to run against one of our projects. For some reason, even though it is referenced correctly I receive the following error: Could not run Web test 'SubmitBadData' on agent 'BLDSERVER': Could not access table 'BadData#csv' in data source 'BadData' of test '942b62a8-c123-4228-a6df-909ef009d62f': The Microsoft Jet database engine could not find the object 'BadData.csv'. Make sure the object exists and that you spell its name and the path name correctly. When I run this test locally, it executes just fine. It only fails when I have our build server execute it. Ideas? Reason for Closure: I must have recreated the webtest 10 times from scratch. Each time it would work locally, but fail miserably when executed from the build server. I just recreated it again... and it worked. Oh well. Thanks for looking.
