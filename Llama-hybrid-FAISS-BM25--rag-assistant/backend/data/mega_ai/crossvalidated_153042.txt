Finding algorithm to detect anomaly in non gaussian data

I have a data (time series like CPU, traffic and so on) that doesnt have a normal distribution usually (especially when I'm looking at 1 hour data). Are there any algorithm to find anomalies? I searched a lot but I found only algorithm related to data with normal distribution. I tried 3-sigma, box but have no success. Currently I'm thinking about following approach: - find today's trend - get yesterday's data (may be smoothed with moving average) - calculate the next point as averate between data from first and second step - .. and I have no criteria to understand if current value is ok or anomaly. So have two questions: - are there any algorithm to use in my case? - I'm on a right way with my approach or not? thanks
