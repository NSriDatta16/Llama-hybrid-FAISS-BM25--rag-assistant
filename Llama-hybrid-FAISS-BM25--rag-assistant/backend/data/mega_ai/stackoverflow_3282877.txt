The fragment REAL(KIND=real_normal) is not a complete and standard specification of a datatype. Somehwere in the source you have there must be a declaration of the variable real_normal . I'd guess that it is declared such that array is either 4- or 8-byte floating-point numbers, but that is only a guess. What array isn't is an array of default floating-point numbers (called real by Fortran). As one of the other answerers has suggested, investigate the interoperability with C features of Fortran 2003. If your compiler doesn't implement these, ditch it and get a compiler that does.
