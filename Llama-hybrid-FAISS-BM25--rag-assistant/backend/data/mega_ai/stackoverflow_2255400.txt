Obviously, you'll need to save the tab you're displaying, and whatever sort of data storage you want to use to manually determine where the user is. If you're using a drill-down sort of system where your data is in arrays that the user opens, then I would suggest saving an NSIndexPath of the items the user clicked on to get to his current position. Then, on app startup, first switch to the correct tab, then load the index path and create the necessary views and set the navigation controller's stack using [navigationController setViewControllers:animated:]
