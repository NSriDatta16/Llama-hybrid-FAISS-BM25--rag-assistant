Can MLP model sequential data?

When modeling sequential data, RNNs are introduced as an improvement of MLP as they can model the time dependency between the inputs. It is said that feeding the last N data points in the sequence to a MLP does not work because it does not understand that the points come after each other in time. But is this not something that can be learned? Is it not possible the backprop can set the weights of the first layer such that the time dependency is modeled?
