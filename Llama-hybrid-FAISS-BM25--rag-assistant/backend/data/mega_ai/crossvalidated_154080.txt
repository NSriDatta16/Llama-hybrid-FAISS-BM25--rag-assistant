What are variable weights in principal component analysis (PCA) using MATLAB?

Can I set variable (inputs) weights in MATLAB for principal component analysis using pca() function? There is VariableWeights input parameter for pca() . If yes, how does MATLAB use this weights in PCA calculation? In my case some inputs have more higher weights in final output compare to other inputs and I want convert all (6) inputs to a single input.
