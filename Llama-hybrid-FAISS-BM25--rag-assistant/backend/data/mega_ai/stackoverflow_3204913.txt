I've used AntiCrack for all our products. Admittedly, I'm still using version 1: at the time it was free but were encouraged to make a donation (and I duly did). And to be honest it's great. Very easy to integrate. Of course, it's a real battle, and nothing's perfect, but AntiCrack certainly helped to prevent a whole set of common cracking approaches. Of course, many are documented all over the web, it would have taken far longer for me to implement and test than just shell out a few dollars. Version 2 looks like it's even better, although there is now a compulsory donation of at least $30, which is still a bargain.
