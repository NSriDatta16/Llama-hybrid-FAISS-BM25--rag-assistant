Maybe you could try to cluster different courses by merging the ones that are similar in term of topics or scientific area. This way you should be able to reduce the distortion introduced by imputing the average gpa to courses that a given student did not take due to the level of difficulty. Then you could also creat an indicator for each scientific area that shows how many courses the students has taken in that area, and maybe weight the score of a given student in a given area by that indicator.
