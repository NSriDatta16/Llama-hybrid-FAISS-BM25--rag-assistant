It seems good. (Understanding that you are not getting any error) You are fitting your model in some data, then evaluating on other (basic validation). Now you have to find data that have the same format and similar distribution and predict there. You can have a look at the random forest documentation to see what else you can do https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html
