Clearcase viewname.tmp folder deletion

My ClearCase storage location has something like viewname.tmp folders, I believe they got created for my views. I would like to know how can I delete those .tmp folders from my storage location (eg : \\server1\views\username ). If I do with delete button then " Access denied " message is coming.
