Algorithms from R-statistics package Caret R Package- LVQ algorithm, is there similar in Python

In the R-statistics package : Caret R Package, they have the LVQ algorithm that is used for the purpose of "Feature Selection". I have used this to do some data science in R-stats over 6 years ago. I am searching all over the web, and the only reference I can find for LVQ is in terms of LVQ being used as a CLASSIFIER in python and that is it. SO hope someone can tell me if there is "LVQ-Feature Selection" algorithm in PYTHON like there is in R-stats package : Caret R Package. Hope someone knows if a Python library Exists for this or not.
