what technology would you use to build a webapp that requires the use of a special font?

I'm planning a webapp. I have all the wireframes defined, the interfaces designed in photoshop, data structures etc. It will be built on php and mysql however I've been unable to decide on which technology to use as a GUI. All your insights are welcome. The problem with going the html way is that the GUI makes use of a special font that is crucial to the visual aspect of the app. So this font is required. For headers and fixed sections I could do sfir or use images but being a webapp, the amount of dynamically generated content makes it imposible to use image replacements. Enter flash. Flash solves the font problem easily, it even adds font antialiasing and animations which makes it look even sexier. Another pro is being able to deploy as an air app to use local storage for users that have troublesome connections. This way when internet access is restored the app can sync with the main servers. BUT... flash is being ignored by major developers, this would mean the app wouldn't be accessible to mobile devices, ipads,search engines, etc and requires the installation of the flash plugin which is not that big a deal but should be considered. I appreciate your insights, suggestions, comments :)
