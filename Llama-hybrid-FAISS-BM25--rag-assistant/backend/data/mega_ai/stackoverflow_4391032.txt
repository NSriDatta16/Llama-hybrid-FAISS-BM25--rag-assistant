It depends a lot on what kind of queries you'll need. In general it's not possible to design the whole schema from only one sample query, but here's a start: name: string/text services: multiValued string languages: multiValued string opentime: multiValued string servicestime: multiValued string Sample documents: name: Foo org services: childcare, something_else languages: English, Spanish opentime: Monday 9AM, Monday 10AM, ..., Monday 4PM, Tuesday 9AM, ..., Tuesday 4PM servicestime: childcare Monday 9AM, ..., childcare Monday 12PM Your sample query: "Find all organizations open Monday at 3pm offering childcare service and Spanish speakers" can be translated to this schema as: servicestime:"Monday 3PM" AND languages:Spanish (it's implied that if it offers a service on Monday 3PM the organization is open). In general when designing a Solr schema you will have scenario-specific fields. Remember it's not a relational database, your data should be denormalized.
