It looks like your data and analysis is all at the aggregate level (i.e., gender means for incidence and population means for spending). Therefore, it seems like you have a more traditional time series with a time-varying covariate (i.e., spending). And thus, you don't have panel data in the normal sense of multiple people each measured on multiple occasions. Your exact analysis options depend somewhat on how many time points you have. If you have lots of time points, you can estimate more sophisticated models of time. You could start by (a) graphing the data, and (b) running a basic regression model predicting incidence, from sex, spending, the sex by spending interaction, year and perhaps year-squared. That said, if you only have a small number of time points (e.g., 5 to 10), you may want to keep the model even simpler. Also, with spending, you'd know doubt want to think about issues like adjusting for inflation and so on.
