I mean you are working in an ASP.NET MVC project, you should be manipulating html, why care about the design view? Look at the price you should pay just to get the design view working, it's too expensive. It's faster to hit CTRL+F5 in your favorite browser to see the result of your efforts than switching all the time between code and design view.
