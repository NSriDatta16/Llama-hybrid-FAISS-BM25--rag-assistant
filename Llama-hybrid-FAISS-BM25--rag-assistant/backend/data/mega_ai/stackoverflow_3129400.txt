No, it's not that simple. The warning on the MSDN page for SetWindowSubclass says explicitly: Warning You cannot use the subclassing helper functions to subclass a window across threads This article outlines the process for injecting code into another process, but to summarise, you basically need to: Use CreateRemoteThread and LoadLibrary , or Set up the AppInit_DLLs registry key appropriately Once you've got code running in the remote process, you can use SetWindowLongPtr to subclass the window and then use regular IPC techniques (named pipes, etc) to communicate with your process (if needed).
