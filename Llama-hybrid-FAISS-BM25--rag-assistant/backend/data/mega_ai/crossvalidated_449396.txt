Probability as the Correct Term for Classifier Scores

This is more of a semantic question, but is the term probability , in the strictest sense, the correct term to use when describing the output of a predictive model that outputs values between 0 and 1? That is, if my logistic regression outputs a value 0.35 for some unseen sample, can and should that be interpreted as "there is a 35% probability of this sample being the 1 class"? In my understanding, the definition of a probability refers to the frequency of occurrence of some event. Unless it is the case that ~35 out of every 100 samples that my classifier gives a score of 0.35 truly are of the 1 class, is it correct to call this a probability score? Would it be more accurate to just call it a prediction score if it doesn't truly reflect frequency?
