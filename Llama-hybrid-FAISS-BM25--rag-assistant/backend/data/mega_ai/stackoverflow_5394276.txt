You'd want to split things up into two databases. One optimized for insertion to capture the data. And a second one optimized for data retrieval. You can't do this with one single database handling both tasks. Optimizing for heavy data insertion means reducing to absolute bare mininum the amount of indexing done (basically just primary keys), and removing keys kills performance when it comes time to do the data mining. So... two databases. Capture all the data into the insert-optimized one. Then have a scheduled job slurp over the day's data capture into the other database, and run your analyses there. As a side effect, this where the "up until yesterday" restriction comes from. Today's data won't be available as it's in a separate database.
