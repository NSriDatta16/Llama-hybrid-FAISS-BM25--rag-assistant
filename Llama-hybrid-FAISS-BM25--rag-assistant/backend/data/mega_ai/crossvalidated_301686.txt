I had exactly the same question as you, and was a bit sad to find out no answers were posted on your topic... That said, I found this paper : One-Vs-All Binarization Technique in the Context of Random Forest ( https://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/Proceedings/esann/esannpdf/es2015-5.pdf ) published in 2015. The authors are showing better classification performances with one-versus-rest Random Forest classifiers compared to standard multiclass Random Forest ones. The authors are not giving many clues on why it works so well, except that the trees generated in the one-versus-rest context are simpler. I am wondering if you found some answers yourself since you posted your question?
