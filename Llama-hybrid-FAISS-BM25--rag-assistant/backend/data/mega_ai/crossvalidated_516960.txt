A GARCH process with constant conditional mean would be an example of a martingale process that is not a random walk*: \begin{aligned} y_t &= \mu+\varepsilon_t, \\ \varepsilon_t &= \sigma_t z_t, \\ \sigma_t^2 &= \omega+\alpha_1\varepsilon_{t-1}^2+\beta_1\sigma_{t-1}^2, \\ z_t &\sim i.i.D(0,1) \end{aligned} where $D$ is some distribution with zero mean and unit variance. It does not have memory in the conditional mean, so it is a martingale, but it does have memory in the conditional variance, so it is not a random walk. *This depends on the exact definition of random walk. Surprisingly, I could not find one (at least explicitly) in Hamilton's "Time Series Analysis" (1994) nor in Tsay's "Analysis of Financial Time Series" (3rd edition, 2010) to mention a couple textbooks I checked. I finally found a relevant discussion in Campbell et al. "The Econometrics of Financial Markets" (1997) p. 31-33. They distinguish between three types of random walk: Type I with i.i.d. increments, Type II with independent increments and Type III with uncorrelated increments. Type I is a subset of Type II which in turn is a subset of Type III. The GARCH model above would be an example of the Type III random walk as defined there. I am not sure how common this terminology is in the field of financial econometrics or in other fields. I would not think processes with dependent increments would usually be classified as random walks.
