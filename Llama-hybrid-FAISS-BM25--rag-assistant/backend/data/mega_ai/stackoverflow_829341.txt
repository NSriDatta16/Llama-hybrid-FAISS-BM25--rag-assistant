What is the proper procedure for offering a patch to the Python documentation?

I'm about to dive into the source code for the cgi.py module again because the MiniFieldStorage class is mentioned in the documentation, but not actually documented. It occurred to me that I have done this so many times that maybe I could write documentation for it. If I did, how should I submit it?
