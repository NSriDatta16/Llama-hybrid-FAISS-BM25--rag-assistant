Why is a random walk not a stationary process?

In the book Analysis of Financial Time Series by Rue Tsay, I read: A time series $\{p_t\}$ is a random walk if it satisfies $p_t = p_{t−1} + a_t$ where $p_0$ is a real number denoting the starting value of the process and $\{a_t\}$ is a white noise series. If $p_t$ is the log price of a particular stock at date $t$ , then $p_0$ could be the log price of the stock $a_t$ its initial public offering (IPO) (i.e., the logged IPO price). If $a_t$ has a symmetric distribution around zero, then conditional on $p_{t−1}$, $p_t$ has a 50–50 chance to go up or down, implying that $p_t$ would go up or down at random. If we treat the random-walk model as a special AR(1) model, then the coefficient of $p_{t−1}$ is unity, which does not satisfy the weak stationarity condition of an AR(1) model. A random-walk series is, therefore, not weakly stationary, and we call it a unit-root nonstationary time series. If $p_t$ has a 50–50 chance of going up or down, then its mean is constant, correct? So if $p_0=1$, and it can go to 0 with a probability of 0.5 or go to 2 with probability of 0.5, then the mean is constant at 1. So why is this not a stationary process?
