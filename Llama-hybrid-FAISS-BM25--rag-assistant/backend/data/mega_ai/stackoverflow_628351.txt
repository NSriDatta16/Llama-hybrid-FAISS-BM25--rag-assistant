It is a mistake to be too flexible. The service should do what the service is meant to do. If the requirements change later, then add a new operation to the service, or better still, add a new version of the service - it's cheap and easy to do so. Also, if you are just starting out, there is no sense in starting in the past. Go straight to WCF, and pay no attention to ASMX web services, which are the next best thing to obsolete - there will be few, if any, enhancements made to them, and maybe only critical security fixes. Basic WCF is simpler, besides. Also, to a large extent, the code you write for the simple case will also be usable, with little or no change, in the more sophisticated cases that may arise later.
