If you have no theoretical model to suggest you possible relationships then stick to non-parametrics: start out with random forests, then if you start spotting some relationships try again with support vector machines. Eventually, if some relationships appear clear, try out logistic regressions. Parametrics will introduce specification errors, but they have clearer meanings and if well specified tend to be better. After you have used a few algorithms, you'll have to choose the one that works best. Cross-Validation is the key tool there. Run the classification algorithms on 90% of the data and use them to predict the rest 10%. The algorithm that predicts better "wins".
