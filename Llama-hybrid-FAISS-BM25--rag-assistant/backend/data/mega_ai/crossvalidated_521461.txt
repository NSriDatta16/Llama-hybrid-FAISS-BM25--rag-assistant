Train a model on batches with multiple epochs vs. each batch with multiple epochs

In traditional supervised learning, say we split the data into $B$ batches, we will go through all these batches with $E$ epochs. The computational cost is $E\times B$ . But what if on each batch, we train the model for $E$ epochs, and then fetch the next batch till we go through all the batches. The computational cost remains the same. I tried it empirically on a neural network, the first method is better than the second one. But will it cause any difference mathematically?
