You’re kind of right, but not totally. There are several ways to design the network. I’ll name three. 1) Domain knowledge. If you know what you’re looking for, you can look for it! 2) Using what has brought success to others on related problems. 3) Cross validation. Let the data guide your decisions. I say you’re kind of right because, for some problems (e.g. MNIST), you can throw just about any CNN at the data and get pretty good performance. You’ll have to work to get world-class performance, but you can do well without having to do much. And you’re also kind of wrong because that last little bit to go from good to world-class requires a mixture of all three of the points I mentioned.
