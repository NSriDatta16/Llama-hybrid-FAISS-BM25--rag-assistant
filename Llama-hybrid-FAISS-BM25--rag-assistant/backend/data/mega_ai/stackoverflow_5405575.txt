First I think most answers are correct from what I can Read. (display: inline) But i think you should reconsider how you do this. You have margin left: 340px on your header. I guess u have the same on your paragraph to? It works. But I think you should divide everything in to i.e. articles (or DIV) and just have a left and right column in this Article area. Then you donÂ´t need to set all these specific margins etc on each element. Also you should reconsider have paragraphs and headings instead of DIV in your HTML. Also, there is no need for "titlesmedium" if you have . article.anygoodname h1{ ... article.anygoodname p{ .... etc Good luck!
