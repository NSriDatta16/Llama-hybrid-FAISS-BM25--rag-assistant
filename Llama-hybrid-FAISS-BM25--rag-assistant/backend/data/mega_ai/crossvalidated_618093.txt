Yes, if your numerical models are deterministic, it makes perfect sense to set the noise variance to zero at both levels. It may sound like a contradiction but it is not: by doing so, you are simply indicating that, at each level $t$ , you are making "exact" (noiseless) observations of the corresponding function $f_t$ . As a consequence, the resulting surrogate model will be interpolating in the following sense: if you have observed $y_i = f_{t_i}(x_i)$ and ask for a prediction of the model response at level $t = t_i$ and input $x = x_i$ , the predicted value will be $y_i$ . (Of course,the predicted value will not, in general, be the same if you make a prediction at a different level $t' \neq t_i$ .) Note that it is not mandatory to use an noiseless/interpolating GP model when the measurement are "exact" (deterministic numerical model). Indeed, even then, it is sometimes beneficial to create a surrogate model that is an approximation but not an interpolation. In this vein you can look for instance at the following papers: Gramacy & Lee (2012). Cases for the nugget in modeling computer experiments . Statistics and Computing, 22:713–722. DOI:10.1007/s11222-010-9224-x ⇒ In this paper the authors argue that using a non-zero nugget might be beneficial for the global approximation quality of the surrogate model, if when the numerical model is deterministic. Petit et al (2022). Relaxed Gaussian process interpolation: a goal-oriented approach to Bayesian optimization . arXiv:2206.03034 ⇒ In this paper we propose a more sophisticated approach to relax the interpolation constraint only outside a particular region of interest. This is suitable, for instance, if the resulting GP model is meant to be used in Bayesian optimization or set inversion.
