Here is a small Neural Network (image link ): So, there are 12 weights between the input layer and the hidden layer. If you change input size from 3 to 4, the number of weights between input layer and hidden layer will increase to 16 . So, when your input samples are different, the number of weights in your model are also different. But, training Neural Network simple means updating weights . Then, how you would update your weights if every input sample generates different number of weights? Same logic applies to Convolutional Neural Network.
