Seems to me that one solid point in favor of MVC is that you may not need to customize the model (or the controller - of which you want only one) if all the user needs is a different view. Multiple models would appear only if the storage (persistence) architecture dictated a need for it. Some feature like data access objects (DAO) would potentially appear as another tier, between the controller and the model,should you require multiple models. Take a look at the Apache Struts project for examples. As stated in Struts for Newbies , "To use Struts well, it's important to have a good grasp of the fundamentals. Start by reviewing the Key Technologies primer , and studying any unfamiliar topics." For another resource, see Web-Tier Application Framework Design (Sun J2EE Blueprints)
