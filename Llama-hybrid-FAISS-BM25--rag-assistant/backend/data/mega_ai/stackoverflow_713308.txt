Only a hint... once we had a project that suffered major GC problems (Websphere and IBM JDK) due to heap fragmentation. At the end, we added a JDK switch to force heap compaction. The Sun JDK does not tent to have a fragmented heap, but the IBM JDK does due to the different memory/GC handling. Just give it a try... I cannot remember the magic switch.
