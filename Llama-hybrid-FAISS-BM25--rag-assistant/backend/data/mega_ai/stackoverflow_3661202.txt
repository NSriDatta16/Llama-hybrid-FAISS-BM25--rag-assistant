Perl 5 really doesn't have macros (there are source filters, but they are dangerous and ugly, so ugly even I won't link you to the documentation). A function may be the right choice, but you will find that it makes it harder for new people to read your code. A better option may be to use the autodie pragma (it is core as of Perl 5.10.1) and just cut out the or die part. Another option, if you use Vim , is to use snipMate . You just type fw FP outfile and it produces open my $FP, '>', $outfile or die "Couldn't open $outfile for writing: $!\n"; The snipMate text is snippet fw open my $${1:filehandle}, ">", $${2:filename variable} or die "Couldn't open $$2 for writing: $!\n"; ${3} I believe other editors have similar capabilities, but I am a Vim user.
