Open source examples of well written SCM web interface in Perl

Can anyone point me to some good Open Source web interface for VCS (version control system) written in Perl? Something well written, so I can examine the code and steal the best parts (or organization) for gitweb. Preferably something without tons of external dependences not available in (extended) Perl core.
