Create a new project in XCode, using the templates provided - find one that has a box to check for using Core Data for storage. That gives you an xcdatamodel file, and some code/class variables in the application delegate that you can copy from that project into your current one. I also highly recommend the Apple tutorial mentioned by nall. If you do decide to just use SQLLite directly instead, strongly consider using FMDB , which simplifies SQL code. It's one file you add to a project.
