Reporting contrasts between binary probability parameters in Bayesian data analysis - odds ratios or difference in probability?

In a bayesian data analysis, if one is modeling differences in binomial/bernoulli probability parameter differences between populations, is it still standard to report the difference in the binary probability as an odds ratio / relative risk as opposed to a probability difference? Take for example, estimating a set of binomial proportions and computing posterior contrasts between them via a beta-binomial model. The use of the odds ratio in the context of logistic regression makes sense since there's a direct correspondence between the coefficient and the change in the log odds ratio. However, in Bayesian data analyses, I commonly see the posterior distribution shown on a 0-1 scale and the posterior contrasts on the same scale as a posterior distribution. What's the preferred scale on which to present binary probability contrasts in a Bayesian data analysis (and why is it preferred)?
