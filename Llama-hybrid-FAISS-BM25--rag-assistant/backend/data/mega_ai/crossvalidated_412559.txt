Fitted RF: difference between the probabilities in $votes and predict (type="prob")

Say we have a data frame df where diagnosis is the first column. There are only 2 possible values for diagnosis : C and N. We fit a random forest: rf We then extract probabilities in two different ways: probs1 = rf$votes probs2 = predict(rf, df[,-1], type="prob" ) So if we now examine these extracted probabilities: > head(probs1) C N sample1220 0.52095808 0.47904192 sample1831 0.06698565 0.93301435 sample526 0.15286624 0.84713376 sample1225 0.30808081 0.69191919 sample523 0.03910615 0.96089385 sample644 0.97093023 0.02906977 > head(probs2) C N sample1220 0.174 0.826 sample1831 0.028 0.972 sample526 0.734 0.266 sample1225 0.726 0.274 sample523 0.014 0.986 sample644 0.990 0.010 Why are the probabilities in probs2 (from the predict function) different from the ones in probs1 (which are the proportions of votes) ? I thought the probabilities were the proportions of votes, but clearly that's not the case. Could anybody please explain?
