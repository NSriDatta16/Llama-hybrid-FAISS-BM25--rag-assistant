This does not make sense. When you predict the probability, there is not the sense of being right or wrong like there is when you predict a category. Therefore, there is not a notion of recall, let alone consistent estimation of the recall. What might be of interest to you is the calibration of your probability predictions: whether or not a predicted probability of $p$ corresponds with the event happening $p$ proportion of times. Especially for multi-class problems, assessing this seems to be an open problem. Note that random forests are not known for their calibration.
