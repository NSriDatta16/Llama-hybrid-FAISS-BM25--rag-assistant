XSLT output formatting: removing line breaks, and blank output lines from removed elements while keeping indent

Here is my XML: Mr. Title This is one paragraph. Another paragraph. An item paragraph. Another item paragraph Here is my XSL: And the output: Mr. Title This is one paragraph. Another paragraph. An item paragraph. Another item paragraph I would like to change 3 things about this output: remove the line break from the "p" elements (originally paragraph) remove the line breaks from the "li" elements (produced when item/paragraph elements were removed) remove the extra blank lines created when the list items were removed -I have tried for #3, but this messes with the indentation -I have also tried for #1, but this has no effect on the line breaks -And I have tried but this eliminates all indentation Thank you!!
