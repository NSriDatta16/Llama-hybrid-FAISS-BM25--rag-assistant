My advice is: Do not believe any data stored in javascript, cookies or any other local storage where user have access. All security issues have to be maintained on server side and any changing (I do not mean session id for example, because it is hard to know valid sid to hack it) of local data must not grant more privileges or access to protected data. In your case - What will happen when user will change data in ajax call? What is in newtval variable?
