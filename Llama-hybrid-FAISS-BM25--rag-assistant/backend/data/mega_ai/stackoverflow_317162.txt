If you simply need to generate XML (no parsing or editing needed) the fastest way to do this is using an XmlWriter (It's more elegant and faster than your second example using strings and much less error prone because you do not have to worry about keeping your document well-formed): // Create an XmlWriterSettings object with the correct options. var settings = new XmlWriterSettings(); settings.Indent = true; settings.IndentChars = ("\t"); settings.OmitXmlDeclaration = true; // Create the XmlWriter object and write some content. using (var writer = XmlWriter.Create("data.xml", settings)) { writer.WriteStartElement("book"); writer.WriteElementString("item", "tesing"); writer.WriteEndElement(); writer.Flush(); } If you already have an object model to serialize, you could think of using an XmlSerializer, which is however - at least from my experience - much slower than XmlWriter and is only easy to use on simple object models.
