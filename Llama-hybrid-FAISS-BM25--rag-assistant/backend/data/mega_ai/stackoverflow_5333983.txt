In VS 2010 you can use code coverage together with unit tests for that - so if you can refactor your client code into actual unit tests you can use that. To quote from MSDN : To determine what proportion of your project's code is actually being tested using unit tests, you can use the code coverage feature of Visual Studio Application Lifecycle Management. To do this, first edit the run configuration to indicate the assembly that contains the code whose coverage you want to measure. Then run tests on that code. Detailed code coverage statistics appear in a window, and you can also see, line-by-line, which code has been tested.
