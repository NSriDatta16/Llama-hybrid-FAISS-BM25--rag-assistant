I'm just learning Timeseries now but found this wonderful paper: Caporin and Sartore use the term back-calculation. They acknowledge it's not a common term, noting other used terms: retropolation, reconstruction, and back-casting (ARIMA). see end of section 2: Caporin, M., & Sartore, D. (2006). Methodological aspects of time series back-calculation.
