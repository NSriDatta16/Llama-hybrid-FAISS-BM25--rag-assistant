I think you dont have enought information to answer 3rd question. You want to use "increase", but it requires time series or more data to check on how proportion was changing. In your case you may only say that "on the average" there is 12.92% more students in India than in the whole dataset (world etc). From that, perspective option 1) is more reasonable because you compare number of students to the sample.
