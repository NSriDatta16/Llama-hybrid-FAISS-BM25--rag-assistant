How to handle exact UITouch of image?

I have an image for example triangle and place it inside UIImageView, and I have a touch and drag application, I can already drag the triangle but my problem is I can still drag the triangle even if I'm not actually touching the triangle, (Im touching the upper left of the triangle image) I think this is because the UIImageView itself is a square so although I have not touch the triangle image but I have touch the square UIImageView that's why I can still drag it w/o touching the triangle, So the question would be how can I make this accurate, like I can only drag it if I have touch the triangle image and not really the square ImageView? Hopeful for all your help.
