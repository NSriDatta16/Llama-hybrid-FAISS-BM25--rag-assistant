Yes, there are reasons. As I saw many questions about scaling, I ended up writing a small article about scaling here . In short: Scaling may be a pure waste of time (especially true for decision tree based methods). Scaling may harm you performance (think about image classification) When scaling, you have to pay extra attention to constant columns / NAs... (though this can be handled writing more tests)
