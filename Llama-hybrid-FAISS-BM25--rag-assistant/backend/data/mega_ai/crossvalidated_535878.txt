The odds ratio modelled by logistic regression is not between X and Y but between Y and "not Y". Actually it's not an "odds ratio" but just log odds (the odds themselves are a ratio). In fact, mathematically, in case of a single binary explanatory variable, the logistic regression is directly related to the odds ratio, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression#The_odds_ratio , but this does not hold with multiple explanatory variables.
