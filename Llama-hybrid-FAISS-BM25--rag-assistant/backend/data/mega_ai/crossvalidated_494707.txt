Is there a law or concept related to unchanging average?

I have a survey comprising 30 questions with 50k respondents where respondents mark each answer on a 5 point scale. An average of all the questions for all the respondents is metric we track monthly. We compare the month on month average of all the questions. Lately, we have felt that the average is unchanging. Though the sub themes scores do vary, the overall mean/average is more or less constant. A sub theme is collection of 4-5 similar questions. I would like to investigate it further on reasons on why it doesn't seem to budge. I have come across The law of large numbers Central limit theorem Concepts related to stock index of multiple stocks which I do not fully understand But I feel that the above concepts cannot explain this fully. I suspect that we have reached a potential maximum (Current average of 4) for the average for a survey, although it is not close to the theoretical maximum (Average of 5). Is there a way to test this or do you have any other possible explanations for it not changing?
