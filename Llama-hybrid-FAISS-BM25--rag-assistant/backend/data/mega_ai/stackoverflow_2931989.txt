which time series class to use in R for financial data?

for working with financial time series, like daily stock prices or intraday data, which time series packages are preferred? xts, plain zoo, or timeSeries or something else? I use both xts and zoo, but sometimes not sure to use xts exclusively or sometimes zoo have advantage of lighter overhead; also, I remembered a review paper on all these packages by Rmetrics, which claims that xts cannot even finish some tests they did. But I cannot find the paper now.
