Convert two categoricals variables to numeric one - PCA FactoMineR

I am currently working on the CPA with R and I have a problem. My data are all numerical, except for two columns that represent a "category" (the sampling site and the land use type) At first I foolishly replaced these data with numerical identifiers (A:1, B:2, C:3 ...), but this method implies that A Is there a way to convert a text data into a numerical data without biasing the results to make a PCA ? Thank you.
