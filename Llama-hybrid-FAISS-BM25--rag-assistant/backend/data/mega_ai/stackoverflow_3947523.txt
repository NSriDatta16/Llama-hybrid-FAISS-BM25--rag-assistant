I had a discussion on my blog a little while back about this: http://rosshawkins.net/archive/2009/12/24/notesdomino-refactoringanalysis-tools.aspx However what I've ended up doing in the past is exporting the design to the filesystem and using standard text tools (WinMerge and SublimeText for me personally) to do what I need. Being able to do the raw dump is something that was added with the Eclipse based designer, and isn't overly obvious, but you can read more about it here: rosshawkins.net/archive/2010/01/20/searching-the-contents-of-notesdomino-design-elements.aspx (link mangled as my rep is too low to post 2 links in one post yet!)
