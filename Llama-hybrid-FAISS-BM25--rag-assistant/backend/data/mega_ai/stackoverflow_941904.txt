I could reproduce this issue by creating an enumeration with a non-static member class and a static block enumerating its values: public enum Foo { Dummy(new Bar [] {new Bar()}); static { for (Foo foo: Foo.values()); } private Foo(Bar [] params) {} public class Bar {} } This class breaks the Ganymede compiler. If you delete the line in the static initializer block, the code compiles correctly again, and you get the error that there is no enclosing instance for the new Bar() call, as expected. -- correction: The above holds only if the project has gaeNature from Google Appengine. However, if you get an error similar as mentioned in the original question, you might be encountering another java compiler bug ...
