lmer for repeated measures in complete block design

I've got a completely randomized block design with 4 treatments and 3 replications (blocks). I figured that a mixed model with repeated measures as random terms should be appropriate to analyse this design. We have measured each plot (4 treatments x 3 replications = 12 plots), using means of 3 animals per plot, 4 times per year (Time, every 28 days). We are evaluating the average daily gain (ADG) of animals. Is my model correct? fit1
