For our application, we had a client server architecture and we only allowed decrypting/encrypting data in the server level. Hence the JCE files are only needed there. We had another problem where we needed to update a security jar on the client machines, through JNLP, it overwrites the libraries in ${java.home}/lib/security/ and the JVM on first run. That made it work.
