differenced variables in VAR model

everybody. I'm running a VAR model. I checked out the stationarity with the Dickie Fuller test. Test rejects the Ho of nonstationarity when I differenced the variables twice, so I used twice differenced variables But I don't quite get the interpretation of the resulting parameters, they cannot be the same that in OLS. I'm under the impression that differentiating the variables makes me lose the information of the original variables. For instance, observing the time series of GDP per capita and expenditure in education, I observed a positive trend, so they would seem positively correlated. But when running the VAR, it would give me a negative coefficient for education, and that does not make much sense. Thanks for your comments.
