That would require most certainly some kind of script. A bit like this commandline-fu for k in `git branch|perl -pe s/^..//`;do echo -e `git show --pretty=format:"%Cgreen%ci %Cblue%cr%Creset" $k|head -n 1`\\t$k;done|sort -r (not exactly what you are after but can gives you an idea nonetheless) I know about GitStats which has also data organized by date (but not the commit messages) Note: the git branch part of this command is ill-fitted for scripting, as Jakub NarÄ™bski comments. git for-each-ref or git show-ref are natural candidate for scripting commands, being plumbing commands.
