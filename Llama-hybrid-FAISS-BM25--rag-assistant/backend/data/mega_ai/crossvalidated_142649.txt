I think this problem is very similar to keywords/keyphrases extraction problem. Keywords extraction is well studied task (see for example this paper for review). Possible approaches include heuristics, supervised machine learning (with a number of special feautures like TD/IDF, position in the sentence and other) and language models. Powerful keywords/keyphrases extraction tools exist, thus one can try them first, and see if they do job well.
