Is a preference for brute force solutions a bad sign?

I'm a beginner C++ programmer, and to stretch my mind I've been trying some of the problems on projecteuler.net . Despite an interest in maths at school, I've found myself automatically going for brute force solutions to the problems, rather than looking for something streamlined or elegant. Does this sound like a bad mindset to have? I feel a bit guilty doing it like this, but maybe quick and dirty is OK some of the time...
