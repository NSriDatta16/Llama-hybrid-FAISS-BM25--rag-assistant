Is it possible to create a neural network, which behaves like $f(x) = x$?

Let's assume $x \in R, 0 The neural network has one input and one output, and contains one or more hidden layer. is it possible to create a network, where if the input is x, then the output is also x? $f(x) \approx x$ Edit The sigmoid function is: $\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$
