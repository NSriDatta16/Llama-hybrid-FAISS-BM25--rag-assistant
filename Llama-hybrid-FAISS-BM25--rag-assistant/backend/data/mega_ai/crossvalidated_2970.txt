Just a guess. First I would explore transformations of the data, such as converting time to speed or acceleration. Then I would consider the log of that, since it obviously won't be negative. Then, since you are interested in the asymptote, I would try fitting (by least squares) a simple exponential to the transformed data, with time t being the x axis, and log-transformed speed (or acceleration) being the y axis. See how that works in predicting new measurements as time increases. A possible alternative to an an exponential function would be a Michaelis-Menten type of hyperbola. Actually, I would strongly consider a mixed-effect population approach first (as with NONMEM), because each individual may not show enough information to evaluate different models. If you want to go Bayesian, you could use WinBugs, and provide any prior distribution you want to the parameters of the exponential function. The book I found useful is Gilks, Richardson, Spiegelhalter, "Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice", Chapman & Hall, 1996.
