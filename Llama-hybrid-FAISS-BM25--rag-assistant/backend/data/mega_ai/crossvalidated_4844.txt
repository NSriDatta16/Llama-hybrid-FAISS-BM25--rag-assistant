Confidence interval based on time series

I have a timeseries of data which was gathered by driving a car around randomly. One data point was gathered every minute and each data point is either "Yes" or "No". Yes = temperature is above a threshold, No = it is below the threshold. Assume the car never stops. I'm interested in the proportion of Yeses and related confidence intervals. I'm inclined to use binomial confidence intervals except that it seems to me that the data points are not independent. Would the fact that the data was gathered by driving around randomly buy me independence? How could I derive meaningful confidence intervals?
