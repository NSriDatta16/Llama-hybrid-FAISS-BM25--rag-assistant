I think that a Bayesian approach may solve your problem. But it depends on how many data you have. I ned did it, but I guesst's possible to estimate a hierarchical model, in which data are nested by country or time. For example, assume you have $i = 1, 2, ..., n$ countries and $t = 1, 2, ..., T$ years. For country $j$ you don't have information for year $l$ and for country $k$ you don't have information for year $m$. So, you would have a model like this: $y_{it} \sim N(a + b_{t}*x_{it})$ $b_{t} \sim N(0, sigma^{2})$ $sigma^{2} \sim Unif(0, 100)$ $x_{jk} \sim N(0, 100)$ $x_{lm} \sim N(0, 100)$ The details of the priors will depend of your theory and your data. It is fairly simple to estimate this model using WinBugs or Jags (so you don't have to worry about the MCMC machinery).
