How would a drift diffusion model explain effects in reaction time but not accuracy?

How would a drift-diffusion model explain a case where a variable has an effect in reaction time but not in accuracy. I know that one explanation would be a speed-accuracy tradeoff, in which the decision boundaries are so far apart that there are unlikely to be any incorrect answers. But, is there another way that doesn't involve such a trade-off?
