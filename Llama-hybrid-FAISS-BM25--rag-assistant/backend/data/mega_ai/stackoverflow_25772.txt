As mentioned also, a grayscale translation (note that monochromatic images need not to be in grayscale) from an RGB-triplet is subject to taste. For example, you could cheat, extract only the blue component, by simply throwing the red and green components away, and copying the blue value in their stead. Another simple and generally ok solution would be to take the average of the pixel's RGB-triplet and use that value in all three components. The fact that there's a considerable market for professional and not-very-cheap-at-all-no-sirree grayscale/monochrome converter plugins for Photoshop alone, tells that the conversion is just as simple or complex as you wish.
