There's no single answer to optimizing a regex. You can watch what a particular regex is doing with the re pragma: use re 'debugcolor'; Once you see what it traverses the string, you see where it is having problems and adjust your regex from there. You'll learn a little about the regex engine as you do that. You should also check out Mastering Regular Expressions , which tells you how regular expressions work and why some patterns are slower than others.
