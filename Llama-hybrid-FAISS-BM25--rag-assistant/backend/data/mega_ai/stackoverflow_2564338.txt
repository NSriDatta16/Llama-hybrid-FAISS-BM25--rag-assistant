Hmm, domain model. Modeling is a an abstraction technique in which we create representation of real objects, which will abstract from (omit) unnecessary details (so usually we have to specify important aspects beforehand). Domain is a certain area of business. The problem is, that there might be different views on the domain even in one organization and different viewpoints, so it is hard to define important aspects and therefore model. The issue which is even worse, is that tis domain and those viewpoints change in time and therefore model might change in time - this is important when we talk about business agility. I personally think, that domain models, especially when they need to be used for certain purpose, are too fluent. It is imho better to capture the current state and view of/on domain for given purpose at demand.
