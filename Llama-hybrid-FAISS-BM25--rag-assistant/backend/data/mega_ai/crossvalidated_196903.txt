So a one standard deviation increase of the log-transformed variable translates to 2,706 likes. Is this ok? You were careful to formulate your statement with 'increase of of log-transformed variable' qualifier. I think this eliminates misunderstanding that could have occurred to a reader who may assume that you're trying to calculate the standard deviation of $Y$. You're clearly not trying to do that . You use a word 'translates', which is not a standard term thus indicating that you're not transforming variables and converting the statistics between these variables by 'standard' means. Compare your procedure to what's described in " SAS/ETS 12.1 Users Guide ", p.252 The log transformation is often used to convert time series that are nonstationary with respect to the innovation variance into stationary time series. The usual approach is to take the log of the series in a DATA step and then apply PROC ARIMA to the transformed data. A DATA step is then used to transform the forecasts of the logs back to the original units of measurement. The confidence limits are also transformed by using the exponential function . The highlighted [by me] sentence essentially describes what you're doing. Hence, what you are doing is not wrong, whether it's right is an interesting question. It depends on the interpretations and the intended use. One more thing (c) The estimator of the mean of the original variable $Y$ is not necessarily $e^{\overline{\ln Y}}$. I'm using a soft language here, because there's this seemingly obvious estimator $$\hat\mu_Y=\exp\left(\hat\mu_{\ln Y}+\hat\sigma^2_{\ln Y}/2\right)$$ It is based on the exact relationship for log-normal distribution: $$E[Y]=\exp\left(E[\ln Y]+\sigma^2_{\ln Y}/2\right)$$ However, this estimator is not always the best one in practice for the variance $\sigma^2_{\ln Y}$ is unknown, and has to be estimated. Once you start using the estimator of the variance, things get complicated, as shown in the empirical paper by Helmut Lutkepohl and Fang Xu. " The role of the log transformation in forecasting economic variables ." Empirical Economics, 42(3):619{638, 2012. The following, naive , estimator of the mean may end up being the best in such cases: $$\hat\mu_Y'=\exp\left(\hat\mu_{\ln Y}\right)$$ I went to write about the means because when you talk about the 'translation' of the standard deviation increase, you need to mention what is the base. You assumed rather implicitly that the increase is from the point of the naive estimator above. As I wrote it is not wrong, but you have to clearly state that it's what you used, otherwise your reader may assume that you're correcting for the variance or that the 2,706 likes increase is from any point (which is not true). For instance, if you apply your equation to the base of 0, you get $$e^{0+0.8}-e^0=2.2$$
