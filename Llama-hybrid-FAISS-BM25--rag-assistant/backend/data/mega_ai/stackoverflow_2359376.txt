You get a NullPointerException because you are instantiating your BookService with a new() - which is basically wrong - and nothing gets injected in the EJB. EJB are component that are managed by the container and should be obtained either via injection or with a lookup. Here, while the JSP spec allows any code to be run in a scriplet, calling an EJB from a JSP is actually not really encouraged and JSPs don't support injection. In other words, you'll have to use a lookup: But you should call your EJB from a Servlet or a JSF Managed Bean (and your EJB could be injected in such components). If you need some samples, have a look at the Java EE Code Samples & Apps . Update: See How do I access a Local EJB component from a POJO? in the EJB FAQ for more details on JNDI (especially the new portable global JNDI names defined by the EJB 3.1 specification ).
