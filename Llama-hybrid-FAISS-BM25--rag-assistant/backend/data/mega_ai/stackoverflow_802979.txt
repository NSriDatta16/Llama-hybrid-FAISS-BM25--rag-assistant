Your program exhibits undefined behavior specifically because: you fail to include or depending on the language you are compiling your code as printf and all variable argument functions do not have the capacity to type-check their arguments. Hence it is obligatory on your part to pass correctly typed arguments. You really should do: system() has no declaration in scope. Include or as the case maybe. Write your code as: #include int main() { /* ... */ printf("%p %p %p\n", (void *)foo, (void *)&i, (void *)main); /* ... */ } Also note that: The definition of void foo() is not a prototype in C, but in C++. However, if you were to write void foo(void) you'd get a prototype in both languages. system() is implementation dependent -- your code may not behave as expected across platforms. The language proper(C or C++) does not put any restrictions on how to organize memory. It does not even have the concept of a stack or a heap. These are defined by implementations as they deem fit. You should ideally consult documentation provided by your implementation to get a fair idea of what they do.
