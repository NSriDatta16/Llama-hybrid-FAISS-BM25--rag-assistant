Calculate conditional probabilities on a logistic regression

I am analysing data of an digital advertising tool. I have access to all the exposures for each of the 6 channels (x1, x2, .., x6) of an online campaign. The outcome is the conversion (y=1 or 0) on the website. My goal is to calculate an attribution model and credit each of the channels with the number of conversions that he deserves. I started by creating a logistic regression between the numbers of exposures by channel (x1,..,x6) to explain the conversion. Coef S.E. Wald Z Pr(>|Z|) Intercept -6.7910 0.0938 -72.36 In order to give credit to each of the channels, Iâ€™d like to use the Shapley Value, applied to the different conditional probabilities. So I am calculating now these conditional probabilities but I am not sure how that my formula is the right one. For example, if I want to know the probability of users to convert if exposed to channel 1, then the formula will be: $$P(Y|X_1 = x_1) = \text{mean}\big(\frac{e^{-6.7910 + 0.0756x_1}}{1+e^{-6.7910 + 0.0756x_1}}\big)$$ For all the x1 values of my data. To calculate P(Y|X1 and X2) then I will to the same but with X1 and X2 values. I am not entirely sure of the method, could someone confirm to me that it is the right way to calculate conditional probabilities on a logistic regression?
