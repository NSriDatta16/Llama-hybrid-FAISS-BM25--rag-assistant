live() might only be considered inefficient if: There is a small amount of elements to be bound to an event ( The number of these target elements stays fixed. If your use case meets the criteria above (especially #2) you should stick to binding straight to the elements and avoid live() . An example of benchmarking the performance of live() you can try is by profiling a fragment of code that uses live() to bind a click handler to an element and also profile another fragment of code that uses click() to bind to that same element. I'm not too sure what end result you'll have but I'm sure it'll be interesting.
