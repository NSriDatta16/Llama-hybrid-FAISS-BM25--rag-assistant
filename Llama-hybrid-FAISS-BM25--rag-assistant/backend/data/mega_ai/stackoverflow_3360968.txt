Python how to search and correct html tags and attributes?

I have to fix all the closing tags of the tag as shown in the text below. Instead of closing the with a > , it should close with /> . Is there any easy way to search for all the in this text and fix the > ? (If it is closed with a /> already then there is no action required). Other question, if there is no "width" or "height" to the specified, what is the best way to solve the issue? Download all the images and get the corresponding attributes of width and height, then add them back to the string? The correct tag is the one that closes with /> and have the valid width & height. Apple today unleashed a number of goodies, including giving iMacs and Mac Pros more oomph with new processors and increased storage options. We have those deals today, along with many more items for the Mac lover. Along with the refreshed line of iMacs and Mac Pros, weâ€™ll also look at a number of software deals [...] I really need to have width and height in the output, because it will be used as the input to other parser. And that parser says that the tag MUST close with a /> . I am not using the output to view on the web page. Please suggest a simple solution to achieve this!
