Confusion about Moving Average(MA) Process

Let's assume there is a time series Y of length n with Y(1) being the most recent observation. In MA process we plot auto-correlation function (ACF) to see how many lags to use. If we look at MA(3) process for example that implies the correlation between: Y(1:n-1) and Y(2:n) Y(1:n-2) and Y(3:n) Y(1:n-3) and Y(4:n) are significant. So shouldn't MA process look something like: Y(t) = a0 + a1.Y(t-1) + a2.Y(t-2) + a3.Y(t-3) instead of: Y(t) = a0 + a1.ep(t-1) + a2.ep(t-2) + a3.ep(t-3) where ep ~ N(0,1) After all we see a direct correlation between Y(t) and it's lagged observation.
