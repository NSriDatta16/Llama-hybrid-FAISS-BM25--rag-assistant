auto.arima with an input of another series

Two time series, which are related to each other. I want to see if "order" helps in predicting sales , by running auto.arima with and without the input of order . sales auto.arima without the input. auto.arima(sales_ts) Series: sales_ts ARIMA(0,1,0) with drift Coefficients: drift 7.7647 s.e. 2.6222 sigma^2 estimated as 124.2: log likelihood=-64.59 AIC=133.18 AICc=134.04 BIC=134.85 auto.arima with the input of a series. auto.arima(sales_ts, xreg = order_ts) Series: sales_ts Regression with ARIMA(0,0,0) errors Coefficients: intercept xreg -146.8293 5.0626 s.e. 16.4214 0.3521 sigma^2 estimated as 135.7: log likelihood=-68.67 AIC=143.35 AICc=145.06 BIC=146.02 Judged from the AIC values (133.18 vs 143.35). Am I right that the input of the order series is not helpful in fitting the auto.arima for sales ? The ultimate goal is to predict sales . ARIMAX only provides model fitting but no forecast, so I want to see how auto.arima can help in forecasting when combined the 2 series.
