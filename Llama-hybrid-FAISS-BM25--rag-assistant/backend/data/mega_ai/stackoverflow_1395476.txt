Color Interpolation

Okay, so I'm looking at a typical color chooser and it looks something like this: If we deal with only highly saturated colors, the blending pattern behaves like this: R 255 G 0 B 0 R 255 G 0 -> 255 B 0 R 255 G 255 B 0 R 255 -> 0 G 255 B 0 R 0 G 255 B 0 R 0 G 255 B 0 -> 255 R 0 G 255 B 255 R 0 G 255 -> 0 B 255 R 0 G 0 B 255 R 0 -> 255 G 0 B 255 R 255 G 0 B 255 R 255 G 0 B 255 -> 0 R 255 G 0 B 0 Is it possible to define an interpolating function f which takes a value from 0 to 1 and produces a color on this spectrum (where 0 and 1 correspond to the left and right hand sides of the spectrum posted above)? I only care about highly saturated colors (One component is always 255.). Also, I notice that this pattern blends from R to G to B. However, is there also a similar function which blends between cyan, magenta, and yellow? And while this is not correct, if f(0) produced cyan and f(1) produced yellow, then f(0.5) would produce a green color similar to the one you might achieve if you mixed two paints. I hope this makes sense. Please feel free to have me clarify anything. Thanks!
