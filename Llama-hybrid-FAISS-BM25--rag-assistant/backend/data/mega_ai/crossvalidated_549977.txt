How to obtain the 2D decision boundaries of a convolutional neural network for image classification?

In the paper Robust Learning with Jacobian Regularization the authors use a method to visualize the decision boundary of a convolutional neural network for image classification. More specifically, in Figure 1 they explain Cross sections of decision cells in the input space. To make these cross sections for LeNet’ models trained on the MNIST dataset, a test sample (black dot) and a two-dimensional hyperplane ⊂ R 784 passing through it are randomly chosen. Different colors indicate the different classes predicted by these models, transparency and contours are set by maximum of the softmax values, and the circle around the test sample signifies distance to the closest decision boundary in the plane. I did not understand how those cross sections were obtained. I understand that in the case of a 2D input I just have to take a sample, produce some perturbations around that sample and classify them. But in the case of a 28x28 image, how can I obtain a 2D sample and perturbate it?
