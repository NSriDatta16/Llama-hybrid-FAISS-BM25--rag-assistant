Selectors with arguments in Obj-C

So basically I have a big list of buttons that's present dropdowns and other things, and these buttons are created dynamically. So to capture the value for the appropriate button's data, I need to set it's action selector to a function that takes 1 extra parameter. For example, using this selector on this dropdown, with the method below, returns an error that the selector is unrecognized. How can I get the selector to recognize the parameter I'm passing in? (In this case the variable 'name') The apple docs at: http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/ocSelectors.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001163-CH23-SW1 On the last paragraph in the header 'The Target-Action Design Pattern', the Apple Docs imply that this can be done, but do not give an example of using a custom message, or maybe I'm just misunderstanding? SEL sel = @selector(openDropdown:name:); [dropdownSelector addTarget:self action:sel forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside]; -(void) openDropdown: (NSString *) anotherArg : (id) sender { // Stuff here based on anotherArg }
