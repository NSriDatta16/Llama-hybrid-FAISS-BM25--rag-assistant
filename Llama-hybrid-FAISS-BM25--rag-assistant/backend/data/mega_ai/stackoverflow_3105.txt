You could try using Alice . It's a 3D program designed for use in introductory programming classes. The two biggest obstacles for new programmers are often: syntax errors motivation (writing something meaningful and fun rather than contrived) Alice uses a drag and drop interface for constructing programs, avoiding the possibility of syntax errors. Alice lets you construct 3D worlds and have your code control (simple) 3D characters and animation, which is usually a lot more interesting than implementing linked lists. Experienced programmers may look down at Alice as a toy and scoff at dragging and dropping lines of code, but research shows that this approach works. Disclaimer: I worked on Alice.
