Is there a better way to serially submit multiple AJAX requests?

I have a page with multiple forms that I submit via Ajax POSTs serially. At first, I tried using synchronous XHR requests, but this causes the browser to lock up for the duration of the request, and breaks my DOM-manipulation effects, which is unacceptable. So the pattern I ended up using is basically this: var fcount = 0; // incremented for each form to be submitted function submit_form( num ) { var fdata = { ... }; // data from form # num $.ajax( { async: true, url: '/index.cgi', data: fdata, type: 'POST', success: function() { if ( num The recursion strikes me as a bit of an ugly solution to what is essentially an iterative problem. Is there a cleaner or more elegant way that this could be handled?
