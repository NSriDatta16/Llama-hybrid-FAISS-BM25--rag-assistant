Because the cosine measure is not linear, an embedding can have an expected cosine distance greater than the expected distance in a set of uniformly distributed vectors. When measuring the expectation in a trained embedding, the expectation will be greater than the average distance of $v$ and $d$ . The fact that the expectation of a uniform random set of vectors is smaller, has nothing to do with that. Everything is as it should be.
