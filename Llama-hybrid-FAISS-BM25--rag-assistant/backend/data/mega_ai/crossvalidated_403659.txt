Simple time series identification tools that assume that seasonality is auto-projective are often simply overmatched by the data. Check the assumptions underlying all tools. Many time series are affected by monthly determinstic structure e.g. a Dec effect or a June effect . In both cases the original acf/pacf seasonality suggestion/hint may be obfuscated by unusual values (pulses) or level/step shifts or local time trends or changes in model error variance or parameters over time. Build your model iteratively following this paradigm https://autobox.com/pdfs/ARIMA%20FLOW%20CHART.pdf ultimately yielding a white-noise error process.
