I think you're coming at this from the wrong angle. You're asking how to find the memory footprint without using XCode. I think the question you should be asking is: why can you not use XCode? Presumably that's what you used to develop the application in the first place? Without XCode you're pretty much flying blind. You say you halved the size of your textures, but how do you know? Does your app release any extraneous memory when it gets a low memory warning? ( applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning: ) First, have you looked at the crash logs from when you run your app from XCode? You should be able to see them in the Organiser in XCode. I'm not sure there's a single solution to stop your app crashing with XCode. Normally when my iPhone won't allow debugging I just restart xCode and my handset and it starts working again. Restarting XCode sometimes helps. I would also try reinstalling both XCode and the iPhone SDK.
