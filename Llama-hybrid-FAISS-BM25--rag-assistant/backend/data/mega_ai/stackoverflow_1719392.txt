Open complex file:// uri in new Firefox tab on OS X

I need a way to open a new URL in firefox from the shell on OS X. The normal way I do this is with the open command ... but the open command doesn't seem to pass query/fragment values when the location is a file: uri. Granted, this a bit of an abuse of a file uri, but if you give either FF or Safari the URI in the loc bar, they (seem to) work fine. But it appears open won't pass it. I looked at bit at applescript, but couldn't figure out how to tell FF to open a new url, not recent versions of FF anyway. open must be communicating with the running firefox to open new urls but heck if I can figure out how it's doing it.
