Reporting Services 2008 Chart DynamicHeight Property Creates Extra Space

I have a bar chart with horizontal bars. I used this article to setup the dynamic height property: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/robertbruckner/archive/2008/10/27/charts-with-dynamic-size-based-on-categories-or-data.aspx Everything looks fine in the viewer , but as soon as you go to print layout, pdf, et.al there is about 50% more blank space below the chart. I've created a sample report (using AdventureWorks DB) to show what is happening. I placed 3 charts with blue backgrounds, each inside its own rectangle with gray backgrounds. The first chart has an expression in the DynamicHeight property, the second chart has a hard coded value in the DynamicHeight property of 8.5in, and the third chart has a blank DynamicHeight and a 8.5in in the normal Height property. I have it return 15 items to place in the chart. They all look fine in the viewer like I said before, but go to Print Layout and the first and second charts take up twice the space with half of it being blank below the report. I tried to post the .rdl code, but its too much for the size limit. I have an open ticket to Microsoft that has been escalated. We've filed the necessary request to get collaboration from our development team so we should be getting a response regarding this functionality sometime in the next couple days. I'll let you know what they say. Development has later confirmed it was definitely a bug, now are trying to decide if it is worth it to add to the next cumulative update or wait until SSRS 2010.
