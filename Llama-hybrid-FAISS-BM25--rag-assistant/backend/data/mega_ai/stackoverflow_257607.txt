So I took a software testing class link text and basically what you want is to identify the class of inputs.. all real numbers? all integers, only positive, only negative,etc... Then group the output actions. is 360 uniquely different from 359 or do they pretty much end up doing the same thing to the app. Once there do a combination of inputs to outputs. This all seems abstract and vague but until you provide the method code it's difficult to come up with a perfect strategy. Another way is to do branch level testing or predicate coverage testing. code coverage isn't fool proof but not covering all your code seems irresponsible.
