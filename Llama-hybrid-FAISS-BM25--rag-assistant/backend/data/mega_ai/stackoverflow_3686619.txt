Cloud machine for Windows .NET app

I am currently running a new .NET application on an Amazon instance. I really like it, as it comes with Windows 2k8, IIS7 and SQL server pre-installed. However, it's costing a bit, at about $90/month for a small instance, which is catagorized as: "Small Instance (Default) 1.7 GB of memory, 1 EC2 Compute Unit (1 virtual core with 1 EC2 Compute Unit), 160 GB of local instance storage, 32-bit platform" Is there a cheaper alternative (VPS??) to the above Amazon EC2 service? I would prefer a service people have had experience/success with, not necessarily the dirt cheapest on the market.
