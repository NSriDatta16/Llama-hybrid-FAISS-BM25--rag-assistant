How good is Mootools backward compatibility?

A coworker of mine has had issue with Mootools being backward compatible and I was wondering if anyone else had noticed this? He said that his main problem was when trying to using the drag and drop functionality offered in an older version. I never really looked into it myself, but when I mentioned it when asking the same question for JQuery others did not seem to have the same problem. So Stackoverflow have you ever noticed an issue with Mootools backward compatibility?
