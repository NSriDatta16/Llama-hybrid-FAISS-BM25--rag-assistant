When should ordinal data be represented catigorically and when as integer?

I am doing the Kaggle competition House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques to learn more about data analysis. I would like to apply multiple models to the data(Regularized LR, Random Forests, Neural Networks, and ensemble methods). When inspecting the data, I found many fields were ordinal data represented as categorical data. Two examples: HeatingQC: Heating quality and condition Ex Excellent Gd Good TA Average/Typical Fa Fair Po Poor LotShape: General shape of property Reg Regular IR1 Slightly irregular IR2 Moderately Irregular IR3 Irregular I was wondering whether I should keep the fields like this, or whether I should turn encode them as integers(i.e. give each class in the category a number like 1,2,3 or 4) . Since the question probably is 'it depends', I hope you could give me some more general insight in when I should keep this data ordinal, or when to transform it into integers.
