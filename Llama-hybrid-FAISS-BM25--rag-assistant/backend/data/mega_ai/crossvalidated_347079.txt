How random forest apply on clustering technique to check the accuracy of the method

I have the following codes and want to apply random forest classifier by one of a simple function. Actually, x is my clustering technique and y is the response in the training set. Then to find coefficient by glm method to select only the genes that have a contribution. reduced_data is the combination of my method that for features selection i:e. "Selection" and "oderedfeatures". Here they give an error which I closed in steric sign. I have total $72$ samples in the data. How have gene number 4847 differed length? Because if you observe the following samples all have the same in size. anyone help/suggest me. Thanks in advance for your consideration. cv.fit > Error in model.frame.default(formula = y ~ ., data = list( gene 4847 = c(0.102796, : variable lengths differ (found for 'gene 4847') reduced_data gene 4847 gene 15 gene 888 gene 1058 gene 4787 sample 1 0.102796 0.495544 0.928571 0.513619 0.540698 sample 2 0.178811 0.424242 1.000000 0.322957 0.127907 sample 3 0.090981 0.003565 0.741758 0.315175 0.825581 sample 4 0.000000 0.103387 0.670330 0.926070 0.773256 sample 5 0.139228 0.586453 0.879121 0.758755 0.406977 sample 6 0.122686 0.028520 0.543956 0.688716 0.616279 sample 7 0.113234 0.171123 0.950549 0.782101 0.802326 sample 8 0.209334 0.520499 0.851648 0.797665 0.773256 sample 9 0.119141 0.525847 0.675824 0.809339 0.930233 sample 10 0.205199 0.475936 0.846154 0.723735 0.906977 ......................................................... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . sample 69 1.000000 0.814558 0.333333 0.314286 0.309735 sample 70 1.000000 0.814558 0.333333 0.314286 0.309735 sample 71 1.000000 0.814558 0.333333 0.314286 0.309735 sample 72 1.000000 0.814558 0.333333 0.314286 0.309735
