What would be the best way to structure and mine this set of data?

http://pastebin.com/K0eq8cyZ I went through each season of "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" and determined the character groupings (D=Dennis, F=Frank, C=Charlie, M=Mac, B=Sweet Dee) for each episode. I also starred "winners" for some episodes. How best could I organize this data, in what type of database, and what data science tools would extract the most information out of it? I was thinking of making an SQL table like so: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Episode# | Dennis | Frank | Charlie | Mac | Sweet Dee 008 | 5 | 3,4 | 2,4 | 2,3 | 1 010 | 5 | 3,4,6| 2,4,6 |2,3,6| 1 ...where all the values are arrays of ints. 6 represents that the character won the episode and each number represents one of the 5 characters. Thoughts?
