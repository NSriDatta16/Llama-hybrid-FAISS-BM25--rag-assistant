Importance of Time Features

if you have a time series and you want to do some predictions, what time feature should you use ? lets say we are trying to predict how many people visit a certain website , we have data for the visits for the last 2 years, what should we include as a time feature ? and if we use more features might it make our model less accurate ? the features i can think of are the following: Date index(1-700) Week number (1-53) Day of the week (1-7) Month(1-12) Day of the month(1-31) Day of the year(1-365) Year
