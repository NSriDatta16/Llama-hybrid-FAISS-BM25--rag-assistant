Identify social users using graph embeddings

I have a social network and I want to identify the most social people in the graph. In a typical graph experiments this could have done using different network features. However, I recently came across graph embeddings and interested in knowing if my problem can be solved using graph embeddings. If so, please letme know how I can do that?
