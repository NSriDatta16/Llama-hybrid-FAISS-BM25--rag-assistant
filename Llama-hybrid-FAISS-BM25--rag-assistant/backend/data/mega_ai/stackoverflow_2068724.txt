Short answer: it depends on your compiler and architecture. Most compilers have some sort of command-line option or #pragma that you can use to manually specify or alter the alignment of variables. I once used something like this to investigate the data alignment of various types: union { struct { char one; char two; char three; char four; } chars; struct { short one; short two; short three; short four; } shorts; struct { int one; int two; int three; int four; } ints; struct { double one; double two; double three; double four; } doubles; /* etc, etc */ } many_types; By looking at the addresses of each struct member vs the sizeof() that member, you can get a picture of how your compiler is aligning different data types.
