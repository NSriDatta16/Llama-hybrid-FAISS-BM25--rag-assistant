Unless your data has more than two genders, including a constant and both male and female as indicators will be collinear. Let $m_i$ be an indicator for male and let $f_i$ be an indicator for female. Observe that for any individual $i$ $$m_i + f_i = 1$$ hence if you also include a constant, your data is collinear. Some solutions for collinearity: If you have indicators for various categories (eg. month of the year), you should leave an indicator for one of the categories out of the regression. Coefficients on the remaining indicators will then be an estimate of the categories' mean relative to the left out category. Think through the logic of your problem. You can have some subtle stuff such as age, years of schooling, and a constant being collinear if everyone starts school at the same age and doesn't drop out. If you're doing machine learning with tons of variables, you may want to explore regularization . Some further ideas and examples are explored here .
