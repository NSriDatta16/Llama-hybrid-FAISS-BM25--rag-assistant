What are the "hot algorithms" for machine learning?

This is a naive question from someone starting to learn machine learning. I'm reading these days the book "Machine Learning: An algorithmic perspective" from Marsland. I find it useful as an introductory book, but now I would like to go into advanced algorithms, those that are currently giving the best results. I'm mostly interested in bioinformatics: clustering of biological networks and finding patterns in biological sequences, particularly applied to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Could you recommend me some reviews or books to read?
