If all you care is textual similarity, you could just write a regex to strip out all the HTML tags of the form ]*> (perhaps first removing all .* tags), then mash all the content up in a very long paragraph. That wouldn't be a bad use of a regex at all; that's what they're there for. I might recommend http://docs.python.org/library/xml.dom.minidom.html , but imho the interface can be very awkward. Also you don't need access to the hierarchical structure, just the text. Otherwise a parser would be better than a regex (which would otherwise be a terrible idea).
