Execute remote batch file from within a C# forms application

I am working on a VPN dialer that will execute a login script when the connection is successfull using the following method. Process p = new Process(); try { p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = true; p.StartInfo.FileName = @"\\serverName\NETLOGON\Script Test.cmd"; p.Start(); p.WaitForExit(); } } catch (Exception ex) { } The batch file execute properly according to the logging methods in the batch file, but the drives are not acctualy mapped for the user to use. Other batch files tested (local & remote) have the same result. I am assuming this has something to do with the application domain or UAC. The finished application will run on Viata/7 and is being tested on Windows 7. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Regards Bert
