Thanks for the answers I think I just have to wait :-) The EF is moving in the right direction love the CTP5. I need to comment on the answer from "Rap". Using random Guid's as indexes can really slow down the performance on the SQL Server because the indexes for each insert becomes fragmented. This I have learn from the real world, when I started working at a new company that had big problems with performance on there sql servers. moving from guid to bigint solved the problem. and there was no need to reindex all the time.
