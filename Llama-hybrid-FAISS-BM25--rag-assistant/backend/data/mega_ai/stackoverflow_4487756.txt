Are there any good jQuery drag and drop file upload plugins?

Are there any good drag & drop jQuery plugins that give me the same functionality as dragging and dropping attachments in Gmail? Preferably I would be able to see the upload progress as it is going. But I don't want flash. CSS, HTML5 and jQuery preferred. Thanks.
