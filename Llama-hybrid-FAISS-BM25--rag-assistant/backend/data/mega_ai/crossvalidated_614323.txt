The "best" analysis depends on what your question is and how you are thinking about the relationships. For example, what do you think is a (possible) function of what? You state that presence/absence is a predictor of carbon in the soil (presumably a continuous variable). As stated, determining if a continuous variable differs between two groups would be a $t$ -test. If you had a bunch of different species that could be present or not, it might be a factorial ANOVA. This is not my field, but I would guess the thinking is something like 'this species generates carbon that then becomes incorporated into the soil (or leaches it out of the soil)'. On the other hand, if you wanted to see if the presence of carbon predicted whether a given species were present, you would probably want logistic regression. In that case, the thinking would be something like 'this species needs carbon to survive, if there is very little in the soil, this species won't be there'.
