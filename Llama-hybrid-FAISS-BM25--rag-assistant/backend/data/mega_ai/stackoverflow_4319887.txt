What is best approach for performing operations on pairs of 2d lines?

So I have 10 000 lines defined on 2d plane so that each line is presented as (A1, A2, B1, B2) (A, B points). I have an array of functions I need to perform on each pair of lines: Angle(A,B) return Atan((B.y-A.y) / (B.x-A.x)) NearlyParallel(angle1, angle2) delta = Abs(angle1-angle2) return (delta Pi-threshold) Collinear(A,B, C,D) return NearlyParallel(Angle(A,C), Angle(B,D)) and NearlyParallel(Angle(A,D), Angle(B,C)) So generally I need to say which line is Collinear to which and which one is NearlyParallel to another for each line. I need to do it in c++ using boost and any opensource library needed. I do it under windows in visual studio 2010. What library, and its part can help me in organizing fast calculations for my data? will for example boost graph lib be helpful? I mean generally I need to perform some thread/processors optimizations for speeding up. And I will not have any fancy video card to perform that all...
