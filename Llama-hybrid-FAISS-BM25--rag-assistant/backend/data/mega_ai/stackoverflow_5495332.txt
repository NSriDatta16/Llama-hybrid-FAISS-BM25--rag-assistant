More elegant way of declaring multiple variables at the same time

To declare multiple variables at the "same time" I would do: a, b = True, False But if I had to declare much more variables, it turns less and less elegant: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j = True, True, True, True, True, False, True ,True , True, True Is there a better / elegant / convenient way to do this? This must be very basic, but if I do used a list or a tuple for storing the variables, how would I have to approach so that I would be helpful since: aList = [a,b] Is not valid, I would have to do: a, b = True, True Or what am I missing?
