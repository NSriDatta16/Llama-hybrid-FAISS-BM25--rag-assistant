Shell extension for selected file

Is there a way to know which file is being selected in windows explorer? I've been looking at the tutorial posted here Idiots guide to ... but the actions described are: hover context menu properties drag drag and drop I wonder if is there a method that get invoked when a file is selected. For instance to create a thumbnail view of the file. Thanks.
