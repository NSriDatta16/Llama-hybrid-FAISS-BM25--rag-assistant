KKT in a nutshell graphically

Objective Confirm if the understanding of KKT is correct or not. Seek for further explanation and confirmations on KKT. Background Trying to understand KKT conditions, especially the complementary one, which always pops up out of blue in SVM articles. I do not need list of abstract formulas but do need a concrete, intuitive, and graphical explanation. Question If P, which minimizes the cost function f(X), is inside the constraint (g(P) >= 0), it is the solution. It seems KKT is not relevant in this case. It seems KKT says if P is not inside the constraint, then the solution X should satisfy below in the picture. Is it KKT all about or do I miss other important aspects? Other clarifications Should f(x) be convex for KKT to apply? Should g(x) be linear for KKT to apply? Should λ be necessary in λ*g(X) = 0? Why g(X) = 0 or g(Xi) = 0 is not enough? References Lagrange Multipler KKT condition Does every gutter point in SVM have positive multiplier? http://fnorio.com/0136Lagrange_method_of_undetermined_multipliers/Lagrange_method_of_undetermined_multipliers.html Update 1 Thanks for the answers but still struggle to understand. Focus on the necessity only here: Is the condition(2) in Matthew Gunn's answer about the non-optimal point (in green circle) and KKT will not be satisfied there? And the point would be identified by looking at Hessian as in the Mark L. Stone's answer? I suppose another situation is saddle points, but the same applies? user23658
