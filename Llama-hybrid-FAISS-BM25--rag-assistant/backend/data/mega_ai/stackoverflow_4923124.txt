Google Maps + Google Local Search generate lat/long from uk postcode

Is there anyway i can put 2 hidden fields in a form and automatically put the Lat/Long into them from the user inputting a post code? I don't really want to rely on the user dragging a marker on the Google map to plot the location. Thanks in advance Robbie
