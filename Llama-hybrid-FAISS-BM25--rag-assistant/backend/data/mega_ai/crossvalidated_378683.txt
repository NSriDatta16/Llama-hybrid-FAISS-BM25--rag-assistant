It's evident that for both groups 1 and 2: At least 25% of your data points are 1. (1 is shown on the box plots as the lower quartile and the minimum too.) At least 75% of your data points are 1 or 2. (2 is shown as the median and the upper quartile.) From the information that 1 is the mode, a further guess is that perhaps 40-45% are 1 and another 35-40% are 2. The "average" (mean?) is not usually shown by default on a box plot, although all good statistical software should allow plotting means as extra detail on a box plot. On general grounds and from other answers on this tag (e.g. Help needed with my box plot ) I would suggest that box plots are often ineffective in showing the detail of spiky discrete distributions . In particular, although most of the possible values up to 20 do occur in your data, the box plot is not informative about their absolute or relative frequency. From the answer just cited alone, I suggest that simple histograms (bar charts) showing your frequencies would be much more direct and informative . (Plotting frequencies on a square root scale is a possible trick.) Transformations can't help much here either. They just transform each distribution with several spikes into another with exactly the same number of spikes. Also, if the mode is the smallest value, then that fact will always imply asymmetry of a discrete variable, as any one-to-one transformation will still result in the mode being at one end of the distribution. Note that the over-drastic negative exponential transformation just flips the mode from the minimum observed value to the maximum transformed value. To compare the means, just compare the means. It's possible that bootstrapping the difference in means would help. Posting your data, or in this case the table of counts, would allow more developed answers.
