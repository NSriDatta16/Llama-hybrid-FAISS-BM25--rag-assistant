It is a good practice to separate business with data storage structure. Why? Because tomorrow somebody will decide to change business logic: use non-integer document order (1-AA, 1-AB, 1-AC...) include year and month to build some monthly reports any other changes... And what should you do than? So, my solution is: use primary key (int, for example or your preferred data type) to do relationship with other tables in the database use business key 1.2.3...as you wish (maybe some identifier generator) use datetime field to store date of adding document, the year you can calculate dynamically.
