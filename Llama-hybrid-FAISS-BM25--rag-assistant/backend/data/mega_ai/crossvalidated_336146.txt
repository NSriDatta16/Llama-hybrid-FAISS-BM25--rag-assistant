The point is bigger than just clustering. Try embedding methods like PCA or tSNE on bothe sampled and original data. It will show you similarities of data sets. Another way is to see the difference between cluster distributions e.g. using Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence. It gives you the distance between two distributions. If it is small your sampling is right.
