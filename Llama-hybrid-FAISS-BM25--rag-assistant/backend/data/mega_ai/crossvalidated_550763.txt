Randomize or not the order of items?

( It is a question about an optimal design, rather than a statistical question. So if it's not allowed by the rules, I am sorry in advance: please don't downvote me, but just let me know and I'll delete the question ) So simplifying things as much as possible: I want to measure whether information about crime rate affects the preferences towards a region. To do this in between-subject design I let participants choose between Region 1, and Region 2, providing them several pieces of information. In a control treatment these pieces do not include crime rate. In a T_A, these pieces do include crime rate. Other pieces of information are the same in both treatments. So schematically it looks like that: So, the hypothesis is that in T_A the share of those who prefer R1 to R2 will be higher than in the baseline. The question is: should I randomize the order of Regions between subjects? (so sometimes Region 1 goes first, sometimes Region 2 goes first). should I randomize the order of pieces of information between subjects? (so sometimes the information is shown in order Population->Crime rate->Average wage, and sometimes Crime rate->Average wage->Population etc.) If I do both or one of randomizations, does it substantially increase the sample size?
