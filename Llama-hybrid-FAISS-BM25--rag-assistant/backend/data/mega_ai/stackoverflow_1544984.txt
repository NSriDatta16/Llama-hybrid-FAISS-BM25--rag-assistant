I agree with the general consensus that the Foo() && Bar() form is reasonable unless it is the case that Bar() is useful for its side effects as well as its value. If it is the case that Bar() is useful for its side effects as well as it's value, my first choice would be to redesign Bar() so that production of its side effects and computation of its value were separate methods. If for some reason that was impossible, then I would greatly prefer the original version. To me the original version more clearly emphasizes that the call to Bar() is part of a statement that is useful for its side effects. The latter form to me emphasizes that Bar() is useful for its value. For example, given the choice between if (NetworkAvailable()) success = LogUserOn(); else success = false; and success = NetworkAvailable() && LogUserOn(); I would take the former; to me, it is too easy to overlook the important side effect in the latter. However, if it were a choice between if (NetworkAvailable()) tryWritingToNetworkStorage = UserHasAvailableDiskQuota(); else tryWritingToNetworkStorage = false; and tryWritingToNetworkStorage = NetworkAvailable() && UserHasAvailableDiskQuota(); I'd choose the latter.
