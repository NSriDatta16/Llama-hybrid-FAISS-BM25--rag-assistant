The NetworkInterface.NetworkInterfaceType offers a enumeration that contains the network currently servicing internet requests. It will return 'none' if there isn't a internet connection available. (unfortunately it doesn't provide health information on the nature of the connection available, so if you have poor coverage it will still return MobileBroadbandGSM) You can find the full information on the NetworkInterfaceType enumeration here
