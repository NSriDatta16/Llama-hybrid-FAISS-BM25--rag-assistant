Switching "outcome" and "exposure" in multiple logistic regression

I read this question on whether switching the "outcome" and "exposure" changes the odds ratio in bivariate logistic regression. Which it does not. I'm wonder if this also holds for multiple logistic regression. For instance say we have Y1 = alcohol abuse (0,1) Y2 = cannabis abuse (0,1) X1 ... X3 = demographic covariates will model 1: y1 ~ y2 + x1 + x2 + x3 and model 2: y2 ~ y1 + x1 + x2 + x3 yield the same odds ratio for the relationship between y1 and y2? I tested this on a data set and model 1 and 2 did give different results. Is this because the covariates have different effects on y1 and y2?
