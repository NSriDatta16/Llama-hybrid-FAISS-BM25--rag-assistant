Prior for df in a multivariate t-distribution

I'm working on a robust bayesian regression with a multivariate response. Right now i'm trying to set prior distribution for degrees of freedom of multivariate t-distribution I read here https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations that a choice would be a gamma( it's referred to univariate case) while LaplacesDemon package examples ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LaplacesDemon/vignettes/Examples.pdf ) suggestS an half cauchy. Does Anyone have some reference to deal with it? or any useful tips to decide. Thanks
