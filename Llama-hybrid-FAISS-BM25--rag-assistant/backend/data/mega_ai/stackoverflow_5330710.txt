This: WINDOWPLACEMENT wp = { X }; Will initialize all remaining members to 0 (assuming POD). See: 8.5.1 Aggregates [dcl.init.aggr] Paragraph: 7: 7 If there are fewer initializer-clauses in the list than there are members in the aggregate, then each member not explicitly initialized shall be value-initialized (8.5). [ Example: struct S { int a; char* b; int c; }; S ss = { 1, "asdf" }; initializes ss.a with 1, ss.b with "asdf", and ss.c with the value of an expression of the form int(), that is, 0. â€”end example ]
