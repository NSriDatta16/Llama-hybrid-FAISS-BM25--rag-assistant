Choosing a window size for DTW

I have time series data from mobile sensors for different motions such as walking, pushups, dumbellifts, rowing and so on. All these motions have different length of time series. For classifying them using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) , how do I choose an appropriate window size that will give good results?
