For linear models without categorical variables, if you are using the mean when computing the PE plot, then the PE plot is the same as the PDP. Intuitively, the PE plot is to take the average for other variables first and then plot a curve, where the slope is the beta. The PDP is to compute the values for every instance and then take an average, where the slope is also the beta (see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datarobot/vignettes/PartialDependence.html ). However, for linear models with categorical variables, using the mode for categorical variables cannot generate a curve with a slope equal to beta (since using mode to approximate the "mean" of categorical variables is not accurate enough). But PDP still can. I think here is where the difference lies. Obviously, PDP seems better in this sense.
