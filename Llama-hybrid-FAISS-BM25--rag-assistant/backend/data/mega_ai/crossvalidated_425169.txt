Distance between 2 hyperplanes in SVM formulation

During the SVM formulation, the 2 hyperplanes is given by the equations: wᵀx + b = 1 ---------(1) wᵀx + b = -1 ---------(2) Now, the margin between these 2 hyperplanes is given by: 2/||w|| However, I'm not able to derive the margin 2/||w|| from the equations 1 and 2 geometrically. I've tried this: Consider a point 'p' on plane (1). Then, the distance of that point from plane (2) will be: (wᵀp)/||w|| ---------(3) which will also be the distance between the 2 planes. Since p lies on plane (1), we have: p = (1-b) * inverse(wᵀ) ----------(4) On substituting the value of p in equation (3), we have: wᵀ/||w|| * (1-b) * inverse(wᵀ) = (1-b)/||w|| ---------------------(5) Can anyone please tell me how to eliminate 'b' from the last equation, such that we can arrive at the distance 2/||w|| ?
