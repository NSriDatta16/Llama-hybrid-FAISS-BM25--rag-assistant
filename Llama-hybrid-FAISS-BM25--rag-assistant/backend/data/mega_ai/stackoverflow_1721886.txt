Always make sure your pointers are initialized Always know the length of the allocated memory area Always check for NULL value when working with a pointer Always delete the pointers after you use them Never overwrite the memory past the ends of the pointer Never trust the validity pointers provided to your methods Never put user input in a pointer (gets for example) Never mix malloc/free with new/delete Never allocate pointers to class objects with malloc Never free class object pointers with free And last but not least Never use pointers unless you have to... There are (const) references to avoid copy construction of objects passed to functions and STL containers and strings for the other storage requirements and use smart (boost::shared_ptr) pointers if you really need pointers and don't want to track them by hand.
