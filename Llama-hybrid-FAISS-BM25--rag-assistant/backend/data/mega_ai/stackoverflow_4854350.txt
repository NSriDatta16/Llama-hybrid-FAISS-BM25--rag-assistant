How to model a storage repository which provides intelligent REST based access

I am looking for a unique way to query the following use cases in a REST fashion:- Assuming the repository contains the following:- a. green color ball image of 1cm radius b. yellow color ball image of 1cm radius c. blue color ball image of 1cm radius d. green color ball image of 2cm radius e. yellow color ball image of 2cm radius f. blue color ball image of 2cm radius g. computer monitor icon image of size 32x32 pixels in png format h. computer monitor icon image of size 64x64 pixels in png format i. computer monitor icon image of size 32x32 pixels in ico format j. computer monitor icon image of size 64x64 pixels in ico format k. HR travel policy l. HR new hire policy g. HR promotion policy 1. Find all documents published after a certain date? 2. Find all documents published before a certain date? 3. Find all documents published between a certain set of dates? 4. Find all balls which are 1cm in radius 5. Find all documents whose download format is "png" 6. Find all documents whose size is 32x32 pixels 7. Find all balls which are green in color. Our storage repository could be based on Google Storage, Amazon S3, Mongodb GridFS, Java content repository (JCR 2.0) or a simple file system. What would be the ideal way to store and retrieve the above data. I would like the REST URL to be as expressive as possible, so that I can model any of the above use cases [1-6]. Appreciate any pointers on how to design a generic repository, so that I can use appropriate naming conventions to fetch documents based on the above queries.
