nonlinear regression with time series error

I have a question about data analysis. I fitted my data to non linear regression by using nls function in R. Then I plot the residuals. The residuals are non stationary but when I plot diff(residual) they become stationary. Is it correct to use diff(residual) to transform non-stationary to stationary?
