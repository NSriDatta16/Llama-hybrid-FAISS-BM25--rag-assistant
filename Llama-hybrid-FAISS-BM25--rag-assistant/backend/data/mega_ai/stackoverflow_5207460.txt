Is there any particular reason you don't want to use object references? It looks very elegant to use them: public class Category { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public virtual ICollection Products { get; set; } } public class Product { public int Id { get; set; } public Category Category { get; set; } } And you can still access the Category Id via your product as product.Category.Id .
