NServicebus - Publish Message that contains HTML/XML

I am using NServicebus with a pubsub configuration. So far it has been really awesome and quite straightforward. However, I've noticed that one of my subscriber endpoints does not pickup messages that contain HTML/XML strings. For instance I am adding a POCO object that implements IMessage and one of the string fields contains some HTML fragments. The message appears in my queue but is not picked up by endpoint. When I use the debugger to remove the HTML fragments from the string property the endpoint kicks in. Does anyone know a) why this is happening and b) how to work around this (i assume by performing some encoding? Thanks in advance JP [Edit] To add some more detail and respond to Udi's feedback (thanks Udi): I am using the 4.0 build of NServicebus. The html is extremely straightforwad and looks a little like this: Test Message This is a test message [Edit2] It appears that my issue (while still in existence) is not related to the HTML i am passing. Debugging this evening I noticed that NServicebus is picking up the messages, but intermittently (approximately 1 in 5 messages). I see all messages in my queue journal but my logic is not consistently hit.
