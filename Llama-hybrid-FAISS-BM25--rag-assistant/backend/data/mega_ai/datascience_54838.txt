Single Word Classifier

How to use machine learning algorithms to predict class of single values/words ? Use-case : I have a list of different labels and their values. eg : Labels [Colour, Height, Weight, Location, Width etc] Values [red, green, 10 cm, 80 kg, usa, uk etc] Now given a sentence like "color red height 10 usa 80 kg", what is the best way to tokenize them as Labels and Values? Input : color red height 10 usa 80 kg" Output: Labels [color, height] Values [red, 10, usa, 80kg] Note : there is no delimiters in the given sentence, values and labels are not fixed, values can occur without label in a sentence. Once Values and Labels are detected,need to map them as pairs. { color : red height : 10 weight : 80 kg location : usa,uk } Currently I am using a lookup list for mapping labels and values and this list need to be updated whenever a new label or value is found. Is this the best way to solve ? Can this problem be solved using ML ?
