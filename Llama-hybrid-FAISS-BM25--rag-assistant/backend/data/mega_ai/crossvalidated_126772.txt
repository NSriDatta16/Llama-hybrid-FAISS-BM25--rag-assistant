Reduce the polynomial terms in logistic regression (glm)

I've three categorical variables A, B and C with 5 levels each. The model I'm trying to fit is glm(Y~A+B+C, family=binomial()) How can I remove the higher order polynomial contrasts terms from the model after making sure that the AIC and null deviance is improved?
