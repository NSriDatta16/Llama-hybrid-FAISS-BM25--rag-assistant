I guess I'm the opposite of RHSeeger there. I've used both Lua and TCL embedded in games (online games, incidentally) and I wouldn't touch TCL again with a 10' bargepole if I had the choice. My very subjective opinion is that Lua is a sane language and TCL isn't. Relative to the other options for scripting languages, TCL syntax is very obscure to most people, with all the set and expr and dollar signs and lots of brackets etc. The only objective benefit it has is ease of embedding - but Lua is no slouch in that department either. If this scripting interface is purely for you then you may as well go with TCL because Lua won't offer you anything new (unless object orientation is your thing). In the hands of a skilled user TCL is a reasonable tool. If, however, you expect less experienced users to use the system then go with Lua - the simpler syntax will buy them a lot of productivity.
