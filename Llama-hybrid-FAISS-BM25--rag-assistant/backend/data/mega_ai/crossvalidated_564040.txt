Actually you're missing the multilabel option. Going through the implementation you might distinguish the 'multiclass' branch where ._multiclass_roc_auc_score() is called and where you might see that the available options are indeed only ('macro', 'weighted') (see here for reference); then, again, you might distinguish the 'binary' and the 'multilabel-indicator' branches where ._average_binary_score() is called. When considering a multilabel target, all weighting options are available. Indeed, the documentation of sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score() states that this implementation can be used with binary, multiclass and multilabel classification. The sklearn.utils.multiclass.type_of_target() function is a utility in sklearn that returns an encoding of the target type (given the target y itself). It is indeed what the implementation uses in the branches referenced above to determine the label type and therefore to detect whether you're approaching a binary , a multiclass or a multilabel classification problem. Following the documentation for type_of_target() you might see that 'binary' , 'multiclass' , 'multilabel-indicator' are not the only types of target existing in sklearn , though being the only ones that can be used within .roc_auc_score() .
