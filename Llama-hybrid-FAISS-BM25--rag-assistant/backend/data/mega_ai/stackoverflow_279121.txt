In Profiler, you can add the event "Attention" under "Errors and Warnings". It's definition is Collects all attention events, such as client interrupt request or when a client connection is broken. As far as other errors (deadlocks, contraints, etc), try "Execution Warning" (reports warning that occurred during the execution of SQL statement or procedure) or "User Error Message" (the error message displayed to the user in the case of an error or exception).
