On Symbian I've used BullseyeCoverage and Testwell CTC++ . Cannot really describe the pros/cons of them in detail. Both got the job done, eventually. Both needed some effort with setup and integration with an automated test suite. Both contained bugs that e.g. crashed the downstream compiler with slightly broken instrumented source code. On Maemo, since the toolchain is GCC based, I'd guess gcov would be a good starting point. Though I haven't been working on Maemo much yet and haven't done any coverage measurement there.
