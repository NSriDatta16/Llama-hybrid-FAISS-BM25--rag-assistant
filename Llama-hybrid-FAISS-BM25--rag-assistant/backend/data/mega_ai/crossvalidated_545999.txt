In a 2002 paper with Arnaud Doucet and Simon Godsill, Marginal maximum a posteriori estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo , we use an MCMC approach to derive the maximum likelihood estimator in latent variable models where the observed likelihood is not available. By repeating the number of repetitions of said latent variables in a simulated annealing spirit. Similar proposals were proposed subsequently by Gaetan and Yao (2003) under the name of multiple imputation Metropolis-EM Lele et al. (2007) under the name of data cloning Jacquier, Johannes and Polson (2007) under the name of MCMC maximum likelihood
