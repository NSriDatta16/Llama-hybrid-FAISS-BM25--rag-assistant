LATEST version of parent project in Maven

I am using Maven2. I have created a parent POM for my organization. I want the various groups will use it as a parent for their project but I want them to use the latest version. for some reason, using it as a parent with version LATEST doesn't work, any idea? Thanks, Ronen.
