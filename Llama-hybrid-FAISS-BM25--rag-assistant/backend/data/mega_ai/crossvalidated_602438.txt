whuber shows, by means of a counterexample, that the product of a Gaussian $X|Y$ times a Gaussian r.v. $Y$ does not necessarily lead to a joint Gaussian distribution, which in this case certainly doesn't have a conditional Gaussian. Here is a (numerical) counter-example for your claim. Let $Y|X=x \sim N(x^3, 1)$ and $X \sim N(0,1)$ . Then $(X,Y)$ is not jointly normal. The marginal of $Y$ is $$ f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(y - x^3)^2 - \frac{1}{2}x^2}dx. $$ Unfortunately this integral (as far as I know) cannot be computed analytically, but we can provide a fairly good approximation via adaptive quadratures . Thus the conditional we require is $$ f_{X|Y} = \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2}(y - x^3)^2 - \frac{1}{2}x^2}}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(y - x^3)^2 - \frac{1}{2}x^2}dx}. $$ The result is disproved provided we are able to show that this conditional is not Gaussian. Toward this aim, let's fix $y = -1$ . An elegant proof may be given by studying the properties of this function but here I am taking a brute-force approach in which I approximate this beast numerically. If the conditional is gaussian we expect it to be unimodal and symmetric. This is the contradiction I'll be looking for. # propto the joint distribution f_yx If we can trust numerical integration (I'm using the integrate function here which is extremely robust!), we can see from the plot that this conditional density is definitely non-Gaussian. This contradicts the claim. Side comment. There exist non-Gaussian bivariate distributions which have Gaussian conditional densities. One example of this is $$ f(x,y) = C\exp\left(-(1+x^2)(1+y^2)\right),\quad -\infty where $C$ is the normalising constant. You can check that both $Y|X=x$ and $X|Y=x$ are Gaussian with suitable parameters.
