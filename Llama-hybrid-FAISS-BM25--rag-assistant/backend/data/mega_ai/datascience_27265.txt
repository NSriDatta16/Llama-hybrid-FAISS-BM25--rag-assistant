Perhaps you could use word embeddings to better represent the distance between certain skills. For instance, "Python" and "R" should be closer together than "Python" and "Time management" since they are both programming languages. The whole idea is that words that appear in the same context should be closer. Once you have these embeddings, you would have a set of skills for the candidate, and sets of skills of various size for the jobs. You could then use Earth Mover's Distance to calculate the distance between the sets. This distance measure is rather slow (quadratic time) so it might not scale well if you have many jobs to go through. To deal with the scalability issue, you could perhaps rank the jobs based on how many skills the candidate has in common in the first place, and favor these jobs.
