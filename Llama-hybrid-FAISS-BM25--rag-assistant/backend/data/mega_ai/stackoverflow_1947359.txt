You also need to deploy the MINGW runtime dll ( mingwm10.dll ). This file is located in your Qt\2009.5\mingw\bin directory. Also pay attention to whether your application is compiled in debug mode or release mode. I just made the test with an hello world type application and Qt Creator. In the debug folders, I copied libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll , mingwm10.dll , QtCored4.dll and QtGuid4.dll and it works. Pay attention to the d in dll names, which stands for debug: QtCore d 4.dll . See Qt 4.6: Deploying an Application in Windows . For Qt 5, check this page.
