Best statistical model to compare student metrics

I want to understand what would be the best statistical model to use if I'm comparing students basis their metrics that carry a certain weightage. Details are as below Metric (Weightage) % of assignments completed (10%) - format (%) % feedback received from teachers (10%) - format (%) number of assignments completed (10%) - format (number) average attendance in days (10%) - format (number) quality of projects submitted (40%) - format (%) projects (20%) format (%) Since this data is spread across percentages & time, what would be the best way to put it on one scale for evaluation ?
