In C:\Program Files\Microsoft Help Viewer\v1.0, you've got an help file ReadMe_ENG.htm. It said that : If port 47873 is used by another process (not via the http.sys service) then the Help Library Agent will not be able to attach and use port 47873 and will fail. The port number can be changed by adding a string registry value AgentPort under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Help\v1.0 with the value of the port to use (eg. 81). In regedit, I've got : LocalStore = C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\HelpLibrary\ AppRoot = C:\Program Files\Microsoft Help Viewer\v1.0\ The LocalStore directory, in my HDD, contain 2.3Go of data (*.mshi, *.mshc...) So, I believe that if you move this content to a shared directory....it MAY work I cannot test, so it's only suppositions...
