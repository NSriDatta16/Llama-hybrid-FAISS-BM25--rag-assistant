Feature selection using feature importances in random forests with scikit-learn

I have plotted the feature importances in random forests with scikit-learn . In order to improve the prediction using random forests, how can I use the plot information to remove features? I.e. how to spot whether a feature is useless or even worse decrease of the random forests performance, based on the plot information? The plot is based on the attribute feature_importances_ and I use the classifier sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier . I am aware that there exist other techniques for feature selection , but in this question I want to focus on how to use feature feature_importances_ . Examples of such feature importance plots:
