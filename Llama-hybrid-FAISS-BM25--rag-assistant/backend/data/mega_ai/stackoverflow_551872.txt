Best practice for controlling access to a ".internal" package

I write Eclipse plugins and export some classes as an API while wanting to restrict access to other classes. I follow the common Eclipse practice of separating these classes into a ".internal" subpackage. However, then I can't use "package" or default level access on these classes since many of them need to be used by the classes I'm exporting. What is the best practice for preventing or discouraging users of my API from using these classes for their own purposes? Is there an automatic checker? I admit that I've dabbled in using some of Eclipse's internal classes when I had no choice :) Clarification: I have a similar need with non-plugin code.
