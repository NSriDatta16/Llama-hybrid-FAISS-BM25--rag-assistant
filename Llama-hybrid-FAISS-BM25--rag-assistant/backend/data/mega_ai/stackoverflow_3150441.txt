I create a class to hold system-wide settings using either a Singleton pattern, or a Global instance (whichever you preference is). If another project is in the solution, it can see the class (when references are added). This also decouples the presentation of the settings from the storage mechanism (database, config file, custom XML file, whatever), and if you design to the interface, it makes unit testing more flexible, too.
