If you end up having lot's of Javascript code and most of the functionality running client side, server side cannot help much. You need to have your JQuery and other JavaScript code organized well. Not sure if there are any MVC frameworks existing specifically for JavaScript. Did one of my own years ago when had to work with the project with huge loads of JavaScript. However you don't necessarily need to do full blown MVC, just having simple model in place and handlers (controllers) for the logic in place will help you a lot. But if you code relies on JavaScript it's a biiiig mistake if you don't really thing how you construct your JavaScript software.
