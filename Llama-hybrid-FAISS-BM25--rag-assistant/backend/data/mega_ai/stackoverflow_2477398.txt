Problem loading R own created libraries in Java/JRI code

I created my own new R library (called "Media"). There is no problem when I try to load it with RGui, and I can call the functions defined in the new package. This is how I load it: > library(Media) But, I'm also trying to call that functions from Java/JRI code, and when I load the new R package, Java doesn't seem to find the pacakge, throwing the message "Error in library(Media) : object 'Media' not found" This is my current code using JRI: REXP rexpSetFolder = re.eval("setwd('C:/Users/Albert/Documents')"); REXP rexpFolder = re.eval("getwd()"); System.out.println(rexpFolder.asString()); REXP rexpLoad = re.eval("library(Media)"); // fails It also fails without the 'setwd' command, and simple calls to existing R functions work fine. I'm using R 2.10 and the latest JRI 0.5-0 under Windows. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you very much. Edit: The parameter lib.loc seems to work, at least this sentence does not return an error: library("Media", lib.loc = "c:/Users/Albert/Documents") But after that, calling a function in the package with re.eval("myfunction()"); still fails, as the function is not properly found.
