Is a full WPF application not an option for your situation? As you probably know Silverlight uses a subset of WPF so you may be able to change your application relatively easy. A wpf app would be easier than having a web server etc bundled within your application. You wont in the foreseeable future be able to have access to resources such as printer and files (apart from isolated storage) through Silverlight as you know. You could have a seperate part of your app to upload files to the webserver then read these in your silverlight app from a service. Depending on your printing requirements (e.g. if you just want to send everything to an office printer) you could send the informaton you wanted printed to a service that will then print it for you. However I am guessing you want each client machine to be able to print in which case this wont work for you.
