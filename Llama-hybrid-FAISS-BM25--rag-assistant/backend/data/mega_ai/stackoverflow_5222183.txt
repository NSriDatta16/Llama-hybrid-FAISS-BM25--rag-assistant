there are a few visible 'cultures' in naming constants across the libraries. I typically declare constants quite literally, using upper Camel with underscores to separate the longer names: Prefix with organization code then prefix with library (if applicable) then prefix it by type or category ORGConstantName ORGLibrary_ConstantName ORGLibraryType_ConstantName ORGLibraryCategory_ConstantName it's verbose, but it avoids clashes, and it's really clear when the constant applies only to a certain scope, type, library, or other context. whatever you settle on, just make sure it's consistent.
