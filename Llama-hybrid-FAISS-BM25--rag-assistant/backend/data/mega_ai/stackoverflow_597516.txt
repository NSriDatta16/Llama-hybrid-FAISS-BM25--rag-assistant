Validation problem with JSP and Eclipse

I have this simple JSP page in Eclipse and the first line in the file is: Eclipse however, puts a yellow warning icon before this line with the following tooltip message: Multiple annotations found at this line: - Line breakpoint:index.jsp [line: 1] - Tag (jsp:directive.page) should be an empty-element tag. Does anyone know why this is? UPDATE : This is my full source script. This is basically the template that Eclipse generates for me when I create a new JSP file based on the XHTML template. I only slightly modified the content to make it do something 'use full'. I'm using Eclipse 3.4 (eclipse-jee-ganymede-SR1-linux-gtk.tar.gz) on Ubuntu 8.10 with the Geronimo 2.1 plug-in (I don't think that matters though). I had this same problem with every version of Eclipse I've used so far (3.0 and up) Hello Geronimo Hello Apache Geronimo!!! on ${datetime}
