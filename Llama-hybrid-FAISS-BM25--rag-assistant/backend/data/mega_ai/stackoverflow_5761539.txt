Doctrine's ORM is for relational databases, that's why it's called an object relational mapper. A fundamentally different concept from a column oriented store such as Cassandra. I would say that the chances to get Cassandra in there are pretty slim. Add to the work required that storage and access patterns are just not the same. In Doctrine's ecosystem, there are people writing a ODM (object document mapper) which supports MongoDB and CouchDB - but a document oriented databases is also a different playground. Even those two are very different from each other while both are a document oriented database. https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm https://github.com/doctrine/couchdb-odm I don't think you can convince anyone to take on Cassandra in either of these projects. For me personally, the biggest show-stopper for Cassandra is thrift and related which comes with it. Having said that, that's my personal opinion and nothing should hold you back from implementing a nice PHP wrapper for Cassandra. I also see no reason to not release your Cassandra wrapper as a custom Symfony bundle, etc.. In the wake of Symfony2 lots of people started projects independent from core to provide bundles which cover an additional feature set (for example, Friends of Symfony ). So if you want to persue this, just go ahead and start something (e.g. on Github) and see how it is received.
