The float.h/cfloat header gives some maxima and minima, from which you could derive bit limits, but that seems a little awkward; what I would do personally is define the limits on mantissa , exponent , and base as constants, explicitly, for each platform you support, with a #pragma warning and comments to handle platforms you don't recognize.
