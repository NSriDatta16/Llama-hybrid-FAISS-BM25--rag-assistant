How can I write data to a ini file on the fly

In my office, the connection configuration parameters like userid password details are stored in a .ini file. Now since password cannot be stored as clear text, password comes from an external provider. I can write the password retrieval script in either vbscript or C#. But I would need to invoke this file for that action to be performed. I'm looking for an asynchronous solution wherein my script gets my password and writes to the ini file.
