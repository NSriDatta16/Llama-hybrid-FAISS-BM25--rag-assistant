Automating wix small updates and minor upgrades

I just read the following in the wix tutorial . For some strange reason, small updates and minor upgrades cannot be run simply by clicking on the .msi fileâ€”they give the error: "Another version of this product is already installed." We know, stupid... Anyway, you have to start it with the command: msiexec /i SampleUpgrade2.msi REINSTALL=ALL REINSTALLMODE=vomus Don't ask me how this would fare with the average user... You'd better start it from an Autorun.inf file or devise an outer Setup.exe shell to launch it. We want people to be able to download the most recent version of our app and install it, even if they have an older version already installed. How do you normally deal with this?
