Outside of the class, that type must be referred as Timing::Message , so typedef Timing::Message* MessageP; But this is possible only after the declaration of Timing::Message , yet MessageP is used before the declaration of Timing is complete, so it's not possible. Moreover, the struct is a private: member, so you can't define this outside anyway. The typedef must be done inside the Timing class. class Timing { public: Timing(); private: struct Message { Agent *_agent; double _val; }; typedef Message* MessageP; // You did not get compilation error probably because another Message type in global scope already exists.
