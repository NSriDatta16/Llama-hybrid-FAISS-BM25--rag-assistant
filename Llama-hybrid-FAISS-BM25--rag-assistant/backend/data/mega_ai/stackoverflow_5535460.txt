Data retrieval/storage & graphing solution selection

Our company have a need to set up some solution, that would allow us to grap almost live (1 second interval) data, from electrical equipment. Currently, the thing we are using, is Cacti, which allows lowest read interval to 1 minute. What would be your software solution suggestion, for such a situation, considering, that data is retrieved by SNMP, XML or web interface (ther's more than one device, each with different data retrieval method) and my knowlage covers HTML\PHP\JavaScript programming capabilities. As *nix CRON can handle only 1 minute intervals as minimum, there should be some tool or solution, that could "ask" by itself. Only workaround I see, is to code some JavaScript, that is reloading every second, triggering server-side code. Maybe, there are some ready-solutions like RRDTool or maybe, using ordinary MySQL+Graph library (Google, etc) will do the job?
