Does stopPropagation() work on IE flavors? Perhaps, using the old "return false" in the end stops the event from getting somewhere else. Also, some odd agent check -already available en JQuery- should do. (if MSIE, then do event.cancelBubble = true; else, use the stopPropagation method event.stopPropagation(); )
