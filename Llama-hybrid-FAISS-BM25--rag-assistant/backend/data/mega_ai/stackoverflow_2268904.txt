Got it from your updated code sample. When you say st = XDocument.Load("C:\\storage.xml"); and then st.Descendants() your st is the document , not the root element . So when you ask it for its Descendants , you enumerate over 2 XElement s - the items node and the one item node that this example have. It is the items node that is giving you the 'empty' item. There are numerous ways to restrict yourself to just the item nodes, depending on how sure you can be about the structure of your xml - for example, From item In st.Root.Elements("item") will enumerate over just the item nodes found as immediate children of the document's root element.
