STATA margins dydx with over(.), continuous variables and interaction effect

I have a logistic regression model with two variables (A and B), which I also interact. A and B are both continuous. After the estimation I want to use the margins command to plot the marginal effect of A over the range of B values. As far as I understood this should go by using: margins, dydx(A) over(B) However, STATA throws the following error: only integer values are allowed in by() variables r(198) Does anyone know what I am missing? Thanks!
