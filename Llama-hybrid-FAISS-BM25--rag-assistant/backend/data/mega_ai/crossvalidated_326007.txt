Assuming you have enough number of samples in your trainign data, neural networks can learn to capture such uncaptured relationship between features. This is one of the advantages of using an neural network instead of an tradition ML algorithms like regression, decision trees etc(which needs manual feature extraction). Since neural networks are like a black box, you cannot be very sure that which feature (or) relation between features is influencing the predictions.
