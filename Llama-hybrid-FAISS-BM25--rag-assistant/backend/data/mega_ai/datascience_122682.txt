Mean Average Precision with 11 points interpolation method Python libs

I want to calculate mAP with 11 points interpolation method for object detection, as described here: https://learnopencv.com/mean-average-precision-map-object-detection-model-evaluation-metric/ What Python libs do implement this algorithm? For example, average_precision_score from sklearn doesn't seem to use 11 points interpolation...
