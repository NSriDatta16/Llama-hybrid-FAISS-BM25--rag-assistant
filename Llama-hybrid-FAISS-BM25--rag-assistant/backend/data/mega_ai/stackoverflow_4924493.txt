Since this was a top search result when I had this error, just want to post my cause and solution. I had two projects within a solution, sharing a 'common' class file which was added as a link. I added a second 'helper' class file as a link, used its code within the first, and got the error. The problem was I had not added the second 'helper' class as a link in both projects. So the other project had an updated 'common' class, but no knowledge of the 'helper' class it now used. Note to self: pay more attention to the project column of the error list :)
