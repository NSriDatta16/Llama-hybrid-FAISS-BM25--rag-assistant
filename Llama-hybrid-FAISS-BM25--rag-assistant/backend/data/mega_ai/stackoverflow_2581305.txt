Some encoded Javascript that I need in plain text

I'm having some issues trying to decode some javascript.. I have no idea what kind of encoding this is.. i tried base 64 decoders etc. If you can please help me out with this, here's a fragment of the code: \x69\x6E\x6E\x65\x72\x48\x54\x4D\x4C","\x61\x70\x70\x34\x39\x34\x39\x3 Any ways I can get plain text from that? Thanks!
