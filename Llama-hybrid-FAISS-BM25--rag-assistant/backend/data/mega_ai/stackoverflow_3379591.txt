.htaccess redirects with dynamic URLs

I am having problems doing a redirect for some URLS, the ones from the old site that have a ? sign, won't redirect, every other URL will do. example: OLD: /laser-alignment-resources/presentations.cfm?pres=diaphragm NEW: http://www.acquip.com/en/presentations/47-presentation-internal-laser-diaphragm-alignment Won't work, I am sure I did something wrong but I am a n00b when it comes to .htaccess all the URLs are in the same format, 14 in total: OLD:/laser-alignment-resources/presentations.cfm?pres=gas New: http://www.acquip.com/en/presentations/48-presentation-gas-turbine-thermal-alignment OLD: /laser-alignment-resources/presentations.cfm?pres=train NEW: http://www.acquip.com/en/presentations/49-presentation-complete-machine-train-alignment any help will be appreciated.
