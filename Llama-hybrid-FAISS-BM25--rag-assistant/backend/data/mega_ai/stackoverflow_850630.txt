Python *.py, *.pyo, *.pyc: Which can be eliminated for an Embedded System?

To squeeze into the limited amount of filesystem storage available in an embedded system I'm currently playing with, I would like to eliminate any files that could reasonably be removed without significantly impacting functionality or performance. The *.py, *.pyo, and *.pyc files in the Python library account for a sizable amount of space, I'm wondering which of these options would be most reasonable for a Python 2.6 installation in a small embedded system: Keep *.py, eliminate *.pyc and *.pyo (Maintain ability to debug, performance suffers?) Keep *.py and *.pyc, eliminate *.pyo (Does optimization really buy anything?) Keep *.pyc, eliminate *.pyo and *.py (Will this work?) Keep *.py, *.pyc, and *.pyo (All are needed?)
