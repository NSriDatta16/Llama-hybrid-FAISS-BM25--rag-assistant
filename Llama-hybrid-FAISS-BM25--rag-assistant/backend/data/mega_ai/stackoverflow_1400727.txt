The two options you list are the only ones I'm aware of. The former is harder than using a single model, but I wouldn't say "not encouraged." It falls into the unfortunately broad category of "supported Entity Framework features with no support in the GUI designer." The latter option is actually not so bad if you can retrieve only what you need, but will result in retrieving entities from two separate ObjectContexts, which could be awkward if you update. That said, updating objects in multiple contexts, potentially from different databases, is strictly no matter how you do it. The Entity Framework team had mentioned working on better solutions for the future, but this is a weak point today, and I don't think it's going to change much in v4.
