I think you need to reorganize the responsibilities. Each component should be responsible for itself and therefore copy its generated goodness where it needs to go. That way it doesn't matter if/who/what/when/where got built. Whatever is updated will put itself into the proper place. IMO the other suggestions are no-nos since they'll circumvent the compiler's smarts to know when a rebuild is necessary for the main project. And hence killing any compile time-savings. If your "plugin" projects are assemblies (and not just project-references from the main project), then you do not need to rebuild the main project each time a plugin is rebuilt. The new assembly will get selected into the process / debugger w/o the main project needing a rebuild.
