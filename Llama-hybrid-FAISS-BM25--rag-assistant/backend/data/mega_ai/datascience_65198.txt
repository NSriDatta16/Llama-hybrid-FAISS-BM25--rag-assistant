Which machine learning algorithms are hard real time capable?

Are there any machine learning algorithms or algorithms categories which have predictable execution times (guaranteed minimal/maximal execution time e.g. when the algorithm is run on a single processor which is not loaded with other processing tasks) for predictions given any possible input making them suitable for the use in hard real time systems?
