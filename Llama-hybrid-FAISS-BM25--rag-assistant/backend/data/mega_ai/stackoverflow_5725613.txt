Remove HTMLs and CSS styles from PDF created using itext

We are dynamically creating PDF using itext in our application. The content of the PDF is inserted by the user in the web application using a screen where he has a Rich Text Editor. Below are the steps specifically. User goes to a add PDF content page. The add page has a Rich text Editor where he can enter the PDF content. Sometimes user can copy/paste the content from the existing word document and enter in the RTE. Once he submits the content, PDF is created. The RTE is used because we have some other pages where we need to show the content with BOLD, italics etc. But, we don't want this RTE stuff in the PDF being generated. We have used some java utility to remove the RTE stuff from the content before generating the PDF. This works normally but when the content is copied from the word document, html and css styles applied by the document are not being removed by the java utility we are using. How can I generate the PDF without any HTML or CSS in it? Here is the code Paragraph paragraph = new Paragraph(Util.removeHTML(content), font); And the removeHTML method is as below public static String removeHTML(String htmlString) { if (htmlString == null) return ""; htmlString.replace("\"", "'"); htmlString = htmlString.replaceAll("\\ ", ""); htmlString = htmlString.replaceAll("&nbsp;", ""); return htmlString; } And below is the additional content being shown in the PDF when I copy/paste from the word document. Please help ! Thanks.
