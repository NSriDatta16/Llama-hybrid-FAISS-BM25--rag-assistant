My first suggestion would be to use Logistic Regression (LR), at least to gain some understanding regarding input feature relationships to output. LR provides a lot more information than neural nets in this regard, since neural nets are much more black boxes. While neural networks tend to be black boxes, there are few things things that you can do, depending upon the type of neural network and the problem that you are solving. As an example, consider the image classification. Often the weight vectors for each neuron are examined to look for detection patterns. The results are generally edge detectors, etc. Similar information is often shown by researchers in a dashboard that is presented at classification time. In this image, there is also a visual indication of the output by class, indicating likelihood by class (8 being most likely in this image). You might consider showing examples of inputs that your neural network gets consistently right and wrong when the predicted class is indicated. This gives the user an idea of the types of errors that are likely for the prediction that is made.
