Which Non-Parametric Test should I use?

I want to make sure I am choosing the right statistical test. I am working with 7 semesters of exams scores for a particular course. Each semester the course ran with many sections. However, the students, no matter what section they were in, no matter which teacher, were given the same exams. Let A = exam 1 and 2 average (two exams were given within the semester and they were averaged) Let B = final exam score (the course ends with a final) Overall for each semester, I want to compare A with B to see if a significant difference is found. Which non-parametric test should I use? What should my level of significance be? Which test should I use to see if there is a correlation between A and B for each of the semesters? I tested semester 1 (A & B) through semester 7 (A & B) and found that the data sets for all is not normal. I used the Shapiro-Wilk test (all p Note: Just to clarify,... ** A is the average of exams 1 and 2 area given within the semester before the final exam The final exam score equals B. ** The data sets are not normally distributed as per the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality as well as histogram, box plots. ** Overall I wish to compare the averages to see differences if there are any.
