In reference to tarn's more elegant way of swapping values you could use a permutation matrix as follows: >> a =[1 2 3]; >> T = [1 0 0; 0 0 1; 0 1 0]; >> b = a*T ans = 1 3 2 but this will swap column 2 and column 3 of the vector (matrix) a ; whereas the question asked about swapping the 1's and 2's. Update To swap elements of two different values look into the find function ind = find(a==1); returns the indices of all the elements with value, 1. Then you can use Mitch's suggestion to change the value of the elements using index arrays. Remeber that find returns the linear index into the matrix; the first element has index 1 and the last element of an nxm matrix has linear index n*m . The linear index is counted down the columns. For example >> b = [1 3 5;2 4 6]; >> b(3) % same as b(1,2) ans = 3 >> b(5) % same as b(1,3) ans = 5 >> b(6) % same as b(2,3) ans = 6
