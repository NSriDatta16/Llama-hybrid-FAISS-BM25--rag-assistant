How to add Type Parameters to XAML

I have the following class: public class DefaultDropTargetAdvisor : IDropTargetAdvisor { I decided to make it have a generic parameter: public class DefaultDropTargetAdvisor : IDropTargetAdvisor where TDragType : class { This was my XAML before the change: How do I change that XAML to now reflect the type parameter? (I want to pass in a class called MockWI). Clearly this does not work: x:Key="targetAdvisor1"/> Any ideas?
