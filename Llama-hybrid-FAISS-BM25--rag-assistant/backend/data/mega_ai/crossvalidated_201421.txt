I think noting some definitions may be beneficial for future reference to this question and answer. Ratio of number of accepted proposed states to the number of propositions gives the acceptance rate. Note that acceptance rate is the rate of acceptance over the course of the random walk. $\alpha$ in the question is called "acceptance probability" by Robert & Casella in their book Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods with R (2010, p. 171). This is very reasonable since $\alpha$, in their presentation, adapted to the notation in the question, is seen here: $$ x_2= \begin{cases} x_2 & \quad \text{with probability } \alpha(x_2,x_1) \\ x_1 & \quad \text{with probability } 1 - \alpha(x_2,x_1)\\ \end{cases} \\ \\ \text{where }\ \alpha(x_2,x_1) = \min\left\{1, \frac{\pi(x_2)p(x_1 | x_2)}{\pi(x_1)p(x_2 | x_1)}\right\} $$ Now note that $\alpha$ here may becomes independent of the proposal density in case of a random walk proposal when $p(x|y)=p(y|x)$. However, the acceptance rate as defined above is still dependent on it due to the reasons explained by random_user. Robert and Casella are very clear about differentiating the two and define the latter as "[...] the average of acceptance probability over the iterations." I have little experience on the matter but it was enough for me to observe that what is referred to in question by "acceptance rate" is sometimes named "acceptance ratio" (see Wikipedia for instance), leading to similar confusions as in the question.
