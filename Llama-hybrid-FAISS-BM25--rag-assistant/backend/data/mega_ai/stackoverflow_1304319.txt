You have to have a license too, to create provision proviles (like the Ad-Hoc provision profile as described above). But if you have, you have to create that, enable it in your project as provision-profile for build "Ad-Hoc" (if doesn't exists, make one) and build it to a device (only build, not build-and-go). Mail the product and the ad-hoc provision profile to your friend, and let him drag both files to iTunes. Now he can sync and install the app on his device. Don't forget to add his device-identifier to your ad-hoc provision profile.
