Reloading of persisted entity

I'm using OpenJPA in my application as a JPA vendor. The question is theoretical or conceptual: Is there any way to tell an entity manager to load an entity from the DB rather than from it's cache? The problematic scenario: EM1.persist(Entity1) EM2.merge(Entity1) EM1.find(Entity1) Any elegant way to do it? I really don't want to call em.refresh(entity) .
