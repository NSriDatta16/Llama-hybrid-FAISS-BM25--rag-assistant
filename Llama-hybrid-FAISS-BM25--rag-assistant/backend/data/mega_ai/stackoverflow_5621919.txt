If you have to detect browsers just to apply CSS, then you might want to rethink your CSS before going to browser-specific stylesheets. All it takes is for one browser to mimic another's user agent string, or a new version to be released, and everything breaks. Use the current standards and validate your code ( http://validator.w3.org/ ), and you'll have to worry about far fewer cross-browser issues. Even just using without a version number could break the layout in later versions. That being said, if you want to style the page differently based on what CSS features are available, take a look at Modernizr . This way, you're only checking features, which won't be broken if a new version of the browser is released. If all else fails and you really need to detect the visitor's browser, try jquery.browser . It's built into jQuery, and is simple to use. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/ .
