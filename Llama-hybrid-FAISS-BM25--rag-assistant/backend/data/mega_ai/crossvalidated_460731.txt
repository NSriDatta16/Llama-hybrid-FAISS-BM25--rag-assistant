Strange output for pairwise comparisons on glm with quasi-binomial distribution

I'm new to CrossValidated - I've read up on how to ask questions properly but sorry if I do anything slightly wrong. My data is showing whether microplastics were present or absent in the gut of fish larvae. > dput(data) structure(list(age = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L), .Label = c("5", "20"), class = "factor"), concentration = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L), .Label = c("20", "200", "2000", "20000"), class = "factor"), replicate = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L), present = c(0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 4L, 0L, 2L, 2L, 7L, 7L, 6L, 7L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 2L, 0L, 0L, 2L, 7L, 3L, 8L, 0L, 11L, 16L, 17L, 19L), absent = c(20L, 20L, 20L, 20L, 20L, 20L, 20L, 20L, 16L, 20L, 18L, 18L, 13L, 13L, 14L, 13L, 20L, 19L, 20L, 20L, 18L, 20L, 20L, 18L, 13L, 17L, 12L, 20L, 9L, 4L, 3L, 1L)), row.names = c(NA, -32L), class = "data.frame") There are two main effects: concentration (the concentration of plastic the fish were exposed to) and age (of fish) I am running a glm with quasibinomial distribution model Firstly, I don't understand why the coefficients are listed like that in those strange combinations? I.e. missing some of the factor levels and combining some glm(formula = cbind(present, absent) ~ age + concentration + age:concentration, family = quasibinomial(link = logit), data = data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.1931 -0.7093 -0.0001 0.2812 2.0579 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

I have tried with emmeans and get the same strange results. Does anyone know if I am going wrong somewhere? Thanks in advance! And please let me know if I haven't asked this question correctly. Edit: These are the results of glht For concentration: summary(glht(model, mcp(concentration="Tukey"))) Multiple Comparisons of Means: Tukey Contrasts Fit: glm(formula = cbind(present, absent) ~ age + concentration + age:concentration, family = quasibinomial(link = logit), data = data) Linear Hypotheses: Estimate Std.

Error z value Pr(>|z|) 20 - 5 == 0 17.38 4268.50 0.004 0.997 (Adjusted p values reported -- single-step method) The reason I find these results "strange" is that when plotted there are obvious significant differences (very small standard error) yet these do not show up using glht. When I see it plotted I just can't get my head around how they could NOT be significant?
