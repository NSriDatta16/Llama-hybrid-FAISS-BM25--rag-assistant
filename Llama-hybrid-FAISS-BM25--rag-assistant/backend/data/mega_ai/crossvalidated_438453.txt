How do filters affect the training loss in a convolutional neural network?

I am training a model, I am trying to lower the training loss. While testing different architectures I increased the number of filters to 128 from 64 - this reduced the training loss. I do not understand why this change happened, the relationship between training loss and filter amount is unclear to me. How can the amount of filter improve the performance of the model?
