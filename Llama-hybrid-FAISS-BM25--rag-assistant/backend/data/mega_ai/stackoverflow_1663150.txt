Does Indy support raw TCP sockets on Windows?

I'm a C++ programmer, but my question is about the Delphi network socket library Indy. Essentially as Microsoft crippled raw sockets with WinXP SP2 so that TCP data cannot be sent over them, does this then also apply to Indy? One of my friends recommended it to me rather then using the WinSock API. If not, then is the only way to use raw TCP sockets using the WinPCap API?
