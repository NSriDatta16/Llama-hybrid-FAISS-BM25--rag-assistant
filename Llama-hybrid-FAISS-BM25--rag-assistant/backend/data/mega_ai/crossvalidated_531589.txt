If you have just 16 data points I would not suggest removing any more data points. You will lose p+s (lag order + seasonalities) degrees of freedom just for fitting your model. Furthermore, you mention there is an impact from covid in 2020 in your data, this can be interpreted as either noise in your data, or worse, a structural break in your series. Both are detrimental for your forecast (accuracy). Just to be clear, noise and a small sample will impact your forecast accuracy, not the forecast value itself. As far as your first suggestion goes, disaggregating your data to lower frequency, will increase your small sample size. This might seem helpful, because it helps your estimation. But it really is basically waving a magic wand and create data that will exactly glue your initial time series together. This is not recommended. Lastly, if you have bad data you can do only so much. There is no model or method of estimation that will heal your bad data. My recommendation is to estimate a simple model (maybe just an AR(1)?) and don't put too much stock in your prediction.
