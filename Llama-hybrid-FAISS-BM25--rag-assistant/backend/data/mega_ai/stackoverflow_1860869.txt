What are valid Perl module return values?

The common practice in Perl is of course to end modules with 1; so that a call to require can then be checked for success. Is there any reason that the return value couldn't be another true value? In my testing, it does not see to cause any problems, but I'd like to know if anyone has run across any issues (such as some other modules or pragmas or anything that expect the value actually to be 1 and not just true). Edit: By popular opinion, and since it will only work once (good tip), the code example is gone. Seems the consensus is that its safe to return any true value, but never to rely on the that value in calling code since require will return 1 after the first loading
