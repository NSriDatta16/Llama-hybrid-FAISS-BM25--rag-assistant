What is the relationship between linear regression and z score regression?

So I'm taking a stat's class that has introduced z-score regression. According to my professor, z-score regression gives us the "line of best fit" when the data has a linear structure. I've previously taken a machine learning course where I learned that the "line of best fit" was obtained through linear regression . My question then is are z-score regression and linear regression the same thing? Here's where my mind is at: Let $r$ be our correlation between our variables $x$ , the data we have, and $y$ , what we're trying to predict. Correlation is $r = {\frac{1}{n - 1}} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} Z(x_i)Z(y_i)$ where Z() is the z score function. Then trying to predict a $\hat{y}$ from using our z score regression line at $x = \hat{x}$ $$Z(\hat{y}) = r Z(\hat{x})$$ $$\frac{\hat{y} - \bar{y}}{SD(y)} = r \frac{\hat{x} - \bar{x}}{SD(x)}$$ Where $\bar{y}$ and $\bar{x}$ are the respective averages. So isolating $$\hat{y} = r \frac{SD(y)}{SD(x)} \hat{x} + \bar{y} - r \frac{SD(y)}{SD(x)} \bar{x}$$ I'm not sure what insights I'm supposed to get from this...(I'm embarrassed lol)... I guess if we attempt to measure how well this z-score regression line does in terms of how close it is to our data: $$min \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - (a_0 + a_1 x_i))^2$$ This is how far the actual data is to our z-score line Let's attempt to find $a_0$ and $a_1$ which after the algebra we'll get: $$a_1 = r \frac{SD(y)}{SD(x)}$$ $$a_0 = \bar{y} - b_1\bar{x}$$ which will give us exactly the formula for $\hat{y}$ In my machine learning class we learned: $$\hat{y} = f(x;\theta, \theta_0) = \theta^T x + \theta_0$$ If we take our cost function/objective function to be $\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - (\theta_0 + \theta^T x_i))^2$ ... Then looking for the best $\theta$ and $\theta_0$ , we should get the same thing as we did for $a_0$ and $a_1$ . So if we use the same cost function/objective as we do in Z-Score regression... then the two approaches are exactly the same? Is there something special about this? Is this question just non-sensical?Am I supposed to be able to gain some special insight between these two subjects(stats and ML)?
