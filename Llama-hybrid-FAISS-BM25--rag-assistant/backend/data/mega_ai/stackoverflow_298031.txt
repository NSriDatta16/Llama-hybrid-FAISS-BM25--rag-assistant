Does Windows XP use the NTFS filesystem function calls to read-from/write-to a pagefile (pagefile.sys)?

If it does, then how do you justify the overheads incurred (journaling etc.)? If it does not, then how come the pagefile gets fragmented? Additionally, would increasing the cluster size improve pagefile performance (cluster slack space is a non-issue)?
