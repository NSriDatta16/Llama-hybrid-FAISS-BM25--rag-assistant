You probably should conduct a missing values analysis to see what is the percentage of missing per column (figure below, from dataprep package ) Decide a threshold according to which you may want to completely drop a column or not (depending on how your analysis or model treats nans as well) For the columns that are not dropped, you should impute the missing values experimenting with relevant techniques, e.g. average, std etc. (also depends on the type of the data and feature). https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html
