removeBatchEffects() may be okay for PCA, but not for regression. The limma documentation includes this note: This function is not intended to be used prior to linear modelling. For linear modelling, it is better to include the batch factors in the linear model. Batch effects should generally be treated as random effects, but duplicateCorrelation() seems to be the approach used for limma. There is a thread discussing this function with respect to batch effects here .
