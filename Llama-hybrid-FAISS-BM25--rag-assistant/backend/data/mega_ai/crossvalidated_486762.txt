Stratum specific estimates in a model with an interaction term

Lets say I have a logistic regression model predicting the log odds of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and my exposures of interest are age, education and carbohydrate intake. I expect that the associate between carbohydrate intake and log odds of MCI might vary across levels of age, so I intend on including a product term. I have centered my age variable at 60 years and it measured in 5 year units. Carbohydrate intake is centered at 200g/day and is in 50g/day units. My model is like so: log odds (MCI) = B0 + B1 carbs + B2 age + B3 university + B4 carbsxage My gesture at understanding these coefficients is: B1 - log OR for a 50g increase in carbs, when age equals 60 years; B2 - log OR for a 5 year increase in age, when carbs equals 200g; B3 - log OR for university education, adjusted for age and carbs; B4 - Change in the log OR for carbs by increasing age by 5 years. If that model were to give clear evidence for the interaction, I would be able to calculate the effect of carb intake on MCI across several strata of age: log OR for carbs at 60 years = B1 log OR for carbs at 65 years = B1 + B4 log OR for carbs at 70 years = B1 + 2*B4 My question is, in this hypothetical, is this a coherent way to display results in the context of interaction? One problem is I don't see any way that I can calculate confidence intervals for these estimates. Is one better off simply performing separate regressions on the data stratified by age (i.e. 60-65, 65-70, 70-75 years)? Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks a lot.
