Nightly build for VB.NET program, Versioning

I currently have a nightly build system running as a windows scheduled task, calling at batch file, that works sort of like this: Check out the latest revision from subversion Modify the AssemblyInfo.vb file of the main executable and the librarys to set the version number to 0.0.0.revision Invoke MSBuild to build everything (including the installer) Upload the installer and a log of the build to an FTP server This works ok, but step 2 is dirty and fragile, and I can't imagine that this the only way to do what I want. Any ideas?
