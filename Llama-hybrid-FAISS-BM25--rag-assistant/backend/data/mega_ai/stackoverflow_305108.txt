After digging a bit I discovered that there is no standard dragging mechanism for pop-ups but that a colleague had implemented it. It was easy to expand the code to constrain the pop-up to the host window. It behaves a bit strangely though. Slow and smooth dragging allows the popup to move right up to the edge of the host window but fast erratic dragging causes it to be stopped before quite reaching the edge. Still trying to figure out why that is.
