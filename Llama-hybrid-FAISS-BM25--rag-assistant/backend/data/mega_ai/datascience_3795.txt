Are Correlithm Objects used for anything in the industry?

This refers to a system described in a book by Nick Lawrence titled " Correlithm Object Technology ". The author coined the term "correlithm" as a combination of "correlation" and "algorithm". The Correlithm Objects ("COs") described in the book are, in the author's view, "primary data tokens" in biological neural systems and are central to "all high-level data representation, storage, and manipulation". In addition to this the author describes the COs as "important mathematical objects of the statistics of bounded, high-dimensional spaces". Considering these descriptions it seems like these COs could be useful for AI. What I was curious about is whether they are actually used anywhere in the industry, and if so, in what kind of situations?
