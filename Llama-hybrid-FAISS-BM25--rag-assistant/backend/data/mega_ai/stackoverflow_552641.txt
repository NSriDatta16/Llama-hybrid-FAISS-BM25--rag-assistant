Apache mod_rewrite and PHP ?argument=something

I'm trying to get all HTML and PHP files on my site to redirect through the index.php, so that they can have common frames applied to them, a templating solution I coded that I found to be quite elegant. Anywho, I'm having issues with my PHP files, specifically those that have arguments after them. My regular rule for PHP files is the following: RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !index.php$ RewriteRule ^(.+).php$ index.php?page=$1&type=1 [NC,L] This works fine for any pages that have no arguments, but you can see that any PHP documents that have ?argument=something end up as: index.php?page=path/to/page?argument=something&type=1 which is not a working solution at all. Now, what's bothering me here is the $ at the end of the rule, shouldn't that cause it to fail if there is anything after the .php? Anywho, I tried rewriting the rule as: RewriteRule ^(.+).php\?(.+)$ index.php?page=$1&type=1&$2 [NC,L] but that simply doesn't trigger at all. It seems that the regex flavor used in mod_rewrite is far different than I'm used to working with, so I'm sure these are simple mistakes I've made, but I can't seem to find decent documentation for this flavor of regex other than the most basic of examples. Can anyone show me what I'm doing wrong? Thanks.
