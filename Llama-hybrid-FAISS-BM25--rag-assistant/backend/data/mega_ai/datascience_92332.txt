If you have the eigenvalues in a single vector you can simply use base R commands to only select values greater than one. The linked page uses the following commmand: food.pca.eigen $values[food.pca.eigen$ values >=1] which simply uses base R syntax. food.pca.eigen$values >=1 returns a true / false vector depending on if the value is greater than or equal to 1 or not, which is then used as a mask for the food.pca.eigen vector. The only values selected are the ones where the mask has the value of true , which are then ones with a value equal to or greater than 1.
