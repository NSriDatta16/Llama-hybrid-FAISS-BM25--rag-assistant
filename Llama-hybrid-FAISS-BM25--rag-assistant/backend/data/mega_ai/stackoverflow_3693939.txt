All of the run-time state is reset whenever the browser does a page-load, such as navigating from foo.com/bar to foo.com/baz. This includes all JavaScript variables, as well as the current DOM. However, asynchronous calls to the server, such as XHR, do not affect run-time state, and all JavaScript variables will stay. If you'd like to preserve values between page-loads, you can use cookies or localStorage .
