The problem is the event you are tracking. UIControlEventTouchUpInside means that your -start method will only get called if you lift your finger up while it is still in the bounds of the control, something that's not easy to do on a slider. What you probably want is UIControlEventTouchUpOutside and/or UIControlEventTouchDragExit , which will call -start either when you lift your finger outside of the control's bounds, or when your finger is dragged from within a control to outside its bounds, respectively. See the UIControl reference for more info.
