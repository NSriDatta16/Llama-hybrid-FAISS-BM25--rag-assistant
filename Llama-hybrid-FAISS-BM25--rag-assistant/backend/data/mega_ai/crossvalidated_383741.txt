Consistency of an OLS estimator in time series

In the ARMA(2,1) time series $y_t = \beta_0+\beta_1y_{t-1}+\beta_2y_{t-2}+ u_t + \phi_1u_{t-2}$ $u_t$ and $u_{t-2}$ are white noise shocks. The time series are stationary and ergodic. In the solution it says that the estimators of $\beta_0$ , $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are consistent if $\beta_1 = 0$ becasue " $y_{t-1}$ is still included in the model, which is correlated with part of the error term $u_{t-1}$ " (The question was "Would the OLS estimator of $\beta_0$ , $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ when regressing $y_t$ on a constant, $y_{t-1}$ and $y_{t-2}$ consistent if $\beta_1 = 0$ ?") Is it because it is a time series model and (different from usual simultaneous equation system) $y_{t-1}$ can still be included as the dependent variable of another equation and is correlated with $u_{t-1}$ , which makes the whole equation system unidentified? Or does " $y_{t-1}$ is still included in the model" mean that it is still considered when regression was done as one does not know before regressing it that $\beta_1 = 0$ ?
