Around the storage.. Do you want to sort / filter / search the data? Then I would store it in a SQL Database and export it later on to CSV (using a simple StringWriter). If you don't want to access the data, just collect it and put it into CSV I would simply write it to CSV as the data comes in. For reading CSV I would recommend using a LINQ to CSV implementation. E.g. http://www.codeproject.com/KB/linq/LINQtoCSV.aspx or http://www.thinqlinq.com/Post.aspx/Title/LINQ-to-CSV-using-DynamicObject
