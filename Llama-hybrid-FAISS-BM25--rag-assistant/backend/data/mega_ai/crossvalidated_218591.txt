MNIST Softmax regression hitting a wall at 70% accuracy

I've implemented a Softmax regression algorithm in java as part of an Android machine learning program. However, no matter how long I let it run for, the accuracy gets to about 70.5% and then plateaus indefinitely, yet the site I got my data from stated that I should be getting close to 90%. I've gone through my code over and over and have been unable to find the source, so I was hoping that you would be able to help. I don't know why it would successfully advance to about 70% and then stop. This is the Softmax formula that I'm using and this is the dataset I'm using Here is my softmax algorithm: public List gradient(List weights, double[] features, int type){ int D = Constants.featureSize; int K = Constants.numberOfClasses; List grad = new ArrayList (D*K); for(int i = 0; i Here is where I apply my gradient to the weight (written as a javascript server): for (i = 0; i And then finally, in case you think it might be an error in my accuracy test, here's that code: var correct = 0; var error = 0; var labels = require('fs').readFileSync(testLabels).toString().split('\n') var features = require('fs').readFileSync(testFeatures).toString().split('\n') for(i = 0; i classResults[bestGuess]){ bestGuess = h;} } if(bestGuess == label){ correct++;} //else{ //console.log(classResults) //console.log('correct: ', label)} } var accuracy = correct/N; console.log(accuracy) If anyone could give me some idea of where i'm making an error, please tell me.
