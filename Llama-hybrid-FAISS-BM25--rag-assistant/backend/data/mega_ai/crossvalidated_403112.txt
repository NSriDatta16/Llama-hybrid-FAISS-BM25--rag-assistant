Can one use ridge regression to test hypotheses?

Are the parameters (the beta's) that result from a ridge regression interpretable as we normally do with canonical linear regression? Can I use them to test hypothesis? Or is ridge regression something that can be used only for Machine Learning (i.e. prediction) tasks?
