What exactly is the gblinear booster in XGBoost?

Aside from ordinary tree boosting, XGBoost offers DART and gblinear. On DART, there is some literature as well as an explanation in the documentation. However, I can't find any useful information about how the gblinear booster works. I would like to know which exact model is used as base learner, and how the algorithm is different from the normal tree boosting algorithm. Does anybody here know this?
