The case for non-parametric models

I am relatively new to non-parametric models, such as the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, Pitman-Yor processes, etc. but I have read that non-parametric methods are data-driven , and that they can be more robust than their parametric counter-parts. I am looking for evidence and an exposition of why this is the case. Perhaps more concisely, what are the benefits and drawbacks of non-parametric models (and what evidence there is of this). More informally, can it be argued that there is a reasonable trend to move towards non-parametric models in the machine learning / statistics literature?
