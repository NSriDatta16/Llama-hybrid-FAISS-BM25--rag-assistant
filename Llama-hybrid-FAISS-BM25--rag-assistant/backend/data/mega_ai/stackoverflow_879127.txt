What kind of data are you compressing? How is it distributed? Is it ordered in any way? All of these things can affect how well it compresses, and perhaps allow you to convert the data in to something more easily compressed, or simply smaller right out the gate. Data compress works poorly on "random" data. If your data is within a smaller range, you may well be able to leverage that. In truth, you should simply try running any of the common algorithms and see if the data is "compressed enough". If not, and you know more about the data than can be "intuited" by the compression algorithms, you should leverage that information. An example is say that your data is not just Lat's and Long's, but they're assumed to be "close" to each other. Then you could probably store an "origin" Lat and Long, and the rest can be differential. Perhaps these differences are small enough to fit in to a single, signed byte. That's just a simple example of things you can do with knowledge of the data vs what some generic algorithm may not be able to figure out.
