Divide people into teams for most satisfaction

Just a curiosity question. Remember when in class groupwork the professor would divide people up into groups of a certain number ( n )? Some of my professors would take a list of n people one wants to work with and n people one doesn't want to work with from each student, and then magically turn out groups of n where students would be matched up with people they prefer and avoid working with people they don't prefer. To me this algorithm sounds a lot like a Knapsack problem, but I thought I would ask around about what your approach to this sort of problem would be. EDIT : Found an ACM article describing something exactly like my question. Read the second paragraph for deja vu.
