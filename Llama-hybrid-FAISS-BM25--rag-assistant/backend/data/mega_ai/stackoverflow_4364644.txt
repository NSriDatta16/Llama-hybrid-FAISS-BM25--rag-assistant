You should read the Drag and drop documentation. Basically you have to listen to the dragenter event: dragenter Fired when the mouse is first moved over an element while a drag is occuring. A listener for this event should indicate whether a drop is allowed over this location. If there are no listeners, or the listeners perform no operations, then a drop is not allowed by default. This is also the event to listen to if you want to provide feedback that a drop is allowed such as displaying a highlight or insertion marker. For information about this, see Specifying Drop Targets .
