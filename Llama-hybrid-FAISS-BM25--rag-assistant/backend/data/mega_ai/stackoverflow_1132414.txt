OK - I found the answer not too long after I posted the question. I'll leave it open in case someone has a better (more elegant) solution. Basically, I change the do_update event handler to intercept the file upload. If there's a file, then I edit the NewValues collection so that the database receives the new file name instead of the old one. //ItemUpdating event handler void do_update(object sender, FormViewUpdateEventArgs e) { FileUpload newpic = (FileUpload)profile_edit.FindControl("pic"); if (newpic.HasFile) { //do a bunch of file uploading "stuff" which makes a new file name //HERE IS THE CHANGE - update the newvalues object to the new file name e.NewValues[1] = new_filename; } }
