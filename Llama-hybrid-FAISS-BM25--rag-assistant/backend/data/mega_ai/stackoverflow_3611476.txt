How to explicitly say that the application doesn't support LDPI devices

How can I make it so that my application is seen on the Android Market only by devices with mdpi and hdpi densities. There is the tag and there is the anyDensity parameter but I don't see how I can say what I want. If I set anyDensity to false, what does that mean? Where do I specify which densities I do support?
