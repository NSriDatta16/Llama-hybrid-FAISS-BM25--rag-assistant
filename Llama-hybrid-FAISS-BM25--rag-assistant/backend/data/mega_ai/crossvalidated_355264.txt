So first, just like the comments have been saying the opposite of parametric is non-parametric. As for whether we can tell if data is parametric or non-parametric, the answer is no. This is because being parametric or non-parametric is not a characteristic of the data. Parametric or non-parametric is a characteristic of the model we think generated said data. All that we can do is to compare models and say which one seems more likely to have generated said data. In general, its good practice to make a simple parametric model first, see how well it fits the data, and if the fit is insufficient, consider moving to a non parametric model. (Ocham's razor after all). Or if you would like to be Bayesian, you can compute probabilities that model A generated the data over model B. But we can't really compute said probabilities over the space of all parametric and non-parametric models, such a space is much too big to say anything meaningful.
