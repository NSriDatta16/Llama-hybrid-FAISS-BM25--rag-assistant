From unittest — Unit testing framework , section Organizing test code : Note: The order in which the various tests will be run is determined by sorting the test method names with respect to the built-in ordering for strings. So just make sure test_setup 's name has the smallest string value. Note that you should not rely on this behavior — different test functions are supposed to be independent of the order of execution. See ngcohlan's answer above for a solution if you explicitly need an order.
