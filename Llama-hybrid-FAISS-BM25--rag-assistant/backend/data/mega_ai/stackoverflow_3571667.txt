Possible Questions Two dogs, A and B, are running in a race, which dog do you think would win? Looking for: dog characteristics (eg size, age, health, breed, experience, etc) race characteristics (temperature, winds, how the race is organized, track conditions, distance, etc) How many fast food restaurants are there in the US? Looking for: fast food qualification how the problem is solved (local -> national guesstimates) Regarding the grilled cheese problem, some questions you might expect the prospect to ask: Is any part of the sandwich already cooked? How does the customer like the sandwich cooked? (crispy, melted cheese) What kind of kitchen tools are available (stove, oven, countertop, pots, pans, etc)? Cooking environment: dimension of kitchen, etc. Expected sandwich properties (size, weight, dimensions)? Brands, flavors, oils, etc Is the customer allergic to any of the ingredients? Cooking specifications (how long, how hot) There are lots and lots of questions depending on how accurate you'd want the recipe to be. But the answer is in the questions asked, not necessarily the recipe. Good recipe answers would direct someone where/when to put the cheese on which bread, etc. This question may seem simple, but it is really involved and it all depends on what is "assumed" and what is not. Possible disclosure : Make no assumptions other than given.
