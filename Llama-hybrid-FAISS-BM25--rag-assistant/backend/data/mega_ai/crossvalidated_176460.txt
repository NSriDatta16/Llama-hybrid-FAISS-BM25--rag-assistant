Great question! From what I've seen, folks usually do inference given the structure and assume the structure is a given. I haven't seen folks do structure learning (which is a hard problem as you and others have pointed out) just for doing inference. Bayesian networks encode conditional independence structure, so learning the structure is useful if you want to understand/explain the dependencies between random variables. For instance, if you have three random variables (smoking, tar in lungs, cancer) it's highly likely you will find that all these variables are associated with one another (i.e., taken pairwise, the variables are not independent of each other). However, if you do structure learning, you might also learn the fact that smoking is independent of cancer given the amount of tar deposits in lungs. With background and domain knowledge it might also be possible to use the Bayesian network structure to convincingly argue or support causal hypotheses.
