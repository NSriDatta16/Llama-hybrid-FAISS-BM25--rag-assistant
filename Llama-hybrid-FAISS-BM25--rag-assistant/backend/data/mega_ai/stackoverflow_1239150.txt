Looking for an easier way to write debugging print statements in Java

EDIT: I would love to read reactions to Steve Reed's AOP approach. Comments to his answer are encouraged! I'm a novice, and at some point I realized it would be helpful to know the contents of a variable during program execution. So I started doing this: EDIT: fixed this. Used to be: var + ": " + var, which was totally wrong. Dumb typo. System.err.println ( "var: " + var ); Later I learned that this was common practice. At least, where a debugger was unavailable or unwanted. I use a basic text editor, and typing the print statement every time I need to debug a variable is pretty tiresome, so I thought, why not something like this: void dbug ( Object obj ) { String variableName = obj.somehowGetVariableName(); String variableContents = obj.toString(); System.out.println ( variableName +": " + variableContents ); } But apparently getting the variable name is easier said than done. java-reflection-how-to-get-the-name-of-a-variable Am I stuck with: System.err.println ( "var: " + var ); Or is there a popular shorthand version of this?
