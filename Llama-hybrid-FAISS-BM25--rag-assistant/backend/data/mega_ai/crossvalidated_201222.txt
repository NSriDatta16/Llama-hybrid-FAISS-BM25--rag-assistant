$K$-Means is very unlikely to give meaningful clusters on such high dimensional space (see e.g. Curse of Dimensionality ). I agree with the suggestions in the comments: you need to reduce the dimensionality of your data and then do $K$-Means on the reduced space. However I would not do PCA in the proper way: for PCA you need to do mean normalization , and that will turn a sparse matrix into a dense one. What you can do instead is SVD - without mean normalization - and then apply the clustering algorithm. Also note that Randomized SVD should work fine, but way faster. Another potentially interesting technique that you can apply in Non-Negative Matrix Factorization . Since your data contains only positive values (if I got it correctly), NMF should suite well for the problem. Also, you can interpret the results of NMF as clustering: when we are doing $n$-dimensional NMF, we can think of the columns of the resulting matrix as clusters, with the value in the cell $i$ being the degree of association of the observation to the cluster $i$. You can read more about applying NMF for clustering in "Document clustering based on non-negative matrix factorization." by Xu, Wei, Xin Liu, and Yihong Gong ( pdf ).
