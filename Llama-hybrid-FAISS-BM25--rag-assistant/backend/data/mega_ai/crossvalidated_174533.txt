Standard error of the intercept in orthogonal regression

I want to perform a univariate regression but with substantial measurement error in both $x$ and $y$. I therefore want to try orthogonal regression with R. The best answer to my question so far have been this: How to perform orthogonal regression (total least squares) via PCA? However, what I need is to pick out the intercept for the regression and its standard error. I'm not sure if/how this can be done via the PCA approach.
