I layout my solutions in a similar manner -- businessLogic, dataaccess, domain objects all reside in one project. The view(s) (Web, Web services, windows forms, WPF..) all go into their own separate projects. That way UI specific code doesn't filter down in to the lower layers of the application. In most web projects I've had to hack together a windows form to inject new data into the database or manage some type of the application that isnt' fesiable in the web medium. If I bake in HttpCaching at the business level I wouldn't be able to switch between views.
