How is the parameter „huber_alpha“ defined in H2O Deep Learning?

In the documentation of the H2O software ( http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/deep-learning.html ) it says for the parameter “huber_alpha: Specify the desired quantile for Huber/M-regression (the threshold between quadratic and linear loss). This value must be between 0 and 1. ”. On Wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss ) the Huber loss function is defined as follows: Here y denotes the observed values and f(x) the reconstructed values. Obviously, huber_alpha from the H2O documentation is not equal delta from the Huber loss definition (delta is an absolute value and not a quantile). Now I’m wondering what the relation between the huber_alpha and the delta is. Especially to what “quantile” is the H2O documentation of the “huber_alpha” parameter referring to. Looking forward to your answer and many thanks in advance.
