I've written an iPhone app with HTTP authentication and experienced what you describe. (My application uses basic authentication instead of digest authentication, but that doesn't make a big difference here.) The cause of the problem is on the iPhone side. The server is required to answer with 401 if the iPhone doesn't send the credentials in the HTTP request header. And in fact it doesn't even though it easily could once the credential is stored in the credential storage. This strange behavior had a severe effect on the speed of the application since every request caused two round-trips to the server instead of one (the first one with status 401, the second with 200). I've solved it by manually setting the credentials in the HTTP request header: NSString* credentials = [NSString stringWithFormat: @"%@:%@", usr, pwd]; const char* credentialsChars = [credentials cStringUsingEncoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding]; credentials = [CommunicationUtil stringBase64WithData: (const UInt8*) credentialsChars length: strlen(credentialsChars)]; NSString* authorizationHeader = [NSString stringWithFormat: @"Basic %@", credentials]; NSMutableURLRequest* request = [[NSMutableURLRequest alloc] initWithURL: url cachePolicy: NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalCacheData timeoutInterval: 15]; [request setValue: authorizationHeader forHTTPHeaderField: @"Authorization"]; Now my application works very smoothly and is very responsive. The solution will look slightly different for digest authentication. But you'll get the idea.
