How to use XGBoost to predict without labels?

I'm afraid I can't provide a reproducible example because I'm not sure what the problem is - I'm just hoping someone else can eyeball it or has encountered it before. I am using XGboost to predict future outcomes. As a result, I'll use data up to and including July 2016 to predict August, September, etc. This means for my training data I provide labels to xgb.DMatrix dtrain This is all well and good. But I (obviously) have no labels for my test data: dtest If I use a validation set and provide labels for dtest, everything works great. If I move up the time window and no longer provide labels, suddenly the predictions are only NaN. I've looked and looked, and all examples and questions I've seen use a validation set with labels provided, and none make predictions for unseen outcomes. What is going wrong? Once again, I'm sorry I can't be more specific. I've been trying for hours to figure this out...I must be missing something simple, but I don't know what it is.
