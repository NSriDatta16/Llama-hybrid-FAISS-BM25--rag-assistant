Wow, guys. Thanks so much for all your responses--tragically I sent you all on a horrible goosechase. My NavigationView navigates a NSArray of Event objects (local arts events). My table view drills down to a detail view. My detail view has in it the following: -(void)loadEvent:(Event *)event { thisEvent = event; } And I call that from my table view before pushing the detail view onto the nav stack. thisEvent is a synthesized property of type Event, and so since it's synthesized, I dutifully release 'd it in [dealloc] . Many of you already see the problem. Backing up to the table view, when I scroll such that the one I just saw is displayed, it builds the custom table row, and so it goes to get the title property from the Event.... which I just released inside the detail controller. Boom. I added a retain to that loadEvent: method above and the crashes, they are gone. NONE of this was really about the views getting retained and released by the navcontroller. It was about accidentally over-releasing the data objects I'm navigating. Part of what had me discover this was, I NSLogged myself in the [dealloc] of each of these view controllers, and I can now see they're behaving exactly as they should. Thanks! I SO love this site.
