Analysing alogithm possibly based on regular intervals to check for bots and spiders

I'm trying to build a script which shows me a list of IP's that are bots/spiders. I wrote a script which imports the access log of Apache to a mysql db so I can try to manage it with php and mysql. I've noticed a lot of bots have regular intervals, they send out a request every 2 or 3 seconds. Is there an easy way of showing these patterns with a query or php script? Or, even harder I think, is there an algorithm that can recognise these bots / spiders. DB: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `access_log` ( `IP` varchar(16) NOT NULL, `datetime` datetime NOT NULL, `method` varchar(255) NOT NULL, `status` varchar(255) NOT NULL, `referrer` varchar(255) NOT NULL, `agent` varchar(255) NOT NULL, `site` smallint(6) NOT NULL );
