Averaging models in cross validation in neural network implementation

I am implanting my first NN and I want to use cross validation. I have diposoted 20% of my data aside for testing and the rest is my training set. I have divided my training set to 10 sections and I am iterating over them 10 times, each time picking another section to test a model trained on the other 9 sections. I have 10 models with 10 entropy errors. how do I make it into 1 model? I have seen a lot of tutorials stating I should average them for classifiers other than NN. how do I average for NN? Do I simply take all 10 W1 matrices (for the first layer) and average the weights values? then proceed to do the same for b1 , W2 , b2 and so on? If so, how do I then calculate the entropy for the total model? If not, how do I pick the model?
