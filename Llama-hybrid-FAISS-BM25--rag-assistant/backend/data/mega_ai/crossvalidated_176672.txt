What is meant by PCA preserving only large pairwise distances?

I am currently reading up on t-SNE visualization technique and it was mentioned that one of the drawbacks of using principal component analysis (PCA) for visualizing high-dimensional data is that it only preserves large pairwise distances between the points. Meaning points which are far apart in high-dimensional space would also appear far apart in low-dimensional subspace but other than that all other pairwise distances would get screwed up. Could someone help me understand why is that and what does it mean graphically?
