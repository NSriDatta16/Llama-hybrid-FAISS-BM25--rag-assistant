It is possible that there is a prejudice against anything that comes close to data mining, but there can also be good reasons for omitting this area. Without further information I would start with the assumption that there was a good reason. If you assume a good reason and there was actually a prejudice the debate starts as much more friendly and is likely to become much more productive than when you assume prejudice and there was actually a good reason. Any textbook needs to make a selection on what it covers and what it does not cover. The fact that something has developed recently is on its own not a sufficient reason to include it. I use logistic regression a lot in my own research and I have never been in a situation where I needed the lasso or elastic nets. So if I were writing such a textbook, I would probably ignore that part too. This is not to say there is anything wrong with these techniques; they just weren't useful for the problems I wanted to solve. Since different (sub-)disciplines tend to focus on different types of questions, it is not surprising that some techniques are less useful for that (sub-)discipline than others. This should translate to which topics are covered in textbooks aimed at different (sub-)disciplines.
