How can I have an "undefined" category in multi-class classification

I'm trying to classify several websites by category (finance, health-care, IT, etc...). I have at my disposal the content of the pages of the websites, and I use the words to classify. For now, I have manually classified some website to train a naive bayes model. As I'm mostly interested in a high precision (e.g a classified website must be in the right category), I would like to add an "undefined" category in which a website would end up if it is not close enough to the other categories. To be clear, it's not a problem for me if a website is not classified, it's a problem if it is misclassified. Are there algorithms that would allow this, or a way to train an "undefined" category ? My best guess for now is to train something like a random forest and define a "minimum score" below which a website is "undefined".
