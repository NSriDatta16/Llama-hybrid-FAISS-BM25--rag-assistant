My first guess is that you want to build a generic webpage scraper where user can specify certain DOM nodes in the current active page. I would suggest using a bookmarklet based solution. You give the user a bookmarklet and he drag it over to his bookmarks toolbar. Whenever he need to scrape a page he simply clicks the bookmark and you start injecting your javascript code in that page (ie, in tags) Once your scripts load you should mimick the same behavior that you were talking about. Highlight DOM element on mouse over and select on click. Check the firebug DOM Explorer as to how it should work and look. On submission you can send the data to your server via JSONP or an iframe call and switch off your scripts
