Meaning of probability as used in machine learning

In machine learning, it seems that people are often happy to call the output of any function (e.g. logistic function) with the range $[0, 1]$ , a probability. How correct is that thinking? How compatible is it with probability theory? It feels that there is more to probabilities, which is ignored in machine learning. I assume that it is for the sake of simplicity. I should also mention that I don't have much of a background in probability theory, besides the basics that you need in machine learning. Any answers or guidance to other resources is much appreciated.
