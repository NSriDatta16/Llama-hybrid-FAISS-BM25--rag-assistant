I learned that most of the time rebuilding metadata of the repositories helps to solve such problems. I find it annoying how often this is necessary. Select the repository In the "Browse Storage" tab open the context menu of the root node (it sometimes is hidden behind the Firefox default context menu - pressing Esc helps in this case and brings the Nexus context menu into view) Select rebuild metadata Expire cache and reindex may help too for some cases. Most of the time these steps didn't solve the problem at the first try but at last they solved it each time though. I run Nexus as a WAR in Glassfish 2.1
