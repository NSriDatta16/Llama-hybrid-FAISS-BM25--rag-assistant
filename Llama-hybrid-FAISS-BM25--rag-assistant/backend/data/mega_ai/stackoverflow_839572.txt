Using something like CruiseControl and CCTray gives you confidence, you know when that little icon is green that you can get the latest code and it will most likely work with your local copy. To get the best from it you need to be in good habits, always getting latest before you commit, etc. It won't stop conflicts, or even broken builds but it will let you move forward with your development with confidence knowing that there is a working version of the software. Using custom build scripts, again gives you confidence as you can get the build done and then run unit tests, code coverage, fxcop. It all adds to the quality of the main body of code. As always there's a time and effort cost, but you'll quickly get to a balance of how much quality you need to deliver the software consistently, versus how much testing and code analysis you want to do.
