MOSS 2007: 3 additional assembly binding redirects, where are they coming from

I have a web.config of a functioning MOSS server with our custom settings and a web.config of a freshly installed MOSS. Here's 3 redirects I don't know the source of: I don't remember adding them manually and they don't appear in the fresh config. Both installations are SP1. I suspect some update may have added these. Just curious. Does anybody know when exactly these redirects are added and what is SPCanary_Net ? Thanks!
