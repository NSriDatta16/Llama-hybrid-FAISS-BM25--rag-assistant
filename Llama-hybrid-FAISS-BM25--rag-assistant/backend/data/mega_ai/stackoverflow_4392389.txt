I am using csharp-mongodb driver and it doesn't help me with his connection pool :( I have about 10-20 request to mongodb per web request.(150 users online - average) And i can't even monitor statistics or connect to mongodb from shell it throw exception to me. I have created repository, which open and dispose connection per request. I rely on such things as: 1) Driver has connection pool 2) After my research(i have posted some question in user groups about this) - i understood that creating mongo object and open connection doesn't heavy operation, so heavy operation. But today my production go down :( May be i have to save open connection per request... here is link to user group http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user/browse_thread/thread/3d4a4e6c5eb48be3#
