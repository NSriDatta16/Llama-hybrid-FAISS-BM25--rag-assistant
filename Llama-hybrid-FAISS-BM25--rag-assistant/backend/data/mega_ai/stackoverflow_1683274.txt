The simple answer is that as things stand today it's just not possible to keep secrets on the iPhone. A jailbroken iPhone is just a general-purpose computer that fits in your hand. There's no trusted platform hardware that you can access. The user can spoof anything you can imagine using to uniquely identify a given device. The user can inject code into your process to do things like inspect the keychain. (Search for MobileSubstrate to see what I mean.) Sorry, you're screwed. One ray of light in this situation is in app purchase receipts. If you sell an item in your app using in app purchase you get a receipt that's crypto signed and can be verified with Apple on demand. Even though you can't keep the receipt secret it can be traced (by Apple, not you) to a specific purchase, which might discourage pirates from sharing them. You can also throttle access to your server on a per-receipt basis to prevent your server resources from being drained by pirates.
