Problem in plug-in development: Eclipse 3.4 can't find a bundle that is definitively there!

Today I had a problem with my old Eclipse 3.4 installation and I had to re-download the entire package. However, I don't think that I got the exact package as before, and I'm having some problems. The problem can be summarized as follows: when developing a plug-in, I cannot resolve dependencies towards 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui'. When trying to add the missing plugin, in the dialog the closest match is 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui**.source**'. A similar thing happens with other core plugins. In order to test, I created a new plug-in using the wizard and I obtained a non-compiling plugin: one of the classes uses the class org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaUI and it cannot be resolved. Similarly, the MANIFEST.MF includes a dependency towards 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui', but the ' Bundle 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui' cannot be resolved '. Now a summary of my platform: I'm running Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and Java 1.5.0_19-138 I'm running Eclipse Version: 3.4.1 Build id: M20080911-1700 I downloaded the modeling package, which comes in a file called 'eclipse-modeling-ganymede-SR1-incubation-macosx-carbon.tar.gz' I've performed a fresh installation, in a new folder and using a new workspace. If I look at the Plug-in Registry view, I can find the 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui' plugin in there, and it appears to be running. By the way, if it is disabled, then the workbench breaks and stops working. I cannot understand what is happening. Is my installation broken? I wonder if the Eclipse package that I downloaded has an error and they included the sources instead of the compiled files. But in that case, the plug-in shouldn't be working in the workbench, isn't it? In any case, why I cannot find the plug-in when I'm adding the dependencies, even if I see it in the Plug-in Registry? Thanks for your help!
