@cHao & all: No! Bits are not numbers. They’re not zero or one! Well, 0 and 1 are possible and valid interpretations. Zero and one is the typical interpretation. But a bit is only a thing, representing a simple alternative. It says “it is” or “it is not”. It doesn’t say anything about the thing, the „it“, itself. It doesn’t tell, what thing it is. In most cases this won’t bother you. You can take them for numbers (or parts, digits, of numbers) as you (or the combination of programming languages, cpu and other hardware, you know as being “typical”) usaly do – and maybe you’ll never have trouble with them. But there is no principal problem if you switch the meaning of “0“ and “1”. Ok, if doing this while programming assembler, you’ll find it a bit problematic as some mnemonics will do other logic then they tell you with their names, numbers will be negated and such things. Have a look at http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~amaral/courses/329/webslides/Topic2-DeMorganLaws/sld017.htm if you want. Greetings
