A standard way of correcting for this is by using heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) standard errors. They are also known after their developers as Newey-West standard errors. They can be applied in Stata using the newey command. The Stata help file for this command is here: http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?newey The difficulty in applying these errors is that you need to choose the number of lags that you want the procedure to consider in the autocorrelation structure. The standard autocorrelation tests usually provide good guidance, though. This approach relies on asymptotics, so large data sets work better here. There are alternatives, including the block bootstrap.
