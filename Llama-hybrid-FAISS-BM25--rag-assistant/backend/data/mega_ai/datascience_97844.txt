How to handle a large number of categories in one column effectively in machine learning?

In my dataset one column has a large no of categories. For model training or building we need to convert these categories to numeric. There are several methods we can use to convert labels to numeric, one-hot encoding and label encoders, but here my problem is that the categories are not ordinal (no need to preserve order). We can use one-hot encoding, but it creates a large number of dimensions. In this case, which method do I need to choose for converting the categories to numeric effectively? It is not supposed to affect the dimensions of the model. Please advise on this case. Thanks in advance.
