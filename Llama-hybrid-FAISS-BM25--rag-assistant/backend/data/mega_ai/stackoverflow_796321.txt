Strange C++ std::string behavior... How can I fix this?

This is driving me nuts. I have been at it for over 2 hours trying to figure this out... Here is my problem. I am working on a fairly large program that works with Bayesian networks. Here is the main function: using namespace std; int main() { DSL_network net; initializeNetwork(net); setEvidence(net); net.SetDefaultBNAlgorithm(7); net.SetNumberOfSamples(80000); cout This all works fine. The problem comes when I want to print out a string: using namespace std; int main() { //simple string creation string a = "test"; //should print out "test" cout Here is the output (just from printing the string a...): ▀ÇΦy♠≈6 ♦ What could be going on? UPDATE: int main() { //simple string creation string a = "test"; //should print out "test" cout still prints ▀ÇΦy♠≈6 ♦ BIG UPDATE: Here is the recent. I created a brand new project and pasted the code that Neil Butterworth posted (thanks btw). I ran the code and it printed correctly. Then I added the two .lib files to the Linker in the new project (smile.lib for the SMILE library, and wsock32.lib for socket use.) I tried the code again, and it printed the first "test" correctly, then it printed the giberish. It is a problem with one of the .libs I am linking together. I tried each on their own to see if they are just clashing, and it seems that the smile.lib library is causing the problem. I will need to go into their documentation and figure out why. Any ideas? Thanks all for the help Thanks
