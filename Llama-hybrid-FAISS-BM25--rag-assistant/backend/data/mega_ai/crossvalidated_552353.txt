How do I fit a double Poisson regression model?

$$ X_k \sim \mathcal{Pois}(\lambda_k) \\ Y_k \sim \mathcal{Pois}(\mu_k) \\ \\ \ln \lambda_k = \alpha_{i(k)} + \beta_{j(k)} + \gamma + \eta / 2 \\ \ln \mu_k = \alpha_{j(k)} + \beta_{i(k)} + \gamma - \eta / 2 $$ Imagine the above problem for modelling basketball points, Where $X_k$ represents the total points scored by the home team in game $k$ and $Y_k$ represents the total points scored by the away team in game $k$ (assume $X$ and $Y$ are independent for simplicity). How would one fit these models using Maximum-likelihood estimation? $(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n)$ and $(\beta_1,...,\beta_n)$ are two vectors of coefficients to be estimated. $\alpha_{i(k)}$ is an 'attacking' coefficient for team $i$ (the 'home' team) in game $k$ . $\beta_{j(k)}$ the 'defending' coefficient for team $j$ (the 'away' team) in game $k$ . $\gamma$ is a constant, could be interpreted as the average points scored per game. $\eta$ : I'm not too sure, possibly a binary indicator variable or maybe another constant. Something like home advantage which could take the form $(X-Y)$ but I think that would violate the model ?
