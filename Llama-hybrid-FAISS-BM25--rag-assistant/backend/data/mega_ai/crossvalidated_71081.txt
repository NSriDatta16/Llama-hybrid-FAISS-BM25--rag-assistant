Degrees of freedom for a weighted average

And yet another for the long list of degrees-of-freedom questions! Given an i.i.d. sample $x_1,..., x_n$ from an arbitrary real-valued distribution with expectation $\mu$, the sample mean can be written as $$\bar x = \sum_i \frac{1}{n} x_i.$$ One can say that the degrees of freedom for $\bar x$ is $n-1$, as there are $n$ data points and one parameter being estimated. Now suppose that some twisted statistician decides that the weights $1/n$ are not good enough, and replaces $\bar x$ with $$\bar x_w = \sum_i w_i x_i,$$ where $w = (w_1, ..., w_n)$ is a pre-determined (i.e., not related to the data) vector of nonnegative weights with $\sum_i w_i = 1$. What is the degrees of freedom for $\bar x_w$? References to versions of this problem in peer-reviewed work would be of particular interest.
