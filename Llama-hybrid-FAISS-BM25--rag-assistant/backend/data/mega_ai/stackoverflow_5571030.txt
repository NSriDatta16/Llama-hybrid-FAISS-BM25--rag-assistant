Most of the text files (txt, xml, html, doc, pdf, ...) are already parsed and indexed by Alfresco as an out of the box feature, meaning that full-text search is already enabled. You don't need to perform any extra action. Just create a site, upload a PDF into its document library and try to search using one word used within the PDF content. Besides, the whole indexing and search process is performed by the Alfresco Repository, Alfresco Share is just a UI application that allows you to better leverage the content you store into the repository.
