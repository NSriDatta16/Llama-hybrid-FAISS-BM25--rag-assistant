Generating ordinal characters in JSP EL

Take the following JSP fragment: ${'A' + status.index} The intent should clear, I'm trying to generate an 'A'-based character index for each iterations through the loop. In Java, this is fine (e.g. 'A' + 1 == 'B' ), but JSP EL on Tomcat 6 barfs with java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "A" . It seems it cannot handle characters as ordinal values. The current solution breaks this out into a custom taglib, but this is absurd for something so trivial. Can anyone see how to persuade EL to do this calculation?
