I am trying to figure out the stationarity of time series data

Here, this plot shows the number of customers served per day from 1 jan 2018 to 31 dec 2019. I grouped the entire data by each month and calculated the average and variance per month. This is the average This is the variance I also ran an augmented dickey-fuller test and got the following result ADF Statistic: -26.031963 p-value: 0.000000 Since, the mean and variance do not vary too much, should I infer that the data is stationary?
