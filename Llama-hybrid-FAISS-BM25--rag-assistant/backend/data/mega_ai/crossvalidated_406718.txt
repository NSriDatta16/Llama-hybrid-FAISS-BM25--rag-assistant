Getting best fitted model using Auto ARIMA but prediction result is very bad

I saw this: time series - Poor prediction using ARIMA model But the answers aren't clear and isn't directing to me for solving the problem I have. Using only AR is giving me better prediction whereas Auto arima told me to use ARIMA. acf(diff(sunspots)) #check if there's any seasonal pattern pacf(diff(sunspots)) ACF plot suggesting to use MA(2) as ACF is cutting off and PACF is decreasing slowly. auto.arima(sunspots, start.p=0, max.p=3, start.q=0, max.q=3) Auto arima gave me (2,1,2)X(2,0,1): fit $pred years20_se se plot(sunspots,xlim=c(1700,2015),col="grey",lwd=1.5,ylab="sunspots") lines(years20_pred, col="green",lwd=1.5) This is evident how wrong the prediction is as it's not matching the previous patterns. Using only AR is giving better prediction graph see below: #++++++++++++++ ANOTHER WAY FOr AR===== y $pred years20_se se plot(sunspots,xlim=c(1700,2015),col="grey",lwd=1.5,ylab="sunspots") lines(years20$pred, col="green",lwd=1.5) I hvae tried lots of combination for ARIMA nothing is working and stuck on this for seven days. Can someone please advise where am I going wrong? After doing BoxCoxplot as @stephan said I am getting the positive bounds of the prediction intervals very high which shouldn't be considering previous patterns. Also, I replaced the x-axis values with my own to show years using these lines: forcastvar If I force change X-axis values it's not coming correctly according to data points. Is there a way for that?
