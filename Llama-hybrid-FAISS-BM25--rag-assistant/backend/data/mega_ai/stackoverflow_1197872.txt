Quick update: Shouldn't matter but I notices you don't need: [self.tableView beginUpdates] [self.tableView endUpdates] since you are performing one operation. Not sure if that matters (it shouldn't). Update: I should have said that such issues are pretty common. Here is a post related to your issue http://www.bdunagan.com/2008/12/08/uitextview-in-a-uitableview-on-the-iphone/ Also, others have abstracted this out. Specifically I have tried this with no such issues: http://furbo.org/2009/04/30/matt-gallagher-deserves-a-medal/ You could use: http://github.com/joehewitt/three20/ But it has a bit of a learning curve. Another Stackoverflow question tackling this issue: Editing a UITextField inside a UITableViewCell fails Excuse me not answering your issue directly, but I think that the solution might be contained in one of these links. Original Answer: Try: [newTextField setNeedsDisplay]; Sometimes the tableviews can be "sticky" with updating UITextView/UITextField content. If that doesn't work, be sure that you're backing model is also updated properly. You haven't displayed any code indicating you updated the model (although I assume you did, otherwise it would have likely thrown an exception).
