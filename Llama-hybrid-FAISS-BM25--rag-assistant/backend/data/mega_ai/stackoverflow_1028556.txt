Realtime duplicate of MovieClip

I have a MovieClip containing an image. The image can be dragged around inside the MC. The MC has a mask, let say round, so not all of the image is visible all the time, depends on where you drag the image. What I need is a real-time duplicate of this MC as a smaller thumbnail. When I drag the image around in the MC, the duplicate thumbnail MC should be updated in real-time. Anyone know how to do this?
