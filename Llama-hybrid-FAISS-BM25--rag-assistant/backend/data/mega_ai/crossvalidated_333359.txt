There are certainly lots of ways to try to numerically estimate high-dimensional definite integrals. The entire field of high-dimensional numerical integration is devoted to this problem, and it suffers from the dreaded curse of dimensionality . There are a lot of research papers in this field with a lot of different methods used. Kernel methods are one method that can be used to obtain approximate integrals (using the delta function would give a terrible approximation for continuous distributions), but I think it is fair to say that the most favoured methods presently used in this field are Monte-Carlo methods (e.g., importance sampling), Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo methods (e.g., Gibbs, Metropolis-Hastings, Hamiltonian MC), and sparse-grid methods. Most Bayesians make extensive use of Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods, and many general pieces of Bayesian software are built on these algorithms. The Stan package for Bayesian statistics is built on using Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo methods to estimate these integrals. This is a powerful method that has led to recent improvements in computational power in Bayesian analysis. I'm not an expert on this stuff myself, but I know it is a very large an complicated field, with lots of methods and lots of literature.
