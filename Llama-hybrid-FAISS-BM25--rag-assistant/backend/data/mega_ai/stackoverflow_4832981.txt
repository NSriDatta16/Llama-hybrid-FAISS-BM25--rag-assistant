localStorage to MySQL

Is there any easy way to move data from localStorage or sessionStorage into a MySQL database with callbacks? I'm guessing this would be done with AJAX, but I can't find a good how-to or guide for it. Basically, I'd like to send localStorage to the server, and alert the user as to whether or not the data was successfully stored by the server into MySQL.
