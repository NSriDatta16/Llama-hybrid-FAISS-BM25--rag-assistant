It's a debate that rages on and on (for instance, here ). It's as easy to write bad stored procedures as it is to write bad data access logic in your app. My preference is for Stored Procs, but that's because I'm typically working with very large and complex apps in an enterprise environment where there are dedicated DBAs who are responsible for keeping the database servers running sweetly. In other situations, I'm happy enough for data access technologies such as LINQ to take care of the optimisation. Pure performance isn't the only consideration, though. Aspects such as security and configuration management are typically at least as important. Edit: While Frans Bouma's article is indeed verbose, it misses the point with regard to security by a mile. The fact that it's 5 years old doesn't help its relevance, either.
