Regressing I(1) variable on I(0) variable

I am dealing with time series regression, where I have stationary and nonstationary variables. Can I regress nonstationary I(1) variable on stationary variable when controlling for the lag of the nonstationary I(1) variable? I know regressing nonstationary variable on stationary variable would lead to bias. However, would it be okay if I control for the lag of the nonstationary variable in my regression. My regression would be something like this in Stata (where y is I(1), x is I(0) and for illustration I use up to 3 lags of y) reg y_t+h x l(1/3).y_t
