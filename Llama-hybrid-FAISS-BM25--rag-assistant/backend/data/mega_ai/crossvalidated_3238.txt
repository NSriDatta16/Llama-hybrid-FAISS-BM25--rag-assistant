Time series 'clustering' in R

I have a set of time series data. Each series covers the same period, although the actual dates in each time series may not all 'line up' exactly. That is to say, if the Time series were to be read into a 2D matrix, it would look something like this: date T1 T2 T3 .... TN 1/1/01 100 59 42 N/A 2/1/01 120 29 N/A 42.5 3/1/01 110 N/A 12 36.82 4/1/01 N/A 59 40 61.82 5/1/01 05 99 42 23.68 ... 31/12/01 100 59 42 N/A etc I want to write an R script that will segregate the time series {T1, T2, ... TN} into 'families' where a family is defined as a set of series which "tend to move in sympathy" with each other. For the 'clustering' part, I will need to select/define a kind of distance measure. I am not quite sure how to go about this, since I am dealing with time series, and a pair of series that may move in sympathy over one interval, may not do so in a subsequent interval. I am sure there are far more experienced/clever people than me on here, so I would be grateful for any suggestions, ideas on what algorithm/heuristic to use for the distance measure and how to use that in clustering the time series. My guess is that there is NOT an established robust statistic method for doing this, so I would be very interested to see how people approach/solve this problem - thinking like a statistician.
