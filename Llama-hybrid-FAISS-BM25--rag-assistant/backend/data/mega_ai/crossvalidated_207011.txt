Can trees or random forests learn ratios

This is a question about feature engineering for decision trees/random forests. Given two continuous variables X1 and X2 , is it informative to construct a third feature variable $\frac{X1}{X2}$, i.e. the ratio between these variables? What about $\frac{X2}{X1}$? I think it is equivalent to whether a tree/random forest can solve the following problem: Consider the following dataset X1 X2 Y 1 3 0.333333333 3 4 0.75 2 3 0.666666667 5 6 0.833333333 6 15 0.4 8 12 0.666666667 ... Here, Y is the ratio of the first two variables. Can a tree/random forest predict Y given X1 and X2 ?
