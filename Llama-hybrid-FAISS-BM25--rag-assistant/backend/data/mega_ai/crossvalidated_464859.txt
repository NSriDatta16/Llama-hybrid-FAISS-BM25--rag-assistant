Optimize black box function with one of the output as constraint

I have used deep learning to obtain an objective function (or black box) which I need to optimize to get max output. So the inputs are a1,b1,b2,...,b8 while outputs are x,y and z = x^2/y. I need to get max z but at the same time, the value of a1 whereby z is max must also satisfy the condition that: a1 value when z is max So how should I solve the problem? I have only tried hyperopt at the moment and I can use it to get max z using z = fn1(a1,b1,b2,...,b8) with some constraints of a1,b1-8. Using the b1-8 values when z is max, I could use my deep learning trained y = fn2(a1,b1,b2,...,b8) to get max y. There is a special property in my case that y = fn2(a1) is a parabolic curve. Hence, since I now know the value of max y/1.5, I can decrease a1 by small increments until I get to a1 value when y/1.5 is max. I then compare a1@max z and a1@max y/1.5. if a1 value when z is max So although it worked, I wonder if there's a better way to solve this problem? I'm also wondering if there's a loophole in this mtd, such that I might not get the correct ans... Thanks for reading.
