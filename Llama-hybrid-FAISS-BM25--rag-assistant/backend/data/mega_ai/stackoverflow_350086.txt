..but internet explorer warns users when local content is launched.. I don't get it, what's the problem with IE saying "Hey this app is trying to run your files!" I don't mean you don't have a good reason for this, it is just, I don't get it. IE will only warn the user if the app has not been downloaded and try to access local resources, for instance if running from an applet or a JNLP like this one: (click on the first orange button you see ) But if the users download the jar and run it from the computer ( double click on it ) the app is local and can run without problems. The jar file is a zip file after all, so you can attach your mp3 file with it. Double click is supported in the desired platform, and the HTML content could be either a local file ( un-packed along with the mp3 file ) or an internet web page. Java is preinstalled on those OS already.
