As a quick check, ensure the variable is a ordered factor using str(TestSet). I do not know if this would be a problem for the polr function or not. I think you may be using the analysis from here: https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/ordinal-logistic-regression/ . If not then it is a good resource and explains things well. Their data set is bigger than yours, thus the manual p-value calculation you have done may be less satisfactory on your data set. From the webpage: “One way to calculate a p-value in this case is by comparing the t-value against the standard normal distribution, like a z test. Of course this is only true with infinite degrees of freedom, but is reasonably approximated by large samples, becoming increasingly biased as sample size decreases.”. The calculation you did for p-values matches theirs. However, your lower sample size means your p-values will be biased to be low. Unless you have done so already checking the proportional odds assumption is worth doing. Per the webpage section proportional odds assumption: “One of the assumptions underlying ordinal logistic (and ordinal probit) regression is that the relationship between each pair of outcome groups is the same. In other words, ordinal logistic regression assumes that the coefficients that describe the relationship between, say, the lowest versus all higher categories of the response variable are the same as those that describe the relationship between the next lowest category and all higher categories, etc. This is called the proportional odds assumption or the parallel regression assumption. Because the relationship between all pairs of groups is the same, there is only one set of coefficients.”. How to go about this is also detailed. Hope this helps.
