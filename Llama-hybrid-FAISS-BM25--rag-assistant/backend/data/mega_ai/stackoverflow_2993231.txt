Invoking a PL/SQL function from EclipseLink

I'm trying to execute a PL/SQL function in EclipseLink which uses Oracle Specific types(eg. Boolean). I've tried using PLSQLStoredProcedureCall which complains that I'm not executing a procedure and I have tried using StoredFunctionCall but that returns PLS-00382: expression is of wrong type Has anyone developed a solution to invoke functions in EclipseLink with Oracle Types? I have heard that it would be possible to extend StoredFunctionCall but I'd rather leverage existing functionality as much as possible.
