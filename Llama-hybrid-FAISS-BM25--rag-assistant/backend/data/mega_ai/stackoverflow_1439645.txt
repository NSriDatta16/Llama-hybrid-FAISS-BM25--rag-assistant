Blend does have this capability. You can even do this directly in Visual Studio's WPF Designer. It's a matter of learning the tools. You can still just make a grid, set it to 4 columns and 10 rows (which adds the Column and Row definitions to the grid), and then drag in the elements you want. The problem is probably more that you're trying to treat WPF the same way as a tool like Windows Forms - in which case, it does a horrible job. WPF is all about learning how to use WPF effectively, which is a very different mindset (in my experience, it's usually easier for non-developers to pick up, but tough for developers). There are not automatic grid creation with label/entry control tools, however. This is more likely a job for something like the DataGrid from the WPF Toolkit .
