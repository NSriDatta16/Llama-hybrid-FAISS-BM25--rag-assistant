Clone embedded swf class

Is there a way to clone an embedded class? Because otherwise, I can't directly use my custom methods. Embedding from within the class doesn't work. package { import flash.display.Sprite; public class Player { public var player:Sprite; [Embed(source = '../lib/player.swf')] private var swf:Class; public function Player() { this = new swf(); // doesnt work } public function method1():void { return; } } } Embedding from outside the class, also doesn't work. package { import flash.display.Sprite; public class Main { public var player:Player; [Embed(source = '../lib/player.swf')] private var swf:Class; public function Main() { player = Player(new swf()); // doesn't work player = new swf() as Player; // doesn't work } } } Or maybe there is a way to instantiate a class from an embed and convert it to another class? Thanks.
