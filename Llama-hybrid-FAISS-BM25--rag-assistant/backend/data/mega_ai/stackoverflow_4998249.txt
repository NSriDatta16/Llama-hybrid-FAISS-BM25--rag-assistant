TrueCrypt is a software application used for on-the-fly encryption (OTFE). It is distributed without cost (see tag details for source code and documentation link). It can create a virtual encrypted disk within a file or encrypt a partition or (under MS Windows except Windows 2000) the entire storage device (pre-boot authentication). -Wikipedia
