Detecting faked pagerank

Does anyone know how I would go about detecting faked pagerank in a php script im writing to run checks on a domain? I understand that PR is faked when someone sets up a specific 301 redirect to a high pr domain exclusively for googlebots, but dont know how I would mimic this to check (I guess I would need the exact user agent?) Thanks
