Allocating memory is fast relative to some things and slow relative to others. The average Objective-C program does a lot more than 60 allocations per second. For allocations of a few million bytes, malloc+free should take less than a thousand of a second . Compared to arithmetic operations, that's slow. But compared to other things, it's fast. Whether it's fast enough in your case is a question for testing. It's certainly possible to do 60 Hz memory allocations on the iPhone â€” the processor runs at 600 MHz. This certainly does seem like a good candidate for reusing the memory, though. Keep track of the size of the pool and allocate more if you need more. Not allocating memory is always faster than allocating it.
