Elegant way to make CustomValidator work with ValidationSummary messagebox

I have run into this problem before but never quite solved it. I have a form with several validators and also a CustomValidator. * * * and on the server side: protected void cvMemberNum_Validate(object source, ServerValidateEventArgs args) { try { args.IsValid = (!CampaignRegistration.IsMemberRegistered(args.Value)); } catch { args.IsValid = false; } } My problem is: The ValidationSummary never shows the message from CustomValidator. This question has been asked in several places, but I havent seen a satisfactory answer.
