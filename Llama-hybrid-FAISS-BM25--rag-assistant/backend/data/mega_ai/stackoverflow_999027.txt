I would emphasize @le dorfier's comment about archiving. Most Access applications with a Jet data store don't need data to be archived. A client of mine runs a billing system for 6 parking garages that I built for her back in 1997-98 (it's been upgraded, extended and revised extensively since then). It includes data for that entire period (200-300 invoices for each month for each garage) and it works just as fast now as it did back then. Part of that is the increase in the performance of PCs (i.e., with the same amount of data and 1997-era PCs, it would probably be very slow), but it still works just fine. If speed started to be an issue, we'd probably move the back end to SQL Server Express. The last thing we'd contemplate would be archiving the data. Another client of mine insisted on archiving their inactive data, and then I had to reprogram the ADD NEW RECORD function to check against the archive (because of the requirements of the app, it's crucial that the same person not have a new record created, but instead have it retrieved from the archive). This vastly slowed down the process of adding new records. Now I'm trying to convince them to "de-archive" their data, because it hasn't actually helped them in any way and has made things work more slowly during daily operations.
