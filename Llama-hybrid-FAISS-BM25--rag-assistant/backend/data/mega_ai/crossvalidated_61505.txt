Why the $R^2$, AIC and BIC criteria give different "best model" for models of equal complexity?

I'm modeling growth curve of several ecosystems with respect to their rainfall-productivity relationship using a simple linear regression $\text{ANPP}(t)=a+b\cdot\text{Rain}(t)$ and a modified version of the Brody Model $\text{ANPP}(t)=a\cdot\left[1-e^{(-b\cdot\text{Rain}(t))}\right]$, i.e. for each ecosystem, the two models are fitted to observed data and compared to each other. I would like to know why the $R^2, AIC$ and $BIC$ criteria disagree for many ecosystems about the "best model" knowing that the Brody and the the linear regression are both 2-parameter models (i.e. in this case the complexity is not an issue for $R^2$)? In the above formula, $\text{Rain}(t)$ denotes the accumulated rainfall from time to to time t and to compute the $R^2$, I used the following formula: r2 My guess is that the models needs to have the same form (which is not the case here: linear form vs exponential form) ) or nested so that their model selection with frequentist or Bayesian approaches such as the $AIC$ and $BIC$ criteria will give the same best result with a simple maximizing fit approach such as the $R^2$.
