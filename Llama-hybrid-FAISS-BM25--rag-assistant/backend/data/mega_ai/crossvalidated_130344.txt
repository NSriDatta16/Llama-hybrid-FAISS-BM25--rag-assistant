Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) is one way to solve the SVM training problem that is more efficient than standard QP solvers. SMO uses heuristics to partition the training problem into smaller problems that can be solved analytically. Whether or not it works well depends largely on the assumptions behind the heuristics (working set selection). Typically, it speeds up training by quite a bit. I'm not sure what Weka uses under the hood. LIBSVM is by far the most popular library to train SVMs, so you may want to look into that.
