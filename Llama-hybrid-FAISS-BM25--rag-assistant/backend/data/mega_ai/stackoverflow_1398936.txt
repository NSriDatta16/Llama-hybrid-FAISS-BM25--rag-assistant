I thought it was worth updating this dialog because things are becoming more "do able" in SVG cross-browser. As someone who has implemented some (fairly significant) systems for organisation I have been "dabbling" into the world of "cross-browser" SVG. I see the words "still too early" on a dialog started 11 months ago and I'm adding to it. Please go to my site that shows some of the capabilities of Raphael. You can easily link to the main Raphael site there after your pitstop. My website was implemented with Raphael 0.8.6 but the creater of "Rap" just brought version 1.0 from beta and that (additionally) fully supports SVG "paths" If you want to visit the world of CROSS-BROWSER interactive/SVG in it's current status please visit these constamtly updated websites via: http://www.irunmywebsite.com/raphael/raphaelsource.html
