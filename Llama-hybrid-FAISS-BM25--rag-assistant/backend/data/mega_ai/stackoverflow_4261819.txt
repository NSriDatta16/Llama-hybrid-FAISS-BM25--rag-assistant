After much trial and tribulation I figured it out. Hope this helps someone else. Since I am on a shared server I cannot adjust the include_path. It won't work using a .htaccess file either because phpunit is run from the command line and doesn't invoke the .htaccess file. Therefore, setting an include path in a .htaccess is fruitless if you're having the same problems as I was with phpunit. The only path that I am now able to get phpunit tests to run from is /home/myname/php. That is because my PHPUnit files automatically install in /home/myname/php/PHPUnit. When running a phpunit test from /home/myname/php I would get an error stating File &quot;/home/... &quot; could not be found At this point I found that I needed to upgrade PHPUnit, which in turn upgraded a number of its dependencies (CodeCoverage, Selenium and others). The command to upgrade phpunit was pear upgrade phpunit/PHPUnit Now I can successfully run tests from the /home/myname/php folder and it works. If I run the tests from any other folder it fails because it is searching the include_path directories and /home/myname/php is not one of those paths.
