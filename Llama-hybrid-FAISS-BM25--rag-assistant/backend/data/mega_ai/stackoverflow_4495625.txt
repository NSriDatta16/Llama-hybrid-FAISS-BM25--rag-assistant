Zend_Auth using Zend_Session instead of default storage?

I was reading through this tutorial , and at one point in the code, the user info is retrieved from the database and a session is created for the user: // the default storage is a session with namespace Zend_Auth $authStorage = $auth->getStorage(); $authStorage->write($userInfo); I tried this, but this session expires once the browser is closed. So my question is how do I combine this with Zend_Session to create a cookie that lasts for 20 days or something? I can't figure it out through the Zend_Session documentation.. Any help is appreciated! Thanks
