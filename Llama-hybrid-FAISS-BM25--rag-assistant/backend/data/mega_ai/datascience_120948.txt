Dimensions of mel spectrogram

Can someone explain me dimensions in ASR? For example, if I have an audio, convert it to mel spectrogram and now I have a tensor of dimension [1, 128, 850]. Am I understand right that 128 - number of channels and if i will apply CNN for input, input channels will be equal to 128? And what is 850? For example, if I will apply transformer for input mel spectrogram, number of embeddings that I will pass to encoder is 850? Thank you in advance
