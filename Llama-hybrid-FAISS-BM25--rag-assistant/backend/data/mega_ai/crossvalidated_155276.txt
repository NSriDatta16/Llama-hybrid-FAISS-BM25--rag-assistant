Improving quality of logistic regression estimation

I'm working on a credit scoring model (logistic regression), and I have divided my dataset (5082 obs with 580 negatives) in two samples: 75% training set and 25% test set. The result of the estimation is disappointing, the quality evaluated by the roc curve is 0.63 (and gini coefficient=0.26). I thought, the reason maybe that I have not enough data, and so not enough negatives after I split the data. Is there a method to use the whole data set for estimation? And do the validation on the same dataset? How might this work? I'm new to this methods so my questions is not detailed. Thank you for an suggestion/explication
