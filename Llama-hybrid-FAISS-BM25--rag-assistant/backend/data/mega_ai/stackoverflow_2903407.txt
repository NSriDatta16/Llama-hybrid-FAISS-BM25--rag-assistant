There are some notifications that belong to the page that generates them, such as errors in form fields. These are easy to handle. I normally create an array to hold them in HTML format and use a function to display them as HTML list: ' . implode(' ', $errors) . ' '; } } # ... if($foo Foo is ' . htmlspecialchars($foo) . ' but it must be greater than zero.'; } if(empty($errors)){ save_stuff(); header('Location: http://example.com/somewhere/else/'); exit; } # ... print_errors($errors); echo ' '; echo ' '; echo ' '; # ... ?> Then there is the case you describe: after a successful (or impossible) action, the user is redirected somewhere else (e.g., main section page) where he gets an explanation. For short messages, I tend to use a GET variables that hold the messages in plain text: ' . htmlspecialchars($_GET['error']) . ' '; } if( isset($_GET['message']) ){ echo ' ' . htmlspecialchars($_GET['message']) . ' '; } ?> This is quite fine for intranets, but it has two drawbacks: No HTML available. Bored users can enjoy themselves distributing links with funny error messages: http://example.com/?error=You%20are%20dumb If you have some storage available (files, databases, whatever) you can keep full HTML messages and assign them a random ID: ID: 4a0a19218e082a343a1b17e5333409af9d98f0f5 Date: 2010-05-25 11:24:30 Type: message HTML: Item #25 was modified successfully. http://example.com/?msg=4a0a19218e082a343a1b17e5333409af9d98f0f5 Make sure you save the date so you can clean up old data now and then. My two cents.
