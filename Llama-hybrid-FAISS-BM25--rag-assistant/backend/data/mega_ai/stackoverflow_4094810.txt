Not able to check if user is logged in magento system in footer.phtml file on some pages

I am not able to check if user is logged in or not in magento system. I need to check it in footer.phtml file and show the footer links accordingly. It is working in some of the pages but not in all pages. when i gone inside in the issue and printed session array it is not accessible in some pages and in other pages it is accessible. I used below code to check if user is logged in the system or not. Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')->isLoggedIn() and $this->helper('customer')->isLoggedIn() But it return false in some pages but works in others. and also when i gone inside the footer and printed the current action and module name. it is showing module customer and action create where as address bar shows customer/somethingelse. I am very surprised. Please help. Thanks.
