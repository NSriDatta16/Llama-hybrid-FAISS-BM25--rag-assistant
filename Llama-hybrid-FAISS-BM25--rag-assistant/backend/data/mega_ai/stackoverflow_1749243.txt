Logging user agent info on login with Spring Security

I am using Spring Security with LDAP for an application and I want to log the user-agent when the user logs in. However, I cannot access the request object in the Authorities Populator so I cannot access the user-agent information from there. I also tried setting the pattern in our logger (log4j) so it would log the user agent by putting in %X{user-agent}, but that didn't work either. All I want to do is log the user agent information when the user logs in. So if there is a method in Spring's security framework I can override that will have access to the request on login object that would be ideal. OR If I can get log4j to record the user agent whenver an entry to the log is made, that would be fine as well.
