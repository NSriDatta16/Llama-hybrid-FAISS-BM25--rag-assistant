I find that Java performs very well. However, why has no one ever fixed my biggest complaint? Java uses FIVE TIMES as much memory as a C++ program doing the same job. At least! And once it's used, Java keeps it ! Please, please, why won't anyone write a garbage collector for Java that uses minimum amounts of RAM? It could compact the heap and returns the memory to the OS. Instead of ridiculous piles of -Xm* options, use the memory needed and then give it back ! Actually I am sure some of the embedded system JVMs do this, but none of the desktop or server systems do. This memory piggishness makes Java applications all want to act as if they own the entire computer system, that no one ever wants to run more than one application and that RAM is free and infinitely upgradable. Therefore, no matter how great the performance, I would never write anything like a utility program in Java. Only gigantic server apps need apply.
