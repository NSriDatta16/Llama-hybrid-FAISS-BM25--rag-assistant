Computational cost of applicative style

I am using a small database pool in my web app. And this particular function: withPool pool = bracket (takeConn pool) (putConn pool) can be rewritten in applicative style: withPool = bracket takeConn putConn Arguably it is just as readable and much more elegant. So naturally, I want to write it like that. But database connection pool supposed to be fast, and I am afraid that this style introduces unnecessary overhead. So my question is, how much overhead (if any) does use of applicative functors incur in Haskell? Are there any benchmarks?
