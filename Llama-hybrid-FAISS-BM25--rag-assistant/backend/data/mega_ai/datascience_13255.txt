how does feature selection for random forest help

I came across this link which talks about feature selections in random forest It introduces two methods Mean decrease impurity Mean decrease accuracy I would like to know if there are more methods and when should one method be preferred. Also is it correct to say that less feature for random forest always gives worse result and the only gain is in computation speed?
