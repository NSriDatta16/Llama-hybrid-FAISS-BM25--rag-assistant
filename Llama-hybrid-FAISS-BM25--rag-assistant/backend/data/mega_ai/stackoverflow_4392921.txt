Android: Create image button with a non-clickable overlarge overlay when focused?

For a new Android project I need buttons which are 'shining' when focused or pressed, meaning a bigger image should show up on top of the first image. My problem here is: The clickable area should be not as large as this overlay image. In ASCII-Art: +------------------------------------------+ | | | | | +---------------------+ | | | Inner image, always | | | | visible & clickable | | | +---------------------+ | | Overlay (image with alpha on top) | | visible on focus or press, NOT clickable | +------------------------------------------+ So basically there may be other items under the overlay image which should still be fully accessible, e.g. by clicking & dragging. Do you know how I may solve this in Android? A XML layout solution would be the best! Any best practices here?
