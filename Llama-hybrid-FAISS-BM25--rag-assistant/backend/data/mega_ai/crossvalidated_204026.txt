Are 1656 tweets enough? That depends first and foremost on your task. See my answer here for more information. Supervised or unsupervised? Can you give (at least) one category for most documents? Then it is supervised. Small sets vs large sets For most scenarios in text classification, linear SVMs (Liblinear) work very well. Twitter data is somewhat harder to handle because of things like colloquial language, misspellings, abbreviations, hashtags...etc. However, if you clean and preprocess your data quite good, the algorithms work the same as usual.
