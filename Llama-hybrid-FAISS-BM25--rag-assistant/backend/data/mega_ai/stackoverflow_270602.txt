MouseCapture prevents all mouse based triggers from firing in WPF

I am using CaptureMouse() during a drag and drop operation to make sure I don't miss the MouseUp event, but this seems to prevent any mouse events reaching any other objects on my Canvas. This means that my IsMouseOver based triggers don't work, but I need them to indicate valid locations where the object can be dropped. Am I doing this wrong, or is there a way of making sure everything on my Canvas still gets mouse events?
