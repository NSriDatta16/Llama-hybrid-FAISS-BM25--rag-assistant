Under what conditions DQN selects only one action?

I'm implementing DQN in reinforcement learning, double DQN actually, and it's returning only one action, out of 7 possible actions. I've tried changing number of layers of neural network, regularization parameters, layer size. But I still get only one action. That is, for a particular set of parameters, I get only one action. I wanted to know if it is a common scenario. What it would imply and under what conditions we will encounter such situation? Any suggestion for resolving this will be greatly appreciated.
