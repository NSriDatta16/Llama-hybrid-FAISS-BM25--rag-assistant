How to calculate the Doolittle Skill Score?

A statistic called the Doolittle Skill Score (DSS) is sometimes calculated in relation to the deterministic forecasting of binary events. Hogan and Mason (2012) p35-36 provides the following instruction on two different ways of calculating the DSS: I call one method the 'abcd' method and the other the 'hfs' method. They're both meant to be equivalent. The methods must be understood with respect to the following 2x2 contingency table: I've written a MATLAB script with example data here . It seems to me that the two methods do not give the same results. Are these two calculation methods inconsistent with one another? If so, is there some way I can easily tell which is wrong? If the hfs version is wrong, how can I calculate the DSS using the hfs method? One possibility to find the real DSS would be to look at the original article. Unfortunately it is from 1885 and I can't find it. In any case in this research area the terminology often diverges from what was intended by the originator. Doolittle, M. H. (1885).
