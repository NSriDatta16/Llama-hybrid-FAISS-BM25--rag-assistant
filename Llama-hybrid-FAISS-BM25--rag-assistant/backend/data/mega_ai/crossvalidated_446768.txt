Multiplying two markov chains

Let there be two homogenous markov-chains $(X_t)_{t \in \mathbb{N}_0}$ and $(Y_t)_{t \in \mathbb{N}_0}$ with transition matrices $P_X$ and $P_Y$ , given as follows: $P_X = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, P_Y = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{2}{3} & \frac{1}{3}\\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ I need to calculate the transition matrix $P_Z$ of $(Z_t)_{t \in \mathbb{N}_0}$ where $Z_t = X_t \cdot Y_t$ for all $t \in \mathbb{N}_0$ . Since $\{0, 1, 2\} \times \{0, 1\} = \{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1)\}$ , $Z_t$ has the 3 states $0, 1$ and $2$ . What I'm confused about is that when I'm in state $0$ of $Z_t$ , I could be in any of the states $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)$ and $(2,0)$ in the "combined" matrix. But then the probability to go from state $0$ to, say, back to state $0$ depends on which of the four states in the combined matrix I am, which would mean the value $P^{n+1}_{Z, 0,0}$ depends not only on $P^n_{Z, 0, 0}$ but also on previous states. But then I would not have a markov-chain anymore. Please forgive the poor wording.
