I was going to suggest the following paper: Law CW, Zeglinski K, Dong X, Alhamdoosh M, Smyth GK, Ritchie ME (2020). A guide to creating design matrices for gene expression experiments. F1000Research 9, 1444. https://f1000research.com/articles/9-1444 which would seem to be exactly what you are after. However I've now noticed that you have already rejected this paper, along with all others, as "way too complex". We went to a lot of effort to make that paper accessible to as wide an audience as possible, so I have to give up here. A famous quote attributed to Albert Einstein says that Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler . The model formula that you have proposed has the flaw that it assumes the time effects to be the same for each treatment, which seems an unwarranted assumption. However the experiment you are analyzing seems itself to have the fundamental flaw that there is no replication of any of the treatment/time combinations, so it cannot be analyzed by the standard simple analysis approach that we usually recommend for replicated microarray experiments. There is an analysis strategy based on splines that I would use myself for an unreplicated time-course experiment like yours. The approach is described in the "Time course" sections of the limma and edgeR User's Guide, but it is a lot more statistically sophisticated than what you seem willing to consider.
