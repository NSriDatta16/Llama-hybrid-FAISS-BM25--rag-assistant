Interpreting Bias Corrected bootstrapping confidence intervals in logistic regression

I have a question about interpreting and using the bias corrected confidence intervals for logistic regression as produced by SPSS. I understand the rationale for using bootstrapping, but want confirmation that the BCa confidence intervals produced by the bootstrapping cannot be used as is but need to be exponentiated in order to obtain the actual confidence intervals. The screen shot below indicates this issue. The original CI is 2.263 - 3.378. In the table below that the estimates from the bootstrapping are provide. The variable remains significant, which means the CI cannot contain the neutral value of 1. The BCa CI indicated is 0.813 - 1.226, which at face value suggests the variable is not significant. However, when I exponentiate the BCa CI I arrive at 2.254-3.407, which excludes the value of 1 and is also similar to the original CI estimates. Am I thus correct in finding the exponent of the BCA supplied values for the bootstrapping CI? Many thanks.
