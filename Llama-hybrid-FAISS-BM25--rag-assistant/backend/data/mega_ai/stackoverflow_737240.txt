Array size at run time without dynamic allocation is allowed?

I've been using C++ for a few years, and today I saw some code, but how can this be perfectly legal? int main(int argc, char **argv) { size_t size; cin >> size; int array[size]; for(size_t i = 0; i Compiled under GCC. How can the size be determined at run-time without new or malloc ? Just to double check, I've googled some and all similar codes to mine are claimed to give storage size error. Even Deitel's C++ How To Program p. 261 states under Common Programming Error 4.5: Only constants can be used to declare the size of automatic and static arrays. Enlight me.
