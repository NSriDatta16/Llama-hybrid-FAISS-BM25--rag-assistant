Having gone through the Alice website, I wouldn't be too hopeful, it seems like a platform for a bunch of people to charge for texts, and workshops. Really, python has a billion beginner tutorials and that'll pay off. While Alice will remain relatively unknown. Much depends upon what your brother, not you, want to accomplish. Does he want to 'learn' programming? Or maybe he sits on facebook all day, and would benefit from learning php so he can do things against the facebook API, or what have you. I would worry more about the activity, than the language he starts with. Assuming, he's got someone to ask questions. And about the best thing you can do is have some confidence in him, and encourage your brother.
