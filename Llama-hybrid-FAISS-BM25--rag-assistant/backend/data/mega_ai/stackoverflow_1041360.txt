How do I get triple click to work in Visual Studio's Text Editor

Go into Notepad, Internet Explorer or most other applications that display or edit text. Triple click on some text. Windows will select the entire paragraph under the cursor. This doesn't work in Visual Studio 2005. How do I get triple click support in the Visual Studio text editor? do VS 2008 or VS 2010 solve this? Is there a macro, setting or plugin that will solve this?
