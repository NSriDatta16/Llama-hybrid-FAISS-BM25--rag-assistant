Why is Hebbian learning a less preferred option for training deep neural networks?

I understand that backpropagation is good, but what are the main advantages (and disadvantaged) that it has over Hebbian learning? I'm mostly wondering about contrastive Hebbian learning, though arguments against Hebbian learning in general are welcomed.
