It's a great question. The biggest problem, as I see it, is the (over-)use of the term "population." It really does not mean "population" in nearly every statistical context, even in the IQ case you mention. In fact, authors often put "population" in quotes ("") to underscore that they do not really mean population in the strict sense. Instead, there is a data generating process (DGP) by which the data elements are produced. In time series this makes perfect sense: As you mention there is no population. On the other hand, there are potentially observable data at every single time point that were not observed . To understand this clearly, just put yourself back in time before a particular data point was observed. If you knew what that data value would be, you would not use a statistical model. But you probably did not know what that data point would be, so instead you assume that it comes from some probabilistic process, which you model using ARIMA, GARCH, or whatever probabilistic model is appropriate. So in the context of time series data, the target of all statistical inference is the data generating process. You choose a model for it (ARIMA, GARCH etc.), and the validity of the methods hinges upon the validity of your chosen model as a faithful representation of nature's process. It is really no different in other fields like IQ measurements, or more generally, in cross sectional data. It is nearly impossible that the pristine data collection requirements (perfect random sampling, instantaneous identical measurements, no nonresponse, etc.) needed for the "population" interpretation to hold actually do hold, so while the desired target of inference may well be some population, the data instead target the data generating process. In regression, the necessity of the DGP point of view (rather than the population point of view) becomes even clearer, no matter whether time series or cross section. Say you wish the population to be "everyone on Earth," and you want to predict IQ using height, weight, date of birth, gender, income, etc. When you fix all the $X$ variables at some specified values, there may be only one person on the planet having those precise characteristics. So from the population point of view, the conditional distributions which are part of the true regression model are comprised of but a single number. Hardly what one would like for a "population"! Usually populations are considered to be a large collection of numbers. Even there is a "population" lurking around, scientists are usually more interested in something bigger than that. For example, biologists are usually more interested in how genetic processes govern human life, rather than in how many of which gene variants are present on Earth at any given point in time. Thus, they would be interested in describing how the population data came to be the way it is, rather than in just the population. This requires the viewpoint that the population data themselves are the result of processes. Bottom Line: Just replace "population" with "data generating process" and everything will work out fine.
