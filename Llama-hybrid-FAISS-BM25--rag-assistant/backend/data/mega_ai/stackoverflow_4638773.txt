varchar requires extra storage for length information comparison and sorting requires collation processing varchar may not match across systems because of collation int gives 4 billion rows, bigint (8 bytes) gives 18 trillion rows pre-bigint, I've seen decimal (19, 0) which also gives 18 trillion rows Using varchar will end in tears... To be clear: you're developing a system that may have more then 4 billion rows (you don't know ), has replication, you don't know what RDBMS you'll use, and you don't understand how varchar differs from an integer?
