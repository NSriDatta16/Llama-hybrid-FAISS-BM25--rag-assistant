Mac Installer Certificates

I'm at the point where I'm ready to submit an app - an Apple doesn't elaborate much on how to sign and submit apps. I have both the WWDRCA certificate and one I created but am at a loss on where to put them.. do I add them via drag n' drop into XCode? Why do I need the WWDRCA? Anyone have any info on this? Would be GREATLY appreciated
