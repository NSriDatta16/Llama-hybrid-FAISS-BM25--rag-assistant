How to Detect NSWindow Maximize or Zoom Event?

How do you detect when a user clicks the green maximize or zoom (+) button on the NSWindow without using the NSWindowDidResizeNotification ? The reason I don't want to use NSWindowDidResizeNotification is because that is also triggered repeatedly as the user clicks and drags to manually resize the window. I have some code that I want to execute and it should only fire once when the user zooms or de-zooms the window using the green button in the top left-hand corner and not many times when manually resizing the window.
