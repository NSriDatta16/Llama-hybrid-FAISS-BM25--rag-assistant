There are two WPF books on 3D that I have - one is Charles Petzolds "3D Programming for Windows", which provides a great walk through the topic and is quite practical. The second is Practical WPF Graphics Programming by Jack Xu, which does go a little deeper, but seems to follow a pattern of a few paragraphs of text, followed by 3 pages of code/XAML, then a picture or two. I don't recall either covering performance in depth, though general tips are given. Out of interest, how large is your mesh? In general 3D for WPF is great for augmenting a 2D application, but it isn't really designed for fully-3D, high performance graphics.
