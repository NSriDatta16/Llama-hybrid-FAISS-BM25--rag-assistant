I don't have a fully general answer but it is a start. This assumes: 8 rowers (identified as 1 to 4 and A to D); 1 to 4 always row on one side, and A to D on the other. 2 boats with 4 rowers each: two from 1 to 4 and two from A to D. 6 races of 2 boats; distance 1000m, for each boat the time is taken. rowers are placed into boats according to a swap matrix from the time of a race the average power of the crew is computed. The general connection is $P=k*v^3$ with $k=2.8*4$ a typical drag coefficient for boats with 4 rowers and $v$ the speed of the boat calculated from distance and time. The problem now becomes finding a solution for the following equation system (with some crew power values as an example): $$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} x_1\\ x_2\\ x_3\\ x_4\\ x_A\\ x_B\\ x_C\\ x_D\\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1303.02 \\ 1350.62 \\ 1354.82 \\ 1274.37 \\ 1305.56 \\ 1304.04 \\ 1304.49 \\ 1256.89 \\ 1252.69 \\ 1333.14 \\ 1301.95 \\ 1303.47 \\ \end{bmatrix}\\ $$ or more succinctly as \begin{equation} \label{eq:sx=p} S x = P \end{equation} where $S$ is the swap matrix, $x$ the power of each rower, and $P$ the observed crew power. The swap matrix $S$ identifies who is racing together in a crew. Solving $Sx=P$ for $x$ is not straight forward: $S$ is not square and therefore has no inverse. The left inverse $S'$ with $S'S=I$ does not exist because $\textrm{rank}(S)= 7 . But $S$ has a unique generalised inverse $S^+$ which we can use to describe all solutions. \begin{align} S^+ &= \frac{1}{48} \begin{bmatrix} +7&-5&-5&+7&-5&-5&-5&+7&+7&-5&+7&+7\\ +7&+7&+7&+7&+7&+7&-5&-5&-5&-5&-5&-5\\ -5&-5&+7&-5&-5&+7&+7&+7&-5&+7&+7&-5\\ -5&+7&-5&-5&+7&-5&+7&-5&+7&+7&-5&+7\\ +7&+7&-5&-5&-5&+7&-5&-5&+7&+7&+7&-5\\ +7&-5&+7&-5&+7&-5&-5&+7&-5&+7&-5&+7\\ -5&+7&+7&+7&-5&-5&+7&-5&-5&-5&+7&+7\\ -5&-5&-5&+7&+7&+7&+7&+7&+7&-5&-5&-5 \end{bmatrix} \end{align} All solutions for rower power $x$ given crew power $P$ are given by \begin{equation} \label{eq:x=sp} x = S^+ P + c \begin{bmatrix} +1&+1&+1&+1&-1&-1&-1&-1 \end{bmatrix}^T \end{equation} for an arbitrary constant $c$ . Possible solutions are \begin{equation} \begin{array}{rrrr} rower & c=0 & c=10 & c=30 \\ 1 & 293.40 & 303.40 & 323.40 \\ 2 & 343.42 & 353.42 & 373.42 \\ 3 & 334.14 & 344.14 & 364.14 \\ 4 & 332.80 & 342.80 & 362.80 \\ A & 331.67 & 321.67 & 301.67 \\ B & 334.53 & 324.53 & 304.53 \\ C & 342.74 & 332.74 & 312.74 \\ D & 294.82 & 284.82 & 264.82 \\ \end{array} \end{equation} Note that the difference in power between rowers within one side is independent of $c$ . This is a feature of the swap matrix $S$ and now can be used to rank rowers per side. The strongest rowers on starboard are 2, 3, 4, 1 in this order. The strongest rowers on port side are C, B, A, D in this order. We can't tell who is the strongest rower across sides because power shifts between sides are not detected by the method. Parameter $c$ basically models this shift. Across all solutions, the difference in power between rowers of one side remains constant and leads to an order independent of $c$ . With $c=0$ the combined power of rowers of 1 to 4 and A to D is equal. This makes it somewhat more likely to be the true scenario than a solution with a large parameter $c$ .
