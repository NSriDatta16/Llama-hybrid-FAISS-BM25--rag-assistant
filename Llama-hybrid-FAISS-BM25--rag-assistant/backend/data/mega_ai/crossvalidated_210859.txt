Could this be modelled using an MDP where the player state is number of elves, and amount of cash, and the actions are the allocation of elves to locations, and number of elves to hire? Sure. Unless the effects are delayed from actions, in which case the state should include that. If so, what cost is associated with sending elves to the mountain? You want to maximize the total amount of money, so the reward at the end of each turn is the gross profit. Would I use reinforcement learning to find an optimal strategy? (Or even a good one!) I don't see why not.
