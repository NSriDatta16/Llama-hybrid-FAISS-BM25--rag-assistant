Is marshaling/ serialization in PHP as simple as serialize($var)?

here's a definition of marshaling from Wikipedia: In computer science, marshalling (similar to serialization) is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for storage or transmission. It is typically used when data must be moved between different parts of a computer program or from one program to another. I have always done data serialization in php via its serialize function, usually on objects or arrays. But how is wikipedia's definition of marshaling/serialization takes place in this serizalize( ) function?
