Are you sure the sortable system is the one you need, from the sounds of your second paragraph dont you just want to make an element draggable? ( see http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ ) Would you be better using that to then lock the x-axis and let it be dragged anywhere along the y-axis. Hope I understood you correctly, just a thought.
