SVM - number of dimensions greater than number of samples would give good or bad performance?

I was reading the documentation of sklearn SVM and saw these two statements Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances. Now my understanding regarding SVM is fairly limited (the reason why I am reading the article) but the above 2 statements seem contradictory. But I believe that I am missing something. What is missing in my understanding due to which the above 2 are not contradictory?
