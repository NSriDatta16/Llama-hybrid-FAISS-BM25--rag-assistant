Let's remove the facebook buzzword from the equation. If you need/want to leverage google's infrastructure, you use appengine. There are projects for django that allow you to access appengine services at a higher level of abstraction such as the datastore, blobstore etc... http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/django-nonrel I wouldn't call it the best solution but if the Django style of development is what you are comfortable with, it's a good option. I personally prefer using google's model api for the orm and using something else for routing requests to views. bfg/pyramid is a good option if your routing fits the notion of an object graph, and you can get instance level security fairly easy if you do if thats something you need. conclusion: it all depends on what you need to do. :)
