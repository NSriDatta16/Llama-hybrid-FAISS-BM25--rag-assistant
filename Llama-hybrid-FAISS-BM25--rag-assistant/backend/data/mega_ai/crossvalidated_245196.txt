To the best of my knowledge, there is no opposition between Bayesian models (BM) and hierarchical Bayesian models (HBM) (see e.g. Relation between Bayesian analysis and Bayesian hierarchical analysis? ) and the fact is that, analytically, HBMs are BMs. Hierarchical models simply allow you to design a convoled prior structures that is more likely to represents e.g. interactions between variables of your model and thus to provide more suited inference. Then you should use hierarchical model at the instant hyperparameters appear naturally in the modeling of your problem. A simple example is when you need to account for individual level and group level variation for example: $$ y_{ij} \sim N(\mu_j,\sigma^2_j) \mbox{, (individual level variation)} $$ $$ \mu_j \sim Gamma(k_{\mu},\theta_{\mu}) \mbox{, (group level variation)} $$ with $k$ and $\theta$ (and $\sigma^2_j$ if unknown) assigned to well chosen priors.
