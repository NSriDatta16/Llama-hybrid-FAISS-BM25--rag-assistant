Infragistics version 2010 compatibility

I am using Infragistics version 8.1 in my project. I heard that now the latest version availble is 2010. I just want to know that if i use Infragistics 2010 in my project will it be compatible, because in my project I am using .net 2.0. If I upgrade, what will be the compatibility? thank you
