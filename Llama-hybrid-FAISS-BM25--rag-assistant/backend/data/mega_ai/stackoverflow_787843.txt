The behaviour claimed by GCC in Max Lybbert's post is based on the tables om the C++ Standard that map iostream behaviour onto printf/scanf converters (or at least that;'s my reading). However, the scanf behaviour of g++ seems to be different from the istream behavior: #include #include using namespace std;; int main() { unsigned short n = 0; if ( ! sscanf( "-1", "%hu", &n ) ) { cout actually prints 65535.
