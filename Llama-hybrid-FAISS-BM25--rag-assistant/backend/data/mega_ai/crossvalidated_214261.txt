Neural Networks Vs Structural Equation Modeling What's the Difference?

I'm studying about artificial neural networks (ANN) for the first time and I am struck by how the concepts of neural networks appear to be similar to structural equation modeling (SEM). For example, input nodes in ANN remind me of manifest variables in SEM Hidden nodes in ANN remind of latent variables in SEM Every feature in ANN gets an input node as every observed variable gets a manifest variable in SEM ANN can have several output nodes just as SEM can have several final dependent variables Both can be use explanatory and predictive purposes (I think) So please explain to me the differences between these two forms of statistical analysis
