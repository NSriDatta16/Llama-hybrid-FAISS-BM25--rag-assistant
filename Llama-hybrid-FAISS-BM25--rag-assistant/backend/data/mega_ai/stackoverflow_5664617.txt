Sounds like it's related to a jQuery repeat ajax call bug listed here: jQuery Bug #8398 It turns out that jQuery 1.5 is modifying subsequent ajax calls for json to jsonp which leads to this error. I fixed it by following one of the workarounds suggested in the bug change history and placing the following code somewhere before my ajax calls are made: $.ajaxSetup({ jsonp: null, jsonpCallback: null }); Should fix any problems for other ajax requests too.
