How to import images into magento using an absolute path?

I tried importing product images into Magento using an absolute path, but it did not work. The image was not uploaded. For example, I tried importing " http://somewebsite.com/someimage.jpg ". The image was not imported. (I listed the abosolute path on a csv doc and imported using a Profile on the Import/Export screen of the Magento Admin.) Does anyone know a way to do this?
