I don't think the development philosophy of git and DVCS in general is appealing to larger companies - a central repository makes much more sense to them (and may in fact actually work better for centralized organizations). I work for a large IT service company in the banking sector; they migrated from CVS to SVN only 2 years ago, taking the obvious upgrade path.
