Both AdamO and jsk give a great answer. I would try to repeat their points with plain English: When the underlying distribution is normal, you know there are two parameters: mean and variance . T distribution offers a way to do inference on the mean without knowing the exact value of the variances. Instead of using actual variances, only sample means and sample variances are needed. Because it is an exact distribution, you know exactly what you are getting. In other words, the coverage probability is correct. The usage of t simply reflects the desire to get around the unknown populuation variance. When we do inference on proportion, however, the underlying distribution is binomial. To get the exact distribution, you need to look at Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals. The formula you provide is the formula for Wald confidence interval. It use the normal distribution to approximate the binomial distribution, because normal distribution is the limiting distribution of the binomial distribution. In this case, because you are only approximating, the extra level of precision from using t statistics becomes unnecessary, it all comes down to empirical performance. As suggested in BruceET's answer, the Agresti-Coull is simple and standard formula nowadays for such approximation. My professor Dr Longnecker of Texas A&M has done a simple simulation to illustrate how the different approximation works compared to the binomial based CI. Further information can be found in the article Interval Estimation for a Binomial Proportion in Statistical Science , Vol. 16, pp.101-133, by L. Brown, T. Cai and A. DasGupta. Basically, A-C CI is recommended for n >= 40.
