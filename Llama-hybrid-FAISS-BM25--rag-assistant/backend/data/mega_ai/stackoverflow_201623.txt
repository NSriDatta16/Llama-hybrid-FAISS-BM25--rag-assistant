My experience with ant -- which is our primary build tool for Java source, so make of this what you will -- is that there are no such formal conventions. Many source projects I've seen organize things in a similar manner; JBoss uses /src/main for sources, etc... Ant just uses whatever conventions you want, which makes it an ideal tool to integrate into a larger project building framework. At any rate, the Maven conventions work just fine for Ant, so if you've already got them in place, just re-use the same structures. Not only is it easier for you to keep track of where things are, when you use a familiar structure, but if you ever decide to mavenize the project, you'll already be set.
