How do I create a simple Web Server using WCF without the ServiceHost class?

I've began to learn WCF and wish to understand its internals by creating a simple Web server using channel stacks directly. I have found a lot of theory in the web but I'd like to see a working sample code of receiving and responding an httprequest that I can test using any browser. I'm hoping for something that shows the setup of a custom binding by assembling binding elements all the way to responding the request.
