FIFO (named pipe) messaging obstacles

I plan to use Unix named pipes (mkfifo) for simple multi-process messaging. A message would be just a single line of text. Would you discourage me from that? What obstacles should I expect? I have noticed these limitations: A sender cannot continue until the message is received. A receiver is blocked until there are some data. Nonblocking IO would be needed when we need to stop the reading. For example, another thread could ask for that. The receiver could obtain many messages in a single read. These have to be processed before quiting. The max length of an atomic message is limited by 4096 bytes. That is the PIPE_BUF limit on Linux (see man 7 pipe). I will implement the messaging in Python. But the obstacles hold in general.
