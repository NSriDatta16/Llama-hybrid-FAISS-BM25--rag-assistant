"Large-Scale C++ Software Design" by John Lakos worked great for me years ago on how to organise code in large projects. On testing, this is not my area, and I cannot recommend a great book. What I can do is discourage you from getting "Testing Computer Software", 2nd edition by Cem Kaner, Jack Falk and Hung Q. Nguyen . I found it severely dated and extremely clumsy. But please take this with a grain of salt.
