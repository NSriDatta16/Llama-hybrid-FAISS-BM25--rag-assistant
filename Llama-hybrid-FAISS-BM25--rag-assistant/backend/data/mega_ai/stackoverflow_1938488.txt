Authentication methods for Zend Framework XML-RPC server

I have a Zend Framework application whose sole purpose is to serve as an XmlRpc / JSONRPC server. I've mostly followed the philosophy from this guide for my implementation method. I overrode my Bootstrap's run() method to run a Zend_XmlRpc_Server object and attach the API classes to it. I want to authenticate any XML-RPC method that gets ran with an "API key" I have stored in a database table. If I had a traditional MVC ZF setup, I would use a controller plugin to automatically take care of the authentication, but I don't have that option. My only solution right now is manually insert code into each API method to check for authentication. Any thoughts on a more pragmatic way to solve this issue? I'd prefer not to have a bunch of repeated code at the top of every method.
