How to test time series model?

I am wondering what the good approach for testing time series model would be. Suppose I have a time series in a time domain t1,t2,...tN. I have inputs, say, zt1, zt2,...ztN and output x1,x2...xN. Now, if that were a classical data mining problem, I could go with known approaches like cross-validation, leave-one-out, 70-30 or something else. But how should I approach the problem of testing my model with time series? Should I build the model on the first t1,t2,...t(N-k) inputs and test it on the last k inputs? But what if we want to maximise the prediction for p steps ahead and not k (where p
