The number one issue is: you can only successfully reuse code if that code is GOOD code. If it was designed poorly, has bugs, or is very fragile then you'll run into the same issues you already did run into -- you have to go do it yourself anyway because it's so hard to modify the existing code. However, if it's a third-party library that you are considering using that you don't have the source code for, it's a little different. You can try and get the source if it's that kind of library. Some commercial library vendors are open to suggestions and feature requests.
