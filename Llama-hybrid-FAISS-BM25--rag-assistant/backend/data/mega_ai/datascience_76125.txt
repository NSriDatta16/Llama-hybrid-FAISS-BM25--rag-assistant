Confusion between doing .copy() and using [[ ]]

I am reading "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow" by Aurélien Géron. Sometimes he does xyz = DataFrame[["col1"]] Which returns a dataframe, but other times: xyz = DataFrame["col1"].copy() Which reuturns a series I do understand that both are ways of copying and not using a 'view', but when should we use each? (ps: I only found information about views refering to arrayas in numpy... Are the arrays in numpy the same DataFrames in Pandas?)
