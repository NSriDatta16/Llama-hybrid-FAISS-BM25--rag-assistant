Global Wait Cursor

I know this has been asked many times; I'm trying to implement a "global rectangle", with the wait cursor set thereon. I can see the ugly red fill the whole page, and the cursor initially changes to waiting, but it seems fragile. If I move the mouse around, the cursor just seems to randomly switch back (while the screen is still red, of course.) Worse, if I leave the mouse alone, the wait cursor stays on even after the red rectangle goes away. Why is this so shoddy???
