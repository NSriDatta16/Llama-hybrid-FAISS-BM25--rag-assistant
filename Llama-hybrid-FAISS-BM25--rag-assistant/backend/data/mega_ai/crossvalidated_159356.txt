Combining principal component regression and stepwise regression

I want to use a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and stepwise regression to develop a predictor model. I have 5 independent variables (which are correlated among each other to different extents, i.e. multicollinear) and 1 dependent variable. The step that I plan to follow is: Conduct principal component analysis on the independent variables and reconstruct the independent variables using only the largest 2-3 components. Conduct stepwise regression between the dependent variable and the reconstructed independent variables. My questions are: Does the above procedure make sense? Does the reconstruction of independent variables in step 1 reduce the multicollinearity? If not, what can be done to remove/reduce multicollinearity? If the multicollinearity among the dependent variables is somehow removed, does it make sense to use the interaction terms in the stepwise regression?
