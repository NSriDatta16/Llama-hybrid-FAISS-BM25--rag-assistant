I think the question of costs (e.g. of database hosting) is a business decision, not a technical one. Are you trying to turn a profit? How many users will you have for your game, and what will they pay (directly, or indirectly via e.g. advertising). There are hosting solutions for any language/data storage you may pick. I doubt you need "cloud" solutions for this though, a standard database (MSSQL, MySQL, Postgres, etc.) should do just fine, and one of these will come with almost any hosting plan that allows you to deploy your own code. Regarding technology, C# is a perfectly fine choice for a web application and if learning it is a goal, then by all means use it. You should definitely develop a working game on your own computer before it makes sense to pay for hosting (you'll still need to deploy and test the hosted version after it works locally). As for your last question about moving to other non-PC platforms, I'm afraid you're mostly out of luck there. C#/.NET will help you deploy to Windows-based phones, but for e.g. the iPhone, you have to use Apple's SDK and environment. I have no idea about the XBox. The best advice I can give here is to abstract your layers (e.g. a MVC architecture), and maintain a clean and well-documented separation between them. That way, you can re-implement, say the view and controller on an iPhone, but have that still utilize your centralized data model.
