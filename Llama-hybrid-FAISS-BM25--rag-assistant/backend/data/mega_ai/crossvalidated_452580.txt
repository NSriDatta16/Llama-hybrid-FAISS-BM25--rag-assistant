General linear model or ANOVA: Can I aggregate data by group if participants change over time in a repeated measures alcohol sanitiser experiment?

I have an experiment where one hand from 10 people (left or right) was cleaned with sanitiser. Their other hand was sampled as a control. Over the next 6 hours 5 participants hands' were sampled every hour for microorganisms, after which these 5 left. The other 5 participants (who had not been previously sampled but had been treated) were then sampled from hours 16 to 24 after sanitiser application. See figure. I did not design the experiment or have any control over it but I'd like to know if these two groups can be treated the same or not in a mixed effects general linear model?
