The event could not be stopped because the change event is fired in any case. One possibility could be to set a certain timeout between the event fired and the actual call of the $.get method in order to take your case into account, but certainly it isn't an elegant solution. Otherwise you may call the return function only if a certain other element gets the focus (for example if there is a textbox, after your dropdown list). I would not care too much about it as it seems your popup HAS to be shown on Dropdown change. If it is not critical, you may have a help button on dropdown's right that popsup your window on button's click.
