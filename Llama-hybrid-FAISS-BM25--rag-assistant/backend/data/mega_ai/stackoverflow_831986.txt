Personally, I try to avoid MySQL whenever I can for the following reasons: The default storage engine MyISAM lacks Foreign Key support. Innodb does, however it does not support Foreign Keys to MyISAM tables for obvious reasons. If I attempt to insert invalid data, MySQL will happily change it for me. Illegal DateTime, Date, or Timestamp values are convert to "zero": http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/datetime.html Varchar and Char type columns: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/char.html Numeric Datatypes depending on SQL Strict Mode: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/numeric-types.html These things may not be of any importance to some people, but when it comes to quality of data, I would rather use something else.
