How to copy an ancestor to a descendant

Let's say I have an animal and now I want to make it a dog. How do I go about doing this in java? Right now I have a constructor that looks like public Dog(Animal animal) { this.setProperty(animal.getProperty); ... } While this works, it's fragile. Any other suggestions?
