Essentially, what you want is an hypothesis test. This test needs to take into account that the alternative hypothesis is not a single value but a distribution. Thus, you could test $H_0:\hat{\beta}_{1,1}=\hat{\beta}_{1,2}$ against $H_A:\hat{\beta}_{1,1}\neq\hat{\beta}_{1,2}$ where the second digit stands for the model from which the coefficient $\beta_1$ comes from. The statistic in that case is: $(\hat{\beta}_{1,1}-\hat{\beta}_{1,2})/\sqrt{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{1,1})^2+s.e.(\hat{\beta}_{1,2})^2}$ and, if errors are distributed Normally, is a regular t-test. However, this test is valid for Normally distributed errors. I do not know what is the equivalent for Logistic regressions (or even if there is a difference.)
