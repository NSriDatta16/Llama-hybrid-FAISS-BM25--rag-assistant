ASP.Net MVC 2 custom membership user role assignments are caching

I'm new to implementing custom membership/roles for ASP.Net MVC 2. I have membership/roles working in that a user can login successfully and can retrieve their role assignments. However, if I change their role assignments in the underlying database, those changes are not propagating through to the app. I removed all role assignments for said user and when they login, they still have the same role assignments they had before I deleted the assignments in the database. I'm using Entity Framework 4 for user/role retrieval. I created a test that calls the same code for getting a user by name and this test successfully returns the correct role assignments each time, regardless of what mods I make at the database. So this rules out any EF cache. I also removed all caching at the browser level (I'm using Firefox 3.6.8) and I have the same issue. So, this seems to be a custom membership/role caching issue. What setting am I missing? Thanks in advance for your help.
