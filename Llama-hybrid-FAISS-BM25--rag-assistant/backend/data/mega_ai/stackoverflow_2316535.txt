Alternative to inline-block and its support with current browsers

So I am currently using inline-block for my site. I understand it's still relatively new (scope of 5 years). I was wondering if it's become okay to use it these days or if someone can recommend me an elegant hack, that would be awesome. Thanks for your time.
