Beyond the coding project normalization That should be a reason enough to exclude non-ascii characters in identifiers: some characters are visually undistinguishable (U+0041 / U+0391), in extreme case it may lead to confusions not everyone has a keyboard that allows the typing of [a]cute characters easily; it may be frustrating for developers. As for your original question, I don't think there's any significant overhead. As already stated, strings are internally stored in UTF-16. However filenames (including class filenames) in JAR files are encoded in UTF-8, which means the JVM reads one extra byte for each non-ascii character at load time . Since Spanish has at most one diacritic per word, you can expect an average of one or two additional bytes per class. There's no way you could notice it even in the most limited hardware environments.
