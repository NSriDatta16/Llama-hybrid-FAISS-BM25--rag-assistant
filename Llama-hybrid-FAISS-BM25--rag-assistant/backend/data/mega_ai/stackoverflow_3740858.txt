automatic installation of common magento extensions at project kickoff

There are some Magento Connect extensions that I find myself installing every time I create a new project, such as Fontis_Recaptcha, Mass_Product_Relater, HM_DeveloperToolbar, ModuleCreator, Alanstormdotcom_Layoutviewer, etc. What's on your list? Does anyone know of a capability to automate the installation of a base set of modules? In the same way that Mage itself installs all its modules. I guess a bash or phing script to automate PEAR? Thoughts?
