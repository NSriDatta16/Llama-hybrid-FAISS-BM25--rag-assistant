Best way to update badgeValue of UITabBarController from a UIView

I have a tabBarController set up in the AppDelegate and have a few UIViewControllers with Nav Controllers. In one of the TabBar items, after I have pushed a few UIViews I want to update the badgeValue item of a different TabBar item. Whats the best way to do this? The only way I can really think is a NSNotification and a singleton storage for the value, but it seems a lot of work for something simple, that and I have no idea about NSNotifications. I had a wild guess at something like super.tabBarController.otherView.tabBarItem.badgeValue = @"1" (as I set which tab is selected in a similar way) but I'm not surprised this doesn't work. Thanks
