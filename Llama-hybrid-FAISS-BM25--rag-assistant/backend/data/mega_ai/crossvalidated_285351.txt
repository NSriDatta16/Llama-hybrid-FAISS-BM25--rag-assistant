A ratio mean Let Y = average of all $y_{i}$â€™s, the numerator, the daily fish caught Let X = average of all $x_{i}$'s, the denominator, the daily time fishing Then the estimated ratio mean is $R = Y/X$ The Variance of $R$ is estimated by: $Var(R) = (Y/X)^2 (Var(Y)/Y^2 + Var(X)/X^2 - 2Cov(Y,X)/(YX))$ Both of these are biased but the estimator R is usually quite good compared with the others you are considering. The ratio, R, may be what you are calling the grand mean.
