I'm not 100% sure I understood your current project structure but if you can't change anything, it looks like there are major show stopper issues. With Maven: parent modules of nested modules don't contain code one module produces only one main artifact (not sure it's the case of your project though) Not following the Maven default layout being a minor problem compared to the above one. Without more details about what can be changed (without breaking the structure), I simply don't think it's doable in an elegant way (if even doable).
