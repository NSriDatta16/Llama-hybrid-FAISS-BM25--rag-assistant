I find it rare that there is only one other developer with whom I have to agree on coding styles, and that different groups or projects have different styles. You have to learn to adapt to different coding styles. If there are only two of you, then there are only two of you who need to agree on the common coding style you are going to use. If you cannot agree on a coding style, then you just have to deal with it. Try to work in a way that is productive -- and that means not rewriting the other person's code just to get it to match your style. There may be some stylistic aspects that are troublesome, and it is best to focus on those. Style can easily turn into a religious discussion, so it's often more effective to focus on quantitative or empirical arguments for changes. Elegancy and physical beauty of your code may not win the argument -- but showing cases where a stylistic change would have headed off unnecessary debugging can be effective.
