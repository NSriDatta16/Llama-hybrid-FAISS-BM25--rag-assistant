Natural Programming Language.... what would you like to see?

I am looking at writing a compiler and after I complete something in a "C" style I am looking at adapting it to other models. What are some syntactical constructs you would expect to see in a "natural" programming language? The target platform for this compiler will be the CLR and I am currently using Oslo+MGrammar for the lexer/parser (as you can probably tell this is really just an excuse to play) One of the goals of my project would be to allow programming to feel more like a conversation than structured syntax and demands. Guess I should extend this out a little. One of the ideas I am working with is having a class declaration read like a paragraph. A Dog is a mammal. It may Bark and Run. To Run it uses its feet to move forward. It does Lay. ...would translate too... public class Dog : Mammal{ public Feet Feet { get; set;} public virtual void Bark() {} public virtual void Run() { this.Feet.MoveForward(); } public void Lay(){} }
