Logistic regression with binomial independent variable

I have a table of observations, with three columns --- (a) class labels (can be 0 or 1), (b) counts of successes (out of a certain number of Bernoulli trials) and, (c) numbers of Bernoulli trials. I would like to build a model to predict the class labels based on the (latter two) independent variables. Let us say the values in a row are $y$ , $x$ and $n$ . (Note that $n$ varies from row to row; $x$ is the number of success out of $n$ in the same row.) If $\frac{x}{n}$ is high, the class label is more likely to be 1. I could use a logistic regression model to predict class labels based on $\frac{x}{n}$ . However, the $n$ values vary a lot and when $n$ is small, I'd like for this to reflect in my predictions. Can you please suggest how to do this properly? Explanations, with examples and sample R code will be highly appreciated.
