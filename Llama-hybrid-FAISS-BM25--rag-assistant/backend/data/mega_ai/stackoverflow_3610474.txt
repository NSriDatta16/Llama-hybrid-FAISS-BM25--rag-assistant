As far as I know, there is no way. However, what you can do is generate a key based on the license file and store it in isolated storage . While not entirely foolproof, you can send it, and use this on the server to do some guessing if people are copying the key/GUID to multiple machines as well. With the "obfuscated" path of local storage, and it's per-user / per-machine design it's also difficult for users to copy. Similar to this, there was a discussion on the silverlight forums about uniquely identifying a machine with silverlight . Another discussion has someone writing to isolated storage when connected and having the application verify the encrypted key that was stored there - releasing or moving the license requires reconnecting to the web.
