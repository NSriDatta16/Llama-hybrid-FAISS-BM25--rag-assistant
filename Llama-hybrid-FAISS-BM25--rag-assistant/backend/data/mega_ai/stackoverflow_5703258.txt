Ruby on Rails multidimensional array-like storage

I'm trying to create a form that has: TextInput --Skill DropDown --Years Experience Using jQuery, I have the input and drop down fields populate if a user has more skills to add. Is it possible to store many sets of skills and their respective years experience in a database entry? I've been looking into has_many: Thank you!
