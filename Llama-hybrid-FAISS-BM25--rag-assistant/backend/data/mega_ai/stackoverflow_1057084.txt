I'd recommend reading Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site and all of the content on Yahoo!'s Exceptional Performance page. If you like books, you may be interested in High Performance Websites (note that a lot of the content in this is in the Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site article) and Even Faster Websites . Here are a few of my favourite rules from Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site : Minimize HTTP Requests Add an Expires or a Cache-Control Header Gzip Components Make JavaScript and CSS External Minify JavaScript and CSS Also, smush.it is good for compressing images (which have a big impact on how fast a webpage loads). As far as browsers go, Safari 4 claims it is "the world's fastest browser", and I can say that the Mac version is certainly nice and fast (not to mention elegant!). However, the above suggestions will make much more of a difference than which browser you're using. Steve
