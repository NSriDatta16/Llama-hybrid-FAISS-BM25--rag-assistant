Someone suggested to to a Keplen Maier test, but I cannot see how to apply this kind of tests (logrank) considering all the count that compose one timepoint and not only the final average. While your problem feels like a survival analysis problem, and you could show what you want to show with a set of KM curves, I think it may be a flawed approach. In order to do a survival analysis, one of two things would have to be true: You know all the cell counts for all flies at each sampling point. Since you have to dissect them, and only dissect a portion, this isn't true. You might be able to ignore this if you could credibly say "the undirected flies all have counts identical to the dissected ones", but I have no idea if this is true or not, and if you have any variability in your data, likely won't be true. I might indeed go with a regression approach, showing the slope of the line of number of cells over time drops for the mutants, but not for the wild type. Don't worry about having too much data - the folks here regularly run regression problems on thousands, tens of thousands and higher amounts of data. Your books likely don't cover it because it's really easy to see what's happening with small amounts of data, but the technique can handle plenty. My best advice is to find someone in your department, or a related department, that does regression on a regular basis, and talk to them about how to approach your problem, but it doesn't seem too difficult on the surface.
