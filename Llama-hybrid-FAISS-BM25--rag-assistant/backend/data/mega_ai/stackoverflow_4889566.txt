Thanks for the code starting point makes answer these much easier, for the future although I doubt the world will hear this request please include the Flex version your working with since like Android there's a lot of fragmentation out there, here's what worked for me: I added some dummy data in there and had to reduce the size of the grid to make it truncate the checkboxes before it would show the tooltip, then I verified what you posted above that nulling them doesn't work. Above I capture the mouseover event and stop it from propagating up to the ToolTipManager, alternatively you could call ToolTipManager.enable=false then set back to true when appropriate.
