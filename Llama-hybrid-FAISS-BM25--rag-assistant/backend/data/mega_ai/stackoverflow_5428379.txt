The compiler has already prepared storage of the string "Hello, World" in such a way that it has its own memory address when your application is loaded. Then when your code s = "Hello, World"; runs, you're copying the memory address of the compiled string into pointer s . No additional memory has been allocated for the string, and s itself is a local variable (a pointer) temporarily taking up space on the stack.
