How to normalize the features without the knowledge of the min and max values in online learning?

I am developing an online learning platform where input features are gathered from various sensors. However, these features may have vastly different ranges. For example, displacement values may be measured in millimeters while voltage values are measured in volts. To help facilitate the training of the neural network, I would like to normalize these inputs. However, the issue is that I do not have access to their respective maximum and minimum values, so using the max-min scaling method is not feasible. For instance, at the k-1 time step, the displacement value may be 150mm and the voltage value may be 3V, whereas at the k time step, the displacement value could be 1000mm and the voltage value could be 1V. My question is, how can I scale these differing features to a range between 0-1 to feed the neural network at every time step?
