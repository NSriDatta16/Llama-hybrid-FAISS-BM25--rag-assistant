An STL vector has a size (current number of stored elements) and a capacity (currently allocated storage space). If size , a push_back simply puts the new element at the end and increments the size by 1. If size == capacity before the push_back , a new, larger array is allocated (twice the size is common, but this is implementation-dependent afaik), all of the current data is copied over (including the new element), and the old allocated space is freed. This may throw an exception if the allocation fails. The complexity of the operation is amortized O(1), which means during a push_back that causes a resize, it won't be a constant-time operation (but in general over many operations, it is).
