iPhone detecting processor model / NEON support

I'm looking for a way to differentiate at runtime between devices equipped with the new ARM processor (such as iPhone 3GS and some iPods 3G) and devices equipped with the old ARM processors. I know I can use uname() to determine the device model, but as only some of the iPod touches 3G received a boost in their ARM processor, this isn't enough. Therefore, I'm looking for one of these: A way of detecting processor model - I suppose there's none. A way of determining whether ARM neon instructions are supported - from this I could derive an answer. A way of determining the devices total storage size - combining this with the already known device model could hackishly lead me to the answer. Thanks in advance :)
