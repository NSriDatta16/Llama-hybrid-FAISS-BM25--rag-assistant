This is where so-called term Baseline comes into play. One needs to have a baseline either a simple model prediction performance (accuracy, precision or recall whatever) set, and try to improve upon it. Or in a more natural way, when available, it is best to have a human baseline. The latter is quite common in industries, but it is more costly to obtain since for a collection of data human labels are needed. Where to go with the reaming failed % of prediction, it various. Often many take a model-centric approach, since it sounds the most obvious thing to do with many new mode, architecture being published and released, and improve further. Often though, that doesn't help much and it is usually time-consuming. Others may take a data-centric approach. Meaning they would focus more on data, either data has the right quality, labels and annotations are correct, and most importantly whether it is enough considering the model that is being used to train on. For example, Deep Neural Networks are quite greedy. That means the more data the better. Or even more may ask more fundamental questions that whether such data is a good representation for machine judgement (rule of thumb here is if human is able to make a judgement under X secs/msec, machine can do too). There are also others that consider both approach and take the best from each world. Have they eyes wide open on the data, yet doing fair amount on the model part either to be hyper-parameter optimization, or choice of mode or model's architecture etc. At the end of the day. One needs to ask himself or herself, what if there was no model. Are you benefiting of model predictions even at 85% accuracy? Or the costs of doing wrong prediction is so that, only having 98% recall would be acceptable, otherwise one is better off with manual processes, till it gets there. Here is when the business expectations are vital, and come hand in hand with ML/DS practitioners. I strongly recommend watching Andrew Ng's Recent Talk on From Model-centric to Data-centric AI . He gives practical examples of such scenarios, would you more insights into the matter.
