To be clear, do you have 255 subjects? Each is asked one of two questions, chosen at random: 136 subjects are asked Question 1 and 119 subjects are asked Question 2. Each subject gives one of three responses to the chosen question. If that is correct, you can use a chi-squared test of homogeneity. Results: chi-sq statistic = 32.65, DF=2, P-value very near 0. So we reject, at any reasonable level of significance, the null hypothesis that responses have the same distribution for the two questions. From R statistical software: TBL = rbind(c(40,30,66), c(45,55,19)) chisq.test(TBL) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: TBL X-squared = 32.647, df = 2, p-value = 8.143e-08 If my first paragraph is incorrect, please edit your question so the next person who seeks to answer won't make the same wrong interpretation I did. In particular, I was puzzled by your use of the word 'paired'.
