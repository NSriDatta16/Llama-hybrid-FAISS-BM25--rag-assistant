Adding a filter to the Project Explorer in Eclipse

I want to add a new filter to the Project Explorer, to hide from the user some projects that are created automatically in an Eclipse RCP Application. So far I've found two extension points: org.eclipse.ui.ide.resourceFilters Allows me to filter Navigation org.eclipse.jdt.ui.javaElementFilters Allows me to filter the Java Viewers I expect there is a similar extension point for the Project Explorer, but so far I haven't had any luck getting it. I tried importing org.eclipse.ui.navigator and org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources but I could not find any interesting looking extension point either I am using Eclipse 3.3.2 as the basis for this RCP Application Thanks!
