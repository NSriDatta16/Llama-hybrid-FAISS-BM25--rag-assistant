What are the best practices in your tests?

I would like to know what are your practices when you test your classes. For example, I like to use inheritance, with my fixtures. Given two classes BaseClass, SubClass, I make two other classes BaseClassFixture and SubClassFixture (SubClassFixture is a sub class of BaseClassFixture). So I'm sure that I don't break code which use SubClass as a BaseClass (And people who extends my class can be sure if they do things right, by creating another sub class of my fixture). I do fixture inheritance with interfaces too. For example, when I create a fixture for IList, I check that any Add, increase Count by one. When I have a concrete class which implements IList I just create a fixture named MyConcreteClassIListFixture. In that case, the fixture for my interface is abstract and I let my subclass create the instance for my tests. I think it's a kind of design by contracts (see Bertrand Meyer), because I check invariant before and after any tests. I do this especially with published interfaces or classes. And you... what are your practices ??
