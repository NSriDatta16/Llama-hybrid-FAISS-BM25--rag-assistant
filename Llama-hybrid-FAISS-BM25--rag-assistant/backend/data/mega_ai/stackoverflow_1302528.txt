Apache FOP: Displaying UTF-8 Characters in PDF (without embed?)

I'm trying to use FOP to export a PDF with UTF-8 characters, preferably without needing to embed the font. The following code: Summary 私はガラスを食べられます。それは私を傷つけません produces #################### in the PDF. I'm aware of the issue: http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/faq.html#pdf-characters When I go under Document Properties->Fonts, the Helvetica font is listed with 'Encoding: ANSI'. Is there a way to change this? If I were embedding, what would be the best way to do so without having access to Helvetica.ttf? I've tried using DejaVuSans, but I end up with squares in place of the # signs. Note that this is not a one-time use from the command line (that would be a start), but an extension to an existing app. I'm trying to support UTF-8 characters without too much complexity.
