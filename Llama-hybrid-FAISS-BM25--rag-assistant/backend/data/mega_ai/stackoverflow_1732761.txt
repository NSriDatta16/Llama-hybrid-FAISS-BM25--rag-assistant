Reading Alpha of a PNG Pixel. Fast way via pure Python?

I am having an issue with an embedded 64bit Python instance not liking PIL. Before i start exhausting more methods to get a compiled image editor to read the pixels for me (such as ImageMagick) i am hoping perhaps anyone here can think of a purely Python solution that will be comparable in speeds to the compiled counterparts. Now i am aware that the compiled friends will always be much faster, but i am hoping that because i "just" want to read the alpha of a group of pixels, that perhaps a fast enough pure Python solution can be conjured up. Anyone have any bright ideas? Though, i have tried PyPNG and that is far too slow, so i'm not expecting any magic solutions. None the less, i had to ask. Thanks to any replies! And just for reference, the images i'll be reading will be on average around 512*512 to 2048*2048, and i'll be reading anywhere from one to all of the pixels alpha (multiplied by a few million times, but the values can be stored so reading twice isn't done).
