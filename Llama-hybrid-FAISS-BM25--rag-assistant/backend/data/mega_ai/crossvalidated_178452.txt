plm: Implication of irregularly lagged time series

I have an irregularly lagged and unbalanced time series. I want to run a regression fixed effect regression on my data but I'm not totally sure of the implication of the irregular intervals (the unbalancedness is taken into account by plm() ). The output of the regression seems not to consider the issue. Please consider the following # Sample data require(WDI) df which outputs Oneway (individual) effect Within Model Call: plm(formula = EN.ATM.CO2E.PC ~ NY.GDP.PCAP.CD, data = df, index = c("country", "year"), method = "within", balanced = FALSE) Unbalanced Panel: n=3, T=8-9, N=26 Residuals : Min. 1st Qu. Median 3rd Qu. Max. -1.540 -0.289 0.110 0.543 1.170 Coefficients : Estimate Std. Error t-value Pr(>|t|) NY.GDP.PCAP.CD -6.8273e-05 2.1762e-05 -3.1373 0.004788 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Total Sum of Squares: 16.404 Residual Sum of Squares: 11.333 R-Squared : 0.3091 Adj.
