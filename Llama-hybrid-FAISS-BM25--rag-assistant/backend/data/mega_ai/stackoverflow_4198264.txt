As a "small accounting package" you should be off the radar and therefore away any hackers' attention. The biggest worry should be your Sql Server. If any part of your system gets targeted (besides the OS iteself) it will be the db server (remember the slammer worm. ) To really secure it you could place your Sql Server on a separate subdomain and encrypt the communication to it from your application over SSL.
