Depends on the version of Rails you're on, but I would suggest you look into dynamic scopes: http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/12/29/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-dynamic-scope-methods If named scopes are completely new to you, you should probably read the article linked from that page in the second paragraph (just after the first code snippet). What you're suggesting is very slightly more complex because of the fact you want to be able to OR within sky and humidity and then AND those together, but nothing 20 minutes of tinkering won't produce a result for - I think you'll benefit from going through the exercise yourself though if you're new to Rails (if I'm wrong, say so :-) ).
