Can the temperature of neural network be used to calculate probability distribution?

Neural Networks have "temperature" - how much randomness should be added to the result. Would it be possible to use that temperature to get not just single number prediction, but the probability distribution of the predicted value? Like - you need to predict price of microsoft stock tomorrow, you increased temperature, ran prediction 1000 times, get 1000 slightly different predictions, and build the histogram. I'm sure that would work, but would it be more or less real distribution or just some funny similarly looking random artefact? Also, would that temperature thing work with CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks?
