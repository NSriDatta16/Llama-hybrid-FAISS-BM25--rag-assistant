Q1: After Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down in 1983 after straying into the USSR's prohibited airspace, President Ronald Reagan issued a directive making GPS freely available for civilian use, once it was sufficiently developed, as a common good. The first satellite was launched in 1989, and the 24th and last satellite was launched in 1994. Initially, the highest quality signal was reserved for military use, and the signal available for civilian use intentionally degraded ("Selective Availability", SA). Selective Availability was ended in 2000, improving the precision of civilian GPS from about 100m to about 20m. Source: Wikipedia - History of Global Positioning System Q2: You can calculate acceleration from GPS data by finding the change in velocity (Δv) divided by the change in time (Δt). The accuracy of this will depend on the GPS receiver's ability to acquire very frequent position fixes. Most consumer-grade GPS receivers can only acquire a position every second, which will not be enough for accurate acceleration readings.
