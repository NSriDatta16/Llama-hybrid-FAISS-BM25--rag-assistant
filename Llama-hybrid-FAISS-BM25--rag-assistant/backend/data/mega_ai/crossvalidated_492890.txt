Your question is circular. You say you want to use a test find the 'important' values. And when asked what you mean by 'important' you say the 'important' values are ones that pass the test. To make sense of this it might be most useful for you to look at numerical or graphical summaries of your data. Then from the summaries try to get an intuitive view of what you mean by 'important'. That might lead you to your own general criterion for importance. (Opinions of others may differ.) Using R statistical software: x = c(3 , 4 , 52 , 633 , 1000, 0, 6915 , 890 , 500) summary(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0 4 500 1111 890 6915 sd(x) [1] 2212.417 # sample standard deviation The mean and median are two ways of describing the center of the data. The mean (average) would be the balance point if you consider the values plotted along a line, giving each equal weight (red line below). Are the below-average values important because they are "more typical" or is the largest value important because it has such a large influence on the mean? stripchart(x, pch=20) abline(v = mean(x), col="red") The median is the middle value, if the observations are sorted (halfway between the two middle values if the sample size is even). Here the middle value of the sorted data is $500.$ sort(x) [1] 0 3 4 52 500 633 890 1000 6915 In a boxplot, the box shows the extent of the middle half of the data (from the first to third quartile in the summary). The median is at the line within the box. So-called "whiskers" may extend partway to the minimum or maximum, but the most extreme values might be plotted separately. Because the plot extends so far to the right to include the maximum value the scale doesn't show much detail for the values around $0.$ Which is more 'important' to you--the half of the values inside the box or the half outside the box? Some people might think that the maximum value $5915$ is the only really 'important' one, and some might think it should be disregarded entirely because it is so much different from the others--not typical, perhaps some sort of mistake. boxplot(x, col="skyblue2", pch=20, horizontal=T) There are many possible numerical and graphical descriptions of data because different situations make it appropriate to focus on different values as being 'important'. Addedum per Comments: Suppose there are Five categories of items and 1000 subjects, each of whom is asked to choose 2 favorites. Then you might say each of the five counts is roughly distributed as $\mathsf{Binom}(n=1000, p=2/5),$ in which case one would expect 95% of counts to be between 370 and 430 inclusive. So any item with less than 370 'votes' might be considered 'unpopular' and and any item with more than 430 might be considered 'popular'. However, the vector of counts $(360, 420, 402, 398, 411),$ even with one slightly 'unpopular' count, would not be enough evidence to say that categories are of 'significantly' unequal popularity overall at the 5% level of significance (P-value is $0.066 > 0.05.)$ sum(dbinom(370:430, 1000, 2/5)) [1] 0.9510791 prop.test(c(360,420,402,398,411), rep(1000,5)) 5-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction data: c(360, 420, 402, 398, 411) out of rep(1000, 5) X-squared = 8.8167, df = 4, p-value = 0.06585 alternative hypothesis: two.sided sample estimates: prop 1 prop 2 prop 3 prop 4 prop 5 0.360 0.420 0.402 0.398 0.411 If you think something similar to this approach may be useful, please edit your question with enough specific information that one of us might follow up usefully.
