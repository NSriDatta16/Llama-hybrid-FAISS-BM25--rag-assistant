PCA with sample-specific prior information about principal components

Suppose I have some noisy dataset $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times p}$ that I want to perform PCA on. Obtaining the (trimmed) SVD $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{UDV}$ infers the q-dimensional principal components $\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{U}_q \mathbf{D}_q \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times q}$ . But suppose I have some side-information for predicting these principal components, which gives me q-dimensional predicted-PCs $\mathbf{C} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times q}$ for each of the $N$ samples. This suggests I might want to adjust the PCA objective to add a term that minimizes $\|\mathbf{U}_q \mathbf{D}_q - \mathbf{C} \|^2$ . Are there existing papers and algorithms that do this? And if not, is this because it would be really difficult to solve the optimization problem with that additional term?
