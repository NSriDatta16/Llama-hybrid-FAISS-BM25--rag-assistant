I assume that you have a database table stored in a database somewhere... Determine what database you have. Choose the Tools that you will use to communicate with the database, be it C# as the programming language and then a object relational mapping tool such as Linq 2 Sql or Entity Framework or plain ADO.NET Assuming you are using SQL Server on your computer and that you have a database setup with a table called Answer and using C# with Linq 2 SQL as the ORM. Let's look at an example. e.g Open up Visual Studio Start a new C# Console Application View - Server Explorer -> Connect to a Database -> Type in the Server Name, localhost or your computer name and find the database on your machine given that the credentials are correct View - Solution Explorer -> Right click on "ConsoleApplication1" and Click on Add New Item -> Data -> Linq to Sql Classes Drag your Tables from your Server Explorer to the Design surface. You should now see your tables in your white space Some code to access your table is as follows DataClasses1DataContext context = new DataClasses1DataContext(); Answer answer = new Answer(); answer.description = "Some Description"; context.Answers.InsertOnSubmit(answer); context.SubmitChanges(); I hope this helps.
