I'm not certain I'd call this a "best practice" but a few ideas on a general approach for this kind of problem. One of course is to allow the transaction of REST request to the storage server to take place asynchronously, either by a daemonized process that listens for incoming requests (either by watching a file for changes, or a socket, shared memory, database, whatever you think is best for IPC in your environment) or a very frequently running cron job that would pick up and deliver the files. The benefits of this are that you can deliver a quick message to the User who uploaded the file, while the background process can try, try again if there's a connectivity issue with the REST service. You could even go as far as to have some AJAX polling taking place so the user could get a nice JS message displayed when you complete the REST process.
