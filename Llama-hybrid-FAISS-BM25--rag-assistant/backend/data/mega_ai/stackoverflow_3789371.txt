You need to get familiar with the idea of "Server side" vs. "Client side" code. It's been a long time since I had to start, but you may want to start with some of the video tutorials at http://www.asp.net . Two things to note: if you're using VS2010 you actually have two different frameworks to chose from for ASP.NET: WebForms and ASP.NET MVC2. WebForms is the old legacy way, MVC2 is being positioned by MS as an alternative not a replacement for WebForms, but we'll see how the community handles it over the next couple of years. Anyway, be sure to pay attention to which one a given tutorial is talking about.
