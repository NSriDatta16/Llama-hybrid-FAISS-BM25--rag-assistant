Unbalanced dataset accuracy

Iâ€™m currently encountering some problems analyzing a dataset with neural network. The problem is that I have an unbalanced binary class training set (10:1). Training accuracy for both classes are 100%. When predicting I get accuracy of 99% for the majority class in the validation set, and accuracy of 0.2% for the minority class. So I was wondering if over-sampling would help to improve the accuracy for the minority class.
