If you still wanted to keep this form a normal “bound” access form then you could do something like this. Setup a pass through query that fires your SP. The basic format for that is along the lines of this EXEC [dbo].[spAgents_with_more_than_X_days_sick_by_Team] @Date_from = N'2009-09-14', @Date_to = N'2010-09-14', @Team_ID = N'TEM1', @Days_sick =5 You would then modify this when opening the form like this Set qDef = DBEngine(0)(0).QueryDefs("RqryAgents_more_than_X_sicks_detail_2") With qDef .Connect = strSQL_con_string .SQL = "EXEC [dbo].[spAgents_with_more_than_X_days_sick_by_Team]" .SQL = .SQL & " @Date_from = N'" & Format(Me.txtDate_from, "yyyy-mm-dd") & "', " .SQL = .SQL & "@Date_to = N'" & Format(Me.txtDate_to, "yyyy-mm-dd") & "', " .SQL = .SQL & "@Team_ID = N'" & Me.txtTeam_ID & "', " .SQL = .SQL & "@Days_sick =" & Me.txtDays_sick End With This should work just fine however if it was me (and I know it’s not everyone’s preference) but I would make this an unbound form and populate it by firing your SP using ADO to fill a recordset and go from there. If you want details of how to do that then just ask and I will post an example EDIT: Code sample added Dim cmd as new ADODB.Command Dim dbCon as new ADODB.Connection Dim rst as new ADODB.Recordset dbCon.ConnectionString=”Your_Connection_string” dbCon.open With cmd .ActiveConnection = dbCon .CommandText = "spYour SP" .CommandType = adCmdStoredProc .NamedParameters = True .Parameters.Append .CreateParameter("@Your_pram1", adVarChar, adParamInput, 20, Format(Me.txtDate, "yyyy-mm-dd")) .Parameters.Append .CreateParameter("@Your_pram2", adSmallInt, adParamInput, 0, Me.cboPhone_skill) End With Set rst = cmd.Execute() With rst If .EOF=False then Me.txtYour_text_box_1=!Your_SP_field_1 Me.txtYour_text_box_2=!Your_SP_field_3 Me.txtYour_text_box_3=!Your_SP_field_2 End if End with Rst.close Dbcon.close Set rst=nothing Set cmd=nothing Set dbcon=nothing
