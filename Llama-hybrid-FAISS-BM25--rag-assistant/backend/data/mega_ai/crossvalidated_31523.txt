How should I analyze this design with no replication?

I have data from an experiment where I measured the $CO_2$ from: 4 different dissolved organic carbon (DOC) solutions each at 4 different concentrations each in light and in dark. Each combination of DOC source, concentration, and light occurred only once (e.g., only one jar each of DOC-A: conc-A: Dark, and one jar for DOC-B: conc-A: Dark, etc...) but a series of 4 measurements was taken from each combination (i.e., jar). The production of $CO_2$ was linear over the 4 time points so, the response variable can be represented as a single rate from each jar. I am interested in the effect of light, DOC source, and concentration on $CO_2$ production, plus interactions. I am not necessarily interested in the effect of the different time pointsGiven that each experimental unit was unreplicated, how can I best analyze this experiment?
