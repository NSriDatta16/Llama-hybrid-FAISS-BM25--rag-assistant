OK, I had to do a little more research, here's how to make it work, completely within the spreadsheet (without VBA): Using A1 as the end of your desired range, and the chart being on the same sheet as the data: Name the first cell of the data (C5) as a named range, say TESTRANGE. Created a named range MYDATA as the following formula: =OFFSET(TESTRANGE, 0, 0, Sheet1!$A$1, 1) Now, go to the SERIES tab of the chart SOURCE DATA dialog, and change your VALUES statement to: =Sheet1!MYDATA Now everytime you change the A1 cell value, it'll change the chart. Thanks to Robert Mearns for catching the flaws in my previous answer.
