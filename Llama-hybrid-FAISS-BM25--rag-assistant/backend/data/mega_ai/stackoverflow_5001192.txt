It seems that you are thinking of the case in which both plots have a value at any given position. Maybe this method will work: For each index i, calculate (xi-yi)^2. Sum over all i. Divide by n. This just calculates the average difference between points in the plot, so 0 would be exactly the same, while larger values mean less similarity. Statistically, there's probably a more accurately method, but this is a good estimate for sure.
