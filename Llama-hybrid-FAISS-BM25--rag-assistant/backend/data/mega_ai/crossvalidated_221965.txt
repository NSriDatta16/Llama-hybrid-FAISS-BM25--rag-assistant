Metropolis-Hastings Convergence in R

I'm trying to implement the algorithm Metropolis Hastings for the next FDP. \begin{equation} f_{X}(x)=(5+\exp(5/2))*\sqrt{2\pi}\left[\exp\left\{-\frac{(x-2)^{2}-2x}{2}\right\}+5\exp\left\{-\frac{x+2}{2}\right\}\right] \end{equation} My problem is that I want to analyze the convergence of average, using the strong law of large numbers. However, by construction, I'm getting a unit root process. Am I making a programming error or this is okay? This is my code. rm(list=ls()) f
