CouchDB Database per Main Entity

i'm looking for implement in my application to have database for the main entity of the system. i'd like to create and set a database for this entity named with a property value. Like : For a CMS Project, to create a couchdb database for every Site. kindly, as that is based on Rest and Rails : in the create method i have the property value, so i can create the database and save the document in side that database. but in the other methods how can i specify the database to get the documents from, in (show, edit, update, delete). and in the index method, how can be enhanced for that scenario (Database per Main Entity). also, how can i check if there a database with the value i have with creating the database if not exist. Thanks, Shenouda Bertel
