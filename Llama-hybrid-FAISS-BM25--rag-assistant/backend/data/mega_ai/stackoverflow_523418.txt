method:'post' might well be your problem: the host serving the request likely rejects get requests, which is all you can throw at it from a browser address bar. if this is what's happening, you'll need to find or install some sort of scripting tool capable of doing the job (perl would be my choice, and unless you're running Windows, you'll already have that). I do have to wonder whether what you're trying to do is legit, though: trawling other sites' comment databases isn't usually encouraged.
