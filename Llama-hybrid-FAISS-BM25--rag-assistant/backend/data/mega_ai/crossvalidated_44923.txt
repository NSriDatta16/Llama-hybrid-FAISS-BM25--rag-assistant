The model (the specific parameters and X-matrix) is not exactly the same, clearly. Note that the baseline color (the reference group) in R is "D" while in Minitab it's "I" (see there's no coefficient for D in the R output and none for I in the Minitab output?). Looking through, it looks like there are similar differences in the other categorical variables. Did the the minitab model somehow pick different dummys to exclude? Yes. You can make either one work the same as the other. For example, see the checked answer to this question for how to change the reference category of a factor in R. (The question asks about logistic regression but the solution works quite generally.)
