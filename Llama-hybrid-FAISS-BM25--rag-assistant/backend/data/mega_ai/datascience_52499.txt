I don't know many examples but I'm aware of at least one such tool, specialized for the medical domain: SemRep SemRep is a UMLS-based program that extracts three-part propositions, called semantic predications, from sentences in biomedical text. Predications consist of a subject argument, an object argument, and the relation that binds them. For example, from the sentence in (1), SemRep extracts the predications in (2). 1.We used hemofiltration to treat a patient with digoxin overdose that was complicated by refractory hyperkalemia. Hemofiltration-TREATS-Patients, Digoxin overdose-PROCESS_OF-Patients, hyperkalemia-COMPLICATES-Digoxin overdose, Hemofiltration-TREATS(INFER)-Digoxin overdose In general, this is closely related to the problem of semantic role labeling : semantic role labeling (also called shallow semantic parsing) is the process that assigns labels to words or phrases in a sentence that indicate their semantic role in the sentence, such as that of an agent, goal, or result. Apparently there are some implementations available: https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/ASRL
