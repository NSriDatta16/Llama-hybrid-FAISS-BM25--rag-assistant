Casey, this might help you: The main issue I have found with that flashing login-screen had to do with the cookies Facebook stores in the iPhone. What I did is: 1. Store the facebook access_token and expiration_date elsewhere (NSUserDefaults might be a good place). This way, you can check if the user has already authenticated. If the user hasn't authenticated, then you can show the login screen. 2. Another thing that is important, is to know that Facebook will save some cookies as part of the authentication process. So, what happens is: the user authenticates and then turns off the app, then the next he opens it and taps login; Facebook will use its cookies, causing that annoying screen to appear and disappear. You can try deleting the facebook cookies each time you want the user to login. That did the job for me. Here you have a code snippet that removes the cookies. -(void) deleteFacebookCookies{ NSHTTPCookieStorage* cookies = [NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage]; NSArray* facebookCookies = [cookies cookiesForURL: [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://login.facebook.com"]]; for (NSHTTPCookie* cookie in facebookCookies) { [cookies deleteCookie:cookie]; } } HTH, cheers!
