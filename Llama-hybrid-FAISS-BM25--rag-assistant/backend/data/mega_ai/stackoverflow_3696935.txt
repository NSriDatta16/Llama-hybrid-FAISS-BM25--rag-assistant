I think this must be a bug in PHP since where you have ":10" I get all sort of strange symbols that do not occur anywhere in my code - ie. one time it might be ":0", next time ":196870" and the next time "!qhsu89s3". I also find that if I wait around a bit before refreshing then it normally sorts itself out. Not too encouraging I have to say, but I presume a problem with PHP on Windows.
