It seems that a simple Distinct operation can be implemented more elegantly as follows: var distinct = items.GroupBy(x => x.ID).Select(x => x.First()); where ID is the property that determines if two objects are semantically equivalent. From the confusion here (including that of myself), the default implementation of Distinct() seems to be a little convoluted.
