I couldn't find a way to run your code as you mentioned (server a opening a popup on server b, then having the popup change the location of opener). However, I tried the same thing with an iframe. Loaded google and tried to change it cnn.com. It allowed me when I used window.frames.myframe.location = 'http://www.cnn.com' It didn't work when I tried window.frames.myframe.document.location = 'http://www.cnn.com' Try removing document from your statement. Maybe there are a few things you can do to a window from a different domain. I know you can at least test if window.closed Try it out: http://jsfiddle.net/HrWer/ New test I started from wikipedia.com, typed into the URL box: javascript: open('http://www.google.com');void(0) From the window that opened, I typed the following statements into the URL box javascript: alert(opener.closed) //false, it works javascript: alert(opener.location.href) //undefined, access denied javascript: opener.document.location = 'http://www.google.com'; void(0); // Didn't change the location, access denied javascript: opener.location = 'http://www.google.com'; void(0); // YES, it changed I think this almost confirms my theory, I only tested in chrome though.
