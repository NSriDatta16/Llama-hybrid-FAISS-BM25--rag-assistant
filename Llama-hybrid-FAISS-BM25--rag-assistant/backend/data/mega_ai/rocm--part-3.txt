Cm competes with other GPU computing stacks: Nvidia CUDA and Intel OneAPI. Nvidia CUDA Nvidia's CUDA is closed-source, whereas AMD ROCm is open source. There is open-source software built on top of the closed-source CUDA, for instance RAPIDS. CUDA is able to run on consumer GPUs, whereas ROCm support is mostly offered for professional hardware such as AMD Instinct and AMD Radeon Pro. Nvidia provides a C/C++-centered frontend and its Parallel Thread Execution (PTX) LLVM GPU backend as the Nvidia CUDA Compiler (NVCC). Intel OneAPI Like ROCm, oneAPI is open source, and all the corresponding libraries are published on its GitHub Page. Unified Acceleration Foundation (UXL) Unified Acceleration Foundation (UXL) is a new technology consortium that are working on the continuation of the OneAPI initiative, with the goal to create a new open standard accelerator software ecosystem, related open standards and specification projects through Working Groups and Special Interest Groups (SIGs). The goal will compete with Nvidia's CUDA. The main companies behind it are Intel, Google, Arm, Qualcomm, Samsung, Imagination, and VMware.
