Modern HTML semantics are: Use to contain a paragraph of text in a document. Use to indicate a line break inside a paragraph (i.e. a new line without the paragraph block margins or padding). Use to contain a piece of application UI that happens to have block layout. Don't use or on their own. Those tags are meant to contain content. They appear to work as paragraph breaks only because when the browser sees them, and it "helpfully" closes the current block tag before opening the empty one.
