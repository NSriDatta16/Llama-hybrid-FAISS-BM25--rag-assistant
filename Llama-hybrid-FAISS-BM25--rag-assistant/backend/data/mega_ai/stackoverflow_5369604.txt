C# - simplifying interface

Is it possible to somehow simplify an interface? The goal is to provide a noise-reduced API for the user thats going to use it. An example could be that the interface IFoo has 25 methods defined and I only want to expose 5 of them to the user, how would I do that in a clever and elegant way?
