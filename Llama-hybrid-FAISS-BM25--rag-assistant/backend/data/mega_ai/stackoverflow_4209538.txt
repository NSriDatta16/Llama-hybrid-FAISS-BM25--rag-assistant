When you simply tap, the scroll view will pass touches through to its subviews. But if you start dragging, the scrollview will send a touchesCancelled message to the subview and process the touches itself. Check out the methods on UIScrollViewDelegate - there's probably something there you can use. Alternatively, UIScrollView has a property canCancelContentTouches. If you turn that off, its subviews will always receive touches, but of course then the scroll view won't scroll.
