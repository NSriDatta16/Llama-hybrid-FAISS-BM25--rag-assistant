Sounds like a distributed version control system like GIT or Bzr might be what you are looking for, you can keep all of your code locally (setup the repository on your external storage device) but you still get the option of branching and merging. Plus if you do find yourself in the situation where you need to share with another developer they can just get a local copy of one of your branches.
