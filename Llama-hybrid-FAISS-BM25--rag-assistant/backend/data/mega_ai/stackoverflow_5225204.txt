The main reason that video sites switch to using iframes now are in such cases of embedding. The page they link to (in the iframe src) is a simple page to test if the browser supports HTML5, and if so then use the native HTML5 video. If not, they default back to using flash. This is effective for mobile phones that don't support flash. Disadvantages: Not sure.
