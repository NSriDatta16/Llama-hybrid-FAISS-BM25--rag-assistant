For the first part of your question, when showing the dialog box for the properties of the text area, you can pop it up as a non-modal window. This means the properties dialog will show but will not lock out the rest of the UI, enabling the user to change the text however they like. It also means the background does not blur/grey out. To pop up a window in a non-modal state, call PopUpManager.createPopUp (or PopUpManager.addPopUp) with the third parameter (modal) set to false. For the second issue, set a member variable such as "isDragging" to true when you detect that the user is dragging the image around. Then on mouse up, only display the pop up if isDragging is false. Hope that helps.
