Why are you adding the Views to the list yourself? I would highly recommend using any kind of apropriate Adapter for the List. The adapter will handle the creating and recycling of views while the user is scrolling etc. If you use an Adapter it is discouraged to save references to the view yourself like you are doing it in the views list. The addHeaderView method you are using is made to one single header to the list that always will appear on the top of the list. This means calling it in a loop will not have a reasonable result. Look into the helloListView example Mayra mentions to understand how a list in android is working. To see how a custom listadapter works have a look at this tutorial looks promising despite the bad code formatting.
