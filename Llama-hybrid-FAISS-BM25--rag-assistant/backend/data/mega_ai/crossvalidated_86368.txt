PCA demeaning the data

What is the motivation for demeaning the data when doing PCA. I've been told to do it, but I've never heard a good and/or intuitive reason for it. Is this a case where doing it just makes the math easier, or is it more like: if you don't do it, you'll get the wrong answer. This is something I've been wondering about for a while. One other question: when you demean the data, do you also need to normalize it (i.e., divide by standard deviation)?
