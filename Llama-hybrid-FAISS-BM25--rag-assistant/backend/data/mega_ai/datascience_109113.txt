PCA dimentional reduction

I try to plot three values of a VCF file (QUAL, DP, and rate of phasing) for all the SNPs in the file. I thought that a PCA plot would be a good way to reduce dimensions of the plot, and to compare values although they were not on the same scale. I have tried to build the PCA with different R packages as ggbiplot and pca3d , but its seems that the distribution of the dots cloud is always skewed as a dimension is missing. Find below the code used for generating the ggbiplot. Would anyone have some advises to reduce three values with different scales to two-dimensional PCA? library(devtools) library(ggbiplot) # Create the dataframe df
