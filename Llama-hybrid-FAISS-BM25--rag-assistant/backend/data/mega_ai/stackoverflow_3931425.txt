You need to assign the "KontaktAnfragen_RowCommand" to the Gridview's OnRowCommand event the image button is in. OnRowCommand="KontaktAnfragen_RowCommand" I just noticed, in your aboove code, should you not be using the CommandArgument value instead of the CommandName value for the rowIndex ? Also I'm not sure you need to use ToString but if you do, use ToString() instead of ToString as it is a method call. Something like this (included formatting of if statement, etc..)?: if (e.CommandName == "SelectComment") Then rowIndex = Integer.Parse(e.CommandArgument)
