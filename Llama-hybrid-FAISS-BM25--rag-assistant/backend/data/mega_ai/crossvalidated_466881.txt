How to find the correlation between the number of products vs number of units in an order

Stat noob programmer here. I have to predict the time taken to process an order based on the order size. The example data is like following for example, in the last line there were a total of 7 products with a total of 22 units an an average of 100.9 minutes were taken to process the order. Now, I need to find the correlation between these values and figure out a way to predict the time taken. There is also a problem with the data where some of the values are unexpected, because the staff who process the order may pause the operation for a while so the time taken to process that order become unexpectedly large which affects the average time. I think somehow, I need to normalize this data (Normalization is the correct word I suppose) as well. I have access to the raw data with time taken to process each order in case if something more useful can be made from the original data. Kindly point me to the right direction.
