How would you rework the design in a way that you stay confident that the stuff you're changing does not break other stuff? In short, how would you tackle drastic application design changes efficiently (both DB and code)? Tests, code complexity/coverage metrics, and a continuous integration system. Run them early and often, so you know which parts are the riskiest and where to start writing. These will become your safety nets when you have to make potentially problematic changes. If something does break, your CI system will tell you, and you won't have spent weeks down some rabbit hole before you realize there's a problem.
