I don't know about Guided Discovery. But 'Introduction to Statistical Learning' by Hastie et al. is definately a good book. It also includes examples with R code. I would also recommend the more advanced book 'Elements of Statistical Learning' (same authors). In addition, you could consider having a look at Kaggle. There is an active community sharing and discussing about machine learning applications.
