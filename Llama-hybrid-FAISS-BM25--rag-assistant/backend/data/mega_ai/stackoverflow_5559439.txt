There's two ways that I've found to allow this, the first: #foo { font-size: 0; } #bar1 { font-size: 16px; } JS Fiddle . And the second: #foo { font-size: 0; } #foo :first-child { font-size: 16px; } JS Fiddle . These methods work, pretty much, by giving the font a size of 0 , so it occupies no height, or width. And then overriding that font-size on specific elements, to cause the text of those specified tags to be shown. The problem with, and the reason I don't like, this method is that it explicitly requires a fixed-size font ( 16px in the examples) to override the inherited font-size of 0 . Still, they both work, though the latter example is probably a tad too fragile to be trusted with dynamically generated mark-up.
