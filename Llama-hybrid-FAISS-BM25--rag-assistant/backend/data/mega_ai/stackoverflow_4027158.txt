jqueryUI Sortable: handling .disableSelection() on form inputs

example: i have an un-ordered list containing a bunch of form inputs. after making the ul .sortable(), I call .disableSelection() on the sortable (ul) to prevent text-selection when dragging an li item. ..all fine but I need to re/enable text-selection on the form inputs.. or the form is basically un-editable .. i found a partial solution @ http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-sortable-disableselection-firefox-issue-with-inputs enableSelection, disableSelection seem still to be un-documented: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Core any thoughts?
