selecting child child elements with linq

Hi I just dove into LINQ-XML a few days ago and would like to know if i'm doing something wrong or it's just not possible to do this. I've searched around and there hasn't been any problem related to mine and I've been mucking around a bit now. XML: QWZ5671 39.95 Red Burgundy Red Burgundy RRX9856 42.50 Red Navy Burgundy Red Navy Burgundy Black Navy Black Burgundy Black and the Query: var query = from size in ( from catalogItem in cardigan.Descendants("catalog_item") where catalogItem.Attribute("gender").Value == "Men's" select catalogItem.Descendants("size") ) select size.Elements("color_swatch"); that basically gets me all the color_swatch for Men's but I've been trying to see if I can get all the color_swatch for Men's Large Only. Thanks in advance.
