How to make a UITextView selectable but not editable?

I'm making an iPad application that will let certain selected words or sentences be spoken out loud. But for this I should be able to select text by just dragging a finger over the words. I was thinking about using a UITextView since you can get the selected text from it but it always shows up the keyboard and the magnifying glass with then the menu for Select, Select All and copy. Is it possible to just select words (preferable from a UILabel)? If not is it possible with only the magnifying glass showing but no menu and keyboard? Maybe I'm googling wrong but I've spent already many hours looking for a solution and I'm just not making any progress... Thank you very much!
