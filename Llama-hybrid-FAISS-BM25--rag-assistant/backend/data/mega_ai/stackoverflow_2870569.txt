In CFML (ColdFusion, Railo, OpenBD), the onMissingMethod() event handler, defined within a component, will receive undefined method calls on that component. The arguments missingMethodName and missingMethodArguments are automatically passed in, allowing dynamic handling of the missing method call. This is the mechanism that facilitated the creation of implicit setter/getter schemes before they began to be built into the various CFML engines.
