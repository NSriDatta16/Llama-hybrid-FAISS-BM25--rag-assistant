Can't seem to figure out how to add a comment, so this is part comment part answer: First, it sounds from the comments that you are using a Random Walk Metropolis step to update $\alpha$ and $\beta$ jointly (or possibly separately), and then a Gibbs step to update each $\lambda_i$ conditional on the current values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$. You say you're using a truncated Normal proposal in the (random walk) Metropolis step: it probably won't make much difference in your case, but technically I think you need to propose from a full Gaussian, not truncated - otherwise your proposal distribution isn't symmetric, so $q(y|x) \neq q(x|y) \: \forall x,y$, so the Metropolis acceptance ratio doesn't produce a Markov chain which will converge to the desired density. Alternatively you could keep the truncated $q$ and use the full Metropolis-Hastings acceptance ratio. Secondly, as Procrastinator says, you presumably therefore have a posterior for $(\alpha, \beta)$, so you must have set a prior for these. What is it? Gamma priors with fixed hyperparameters (something like shape=1, rate=0.001) would do probably do the trick). Now, to attempt to answer some of your question: assuming you've done everything right and you're getting large autocorrelation because each $(\alpha^{(i)},\beta^{(i)})$ is highly correalated with each $(\alpha^{(i-1)},\beta^{(i-1)})$, then maybe the Random Walk Metropolis isn't the best method to draw $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Since your MH step is in only two dimensions, an independence sampler might work better. Slightly more advanced methods like the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo are also designed to reduce auto-correlation, but that might be overkill here. So maybe try an independence sampler (don't forget to use the full Metropolis-Hastings ratio $\min\left(1,\frac{\pi(y)q(x|y)}{\pi(x)q(y|x)} \right)$ for acceptance).
