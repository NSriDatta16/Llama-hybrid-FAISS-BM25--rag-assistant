Boundary points can always be reachable from more than one cluster, as discussed in the original DBSCAN article as well as in Erich Schubert, Jörg Sander, Martin Ester, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Xiaowei Xu: DBSCAN Revisited, Revisited: Why and How You Should (Still) Use DBSCAN. ACM Trans. Database Syst. 42(3): 19:1-19:21 (2017) because of this issue, boundary points are no longer included in clusters in HDBSCAN*. Ricardo J. G. B. Campello, Davoud Moulavi, Jörg Sander: Density-Based Clustering Based on Hierarchical Density Estimates. PAKDD (2) 2013: 160-172 Instead of adding a heuristic with yet another parameter, it may be worth exploring the relationship to minimum cuts further, discussed in Erich Schubert, Sibylle Hess, Katharina Morik: The Relationship of DBSCAN to Matrix Factorization and Spectral Clustering. LWDA 2018: 330-334
