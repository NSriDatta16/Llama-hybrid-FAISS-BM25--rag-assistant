It is impossible to say how to combine AM and PM scores--or what to do after that--without knowing your motivation for the study and having a more-focused reason for doing both AM and PM tests. 'Checking for variations' is about as vague as it gets. Why are you really going to the extra effort to do both tests? How do you suppose they may differ? If the overall purpose is to establish the semi-obvious fact that younger people have more 'energy' than older ones, then 10 subjects in each age group is probably too few to give results of interest, no matter what P-values you get. If you have a particular sub-population of interest (e.g., people in a city with a particular kind of water pollution), then results may be less predictable and more interesting, even with small samples. I can see arguments for using any one of four methods of 'combining' AM and PM scores: (a) average, (b) difference, (c) worst, or (d) best score. If you are familiar with 'metabolic cost' scores, then you might know how consistent you expect AM and PM scores to be. You might also have an idea whether such scores tend to be roughly normally distributed across a large population. If you are at the exploratory phase of using these scores, you might try four separate 2-sample t tests after combining in each of the four ways (a)-(d). With sample sizes as small as 10 in each group. I hope data are nearly normal so that t tests are appropriate for comparing Young vs. Older, because the power of nonparametric tests, such as 2-sample Wilcoxon test, is somewhat lower, especially using such small groups. You should guard against false discovery doing all four tests, perhaps looking for P-values below 1% or 2% to reject. If you are familiar with these scores and feel it is OK to assume near normality, then you might consider an appropriate partially hierarchical ANOVA design, which would include all effects. Then if warranted, you could do ad hoc tests. Some of these ad hoc tests might show which of (a)-(d) is getting at the truth. Initial rejection of the overall ANOVA model as a prerequisite for doing ad hoc tests offers some protection against false discovery. Notes: (1) If I understand your experiment correctly, a possible ANOVA model for a design that includes all effects, and does not combine AM and PM scores for individuals, is as follows: $$Y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \tau_j + \{\alpha\tau\}_{ij} + S(\alpha)_{k(i)} + e_{ijk},$$ where $i = 1,2$ age groups, $j=1,2$ times of the day, $k(i) = 1, 2, \dots, 10$ randomly chosen subjects within each age group, $S(\alpha)_{i(i)} \stackrel{iid}{\sim} \mathsf{Norm}(0, \sigma_S),$ and $ e_{ijk} \stackrel{iid}{\sim}\mathsf{Norm}(0, \sigma).$ You could study age, diurnal effect, and their interaction with lines $\alpha, \tau, \{\alpha\tau\}$ of the ANOVA table. These are all fixed effects. 'Subject' is a random effect. A three-way interaction is not supported because of the nesting. Parentheses $(\;)$ indicate nesting and are read as 'within'. (2) Here is one reason parts of my discussion focus on having only ten subjects in each group. Suppose, for normal data, that you are trying to detect a difference of one standard deviation with 10 subjects in each of two groups. For example, this might be the difference between $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=100,\sigma=15)$ and $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=115,\sigma=15).$ Then a computation using a noncentral t distribution shows the power is only about 56%. With the same kind of data, using 2-sample Wilcoxon test, a simulation (with R) shows that the power is only about $0.511 \pm 0.003.$ Even if the effect is present, you have only about a 50:50 chance of detecting it. set.seed(2020) pv = replicate( 10^5, wilcox.test( rnorm(10,100,15), rnorm(10,115,15) )$p.val ) mean(pv Addendum in response to question in comment: Suppose the main difference between Young and Older people is that Older ones have higher metabolic cost later in the day. But Younger people stay steady throughout the day. Would that be of interest? If so, then look at PM/PM difference. (Either order, AM - PM or PM - AM, but be consistent.) What if most efficient score is the 'real' one and some people are occasionally less efficient? (Brief headache, upset over bad news, today's pizza lunch not digesting properly.) Then use most efficient score. What if least efficient sore is more reliable? (Anyone can happen to have an occasional atypical efficient score, but that's an anomaly.) Then use least eff. score. I don't suppose you're limited to using just one of the ways of summarizing data. I really have no idea which to use because this is not my area of study. Presumably someone familiar with these scores would have a clue what they really mean. And presumably someone not yet familiar with them would want to find out before using them in a study. I hope you also pay attention to the issue of potentially low power to detect real effects due to the small sample sizes you mentioned.
