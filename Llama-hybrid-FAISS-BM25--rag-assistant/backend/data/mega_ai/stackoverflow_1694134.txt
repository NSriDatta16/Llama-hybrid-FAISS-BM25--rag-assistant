I think Mckesson uses Intersystems' Cache as its mumps (M) provider. Cache has support for .Net (see the documentation here ). Jesse Liberty has a pretty good article on using C#, .Net and Windows Forms as the front end to a Cache database. I'm not sure about LINQ (I'm no expert here), but this might give you an idea as to where to start to get your project done. Michael
