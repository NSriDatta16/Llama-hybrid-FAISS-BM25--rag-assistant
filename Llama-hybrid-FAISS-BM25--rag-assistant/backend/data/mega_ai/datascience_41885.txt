How can I improve a machine learning model?

I am a Machine learning newbie and i am trying my hands with a dataset which has 9 features and my aim is to figure out the optimal multi class classification model which fits my dataset. I applied PCA on my dataset and reduced the dimensionality to 2 and now i can visualize my dataset and this is how it looks like on my training dataset. I am not sure how to choose a best model when data is distributed in such a way and i am looking for suggestions on what techniques are out there. Is Getting more data a viable next step?
