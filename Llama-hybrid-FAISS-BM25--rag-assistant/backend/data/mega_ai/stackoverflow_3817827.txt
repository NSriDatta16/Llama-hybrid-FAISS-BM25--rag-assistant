Solr really is a great option for you. Not only does it provide soundex support , it has language stemming and a ton of other features which you can leverage down the road. Also, being separately hosted allows you to scale your search traffic separately from your database traffic. If system administration isn't your thing, you might consider a hosted service like Websolr (full disclosure: I am one of its co-founders), which was built precisely to deliver all the killer search features of Solr to developers who don't have the expertise or inclination to configure, monitor and performance-tune Solr itself.
