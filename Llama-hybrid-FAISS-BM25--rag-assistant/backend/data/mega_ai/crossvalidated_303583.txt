PCA works best if you have a lot of data. In particular if some variables aren't continuous or you have many duplicate samples. As a rule of thumb, I have seen the recommendation of at least 3pÂ² samples. So for p=9, that rule would suggest you need many more samples to get a reliable estimate from PCA. Unfortunately, I can't find any source for that rule of thumb. Because of this, I would suggest to not use PCA here for analysis. Because I don't see why you need it, and it just adds to your problems. You can definitely cluster multiple variables. But you can still try PCA for visualization only.
