Detecting parent elements in drag and drop

I am writing a board game script and would like to use jQuery UI's drag and drop functionality. When i drag an element from inside DIV A to inside DIV B, is there a way of reading DIV B as the new container of the element. $( ".draggable" ).draggable({ stop: function() { alert(this.parentNode.id); // alerts DIV A's id } });
