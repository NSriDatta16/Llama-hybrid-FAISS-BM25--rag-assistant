Profiling uses the same toolset as code coverage, but the commands are slightly different. With profiling, you can do both instrumentation and sample profiling. For instrumentation profiling (the most similar to code coverage): vsinstr myapp.exe vsperfcmd /start:trace /output:trace.vsp myapp vsperfcmd /shutdown For sample profiling (sampling): vsperfcmd /start:sample /output:sample.vsp /launch:myapp.exe vsperfcmd /shutdown These steps change slightly if you're profiling managed code (you would also need to use vsperfclrenv ). MSDN has good documentation and examples on using the profiling command-line tools .
