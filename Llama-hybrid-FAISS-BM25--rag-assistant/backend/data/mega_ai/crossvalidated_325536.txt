Is strict stationarity a sufficient condition for ergodicity?

For a given time series, is strict stationarity a sufficient condition for ergodicity? I am wondering if it isn't also sufficient for a time series to be weakly stationary because then the mean is a constant. I can't see why the variance shouldn't be allowed to vary over time in order for the time series to be ergodic.
