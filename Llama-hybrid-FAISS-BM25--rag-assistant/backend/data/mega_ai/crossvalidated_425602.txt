Yes, the model is trained by maximizing log likelihood. However it's an autoregressive model, not a variational encoder. However the first doubt I have is how to make this decisions differentiable Well it's the same thing as an RNN really -- you only have to make discrete "decisions" when sampling from the model, while training can be done without.
