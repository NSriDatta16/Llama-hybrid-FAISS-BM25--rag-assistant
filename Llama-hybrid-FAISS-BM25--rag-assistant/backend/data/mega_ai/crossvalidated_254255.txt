How to develop a model if you don't have a clear response variable

Suppose you want to give free trials to Amazon Prime but only want to give the trials to users who are most likely to subscribe since giving free trials to everyone would be expensive. What would be a good response variable for this problem? There are two flavors of Amazon: Amazon Prime and "Free Amazon". The goal is to target the most likely people to convert who use "Free Amazon". Would giving a survey and asking the respondents to rate their enjoyment of Amazon on a scale of 1-5 be a good proxy for a response variable? Would running an ordered logistic regression model be a good approach using this derived variable?
