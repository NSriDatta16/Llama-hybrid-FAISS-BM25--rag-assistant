For doing PCA, why don't you just use an existing library, if you don't manage to compute the Eigenvectors yourself? Note that however, the covariance matrix (and thus PCA) has $60^2 = 3600$ degrees of freedom. Since you only have 800 subjects, the PCA results may overfit . As a rule of thumb, for PCA you should have much more than $d^2$ instances. Best is something like $d^3$. Maybe you should first try some feature selection approaches that are more significant when you have low sample sizes.
