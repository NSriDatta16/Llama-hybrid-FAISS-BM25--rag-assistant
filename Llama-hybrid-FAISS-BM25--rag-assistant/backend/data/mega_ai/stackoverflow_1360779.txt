The solution i ended up using was to package all the required swf files into the library of a wrapper swf. Then i set the movie property of the activex control to the wrapper swf, and set the embed flag on the activex control to true. This embeds that swf directly into the activex control. I dont ever do any loading in the C#, rather i just call the play() method on the active x control to initialize the swf file that has been embeded. Basically if im embedding a resource, there is no need to do it in the C#, i can just embed it in the swf. I then did all my loading and unloading in the flash wrapper swf.
