Why no mention of penalized regression techniques in Applied Logistic Regression, 3rd edition, by Hosmer, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant?

Just ordered this textbook, and Wow, the complete omission of this subject from an otherwise excellent reference on logistic regression is a bit surprising. The 2nd edition was published in 2000 - there's been a lot of research into penalized regression techniques since then: for example, the lasso and elastic net. I know this text is aimed at epidemiologists and public health specialists. Have researchers in these fields ignored any developments that smack of data mining?
