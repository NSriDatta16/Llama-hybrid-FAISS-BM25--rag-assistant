How to train the machine to read xray image in correct position?

I have trained a model to classify Xray of various body parts using CNN. Now I want the model to read a Xray image in correct position even if input image is given in wrong position(rotated). I think we can use letter R in chest xray to make machine to read them in correct position but I have no idea how. I want to do this in python. kindly help me. Iam a newbie to DL.
