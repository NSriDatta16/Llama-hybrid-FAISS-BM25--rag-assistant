Upgrading Zend Framework from version X to version Y

Whenever I upgrade Zend Framework I study the changelogs ( http://framework.zend.com/changelog ) but still feel like I am going through a bit of leap of faith to ensure my application does not break. So far, I have not really had any problems. A large amount of the application is under unit test and web test. But, tests do not have 100% coverage so the whole process of upgrading ZF is still a bit unnerving. So the Question is... Where would I be able to find definitive information on interface changes and 'backwards compatibility breaks' when upgrading from 'ZF version X' to 'ZF version Y'? Also if anyone has any general upgrade tips on upgrading vendor code smoothly then that would be of interest. i.e. Do you write a set of unit tests to work on all framework components used by your app? Also any specific tips on upgrading from ZF 1.8 to 1.11 would be welcomed in comments.
