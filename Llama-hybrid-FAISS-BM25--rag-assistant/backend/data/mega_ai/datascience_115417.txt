In general, a model trained on a given domain will always outperform another that is trained on a different domain. However, there is no free lunch in data science . In your case this means that is impossible to say whether or not a pre-trained model will outperform your own model. This is because it depends on How well the pre-trained model generalizes to the biomedical domain - which is very hard to estimate without actually testing it out. How well your own model will perform. This in turn depends on your computational resources, data quality and volume, optimization techniques, experience, and a ton of other factors. In short: you'll have to try it out!
