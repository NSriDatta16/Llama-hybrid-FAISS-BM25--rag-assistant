One non-technical consideration. Embedding free data inside English phrases isn't going to look very smooth in many cultures (including Western ones), where you need grammatical agreement on e.g. number, gender or case. A more telegraphic style usually helps (e.g. Excellent input: "xyz") -- then at least everybody gets the same level of clunkiness!
