Conflicting startDrags

Flash CS4, AS2 I'm making a tour with a map. I'm using this startDrag code to move the map around: menu.onPress = function() { this.startDrag(); }; menu.onRelease = function() { stopDrag(); }; This works perfectly. However, inside the "menu" movieclip I am using a hover tag startDrag code: EllisIsland._visible=false;{} EllisIland_mc.onRollOver = function() { EllisIsland.startDrag(); EllisIsland._visible=true; }; EllisIland_mc.onRollOut = function() { EllisIsland.stopDrag(); EllisIsland._visible=false; }; This was working perfectly before I added the drag to the map, but now it won't work. I also have buttons in this movie clip that were working, but now are not. Is there any way to make these elements work together?
