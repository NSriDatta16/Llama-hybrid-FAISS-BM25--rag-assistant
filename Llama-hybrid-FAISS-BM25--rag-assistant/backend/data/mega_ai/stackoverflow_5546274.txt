jQuery: How to determine if one or more textboxes are empty

Suppose I've got a set of textboxes of the form: For validation, I need to make sure all of these textboxes contain a value, and display an error if not. My current idea is basically to set the value outside, a la: var oneEmpty = false; $(".member").each(function() { oneEmpty = oneEmpty || $(this).val() == "" }); if (oneEmpty) { etc } However, it's not particularly elegant. Therefore, is there a better way to pull it off?
