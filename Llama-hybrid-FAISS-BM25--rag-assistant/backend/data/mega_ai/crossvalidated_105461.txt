Difference between standard deviation and standard deviate

I was reading this paper http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/4/359.full.pdf and in the last paragraph of the first page, Rule 1 is given as $\alpha_{j+1} > \bar{\alpha} + k s_{\alpha}$. Here, $\bar{\alpha}$ and $s_{\alpha}$ refer to the mean and standard deviation of a distribution $\alpha$ while $\alpha_{j+1}$ is a clustering criterion value. So far so good. But $k$ is listed as the standard deviate. What is a standard deviate and how is it different from a standard deviation? Googling standard deviate gives this link http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/standard+deviate The link explains that a standard deviate is $\left(x- \bar{x}\right)/ \sigma$. Is this correct? I don't see any references on that site. Also, is there a relation between the standard deviate and the tail of the distribution?
