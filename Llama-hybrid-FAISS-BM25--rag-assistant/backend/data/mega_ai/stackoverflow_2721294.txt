You can get per-pixel normals interpolated from vertex normales by just using a "varying" (in newer OpenGL it is just in/out) variable. But do not forget to normalize this normal! Interpolated normals must not have a length of 1 any longer. These normals also give bad results on sharp edges. If you want to use custom normals with a higher resolution a commonly used technique are normal maps. You create a texture with baked normals for your object. Then you can access the normal in the fragment texture using a textur look-up.
