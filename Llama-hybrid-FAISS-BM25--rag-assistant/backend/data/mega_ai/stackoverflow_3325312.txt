If you hit the source button in the bottom panel of Instruments and drag the source file into it, it will show you the line in your code where it think the leak is. If the app is running, you can copy the address of the objects shown to the debugger and like this: po 0x1a831 ... and it will print a description of the object at that address. Most likely, your leak is resulting from a side effect of fetching your managed objects. Value transformers are a common source of such leaks because they create objects every time they are used. I would look at the managed object subclasses themselves for the source of the leak.
