iPhone timeIntervalSinceDate

I'm trying to measure time between taps. I've gathered code from a couple other posts, but still no luck. I running into issues when I'm taking the difference between two time stamps and trying to make it readable in seconds. // Time elapsed NSTimeInterval duration = [[NSDate date] timeIntervalSinceDate:touchesBegan]; NSDateFormatter *formatted = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init]; [formatted setDateFormat: @"ss"]; NSString *stringFromDate = [ formatted stringFromDate:duration]; The error comes on the last line where the formatting is supposed to occur: Error: Incompatible type for argument 1 of 'stringFromDate' Thanks
