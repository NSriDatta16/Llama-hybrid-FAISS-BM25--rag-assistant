The equation should be $$\operatorname{E}(Y)=\alpha+\beta x$$; that is the expected value of $Y$ at the given value of $x$. So, if your model's right & you make enough observations of $Y$ at that value of $x$, it tells you what the average value of $Y$ will be. In the long run you'll do better making predictions using that average than the value you observed.
