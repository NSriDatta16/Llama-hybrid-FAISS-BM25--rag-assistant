Mocking relates to unit testing. For the functionality you are describing I would separate the trigger (in your case the alarm clock event) from the process (whatever it is your 'daily routine' is doing) and unit test the process functionality. Then direct your attention to the scheduling code that will invoke your process functionality. I would recommend using something like Quartz for this but if you are going to role-your-own the unit test for it can work with the actual system clock provided you assign the trigger time based on the current value of the system clock as all you will be testing for is that the trigger event occurs.
