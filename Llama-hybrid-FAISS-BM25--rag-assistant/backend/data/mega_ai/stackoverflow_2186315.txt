var projection = DataContext.GetTable .AsEnumerable() .Select(f => f.SetRetrievalTimeAndReturnSelf()); This will then perform the invocation of SetRetrievalTimeAndReturnSelf for each instance of Foo in DataContext.GetTable when the IEnumerable projection is iterated over. What do you need to know the time that object was yanked of the database for? That's potentially smelly.
