It sounds like you'd want to use a generalized estimating equations (GEE) or mixed model for this analysis where the participant is a random effect. You'd use a contrasts to determine if the first measurements is different from the average of the other four. You could even try a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach too. To deal with missing data, I'd recommend using multiple imputation.
