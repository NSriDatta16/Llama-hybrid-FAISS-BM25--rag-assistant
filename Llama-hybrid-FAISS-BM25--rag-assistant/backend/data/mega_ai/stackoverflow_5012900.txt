Class to XML in C#

I have a C# class as follows : class CoverageInfo { public string className; public int blocksCovered; public int blocksNotCovered; public CoverageInfo(string className, int blocksCovered, int blocksNotCovered) { this.className = className; this.blocksCovered = blocksCovered; this.blocksNotCovered = blocksNotCovered; } } And, I have a List, ModuleName, BlocksCovered/BlocksNotCovered variable. Out of those information, I need to create an XML file as follows. hello.exe 5 5 Fpga::hello 5 2 ... How can I do that with C#?
