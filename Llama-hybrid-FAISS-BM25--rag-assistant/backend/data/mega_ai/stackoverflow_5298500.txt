Set the leftCalloutAccessoryView in your viewForAnnotation: method of the Map. The leftCallout is a UIView so you can put anything there. Some sample code might look like: MKAnnotationView *av = [[[MKAnnotationView alloc] initWithAnnotation:annotation reuseIdentifier:@"ReuseMe"] autorelease]; [av setCanShowCallout:YES]; UIImageView *sfIconView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"SFIcon.png"]]; av.leftCalloutAccessoryView = sfIconView; [sfIconView release]; Review the MapCallouts demo code from Apple. It does what you want. UPDATE BASED on Comment: to change out the image just put in a new image in initWithImage. you could have the line be something like UIImageView *sfIconView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:[myArrayOfImages objectAtIndex:myIndexVariable]]; You could even refactor the lines that start UIImageView all the way to [sfIconView and pass in the image that way. The code for viewForAnnotation: gets called one time for each annotation (just like the cells in a UITableView).
