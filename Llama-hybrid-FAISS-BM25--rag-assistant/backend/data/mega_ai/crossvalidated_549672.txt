Using right censoring at this point would probably completely destroy the estimate, since I have so, so few "complete" observations. That's not correct. In fact, treating this like a standard censored survival problem is probably the best you can do. Survival analysis, based on markers for each case of whether the last observation time was an "event" (contract died) or censored (contract still in place), takes advantage of all of the data that you have without introducing the bias, that you rightly note, that comes from things like simply taking the average observation times. Now, you still might have a problem in that the mix of cases only gets you down to, say, something like 80% "survival" at a contract length of 3 years. That won't give you an estimate of things like median survival (survival time at which 50% of contracts have died) or a true mean survival. That leaves you with a couple of choices. One is to calculate a "restricted mean survival": the mean survival out to some fixed survival time that is actually covered by your data, but not trying to go beyond that. That can be inherently unsatisfying, but might be good enough for your business purposes if it sets a useful lower limit to true mean survival. An alternative is to make some distributional assumption, like the "some kind of normal distribution assumption" you propose. You do a parametric survival regression, taking censoring into account, based on assuming a particular distribution of survival times like Weibull, gamma, log-normal, or log-logistic. That's implemented in standard statistical software. You effectively end up with an equation for survival over time that can be used to estimate things like median and mean survival times, and corresponding error estimates, that would hold if your choice of survival-time distributional form is correct. Such extrapolation is necessarily risky. For one, the limited early data might not provide enough information about the correct parametric form to choose. For another, no simple parametric form might work. Maybe most important, changes in the underlying structure might happen. How many business predictions made in pre-Covid in 2019 still hold in 2021?
