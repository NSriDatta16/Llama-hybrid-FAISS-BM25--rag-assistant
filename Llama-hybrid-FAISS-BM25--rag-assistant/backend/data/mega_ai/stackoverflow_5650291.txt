Ever hear of DeMorgan 's law...??? The hint is in the linky , it is the table that epitomises and embodies the raw cold truth of logic that is pinned into the syntaxes of major language compilers... Even more worrying is the fact that you don't have the basic CS101 knowledge and posting this question (Sorry if you take this to be condescending but am not), I genuinely cannot believe you're looking at a C code and not told anything about two's complements, bitwise logic... something is very wrong here... If your college lecturer has not told you any of it, said lecturer should not be lecturing at all and find another job.... sigh
