glm returns NA as coefficient for logistic regression

I am fitting a logistic regression for the response variable- 0 or 1. There are 15 explanatory variables- 10 are continuous and 5 are categorical with 3 levels each. I checked collinearity among the 10 continuous variables using correlation and they are okay. Using R, the glm function returns NA as the coefficient for one of the level of a categorical variable. How can I fix this problem? Please help.
