I have to agree with Simon - careful comments and manual merges are the only way to keep it with the rest of your SVN or CVS files. Version Cue is not adequate. My understanding is that Version Cue is a fully featured version control that does file locking that is well suited for media files (storing only changes to files for more efficient storage, ranking, lots of thumbnails, etc...). I saw nothing in the docs about merging versions (just that the files are different). In fact, the docs I saw ( http://www.scribd.com/doc/7868549/Using-Adobe-Bridge-and-Adobe-Version-Cue-CS4 ) say that you can discard your edits or the other user's edits, which means no merge. The only tiny piece that is a little better than nothing is that you can open previous versions directly in Flash to do the manual merge. Concurrent Working Fail.
