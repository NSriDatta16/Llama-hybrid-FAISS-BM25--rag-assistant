EF POCO code only VS EF POCO with Entity Data Model

The ability to separate domain objects completely from any kind of persistance code makes systems much more extensible and maintainable. Testing is made much easier when business logic can be tested separately from storage code. The use of POCOs with the Entity Framework (EF) is definitely a step in the right direction :) there are 2 types of using poco with EF 1.Using the entity designer 2.Using the code only which one is the best approach EF poco code first or EF Poco using the entity data model designer ? thanks
