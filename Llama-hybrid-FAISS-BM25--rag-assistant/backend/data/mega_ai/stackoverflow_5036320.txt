I'd imagine what you suspect is in fact true, that even being IO-bound varies by application. I think you could accomplish your goal of timing by using Timers and writing the output to a file on storage you could then retrieve. Do some math to figure out you can process X number of work units / hour by cramming as many through a small then a medium instance as possible. If your work unit size drastically fluctuates, you might have to do some averaging too. I would always prefer smaller instances if possible and just spin up more copies as you have need for more firepower.
