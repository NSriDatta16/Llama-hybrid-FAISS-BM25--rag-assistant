I propose the following algorithm: Compute 3D Delaunay triangulation of your data points. Remove all the edges that are longer than your threshold distance, O(N) when combined with step 3. Find connected components in the resulting graph which is O(N) in size, this is done in O(N Î±(N)). The bottleneck is step 1 which can be done in O(N 2 ) or even O(N log N) according to this page http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/conf/SANTA_FE_CD-ROM/sf_papers/lattuada_roberto/paper.html . However it's definitely not a 100 lines algorithm.
