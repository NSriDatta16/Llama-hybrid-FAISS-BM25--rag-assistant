Descriptive statistics on time series data

My task is to summarize the descriptive statistics of time series data ( mean, SD , standard error ). It is fairly straightforward for a stationary series. But How do we find out the mean, standard deviation, standard error of the non stationary time series data? I have been reading about the stationary series and how to make a time series stationary by differencing the series. If we take the mean of the differenced series, will that be a reflector of mean of the original data. Any inputs on this?
