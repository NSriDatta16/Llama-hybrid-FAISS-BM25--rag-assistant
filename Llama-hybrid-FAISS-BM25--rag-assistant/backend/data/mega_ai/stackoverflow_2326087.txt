jQuery dialog does not appear on second attempt if using a custom theme

I am using a jQuery dialog with autoOpen set to false. The first time I call dialog("open") it works fine. However, subsequent calls (without a page refresh) do not show the dialog. This problem apparently started when I switched from using jquery.ui.dialog.js, jquery.ui.resizable.js, jquery.ui.draggable.js, and jquery.ui.core.js to a custom theme which bundled all of those into jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js. I pretty much confirmed that the custom theme was the problem by switching back to my old js files. My custom theme was far from custom as I took all of the defaults (simply went to http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ and clicked download). I am using version 1.4.1 of jQuery. Any ideas? I'd like to continue using the themeroller, but may have to punt.
