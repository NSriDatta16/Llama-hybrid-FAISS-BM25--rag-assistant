In addition to Jagannaths answer, I thought the definition of myclass in myclass.hpp counted as a declaration, but in C++ it is a definition so Jagannaths answer applies. It turns out it is possible to just declare a class but then you can only use pointers or references to that class, but not access its members in any way. see also: Declare a C++ class without defining it in the current translation unit
