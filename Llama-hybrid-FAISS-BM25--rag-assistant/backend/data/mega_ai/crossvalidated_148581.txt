If the number of years is small compared to the number of subjects, then it may be reasonable to use a logistic regression model as you describe, but with a separate term for each year, i.e. will_be_olymp ~ a + b1*cig1 + ... + b4*cig4 + c1*miles1 + ... + c4*miles4 where cig1 , ..., cig4 represent the number of cigarettes smoked at age 17, ..., 20, respectively. On the other hand, if the number of years is large (or if there are multiple observations per year), then this may require an excessive number of parameters. In this case, a functional logistic regression model may be more appropriate: see, for example, this recent paper on the topic, Functional logistic regression approach to detecting gene by longitudinal environmental exposure interaction in a case-control study .
