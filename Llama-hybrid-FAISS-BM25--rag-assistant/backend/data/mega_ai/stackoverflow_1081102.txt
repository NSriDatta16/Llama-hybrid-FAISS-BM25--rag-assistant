A byte array is not going to save you much memory unless you make it a byte array holding unsigned ints, which is very dangerous in Java. It will replace memory overhead with extra processing time for the step checking of the code. This may be aright for data storage, but there already is data storage solution out there. Unless you are doing this for serialization purposes, I think that you are wasting your time.
