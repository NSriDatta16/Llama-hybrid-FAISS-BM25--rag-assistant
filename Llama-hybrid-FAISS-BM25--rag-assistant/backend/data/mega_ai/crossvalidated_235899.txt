Markov Chain for system with failure and repair

I am solving the below problem, and facing a few doubts regarding my approach. Consider a system with two components. We observe the state of the system every hour. A given component operating at time n has probability p of failing before the next observation at time n + 1. A component that was in a failed condition at time n has a probability r of being repaired by time n + 1 , independent of how long the component has been in a failed state. The component failures and repairs are mutually independent events. Let $X_n$ be the number of components in operation at time n . The process $\big\{$$X_n$, n = 0, 1, . . .$\big\}$ is a discrete time homogeneous Markov chain with state space $I$ = 0, 1, 2. Determine its transition probability matrix, and draw the state diagram. Obtain the steady state probability vector, if it exists. From my understanding, there are 3 possible states of the system: All 2 components are working fine One component has failed and one is working fine Both components are in the failed state So I have arrived to the following Markov Chain diagram: The 2r is because any one system can be repaired if both are in failed state. Using this diagram, I arrived at the below transitional probability matrix: \begin{bmatrix} -2p & 2p & 0 \\ r & -(r+p) & p \\ 0 & 2r & -2r \end{bmatrix} Am I thinking in the right direction? And can anybody help me with the second part of the question? To find the steady state probability vector? Thanks!
