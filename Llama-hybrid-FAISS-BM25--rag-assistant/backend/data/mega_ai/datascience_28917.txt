Try modeling the time series with a midpoint estimate (expected value at each time) and a band estimate (permissible spread at any given midpoint). Then being an anomaly is just a matter of being outside the band. How you estimate the midpoints depends on the problem. For example if your time series has one or more seasonalities, you could use time series decomposition (e.g., seasonal-trend decomposition using loess). The band estimate is also problem-dependent. I did some work like this for a bookings data time series. I wrote about it here: https://techblog.expedia.com/2016/07/28/applying-data-science-to-monitoring/
