It sounds like what you want is the NIPALS algorithm for performing PCA. It's a very popular algorithm among statisticians. It has many advantages: Computationally less expensive than SVD or eigenvalue decomposition methods if only the first few components are required. Has more modest storage requirements in general because the covariance matrix is never formed. This is a very important property for very large datasets. Can handle missing data in the dataset (though that's not an issue in your problem, since you're dealing with images). Description http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_iterative_partial_least_squares Algorithm Here's a simple and excellent description of the algorithm (in section 1.2) http://stats4.eng.mcmaster.ca/w/mediafiles/mediawiki/f/f7/Section-Extra-Class-1.pdf Remember to mean-center-scale first before doing PCA as it is scale-sensitive.
