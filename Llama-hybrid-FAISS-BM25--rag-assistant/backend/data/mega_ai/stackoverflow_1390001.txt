Byref New Object. Is it okay top pass New Object as "byref"

Below I tried to do an Example: Public Function UserData(ByVal UserDN As String) As DataTable Dim myTable As DataTable = UserData_Table() Dim dr As DataRow dr = myTable.NewRow() SplitOU2(UserDN, dr("OUDN"), dr("Organisation"), New Object) dr("UserDN") = UserDN myTable.Rows.Add(dr) Return myTable End Function Below is the called method: Friend Sub SplitOU2(ByVal inDN As String, ByRef OUDN As Object, ByRef Organisation As Object, ByRef VerksamhetTyp As Object) By doing this I can skip to declare the in this example "useless" variable Dim VerksamhetTyp as Object = "" . Perhaps it looks a little ugly but to have to declare unused variables can also be confusing.
