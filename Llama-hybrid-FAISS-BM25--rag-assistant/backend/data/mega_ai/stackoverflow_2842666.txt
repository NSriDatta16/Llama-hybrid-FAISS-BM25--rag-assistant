When you do this: foreach($html->find('embed') as $element) You're creating a simpleHTMLdom element object - its not a simple variable you can just use as an assignment. For exmaple, if the element was: Some Embed Code Here You could change it by doing the following: $element->innertext = "Hello world"; # the element is now Hello world of if you want to change the element completely: $element->outertext = " Now I'm a paragraph "; and you've replaced the embed entirely.
