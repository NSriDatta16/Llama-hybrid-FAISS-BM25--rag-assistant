The resampling method introduced in Efron (1979) was designed for i.i.d. univariate data but is easily extended to multivariate data. As discussed in . If $ x_1,···,x_n $ is a sample of vectors, to maintain the covariance structure of the data in the sample. It is not immediately obvious whether one can resample a time series $ x_1,x_2,···,x_n $ . A time series is essentially a sample of size 1 from a stochastic process. Resampling a sample is original sample, so one learns nothing by resampling. Therefore, resampling of a time series requires new ideas. Model-based resampling is easily adopted to time series. The resamples are obtained by simulating the time series model. For example, if the model is ARIMA(p,d,q), then the resamples of an ARIMA(p, q) model with MLEs (from the differenced series) of the autoregressive and moving average coefficients and the noise variance. The resamples are the sequences of partial sum of the simulated ARIMA(p, q) process. Model-free resampling of time series is accomplished by block resampling, also called block bootstrap, which can be implemented using the tsboot function in R’s boot package. The idea is to break the series into roughly equal-length blocks of consecutive observations, to resample the block with replacement, and then to paste the blocks together. For example, if the time series is of length 200 and one uses 10 blocks of length 20, then the blocks are the first 20 observations, the next 20, and so forth. A possible resample is the fourth block (observation 61 to 80), then the last block (observation 181 to 200), then the second block (observation 21 to 40), then the fourth block again, and so on until there are 10 blocks in the resample.
