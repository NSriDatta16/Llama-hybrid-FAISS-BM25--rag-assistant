MCMC packages in R

Is there an R package for MCMC that can accept my self-defined (log)likelihood function (can be done in MCMCpack ) and lets the user define contraints to the proposals (like only accept values from the [0,1] interval, or take only positive values (possible in rSTAN ) I already definded my model in R code but obviously no MCMC package in R can handle constraints on the parameters like rstan and I don't want to recode it in rstan . Update: I found that the LaplacesDemon package is perfect for my needs, but the package is obviously abandoned :(
