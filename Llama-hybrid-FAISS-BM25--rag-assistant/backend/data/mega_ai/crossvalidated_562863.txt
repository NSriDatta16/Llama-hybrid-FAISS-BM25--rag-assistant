How do I find probabilities in logistic regression?

let's assume we have continuous independent variable and obviously binary dependent one. How can we calculate probabilities which is displayed on y-axis? With scale like in the image below, it's clear that we can simply take some x value, look through all the samples having this value and corresponding y values and calculate a/(a+b). But, how do I find probabilities if I have continuous variable?
