I don't know that I'd call this a machine learning problem per se...though others may disagree, this sounds like an optimization problem. Your description is vague, but let's pretend it's a guitar that you're trying to tune and you have 6 strings. The trick is to define an objective function that quantifies, with a single number, how 'good' the tuning is. (The program can independently manipulate each string's tension). Perhaps it's some deviance in power from an ideal FFT, and you sum the deviance from each string. Optimization routines such as simplex, sub plex, Nelder-Mead, GA, etc., are ways of manipulating the tension in 'smart' ways that obviate the need for a brute force (or 'grid search') solution. So long as you can define an objective function, you can start trying it out, though the local max/min problem will need to be dealt with. I'd look into some tutorials on minimization algorithms
