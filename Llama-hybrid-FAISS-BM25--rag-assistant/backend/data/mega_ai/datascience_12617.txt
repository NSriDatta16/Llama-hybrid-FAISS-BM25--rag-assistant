How to identify similar data points?

I am new to machine learning and I am struck at one thing. Please help. I am developing an app to sort images based on user preferences. So initially I have n data points(images) with m features each. Now when user create an album and add some images in it then my algorithm should find similar images from the gallery and add it to the same album. This should work even if user creates more albums. And not all images are needed to be sorted, only the relevant one. What algorithms should I use to achieve this?
