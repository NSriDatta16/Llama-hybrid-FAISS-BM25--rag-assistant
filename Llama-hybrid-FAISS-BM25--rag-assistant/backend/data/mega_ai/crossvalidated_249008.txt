You can use the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) that is a good algorithm to find the similarity between two time series since it find the match between the time series that minimize the alignment cost. It's really easy to use and it has a lot of different variations that allow you to set (for example) local weights or just apply it to a subsequence of a time series. If you need for an R package that is ready for the use, I would suggest you to import TSdist and here you can find the documentation.
