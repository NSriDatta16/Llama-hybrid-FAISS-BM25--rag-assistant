Non-parametric test for unimodality of 2-d dataset

I'm looking for a method to determine if a 2-d dataset forms a single cluster or is split into two/multiple clusters - and what's the likelihood or p-value for this. Isolated data should not be considered as different cluster. Also, data has a non-parametric distribution. My approach is to apply an unimodal / bimodal test. However, I didn't find any modality statistical test for 2-d non-parametric data. An alternative approach is to check the modality of the projections of the data on the two axis (this becomes a 1-d modality test). If the distributions of the projections are unimodal on both axis, then the 2-d dataset has a unimodal distribution. If this alternative approach is correct, then my question becomes: what unimodality test to use for 1-d non-parametric data? - I already tried the DipTest R implementation, but it doesn't work correctly in the non-parametric case (see the example below). An example illustrating the alternative approach below: (first two plots - histograms of the projection of the data on the OX and OY axes; the third plot - scatterplot of the 2-d dataset) Example for unimodal distribution - unimodal distribution on both axes (inferred from the histograms) !! inconsistent results from DipTest: pval_x = 0.06 & pval_y = 0.05 (which means significant bimodlity on both axis - which is not true) (source: mdragan at swarm.cs.pub.ro ) Example for multi-modal distribution (source: mdragan at swarm.cs.pub.ro )
