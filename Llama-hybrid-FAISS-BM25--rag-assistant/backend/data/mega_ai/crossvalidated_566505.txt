What do "Expectation" mean in cost function?

I want to know whether my understanding for expectation of loss function is correct or not. (x,y) means sample data-label distribution from true distribution. And function f which is respect to weight w is a mapping function from data x to label dimension. And l means loss function that takes label and predicted label. so applying loss function to all data points we have, we can create distribution of loss values for all data points. using this distribution, we can calculate expectation value for all data points(say averaged(?) loss value for all data points?). is my understanding about expectation correct or not?
