I would like to synchronize git repository with another my git repository on my remote disk so that I can synchronize it with another git repository on different computer. Try: git remote add external-repo ssh://host/path/to/git/repo.git git push origin external-repo I would like to commit frequently in my git repository and when I decide that this small steps are worth to commit (big enough to share) I would like to commit them to svn but with only one commit. No sweat. Collapse multiple commits with git rebase -i (this is called "squashing") and decide whether you want to keep, throw away, or squash each commit into a larger one. It's very helpful for getting organized before pushing to an external repo. The -i is for "interactive" mode. with 'git svn' I cannot use branches (because when I merge them with master, master will not have lineral history). That's not true. Just set up a branch on git for each branch you want to track with svn . In the opposite direction, you're only pushing one branch at a time anyway.
