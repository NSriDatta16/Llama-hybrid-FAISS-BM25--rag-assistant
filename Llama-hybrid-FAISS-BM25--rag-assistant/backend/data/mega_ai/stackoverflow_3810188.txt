Calculate sum , average based on list of items in WPF

In WPF, I want to display sum, average values based on the List of Items provided. For example, I have an Employee object with Salary Property, and I want to calculate total salary based on the employee list. Also, the employee object is data bound to a Items control where the Salary will be edited/new Employee may be added to the list. Can anyone provide me a solution to achieve this?
