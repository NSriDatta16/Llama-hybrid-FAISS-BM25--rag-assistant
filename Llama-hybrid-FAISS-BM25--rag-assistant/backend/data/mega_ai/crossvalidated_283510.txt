sum and product rules of probability in Bishop's book

There is already an answer for that but it skips some mathematics, where I am getting stuck. I am reading Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. In Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (page 73, chapter 2.1.) there is a formula: $$p(x=1|\mathcal{D})=\int_0^1 p(x=1|\mu)p(\mu|\mathcal{D})\text{d}\mu $$ The answer in another thread by applying the product rule states: $$\int_0^1 p(x=1|\mu)p(\mu|\mathcal D)\mathrm d \mu = \int_0^1 p(x=1,\mu|\mathcal D) \mathrm d \mu $$ And that is exactly where I get stuck. My calculations: $$p(x=1|\mu)p(\mu|\mathcal D) = \frac{p(\mu|x=1) p(x=1) p(\mathcal D|\mu) p(\mu)}{p(\mu) p(\mathcal D)} = \frac{p(x=1, \mu)p(\mu,\mathcal D)}{p(\mu) p(\mathcal D)}$$ And I do not know how to proceed further.
