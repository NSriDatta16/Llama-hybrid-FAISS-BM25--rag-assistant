It doesn't make sense to put an index on a bit column because it is not selective enough. When executing a query, SQL Server determines the most appropriate indexes to use. If your index is not selective enough, it will be ignored or it may decide to do an index scan instead of an index seek. Either way, it won't really help all that much. Putting the index on the DeletedDate could possibly help with some queries, but filtering on NULL vs. "any value" will probably not be that much help either because of the selectivity. I encourage you to read this: Seek Vs. Scan
