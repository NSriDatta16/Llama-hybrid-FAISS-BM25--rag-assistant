I think it is best idea to avoid recursion. Loops are more elegant and easier to understand on most cases. Loops are also more efficient and long loops will not crash the program with stack overflow error. I have found very few problems for what recursion is the most elegant solution. Usually such problems are about navigation in graph or on surface. Fortunately that field is studied to death so you can find plenty of algorithms on the net. When navigating in some simpler graph (like tree) that contains nodes of different types visitor pattern is usually simpler than recursion.
