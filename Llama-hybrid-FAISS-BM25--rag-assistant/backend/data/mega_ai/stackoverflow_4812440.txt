Proper use of XML

Over the past couple years, I have seen a lot of articles, opinions on how XML is an overkill or incorrectly used for . When exactly should I use XML? What specific examples are there that your average programmer may run in to that, without a doubt XML is one of the best solutions? Are there any good articles/books that addresses this issue (not articles on what XML is NOT suited for)?
