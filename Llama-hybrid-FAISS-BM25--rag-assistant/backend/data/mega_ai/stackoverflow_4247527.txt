The simplest, although probably inelegant, way is to just pass the recursive depth as an integral argument to your function and increment it with every new level of depth: public static void doTowers(int topN, char from, char inter, char to, int depth) .... doTowers(..., depth + 1) doTowers(..., depth + 1) Start out with 0 for depth in your main function. Then, just print a \t for every depth .
