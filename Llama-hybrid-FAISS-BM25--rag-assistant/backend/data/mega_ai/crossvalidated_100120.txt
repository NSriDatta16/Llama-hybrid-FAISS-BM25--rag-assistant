Ideally, I'd like to be able to draw a line somewhere and say if the count is higher than some n, then I am p% sure that this record is from group 2. It sounds like you want a model that gives an estimate of $P(Y=1|X=x)$ where $X$ is the variable representing the count, and $Y$ indicates membership of group 2 (Y=1 means "is a member"). When you say "A mixture of log-logistic and Pareto" it sounds like you're referring to $X$. But in the model, you condition on the value of $X$ so what its distribution is would be irrelevant (and strictly speaking, being a count, it can't be either log-logistic or Pareto since those are continuous) to that calculation. There are a variety of tools for this job, but you might like to consider logistic regression as a first step. That will not require you to draw a line - it will give you an estimate of the probability at any $x$. If you want to pre-specify $p$, you can back out an estimate of the $x$ that corresponds to that $p$. Is there an R package or python module that would estimate the parameters of such a mixture? This is such a different question as to merit its own post. In the first question you're modelling $Y|X=x$. Now it seems you want to deal with $X|Y=y$ ($y$ takes the values 0 and 1). Have I understood? You want a model that conditions the other direction?
