YYSTYPE is the type of variables on Yacc's expression stack. If the pointers you create are to items actually stored in Yacc's stack, which would typically be done by referencing $1 (or &$1 to get the pointer), then you are indeed pointing to data that will be released and reused, and are in for a world of hurt (such as segmentation faults if you're lucky; confusion and mishandled information if you're unlucky). If the pointers you create are to items of type YYSTYPE that you manage, then of course there is no problem; you manage their duration, not Yacc. Copy anything you need from things like $1 into your own storage.
