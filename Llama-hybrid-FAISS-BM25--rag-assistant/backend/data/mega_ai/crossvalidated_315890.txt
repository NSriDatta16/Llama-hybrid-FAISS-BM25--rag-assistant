You are doing a lot of hypothesis testing, which is generally not a good way to decide on a model. Ideally, a single model would be pre-specified or you could do model averaging between candidate models. The described data-dependent way of picking a model will invalidate inference from the model that is picked at the end. In general, it may be that the parametric model is more powerful than the semi-parametric model. Alternatively, it could be that the Weibull model does not fit the data all that well, but that adding the interaction makes the model a little more flexible so that it fits the data better. In that case, you may decide that it's more of an artifact of forcing a Weibull model on the data. One way of getting an approximate idea of what is going on would be to plot the survivor curves (or CDFs) from all models (Cox with and without time interaction, as well as Weibull with and without time interaction) together with the Kaplan-Meier curves for each treatment group. This will tell you whether one of these models is fitting the data terribly.
