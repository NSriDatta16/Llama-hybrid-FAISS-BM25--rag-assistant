I have also been searching for fully explained model of Stacked Convolutional Autoencoders. I came across three different architectures. I am still studying them and I thought these might help others who are also starting to explore CAEs. Any further references to papers or implementations would greatly help. The one mentioned by you using pooling - unpooling. The layers of (convolve)__x_times -> (deconvolve)__x_times, and get the same size as input. (convolve -> pool)__x_times -> (strided deconvolution)__y_times the padding and strides are selected such that the final image size is same as original image. Reference
