Do you really need per-commit back-ups? There are almost certainly better ways of safe-guarding against failures than going down that route. For example, given that most failures are disk failures, move to a RAID array and/or NAS/SAN storage will provide you with better general protection and, if configured correctly, better performance. At that point, off-site back-ups becomes a matter of using the tools available. See the Repository maintenance section of the svn manual for details. If you truly do need per-commit back-ups then, yeah, post-commit scripts are the way to go.
