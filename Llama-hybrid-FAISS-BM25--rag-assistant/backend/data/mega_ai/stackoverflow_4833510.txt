itextSharp: Table disappears when added to Paragraph with KeepTogether=true

I am exporting some data to a PDF and I have been using iTextSharp with a lot of success, but I just hit a wall. I have a group of information I need to keep on a single page. This information includes a handful of other Paragraph objects and tables. I can add 3 Paragraphs to another parent Paragraph and set that parent's KeepTogether property to true and everything works great. When I add a PdfPTable to the Paragraph with KeepTogether set to true, the table disappears. No Exceptions or error messages, the table just disappears. Any clue as to what is happening? Is there a work around? Should I be coding differently, like is there a better parent control than Paragraph to keep text and tables together on one page?
