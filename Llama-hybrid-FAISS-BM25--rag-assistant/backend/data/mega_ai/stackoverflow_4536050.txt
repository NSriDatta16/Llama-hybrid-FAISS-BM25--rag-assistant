Getting Events Out of an embedded SVG document

None of the questions I have searched through seems to help me with this. I am embedding an SVG document thusly: And then I am trying to seek out elements in the SVG and add event handlers to them. I already learned that jQuery won't work to find SVG elements. I have this in the head: function blah(event) { alert("Got event: " + event) } var svg; var slot1; function fixup() { svg = jQuery("#zgraphic")[0].getSVGDocument(); slot1 = svg.getElementById("slot1"); slot1.onclick = blah; alert("Set onclick for " + slot1); } Using firebug I can see that the svg and slot1 variables are getting set, and the onclick property of slot1 is also getting set. Yet the event never comes. Side question: Is there a better way to get the root SVGDocument object than the way I am doing it? I got there by trial and error but it looks shaky to me and I haven't been able to find anything like it on the web. It would be nice if jQuery could reach into the SVG document but I can live without it if I have to.
