Floating-point for ARM in Visual C++

I'm using Visual C++ 2005 for building applications for ARM, Qualcomm Snapdragon chip. I know it supports VFPv3. Where can I get SDK or something like to use floating-point arithmetics hardware? Best of all if Visual C++ compiler would generate VFP instructions instread of emulating.
