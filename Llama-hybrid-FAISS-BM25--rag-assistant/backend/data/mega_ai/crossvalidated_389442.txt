Most "statistically sound" method for finding the average of multiple different metrics

If I have 3 different metrics and I wanted to find an "average" (not necessarily arithmetic mean) of the 3 metrics so that observations can be ranked, what would be the most "statistically sound" method of doing so? Here's an example with baseball: I have 3 metrics: Batting Average (ranges from 0.000 to 0.350 ) Home Runs (ranges from 0 to 50 ) RBI (ranges from 0 to 120 ) And I want to equally weight each metric and take some sort of average so that I can rank different players, with the best players being great in all 3 metrics. If I wanted to "average" the metrics so that each metric has equal weight, I could: Standardize each metric so they're all on the same scale and calculate the arithmetic mean Calculate the geometric mean Calculate the harmonic mean Is 1 of these methods more/less "statistically sound" than the others, in terms of not violating any assumptions or anything of the like?
