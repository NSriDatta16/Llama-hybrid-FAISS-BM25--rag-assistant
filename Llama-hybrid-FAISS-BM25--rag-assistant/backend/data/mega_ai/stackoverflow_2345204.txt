The only thing I can think of is acting on a ListSelectionEvent based on whether the selection is still changing (i.e. the user is still clicking and dragging the mouse) or whether the event represents the "final" selection event; e.g. public class MyListSelectionListener implements ListSelectionListener { public void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent evt) { // Finished selecting if (!evt.getValueIsAdjusting()) { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog("Selection Complete!"); } } }
