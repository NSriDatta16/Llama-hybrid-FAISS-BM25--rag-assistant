You might want to rephrase what you are asking for here. Of course you can attach with the Eclipse debugger to that application. You will need to run it in debug mode though. You will need to pass in some parameters to the JVM. Something like java -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=127.0.0.1 .. You might also want to point Eclipse to the source jars so you can step through the code. But since you are talking about config files I would rather check the logs first.
