Elegant way to skip processing script tag for shpaml

I have started using excellent shpaml . But soon hit problem that my js code inside script tags is also processed. Is there a way to configure/extend python shpaml, so that it will skip script or any tag for that matter which is configured for exclusion. I know I can prefix pipe but that is not acceptable within my team. I too agree with it. TIA
