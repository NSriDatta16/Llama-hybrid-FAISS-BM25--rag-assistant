Interpreting Stumps in Boosted Logistic Regression

I have trained a binary classifier using the LogitBoost() function from the caTools package. When I inspect the decision stumps with $Stump , one of my predictor variables has been included twice in the model, albeit with the same values for threshold and sign. How should I interpret this? Is this variable of particular importance to the model I have trained?
