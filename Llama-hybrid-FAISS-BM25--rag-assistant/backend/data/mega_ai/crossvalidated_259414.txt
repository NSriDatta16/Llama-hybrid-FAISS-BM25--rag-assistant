How does pca() function in Matlab fix the sign of principal components?

PCA gives me loadings with different signs. I understand that I may simply revert them ( as explained in this thread ), but I need an explanation (my boss insists) of why Matlab implementation gives me these signs, but not reverted. UPDATE I found empirically, that in Matlab the loading with highest absolute value is always positive.
