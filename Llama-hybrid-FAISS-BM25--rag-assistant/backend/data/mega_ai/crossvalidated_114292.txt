If you see your problem as trying to calculate the probability of wind, it's no technically the same the problem of trying to predict when it will be windy or not. In the first case your model will output "70%", "15%", "0%", etc. It's a regression problem, and a model can be evaluated using means squared error, for example. In the second case you are trying to build a model that will output "yes" or "no", and it's a classification problem, and then the usual metrics are accuracy, f1 measure, AUC (area under ROC curve), etc. In both cases you need to evaluate the model against a test set where you know the answers (usually you set aside some of the training data for this purpose). I would say in this case your problem is most likely a classification problem. as you say yourself. Now thinking of the weather reports that give probabilities of rain, that can perhaps be seen as a prediction + measure of the confidence. 80% chance of rain (wind... ) is kind of like predicting a yes with a pretty high confidence, 40% chance of rain is kind of predicting a "no" with a low confidence. Some machine learning tools will allow you to put a confidence value on the result, others won't. Finally I will just recommend the free open source tool Weka, it implements a whole bunch of different kinds of classifiers and will do the evaluation for you, too.
