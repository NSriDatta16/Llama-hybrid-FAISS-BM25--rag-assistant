Peculiar ASP.NET Error Message

This is displayed as a client message ("Error on page.") in the status bar. I think at this point, the app is using some kind of AJAX callback in response to a login button. Trying to deploy on a new Windows Server 2008 testbed (runs fine in debugger and has been deployed on Windows Server 2003, but we're trying to upgrade our testbed and production images for future installations.) Where do I go next to track down the root cause?
