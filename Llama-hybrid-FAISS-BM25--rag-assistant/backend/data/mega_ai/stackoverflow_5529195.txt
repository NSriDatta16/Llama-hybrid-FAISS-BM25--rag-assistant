How to combine unittest results using a Makefile?

I want to use a Makefile to run individual test files or a combined version of all tests or a coverage report. I'm pretty new to Makefiles so I borrowed one and adapted it. The result is here . The problem is that make test will run each test in sequence and it is hard to see which ones failed when you have a bunch and the screen scrolls a lot. I like that each one uses a separate process so they don't interfere with each other, though. Question is: can I combine the results more nicely using only the Makefile or I need a separate script? Do you know some good examples of Makefiles to run tests? (I want to use Makefile + unittest + coverage only, and no other dependencies)
