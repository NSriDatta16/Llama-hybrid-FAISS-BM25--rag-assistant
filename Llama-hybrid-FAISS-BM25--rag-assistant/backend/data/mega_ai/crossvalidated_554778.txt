Country fixed effects and clustered robust standard errors for logistic regression

I'm wondering if in the same analysis I can use countries as fixed effect and as a cluster for the robust standard errors. Background: I'm running a multivariate logistic regression with the glm() package in R. My outcome variable is intimate partner violence and my predictors include income inequality, age, education, under 18y living at home, alcohol abuse, and violent behavior towards others . My supervisor said I should include clustered robust standard errors in my analysis and I do have 28 countries in my sample, therefore, my cluster is countries. Right now, I'm not very interested in what those differences are. My idea was to include country as dummy variables to account for country effects in the analysis. But since now I will use country as my cluster for the robust standard errors, I'm no longer sure if I need to use as the country effects as well. Can I use country as both fixed effects and as the cluster for my robust standard errors? Can someone please help me? Any answer or link to a material would be great.
