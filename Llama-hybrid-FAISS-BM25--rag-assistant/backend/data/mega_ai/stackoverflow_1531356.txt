Based on your comment, I've updated this to include the category name. Note that the query selects them into an anonymous object -- you can change that if you have an actual class with the properties by using the class constructor with property assignment instead. Note that I also gave the count a different name. As you already have a Pid, I thought pid, would be too confusing. var products = PTable.Select( p => new { Pid = p.Pid, Name = p.Name, DetailCount = p.Orderdetails.Count(), Category = p.PCATEGORY.CategoryName });
