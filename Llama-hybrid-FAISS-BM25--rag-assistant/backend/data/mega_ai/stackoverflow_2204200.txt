The way you are embedding the SWF object, it will automatically load and start playing (as you described). The general technique of delay loading or loading based on a click is to actually wrap the object HTML code in some javascript, and have it dynamically added to the DOM based on your click event. This is also how sites don't actually load or start playing a video file until it scrolls into view happens - instead of being bound the the click event, they hook up to some other visibility trigger. There are a bunch of SWF loader scripts on the internet, but in a nutshell you do something like this: Play File and the definition for playfile() function playfile() { // create the param and embed tags, set their values var param = document.createElement('param'); param.name = "movie"; param.value = "video.swf"; var embed = document.createElement('embed'); embed.src = "video.swf"; embed.quality = "high"; embed.bgcolor = "#333399"; embed.width = 320; embed.height = 240; embed.name = "video.swf"; // create the object tag and add the param and embed children var object = document.createElement('object'); object.width = 320; object.height = 240; object.appendChild(param); object.appendChild(embed); // add new element after A tag document.getElementById('player').appendChild(object); } This is completely rough and untested, and may not even work - but the idea is sound and should get you headed in the right direction. Best of luck!
