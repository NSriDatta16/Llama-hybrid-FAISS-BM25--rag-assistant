Well, I tried to do what you've told me guys, but compilator is complaining: 1>.\heroes are back!\dec.cpp(2) : error C4430: missing type specifier - int assumed. Note: C++ does not support default-int 1>.\heroes are back!\dec.cpp(4) : error C4430: missing type specifier - int assumed. Note: C++ does not support default-int 1>.\heroes are back!\dec.cpp(4) : error C2040: 'g_screen' : 'int' differs in levels of indirection from 'SDL_Surface *' Here is the dec.h #ifndef DEC_H #define DEC_H #include #include #pragma comment(lib, "SDL.lib") #pragma comment(lib, "SDLmain.lib") using namespace std; extern int g_win_flags; extern SDL_Surface *g_screen; #endif dec.cpp #include "dec.h" g_win_flags = SDL_HWSURFACE|SDL_DOUBLEBUF; g_screen = NULL; What is wrong in this code? Sorry for asking dumb questions, but I'm only learning C++ :)
