Do you have any touch-event handlers implemented in your MyViewController's code? It looks like your UIButton only receives touchesBegan event and the event gets cancelled by something before it could receive touchesEnded. Something like UIScrollView usually does when it's deciding between touch that needs to be forwarded to it's subviews and a drag that should be handled by itself.
