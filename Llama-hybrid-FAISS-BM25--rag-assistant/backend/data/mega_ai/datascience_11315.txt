How to model spatiotemporal data with ANN?

I have traffic jam intensity of many location in different times of eabch day. So I have kind of 3D data, where the intensities in each location is 2D like an image. Then there is time as a third dimension. Now, I want to predict traffic jam intensity at a give location and time. The intensity is from 0.0 to 10.0. high the intensity means high traffic jam. Example. Whats the jam intensity of X latitude and Y longitude on 3:45 PM? My question is how to feed that 3D data to my neural network? NB: both the time and location contextual data. The intensity of the traffic jam is behavioral.
