How do you reconcile a statistically insignificant logistic regression with a significant AUC?

Suppose I run logistic regression with one continuous predictor. The Wald tests of significance show a p-value that is not significant at the 5% level. Looking at the receiver operating characteristics curve though shows an AUC that is significant, with DeLong's method. How can I interpret these results?
