You could create a model to handle your eye-color logic: class EyeColor COLORS = ['blue','brown','hazel'] attr_accessor :color # Some logic methods... def is_brown? self.color == 'brown' end end Note: this model is not an Active Record model, but it does create an abstraction the real-world object you are trying to model. EDIT: I also like this approach as opposed to a global hash, because it gives it organizes your static definition within EyeColor instead of floating around in your program, which makes it clear where this definition is. EDIT: added question mark to predicate method.
