R plot density smoothed time series

I wish to make a probability distribution of some time series data. My data is in the following format 00:00, 3 01:00, 50 05:00, 13 10:00, 34 17:00, 80 21:00, 100 The time column has some missing values that R will have to interpolate. I want to get a nice smooth curve to highlight the busy periods. I have tried with ts , density and plot but these don't produce what I'm after. For example, data1 But this gives me lines drawn in crazy order and as a probability distribution.
