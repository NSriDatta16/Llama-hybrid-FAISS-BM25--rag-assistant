VC2010 Intellisense - auto-complete /full/ function declaration?

Every so often, in MSVC 2005/8, the erratic Intellisense would randomly decide to kick in and do something wondrous: auto-complete the ENTIRE declaration at once, while having laboriously been re-typing/selecting the function definition for the 1000th time. No, I wasn't drunk at the time. But I did see it happen occasionally--maybe 10 to 20 times in 2 years. More times than the average kook claims to have been given a welcoming committee by aliens. Tell me: Should I be on the lookout for extraterrestrials, or is this an actual phenomenon? Because, if this feature were real, and consistently reproducible, it would be THE BEST FEATURE EVER! Take note, VS devs! I don't care about member auto-completion; I know those anyway, and the squiggles are far better than auto-complete. I want my (fixed?) declaration auto-re-completion! Save my fingers from the injustice!
