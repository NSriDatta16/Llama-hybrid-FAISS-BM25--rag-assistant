You can not. For security reasons the browser only grants access to data stored with localStorage within the same domain. This is due to the fact, that on some systems different subdomains belong to different people / websites. See for example: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc197062(VS.85).aspx Each domain and subdomain has its own separate local storage area. Domains can access the storage areas of subdomains, and subdomains can access the storage areas of parent domains. For example, localStorage['example.com'] is accessible to example.com and any of its subdomains. The subdomain localStorage['www.example.com'] is accessible to example.com, but not to other subdomains, such as mail.example.com.
