document management systems for .net

I have a new requirement to build a document management section to our existing asp.net mvc 3 application. We wish append multiple files to products. The files will be very large 1gb and will be various file types. My question: are there any good .net libraries that offer some of the following good categorisation of files preferably asp.net mvc plugable into some kind of data storage like can manage large file some kind of ftp file upload option.
