I'm not a kernel person at all but I work with a lot of people who are very much into the kernel. They all recommend Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love as a good book on the subject. I've bought the book myself and plan to, in my copious free time, go through it. The Kernel Mentors mailing list related resources at http://kernelnewbies.org/KernelMentors is also a good place to look at.
