As you stated already, this comes down mostly to preference, but typically I would opt for the sorting to be done in the controller. I tend to keep my models purely about data storage and reduce the amount of functionality in them. So in your example, the model's job would be to hold all of the artists' data, and the controller's job would be to extract the artists starting with "A" from that data, and subsequently passing that sorted data to the view.
