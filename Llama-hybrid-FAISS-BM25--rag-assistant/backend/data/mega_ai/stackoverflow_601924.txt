I would say use the design that most makes sense given your data - in this case one large table. The records will all be the same type, with same columns, so from a database normalization standpoint they make sense to have them in the same table. An index makes selecting particular rows easy, especially when whole queries can be satisfied by data in a single index (which can often be the case). Note that visitor analysis will necessarily involve a lot of operations where there is no easy way to optimise other than to operate on a large number of rows at once - for instance: counts, sums, and averages. It is typical for resource intensive statistics like this to be pre-calculated and stored, rather than fetched live. It's something you would want to think about.
