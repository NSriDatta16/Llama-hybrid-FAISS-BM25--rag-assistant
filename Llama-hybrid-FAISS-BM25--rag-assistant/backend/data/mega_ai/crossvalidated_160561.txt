Imputation in R: How to impute univariate data in R?

I am trying classification(2 classes) using Random Forest. Classes are - Red, Green. My dataset contains 1 numeric attributes(called X), and 51 binary attributes to classify a document into red and green classes. However, 40% of the data points(observations) do not have value for numeric attribute X i.e. X is missing. Hence, trying to impute X. I tried using MI, MICE, and other variants(Hmisc, impute). But I did not find them working. Is it possible to impute when 40% of the data points are missing? How can one impute an attribute based on its class specific data points? Hmisc allows to use median, min, max etc - however, it is not class specific median - it imputes column wise median in NA's.
