What exactly I have to do is I have 2 images one is mask and another is Photo. Mask.png is just the layout of the person and Photo.png is the image of the person in the position as per the mask.png. Now the main problem is I want the Photo.png to be resized and moved in such a way that it can be adjusted in that Mask.png. below is the example of mask and Photo Now I want that red color must come on the below two legs of the star for that I need to move the Flowers image as per my convininece and then save them whole as one Image. Im my case theres a outlay of person instead of star and the Photo of person instead of flowers image. Kindly help... Any help would realy be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
