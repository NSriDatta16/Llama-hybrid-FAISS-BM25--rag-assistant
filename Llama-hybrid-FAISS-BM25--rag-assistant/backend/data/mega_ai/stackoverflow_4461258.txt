What tests should I create for unit testing a library that receives and parses XML?

I'm trying to get into the groove of TDD and I've decided to refactor my entire class library project that parses XML it receives from an exposed API. Now I'm stuck on what tests I should have. Can you recommend some tests I should have and also how to identify what I need to test for the future, basic rule of thumb? Thanks! using NUnit.Framework; namespace SharpDIC.Tests { [TestFixture] class MemberTests { [Test] public void Member_Should_Have_Required_Information() { } } }
