Treating zeros slightly differently for input in a glm / logistic regression

I have data that looks like this: df Simply, y can be thought of as the probability of "death" while x is the variable I would like to predict on. In order to fit a logistic regression to this data, I have to simulate the deaths based on the probability of death ( y ). I'm simulating because I don't want to fit a linear model on y ~ x... sim_death % rowwise() %>% mutate(death = as.integer(sim_death(y))) When I start to build a model it breaks down on the zero values and messes up the coefs. Clearly, there is some type of relationship (not exactly linear... but definitely positive) between x and y . But, it seems that x == 0 means something different, or rather increases the probability of death. How can I treat these zero values differently in my model while still capturing the positive relationship between x and y ?
