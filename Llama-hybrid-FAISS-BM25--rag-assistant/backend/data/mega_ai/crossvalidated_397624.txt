VAR order in Cointegration Test

I am studying Johansen's Test using Tsay's book (Multivariate Time Series Analysis). The book has given some sample results of function ca.jo in r package urca , which is a typical way to do cointegration test in r: m1 = VARorder(bnd) # summary table was suppressed. selected order: aic = 11 selected order: bic = 3 selected order: hq = 3 m2 = ca.jo(bnd, K = 2, ecdet = c("none")) ###################### # Johansen-Procedure # ###################### Test type: maximal eigenvalue statistic (lambda max) , with linear trend Eigenvalues (lambda): [1] 0.054773196 0.004665298 Values of teststatistic and critical values of test: test 10pct 5pct 1pct r Tsay has mentioned that given the information criteria has picked order 3 as the optimal order, the example will be using $VAR(3)$ in the Johansen's Test; however as we can see in the command it was using order 2, i.e. $K=2$ in ca.jo function. I don't think this is a typo. Does anyone know why it is of order 2 rather than order 3?
