In my team we've found that with maintenance projects (which is the bulk of what we do) where we're tweaking or replacing like with like there isn't always as much need for user input beyond perhaps some UI prototypes. In that case, particularly given that there are commercial deals involved the waterfall approach at a macro level can fit well. Even then we still like incremental / agile approaches at the implementation level. It is worth noting that most of our clients are large lumbering organisations in love with their paperwork, so that adds even more impetus for us to at least appear traditional to them.
