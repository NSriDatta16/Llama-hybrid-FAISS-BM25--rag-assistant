SSRS2008: LocalReport export to HTML / fragment

I need local RDL report to be exported to HTML, preferably HTML fragment. In 2005 it wasn't officially supported but there was a trick . In SSRS2008 they seem to drop this support (there's no HTML extension in the supported extensions when enumerating using reflection) and use RPL instead which is a binary format that I doubt someone will be happy to parse. Actually it's doesn't seem to be about HTML at all. Now, is there a way to render HTML using SSRS2008 local report? Notice that I use VS2008 but with reporting assemblies installed from VS2010 Beta 2 reportviewer.
