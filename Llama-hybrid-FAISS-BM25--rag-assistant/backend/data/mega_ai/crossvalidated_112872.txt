If I understand well, you use either PCA or PLS-DA as compression step and then use a k-nn like approach on the scores. The variables are lost in the calculations of the Mahalanobis distances, however you might have a look at their individual influence using the pseudo-samples approach initially proposed by Gower and used in metabolomics here and here . The use of kernels is equivalent to your Mahalanobis step.
