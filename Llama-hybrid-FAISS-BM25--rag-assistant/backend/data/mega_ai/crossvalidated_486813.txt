This is probably imprecise, but I believe this is probably accurate - establishes a lose upper bound. We begin by assuming there is exactly 1 item we've not yet seen in the population - we've seen $n$ , so we assume there are $n+1$ . We can calculate the odds of what we've currently seen given that assumption. Once those odds reach a threshold (say, 0.05), we can reject the hypothesis that there is a missing item with that confidence. If we've $n$ items from $m$ samples, we'd get the probability of missing an item as $\alpha=(n/(n+1))^m$ . If we've seen 3 items in 5 samples, this gives a probability of 0.237 that there is a 4th item. If we continue seeing only 3 items in 11 samples, the probability of a 4th item drops to 0.042. At a commonly accepted false positive rate of 0.05, we can stop sampling after 11 samples seeing only 3 items. Similarly, if we've found 50 items, we'd need 152 samples of them to be 95% confident there is not a 51st. At the $\alpha=0.05$ level, this simplifies to a heuristic of an average of approximately 3 samples per item. Solving for $m$ , $m=-(\log(1/0.05)/\log(n/(n+1)))$ . $\log(1/0.05) \approx 3$ , and $-1/\log(n/(n+1)) \approx n$ ; thus, $3n\approx m$ at $\alpha = 0.05$ . An open issue. Can we tighten this bound by factoring in the odds of $n+2$ through $n+\infty$ , or would their contribution be insignificant?
