How does WinForms label control handle focus?

Folks, There is a panel which contains 2 components: a label and a TreeView. The hierarchy, obviously, looks like this: panel1 // handles Enter event - label1 - treeView1 I need to do some UI updates when user starts interacting with any of these 3 controls. My attempted strategy was to catch the Enter event of the panel1 , which would fire when user clicks the label or the TreeView. This way, I would write only a single event handler instead of several. While it worked for the TreeView, it didn't work for the label. When I click the label, I don't get the Enter event on the panel. Whatâ€™s different about the label control? I could handle the Click event of the label. At the same time, I wonder if there is a more elegant solution. Any suggestion, insight or reference is really appreciated! - Nick P.S.
