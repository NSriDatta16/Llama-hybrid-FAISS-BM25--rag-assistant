Labelling a Time series dataset

I was asked this during an interview that I did not crack. You are given data of total (aggregated) power consumption, and the TV power consumption of three households. Each household has data for one day. Task 1: Using TV instantaneous power consumption data, identify the times when the TV is “ON”. Notice that some TVs may have standby modes. Task 2: Using all the data given, design a classifier to identify times when the TV is “ON”. You may also want to train and test your designed classifier. The trained classifier should not take TV instantaneous power as input. Please provide a script which attempts task 1 and 2. Please do not provide a script without explanations. Additional information: Data format in the attached .csv file: “House” column indicates which house it is, ranging from 1 to 3. “Time” column indicates time stamps. “TV” column indicates TV instantaneous power consumption. “Agg” column indicates total (aggregated) instantaneous power consumption. Sampling rate is 1/60 Hz. My submission is here. I did not receive any feedback from the employer and I don't know what went wrong. Please let me know your thoughts on what could have been done better.
