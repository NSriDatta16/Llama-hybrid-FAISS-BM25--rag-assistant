Weblogic remote debugging using eclipse

My Weblogic is installed in a Red hat OS machine. In the startWebLogic.sh i have added this line JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8888,server=y,suspend=n %JAVA_OPTIONS%" When I try to connect from my Eclipse I get a "Failed to connect to remote VM. Connection refused. Connection refused: connect" message. Can you please tell me where I may be going wrong?
