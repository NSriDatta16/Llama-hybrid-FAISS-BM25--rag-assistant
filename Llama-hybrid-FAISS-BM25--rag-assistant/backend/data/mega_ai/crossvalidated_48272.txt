The first question you can easily check yourself: can you reconstruct the original data from obects (scores) and axes (loadings)? Keep in mind that PCA usually centers as a first step. The knowledge gained from that will probably answer the rest of the questions as well. Second question: Sure you can give average and standard deviation. The question is: what is their meaning. And this I cannot answer, because I'm not sure about the direction of projection you propose: PCA is a coordinate transformation, so you have original axes and "new" axes... But acutally checking the calculations will probably make things clear for you. Thirdly, normalization can refer to different things. You need to clarify what you mean.
