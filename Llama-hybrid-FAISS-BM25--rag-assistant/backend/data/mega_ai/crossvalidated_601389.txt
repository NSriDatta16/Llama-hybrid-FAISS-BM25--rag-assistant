The correct interpretating a three-way interaction in a linear mixed model analysis

Context The purpose of this analysis is to examine sex differences in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) scores in Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) patients who are starting their first Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitor (TNFi) treatment over a two-year follow-up period. The BASFI score consists of ten domains, so a secondary research question is to determine if there are sex-based differences in these domains over time. Population : axSpA patients initiating first TNFi Dependent variable : BASFI-score (scale 0-100, higher is worse) Independent variables of interest : sex, sex:time, and sex:time:domains Data-structure The data is organized such that each patient's ID is recorded 40 times (10 times for each domain at four different time points). A 4-level structure analysis was conducted to account for correlations between components of the composite score, repeated measurements within subjects, and subjects within countries. Time is coded as a numeric variable with one unit representing one year. Here is a peek inside the dataset to further clarify how the data is structured: ## ID time domain gender basfi ## 1 1 0.0 1 Male NA ## 2 1 0.0 2 Male NA ## 3 1 0.0 3 Male NA ## 4 1 0.0 4 Male NA ## 5 1 0.0 5 Male NA ## 6 1 0.0 6 Male NA ## 7 1 0.0 7 Male NA ## 8 1 0.0 8 Male NA ## 9 1 0.0 9 Male NA ## 10 1 0.0 10 Male NA ## 11 1 0.5 1 Male NA ## 12 1 0.5 2 Male NA ## 13 1 0.5 3 Male NA ## 14 1 0.5 4 Male NA ## 15 1 0.5 5 Male NA ## 16 1 0.5 6 Male NA ## 17 1 0.5 7 Male NA ## 18 1 0.5 8 Male NA ## 19 1 0.5 9 Male NA ## 20 1 0.5 10 Male NA ## 21 1 1.0 1 Male 0 ## 22 1 1.0 2 Male 0 ## 23 1 1.0 3 Male 0 ## 24 1 1.0 4 Male 0 ## 25 1 1.0 5 Male 0 ## 26 1 1.0 6 Male 0 ## 27 1 1.0 7 Male 0 ## 28 1 1.0 8 Male 0 ## 29 1 1.0 9 Male 0 ## 30 1 1.0 10 Male 0 Structure of the covariates: ## 'data.frame': 391200 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ country : Factor w/ 12 levels "CH","CZ","DK",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ gender : Factor w/ 2 levels "Male","Female": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ ID : Factor w/ 9780 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ basfi : num NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ... ## $ time : num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ domain : Factor w/ 10 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...

This indicates that females have lower overall BASFI scores than males. The effect of gender:time is also significant, strong, and positive (1.93, p-value Question : The effect of gender:time:domain is significant for domains 3, 6, 7, and 10, with effect sizes ranging from -1.5 to -2.1. All of these effects have a negative direction, with domain 1 serving as the reference category. This result suggests that the magnitude of the sex differences in these domains changes over time. Based on this information, is it possible to determine if the magnitude of the sex differences in BASFI over time increases in domains 3,6,7, and 10 compared to domain 1? Or does it decrease? Is another interpretation more appropriate? EDIT : The purpose of coding time as a numeric variable in our model is to examine the potential linear relationship between time and the outcome variable (BASFI). By considering time as a continuous variable, we aim to investigate if any sex differences in the BASFI exist over the entire 24-month follow-up period, rather than being limited to specific time points. Additionally, we included interaction terms between time and gender in the model to explore whether the effect of gender on the BASFI changes over time. To account for the correlation between the components/domains of the BASFI over time, time was also added with random intercept.
