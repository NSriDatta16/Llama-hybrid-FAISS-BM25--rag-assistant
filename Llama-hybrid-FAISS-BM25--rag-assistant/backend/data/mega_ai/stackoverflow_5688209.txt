Yes. The name attribute contains CDATA . It can be more or less anything you like. (You shouldn't include leading or tailing white space because user agents can ignore it, but white space in the middle is fine). Note that name attributes do not have NAME tokens as their data type (although the id attribute does (the id attribute doesn't take an ID token)), so you don't have the restrictions imposed on NAME tokens.
