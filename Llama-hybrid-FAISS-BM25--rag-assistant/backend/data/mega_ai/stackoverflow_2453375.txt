IE8 corrupting the script src?

I have a page that includes a dynamic js-script depending on the page I'm visiting. However, I'm getting errors in my log from some IE8-visitors, where it seems like the actual request-url is completely mangled for the mentioned script. This is what it should fetch: which translates to /sv/5/outlet?partial=filterjs&json=true&viewall However, looking in my logs, I see stuff like: /sv/5/outlet?partial=filterjs&json=truepor It seems to truncate the url, and append random stuff from the actual markup that comes later on (way later on, in fact, although approx at the same offset) I first thought it had something to do with the new XSS-filter that IE8 implemented, but tried disabling it using the HTTP-header X-XSS-Protection: 0 Without success. I cannot reproduce this error on my own machine either, however this happens several times a day (on a site with approx 3000 visits per day). This is happening on both XP, Vista and Win7 according to the user-agent (NT 5.1, 6.0 and 6.1). Anyone recognize this behaviour?
