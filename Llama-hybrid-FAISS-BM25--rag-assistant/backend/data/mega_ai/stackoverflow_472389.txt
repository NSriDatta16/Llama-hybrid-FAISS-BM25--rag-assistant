How can I receive the "scroll box" type scroll events from a DataGridView?

I have a DataGridView, and I'm listening to its Scroll event. This gives me a ScrollEventArgs object whose Type member is supposed to tell me the type of scroll event that has occurred. On the MSDN documentation page it says I should be able to detect movement of the scroll box by listening for events with types ThumbPosition, ThumbTrack, First, Last and EndScroll. However, when I drag the scroll box, I only get events of type LargeDecrement and LargeIncrement. How do I get access to the ThumbPosition, ThumbTrack, First, Last and EndScroll events?
