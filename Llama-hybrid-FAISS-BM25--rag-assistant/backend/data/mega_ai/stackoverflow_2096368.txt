Daylight Saving Time in Javascript for 1974?

"During the "energy crisis" years, Congress enacted earlier starting dates for daylight time. In 1974, daylight time began on 6 January and in 1975 it began on 23 February. After those two years the starting date reverted back to the last Sunday in April. " (via http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/daylight_time.php ) There appears to be a bug in the Javascript date object for these dates. If you convert 127627200000 milliseconds to a date, it should be Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 EDT 1974. This is correct on http://www.fileformat.info/tip/java/date2millis.htm , but incorrect on http://www.esqsoft.com/javascript_examples/date-to-epoch.htm , which says it converts to Wed Jan 16 1974 23:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time). If you create a new Date(127627200000) object in javascript, it gives the latter date conversion. This happens in all major browsers. I can't imagine this is first time this has been a problem for anyone, but I can't find any other cases of this problem with a few searches online. Does anyone know if there is an existing fix for this or an easier fix than manually checking the dates Javascript has the conversion wrong? Are there other dates this is a problem?
