Logistic regression Wald statistic

I have to do a logistic regression analysis. I'm attempting to understand which variables I am taking out of a model. I am doing a simple hypothesis test to understand whether I should keep an independent variable in my model or not. Would I be right in saying to test the significance level with the Wald distribution you have to see whether the p-value is higher than a 0.025 significance as we are doing a two-sided test (because we are testing whether the coefficient is non-zero)?
