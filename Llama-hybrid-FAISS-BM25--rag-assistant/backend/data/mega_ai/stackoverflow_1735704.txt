Installed VS2008 (Pro) and SP1 on Win7 (Pro) Retail full version. Frankly there are nightmare issues and I'm considering going back ti XP for a while. Developing MFC C++: Issues: VS2008 Add Exisiting Item to Project. The File Dialog does not allow Ctrl+ Left Click to select more than one file at a time. SO it becomes a real PITA to add 10 files to a project. Open .rc file from another project no longer allows drag and drop to current project rc file. In fact it crashes VS2008 every time. I tired 3 times. This feature has worked and does work on VS2008 on XP and all previous VS all the way back to VS4 Win7: Using file open dialog does not allow use of the mouse wheel, and if I click in the file listing view the stupid single click opens a file I don't want so I have to use the stupid VScroll bar. Win7: After fighting all the "Access Denied" crap and getting it setup somewhat the way I like to use Windows it seems to be reasonable when running the few other programs I've installed so far. I guess I'm just fighting the learning curve as I bypassed Vista. I can't say I see much difference in speed comapred to XP it's the same. My hardware is reasonable (dual (dual core) Xeon 2.8GHz gobs of mem and hd space etc.etc.)
