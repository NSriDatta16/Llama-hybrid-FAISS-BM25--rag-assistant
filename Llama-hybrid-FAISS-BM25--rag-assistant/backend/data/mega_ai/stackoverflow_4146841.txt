Answer is very simple: attribute value should be a constant, not an expression. Change [Timeout(10*60*1000)] to [Timeout(600000)] resolved an issue. EDIT: Comment to the answer brought to my attention a mistake I've done originally in the answer (wrote "60000" as timeout value). In my source code I have 6000000 and that value helped. the answer was corrected recently
