Is there any Design centric guide for Django, or a set of Templates that are ready and useable? Django templates alone aren't that much reusable, since their are tied to specific views and variables defined in that views. In my personal experience, I found templating still rapid with an average size of my templates around 50 lines. Of course, this application wasn't heavy on the UI. Inheritance and fragments will save you from repetition. Inheritance: {% extends base.html %} Fragments: {% for location in locations %} {% include "_location_item.html" %} {% endfor %} I don't want to start from scratch using JS, HTML5, Ajax and everything. Well, at a point, you'll start from scratch. Version-control your project, so you could extract intermediate states for the coming project, if appropriate, use efficient libraries like jQuery to write less , and do more , use some CSS scaffolding tool like blueprintcss . I agree that there is an overhead at the beginning of a project. My justification of that overhead so far has been the fact, that the UI wasn't a modified template (like modified typo3 or so templates, hence more tailored to the applications needs), that it was fast and looked good in the end, too.
