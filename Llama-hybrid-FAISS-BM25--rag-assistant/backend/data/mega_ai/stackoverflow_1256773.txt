WCF service with dual methods - one for structured results and one for raw XML results. Is there a better way?

I'm designing a WCF web service method that can return results either as a raw XML string, or as a structure, depending on the client's preference. A simple approach is to have two separate methods: MyStructure GetData(); string GetDataAsXML(); This should work fine, but given that the wire representation in both cases will be the same (or at least equivalent), I'm wondering if there's a better way to represent this in the interface? Is there an elegant way I can merge the two methods into one, for example?
