I very much doubt the global keyword will ever be dropped from PHP, as it would require a massive rewrite for many, many applications and PHP has always been big on backward compatibility. Also, different from real kludges like magic quotes, global is, even though discouraged, a valid language construct. As far as I'm aware, there are no concrete plans or even serious discussions about it. That said, it is generally a good thing not to use it, and work with function parameters or class properties instead.
