This doesn't sound like the kind of data you should actually store, by how often you'd have to update it - once every single time you modify the house table in any way! That's a lot of unnecessary load on the database, and a whole lot of room for human error. Instead, I recommend acquiring it on the fly through a SQL query when you need it, and never actually storing it. Retrieving from all areas: SELECT `area`, AVG(`price`) AS `average_price` FROM `house` GROUP BY `area` ORDER BY `average_price` ASC Retrieving from a specific area: SELECT `area`, AVG(`price`) AS `average_price` FROM `house` WHERE `area` = "New York" GROUP BY `area`
