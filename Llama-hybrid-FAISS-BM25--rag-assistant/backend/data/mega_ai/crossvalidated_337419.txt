Meta analysis of test scores in range [0,100]

We have multiple studies of certain test scores which range from 0-100 which we would like to meta-analyze. For each subject within a study a score may vary within this range, however we only have the average test score per study and the number of subjects that took this test. How can we meta-analyze this using the metafor package in R? I am inclined to use meta-analysis for proportions for this, since you can divide the score by 100 and obtained a proportion which is clearly bounded by 0 and 1 (which is necessary for this data) with escalc(measure="PLO",xi=events,ni=n,data = df); . However this method requires an event count which we don't have since individual test scores are not dichotomous. I can, however, estimate xi by multiplying the mean score per study by the sample size. Is this ok? Or should we use a different method?
