User interface issues regarding embedded PDFs

Q.1. What are the advantages and disadvantages, from a usability standpoint, of embedding PDFs in a web page? Q.2. In general, for the average computer user, which scenario provides the most "streamlined" experience? Q.3. Would using cookies to remember the options substantially improve Scenario #2? Scenario #1 User sets options. User clicks a Report button. PDF is sent as an attachment (to Save or Open). Advantages The options don't get reset. Disadvantages The PDF can obstruct the web page. The user might leave too many PDF windows open (slowing system performance). Scenario #2 User sets options. User clicks a Report button. PDF is embedded in the page. User clicks back and the options will have been reset (AJAX, no cookies). Advantages The results appear immediately (no extra clicks). Disadvantages Not all browsers support embedding PDFs (?). The web page (i.e., the Report button) disappears. Thank you!
