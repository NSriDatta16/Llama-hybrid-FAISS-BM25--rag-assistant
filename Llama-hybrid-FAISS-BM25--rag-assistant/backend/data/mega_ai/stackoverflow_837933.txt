This is not a trivial task; one option might be to use signed code, which you could leverage to access the registry and/or filesystem (please note that this is a very expensive option). There is also no unified API or specification for code signing, so you would be required to generate specific code for each target browser. A support nightmare. Also, I know that Steam , the gaming content delivery system, doesn't seem to have this problem solved either.
