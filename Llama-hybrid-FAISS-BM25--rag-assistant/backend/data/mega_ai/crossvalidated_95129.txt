Passes means exactly what you say. The logistic regression module in mahout uses stochastic gradient descent to train, which means it goes through the data points one at a time, starting over when it reaches the end, until convergence. Number of passes is the number of times it has to start over. Features does mean the variables used as predictors. I don't know what you mean by people entering more or less at times. Logistic regression in machine learning is exactly the same as logistic regression in statistics. Literally they are exactly the same. You can use regularization to select variables, or you can take them one by one using some metric (such as AIC, BIC, etc...) but you ahve to calculate them yourself if you're using mahout. It wont' do that for you (AFAIK). Multicolinearity is dealt with in ML by, one hopes, having enough data. If you're so inclined you can calculate a VIF and use that, but if I recall correctly that is not trivial in the case of a logistic model. Finally, if you want that text string at the bottom to be of any help you will need to provide some context about what exactly that is supposed to be.
