"Fully Bayesian" vs "Bayesian"

I have been learning about Bayesian statistics, and I often have read in articles "we adopt a Bayesian approach" or something similar. I also noticed, less often: "we adopt a fully Bayesian approach" (my emphasis). Is there any difference between these approaches in any practical or theoretical sense ? FWIW, I am using the package MCMCglmm in R in case that is relevant.
