Infragistics ASP.NET WebMenu Styling?

Can anyone please recommend a company who styles Infragistics for ASP.NET controls? Is there even a company who does that? A friend needs to style a webmenu like a sample css menu and neither he or I are that good at CSS to get it 100% right. If anyone knows who might be able to do this, please suggest. Thanks.
