So we face a similar problem when dealing with Word Embedding. There we generate co-relations of words with each other and then using the generated relations, try to predict the related words. I should say that there could be a statistical way to check the your assumption, but I would rather try and code my idea to check its correctness by checking it on some test-set. This way, we can narrow down our approach's drawbacks and then think in that specific direction. Whenever we have correlated data, we use algorithm like t-SNE for dimensionality reduction. You can then easily visualize it or use it in any way as per you requirement.
