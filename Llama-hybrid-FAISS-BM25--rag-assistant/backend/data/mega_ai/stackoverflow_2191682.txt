It sounds to me like you have two different kinds of statistics that you want to model, fan speed ( Fanspeed ) and temperatute ( Temps ). If there is some common functionality that you want share between them create common base class for them lets call it Statistic for example. class Statistic(object): def average(self): pass # your logic to calculate the average here class Fanspeed(Statistic): pass # your fan speed functionaly here class Temps(Statistic): pass # your temperature functionaly here
