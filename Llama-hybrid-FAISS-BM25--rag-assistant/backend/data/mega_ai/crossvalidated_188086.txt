Georgia Tech has recently released a reinforcement learning course that covers this in a section called "Generalization." See also Gordon's paper "Stable function approximation in dynamic programming" , and Ladoukis & Parr's paper on least-squares policy iteration . You may also find value in the BURLAP continuous-domain tutorials . ( BURLAP is a Java library "for the use and development of single or multi-agent planning and learning algorithms and domains to accompany them.") In particular, the lunar lander example uses SARSA($\lambda$).
