If you do not want to hit your DB again, cache the results of the initial query in RAM in your Action class (reference a static cache somewhere). Also, you don't have to go with a cache-all-or-nothing approach -- you can cache the first N pages and then when you near the end of the cache, fetch the rest. If you do it right, you can maintain minimum RAM footprint but preserve a snappy user experience that leverages user think time (depends on your app).
