Running Zend Framework from within a folder with .htaccess rules

Greetings. Basically, I'm trying to run a Zend Framework application (multiple of them, actually) from within folders -- but without specifying the public directory. I know this sounds dirty but I have my reasons so it's outside the scope of my question. For example, this may be one of my ZF "installs": http://www.myurl.com/project1/ (Others may be at /project2/, etc.) I'm using the standard ZF directory structure. I'm also familiar with the various methods of placing an .htaccess in the project folder to redirect traffic to /public/ that is often used for shared hosting environments with Zend Framework -- the problem is that when your project root isn't the base URL, it doesn't seem to work. Specifically, if I place the following .htaccess file in /project1/ RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$0 [L] I get a ZF error page stating: Invalid controller specified (project1) So it seems to think that the folder name is a controller. I get the same problem if I use the more lengthy solution explained here: http://www.alberton.info/zend_framework_mod_rewrite_shared_hosting.html (Obviously, I replace the paths with paths that contain "my" path, ie. /project1/) Any help is much appreciated!
