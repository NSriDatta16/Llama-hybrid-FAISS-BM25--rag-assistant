Database maintenance, big binary table optimization

i have a huge database, around 1 TB in size, most of the space is consumed by a table which stores images, the tables has right now almost 800k rows. server response time has increased, i would like to know which techniques should i use or you recomend, partitioning? o how to reorganize the table every row is accessed by the image id column, and it has its clustered index by that column, and every two days i reorganize the index and every 7 days i rebuild it, but it seems not to be working any suggestions?
