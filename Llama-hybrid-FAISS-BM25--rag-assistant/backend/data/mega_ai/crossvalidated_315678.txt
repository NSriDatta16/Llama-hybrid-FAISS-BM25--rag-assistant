It seems clear that your goal is to compare the potential outcomes of cooperative farmers were they to receive certification and were they not to. The individual farmers are unrelated to your causal question (but they may provide information in the analysis). So, any analysis that would allow you to compare the potential outcomes in those circumstances would be adequate. Whether you should use regression, propensity score methods, or IV depends on the assumptions you are willing to make. If you have a good instrument for certification, then IV may be a good option. Knowledge of being certified would not be a good instrument because it is an effect of certification, and an instrument must be a cause of certification. A plausible instrument might be whether farmers received a pamphlet encouraging them to certify. If you have enough variables in your data set to account for confounding (i.e., all common causes of certification and total income), then you can use regression or propensity score methods to estimate the effect of certification.
