Is margin of error truly valid at extreme proportions? Such as 1% agreement, mere traces of data

Survey margin of error contracts as the proportions become more extreme. Its validity and applicability in such cases has always concerned me, but I suppose much depends on the context. Where we have mere traces of data on one side, an extreme proportion such a 1% vs 99% opinion in a survey, can we validly assert that the MoE is only 0.6 points? At a certain level of wispiness, I assume we have to consider errant clicks (online survey), reading errors, other forms of measurement error, etc. as overwhelming our ability to speak of the 1% responses as substantively real or validly refer to the MoE. (Sample size 1145. 10 respondents on one side and 1135 on the other.) What's best practice in such cases? The known population rate on the question is 6% vs 94% at minimum, often much higher than 6% depending on the country (known in the sense of repeated random samples by reputable polling organizations.) How would the known population figures enter into an assessment of MoE for the 1% sample? I don't see much in the literature, and the formulae don't seem to take known population proportions into consideration. Ch-square will tell us the 1% sample is significantly different from any other survey we'd compare it to, but otherwise I don't know what we could say about the MoE for the new sample. Ideas?
