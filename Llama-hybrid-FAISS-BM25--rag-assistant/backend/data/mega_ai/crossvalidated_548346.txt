Pooling Two Samples to a Single Sample

Let us say we draw 10 sample values from a given (continuous) population. However, the values tend to be very different than expected, so that we suspect that there might have been an error with the measurement method. Therefore, we draw again 10 values in seemingly the same way. Yet, the values of the second sample tend to be similar. Is it now justifiable to pool the two samples to a single sample with a sample size of 20, and if so, how exactly can this be justified? Let us say we use a T- or a Mann-Whitney-U-Test in order to test whether there are significant differences between the two samples. The result is that the two samples do not differ significantly. Yet, even if we cannot reject the null hypothesis, this not a proof that the two sample come indeed from the same population (and can be pooled). Instead, one could conduct an equivalence test (parametric or non-parametric). If we can reject the null-hypothesis, we were able to show that the average differences between the sample are within a certain bound. Yet, strictly speaking this is not a proof either, since there is always an error probability. I have learned that statistical tests can never fully proof that two samples come from the same distribtuion. So one could make the case that statistical testing is the wrong approach here. However, to me it seems also hard to deny that the fact that we were able to show that the two samples are singnificantly similar increased the confidence in the correctness of the measurements. Could statistical testing somehow help to justify pooling the two samples?
