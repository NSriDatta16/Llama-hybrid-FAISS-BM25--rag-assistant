Register a global hook to detect whether mouse dragging files/text

I know it's possible to register global hooks for mouse movement, button clicks, scroll, etc, but I was wondering if there's any way to detect whether the user is actually dragging a file or text (or some other content) with a global hook. Can't seem to find anything on this.
