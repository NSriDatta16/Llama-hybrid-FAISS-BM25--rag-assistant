Step-wise Bayesian updating as a prior selection strategy

There is a famous principle in Bayesian that says: 'Yesterday’s posterior is today’s prior'. Lindley (2000) . Now, suppose there are three studies conducted chronologically. Based on Lindley's (2000) principle , is it possible to use a wide prior for the oldest study, and then use its posterior as prior for the study after it and so on to arrive at one final posterior for the most recent study? Is this a good prior selection strategy for the most recent study? P.S. In my mind as a non-stat, non-math person, somehow the above idea mixes up with meta-analysis, so are the above strategy and meta-analysis different?
