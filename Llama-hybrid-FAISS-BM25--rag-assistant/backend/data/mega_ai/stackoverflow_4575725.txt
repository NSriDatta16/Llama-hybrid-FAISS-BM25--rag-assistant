query an XML file using PHP

Using PHP5 is there a way to query an XML file similar to querying a database? If I had an XML file with 50 hotel entries, how could I query the XML file to get a specific entry? Also could I reorganize the XML entries by field such as a date field? So if I wanted to display the entries in descending date order could I do that?
