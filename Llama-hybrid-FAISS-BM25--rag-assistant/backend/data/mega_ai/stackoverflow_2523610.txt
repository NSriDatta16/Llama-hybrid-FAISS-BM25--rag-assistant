From http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/interactive/ddl-schemas.html There are several reasons why one might want to use schemas: *To allow many users to use one database without interfering with each other. *To organize database objects into logical groups to make them more manageable. *Third-party applications can be put into separate schemas so they do not collide with the names of other objects. Schemas are analogous to directories at the operating system level, except that schemas cannot be nested.
