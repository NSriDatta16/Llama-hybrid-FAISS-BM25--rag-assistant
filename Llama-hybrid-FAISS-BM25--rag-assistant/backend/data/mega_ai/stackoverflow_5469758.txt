Sounds like you need to think of Magento terminology 'stores' or 'websites' - with 'stores' you can have lots of them on the same SSL, sharing the same checkout. However, if you have built your sites with 'websites' then you cannot have them all go to the same checkout and you will need multiple IP addresses. It is relatively simple to move your hosting to a VPS that supports more than one IP address, although check before you leap. It is also possible to move your 'stores' to a single 'website' in Magento.
