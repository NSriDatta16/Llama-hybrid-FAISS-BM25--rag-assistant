How to check whether my custom hashing is good in hash_map?

I've written a custom hashing for my custom key in stdext::hash_map and would like to check whether the hasher is good. I'm using STL supplied with VS 2008. A typical check, as I know, is to check the uniformity of distribution among buckets. How should I organize such a check correctly? A solution that comes to my mind is to modify STL sources to add a method to hash_map that walks through buckets and does the subject. Is there are any better ways? Maybe, derive from hash_map and create there such method?
