As explained in How can I use ClearCase to “add to source control …” recursively? , you have to use clearfsimport which does what you are saying (checkout the parent directories, mkelem for the elements) clearfsimport -preview -rec -nset c:\sourceDir\ChildDirectory5 m:\MyView\MyVob\ParentDirectory Note the : -preview option: it will allow to check what would happen without actually doing anything. '*' used only in Windows environment, in order to import the content of a directory -nset option (see my previous answer about nset). I would recommend dynamic view for those initialization phases where you need to import a lot of data: you can quickly see what your view looks like without making any update (like "without updating your workspace"): ClearCase allows to access the data in two ways: snapshot view (like a SVN workspace, except all the .svn are actually externalized in a view storage outside the workspace) dynamic view: all your files are visible through the network (instant access/update)
