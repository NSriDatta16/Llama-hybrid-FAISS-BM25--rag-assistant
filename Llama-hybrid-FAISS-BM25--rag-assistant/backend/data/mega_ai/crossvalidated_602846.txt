How to use CFA in R to justify averiging of Likert scale and further calculation

I am currently writing a paper for school and currently have 3 sections of questionnaire questions based on the Likert scale, where each section has 4 questions that I need to group together. Further, I need to use ordinal logistic regression and using averaged Likert scale as the dependent variable and treatment (factor) as the independent. My Professor asked me to do CFA, to justify that all questions are equally present in the averaging results. So far, I did CFA with the general concept to prove that every 4 questions measure the same concept (ability =~ q1+q2+q3+q4). However, I am not sure how to move further. Whether, this justifies the averaging, whether I could use the latent factors computed by CFA further (eg. doing ANOVA), whether there is a possibility to add the treatments to this model, or what exactly the correct approach should be. Thanks for your help!
