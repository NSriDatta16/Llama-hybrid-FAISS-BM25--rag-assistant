No it's completely outrageous. You call yourself a programmer? My God, man. When I started out, I could fit fifteen applications on a single punch card (that I had to punch with a pair of rusty toenail clippers, btw). They all completed within fifteen CPU cycles and actually CREATED memory out of nothing. You should be ASHAMED. Resign at once.
