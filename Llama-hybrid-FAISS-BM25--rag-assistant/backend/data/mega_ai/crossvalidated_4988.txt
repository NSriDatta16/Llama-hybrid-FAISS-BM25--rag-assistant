Asymmetry between high order and low order interaction terms

Suppose we have a distribution for $\mathbf{x}\in \{-1,1\}^n$ and are interested in representing $p(\mathbf{x})$ as a linear exponential family with sufficient statistics of the form $1,x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_1 x_2,\ldots,x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n$ Suppose we know that entropy some measure of complexity of target distribution is bounded. We can view the parameter vector as a probability distribution $D$ . Can we say anything about how the mass in $D$ is distributed among terms of various orders for some interesting complexity measure? Are there complexity measures that force mass onto low-order terms? Restricting attention to graphical models means discarding 3rd and higher order terms. I'm interested in some explanation why this works so well This was motivated by a similar question on CSTheory Edit 11/29 Below is the probability simplex of of distributions over $\{-1,1\}$ valued $x_1,x_2$ , in "probability" coordinates and in "log-linear" coordinates. In second picture, x,y axes correspond to coefficients in front of $x_1$ and $x_2$ , z axis is the coefficient of $x_1 x_2$ term. You can see first and second order dimensions are symmetric, so bounding entropy (or any other symmetric function of distribution) is not enough to force mass onto low-order coefficients....
