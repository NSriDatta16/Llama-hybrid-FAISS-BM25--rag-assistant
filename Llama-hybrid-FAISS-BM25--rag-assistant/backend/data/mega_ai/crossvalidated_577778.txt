What is the phenomenon I'm observing here?

I was looking at the St. Petersburg paradox and wanted to make a quick simulation to see the results. I made a quick program simulating 1 Billion "games" and the average of the gain (over several runs) was around 30/40. Quite low. My guess would be that the theoretical "Infinite" gain that could be made out of this game is out of reach for only 1 Billion games. Is this correct? My next step was to try to see how a variation of the paradox would behave. My variation is basically putting a limit to the number of flips allowed and see what the results could be. As an example if the maximum number was 3, the game would become "flip a coin, if head you win 1, if tail flip again. If head you win 2, if tail flip again. If head you win 4, if tail you win 0". For a low number of maximum flips I was expecting to reach the theoretical results (5 max flip -> 5 max gain), while for higher numbers I was expecting a more and more chaotic result. This is indeed what happens. Up to 28 flips or so the gain grows quite linearly, then it becomes more chaotic. So far so good, I think. Now I got more curious to know if it was somehow possible to quantify this chaotic behavior and my (quite limited) knowledge in statistics made me think of considering the standard deviation of the results. My Expectation here would have been to see a growing standard deviation. This is instead what I got: While initially there is a slow and reasonable increase of the standard deviation, then it completely blows up and becomes meaningless as well. At this point I'm a bit lost for what statistical tools can be used to described the results I'm seeing here. So my questions would be: Why is the standard deviation so chaotic? What are tools can explain the results? What are some better ways to quantify the randomness of the results as the maximum number of flips increases? Bonus question: Is there a theoretical way to calculate the number of total games I should play for a specific number of maximum flips in order to get a "reasonable" (as in what the theory would predict) result with a specific confidence?
