If I remember correctly, window.location.reload() reloads the current page with POST data, while window.location.href=window.location.href does not include the POST data. As noted by @W3Max in the comments below, window.location.href=window.location.href will not reload the page if there's an anchor (#) in the URL - You must use window.location.reload() in this case. Also, as noted by @Mic below, window.location.reload() takes an additional argument skipCache so that with using window.location.reload(true) the browser will skip the cache and reload the page from the server. window.location.reload(false) will do the opposite, and load the page from cache if possible.
