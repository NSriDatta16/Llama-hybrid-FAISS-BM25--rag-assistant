Application Cache Manifest + Local Storage Size Limit

I'm building an application that might have heavy offline storage needs, and I was wondering if it's possible to use both an offline cache manifest (5MB) as well as localstorage (5MB) to be able to use 10MB of storage. Note that this is an intranet application, so we have control of the devices.
