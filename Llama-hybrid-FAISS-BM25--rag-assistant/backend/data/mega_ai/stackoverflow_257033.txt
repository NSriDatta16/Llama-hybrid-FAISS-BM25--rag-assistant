As of 10-11-2008, there is a version at http://www.songbeamer.com/delphi/ of Orpheus as well. The following comments are attached: This is based on the version from CVS. The first two packages compile and are partly tested. Some asm code still needs updating. Some bugfixing also need to be found and fixed. Contributions are welcome (use the contact form on the top). Search for "FIXME" in the source. Files that may need special attention and bugfixes: OVCDRPVW.PAS, OVCPF.PAS, OVCEDITU.PAS, OVCVIEWR.PAS, OVCSTR.PAS
