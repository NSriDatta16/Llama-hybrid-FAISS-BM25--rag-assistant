Database and model setup in Ruby On Rails

I'm pretty new to database setup in Ruby and need help in setting it up correctly along with the models. Can anyone help? Basically I have an Organisation, which will have at least 2 types of Users - Member and Admin User. Both the Organisations and the Users have an Address. I was thinking this was basically three tables - Organisation, User and Address, but then got really confused when trying think about models and foreign keys. Can anyone suggest the best way to organise this? I'm running Rails 3 with a mySql database. Thanks for your time Sniffer
