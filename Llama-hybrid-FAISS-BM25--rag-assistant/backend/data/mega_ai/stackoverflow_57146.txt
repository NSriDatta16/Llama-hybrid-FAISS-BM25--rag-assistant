As a general point, I'd recommend abstracting the implementation of your settings into a 'Settings Provider' and provide different providers for each platform. That way, you can implement the storage of the settings in the manner that best suits the target platforms (for example, a file on Linux or the Windows Registry). Don't simply adopt the 'lowest common denominator'. Where you have content that must be explicity stored in files, have your settings provider expose the platform-specific location for those files.
