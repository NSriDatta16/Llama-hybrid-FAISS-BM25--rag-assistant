Best reference for using confidence intervals in lieu of p-values

I am working on a high profile manuscript which will go into a journal oriented on translational or medical science. In the paper, several ROC curves have been presented to show the performance of machine learning models in detecting a particular disease. As estimates of the performance, I have given AUC values and confidence intervals; p-values have been added to a supplementary table. I now have been criticized for "unconventional" presentation and "using latest guidelines", which was, for me, surprising. I thought that showing CI's when estimating was the convention and has been for a while (decades?) now, and many better and more "unconventional" replacements for CI have been proposed. The argument is, we should use the p-values, because that is what the reviewers expect. I think that this is incorrect, since we are showing estimates, rather than results of planned comparisons. What would you recommend? If CI, than what recommendations / papers should I present in favor of this view?
