Auto-regression versus linear regression of x(t)-with-t for modelling time series

What difference precisely does autoregression (for AR(p), p=1,2,...) have when compared to linear regression of that time series random variable w.r.t time axis? Explanation with diagrams clarifying the practical and conceptual differences would be very much appreciated. How does the variable being stochastic make any difference? Why can't we use regular Machine Learning techniques for time series?
