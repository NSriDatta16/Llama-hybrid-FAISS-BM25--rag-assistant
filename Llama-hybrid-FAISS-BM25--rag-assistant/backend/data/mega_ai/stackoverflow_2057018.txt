SQL Server datatype precision - Neo, what is real?

SQL Sever 2000 documentation : Is a floating point number data with the following valid values: â€“3.40E + 38 through -1.18E - 38, 0 and 1.18E - 38 through 3.40E + 38. Storage size is 4 bytes. In SQL Server, the synonym for real is float(24). SQL Server 2005 documentation : The ISO synonym for real is float(24). EDIT: Given what I am reading it says the precision is 7 but I can enter in my database(SQL Server 2005) max of 9 see below, as similarly stated here question no. 7. Example: 0.180000082 What is the true precision of real and are there configuration options(ie:compatibility modes) that can affect the precision?
