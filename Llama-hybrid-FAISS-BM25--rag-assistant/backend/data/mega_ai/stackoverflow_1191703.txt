free javascript widget to show an organigram chart

I'm looking for a javascript widget to show some fairly complex graphes... Ideally, it would be interactive, that is the user should be able to move around the nodes, select one or many, zoom in, click on a node to see more info, etc... If it could have printing support, that would be marvelous... The idea is to let the user browse the organization structure, and select one or more departments to create reports... what I've found so far is the following http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/?keyword=default (wow!!!) (it uses http://code.google.com/p/oz-js/ just unzip the file and it works!) http://thejit.org/ http://thejit.org/Jit/Examples/Spacetree/example1.html http://javascript.neyric.com/wireit/ (very impresive!) http://javascript.neyric.com/wireit/examples/jsBox/jsBox.html do you know any other???
