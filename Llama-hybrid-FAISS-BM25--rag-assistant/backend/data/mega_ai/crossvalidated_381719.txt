Cross Correlation between two RVs and PCA

What is the difference between the maximum value of cross-correlation value of RVs X, Y and maximum eigenvalue of Covariance matrix of these same RVs X and Y? Are both same and just represents the correlation between two RVs? Is maximum Pearson correlation between two data vectors will be equal to the maximum eigenvalue of the Covariance/correlation matrix of that two data vectors?
