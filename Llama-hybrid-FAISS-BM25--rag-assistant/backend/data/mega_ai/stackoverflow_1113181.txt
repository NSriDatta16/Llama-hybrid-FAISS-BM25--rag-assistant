My suggestions are to get a website with a forum set up somewhere so that members of the public can apply for beta access and are able to provide you with feedback. At some point, you'll probably also want someone to regularly trawl the forum for bug reports and read the general feed back. The bug reports can be added to a bug tacking database so that you have a handle on the issues being raised by the community and the general feedback can be used to provide a regular report to the rest of the team as not everyone will have time to read every single post. Once you have a community built up and the processes in place for gathering feedback, you should start to think about what you want to actually test. If you have specific game play areas you are unsure about, ask the community directly about those areas. If you are looking to test the network code or scalability of servers, organise regular test nights (no more than 1-2 hours though) with a specific set of tasks to perform. This will produce a ton of feedback the next day, but you'll find it mostly focused on the areas you asked people to test saving you the trouble of having it randomly scatter through the forums. Generally, people will want to help improve the game and getting the community involved earlier will not only get you important feed back from the people who will be playing it when it's finished, but also gives the community a sense of ownership. It's their game and they've helped make it better. The more you can interact with the community in some way, the more you will get from them when it comes to organised tests.
