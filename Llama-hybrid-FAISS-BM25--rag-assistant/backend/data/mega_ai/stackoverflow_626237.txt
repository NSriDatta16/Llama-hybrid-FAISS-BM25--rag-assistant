This is a classification problem - that is, the classification of users into groups of users who are likely to be interested in certain items. Once classified into such a group, it is easy to examine the purchases/likes of other users in that group and recommend them. Therefore, Bayesian Classification and neural networks (multilayer perceptrons, radial basis functions, support vector machines) are worth reading up on.
