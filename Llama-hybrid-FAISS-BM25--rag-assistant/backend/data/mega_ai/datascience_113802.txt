Presumably, you need a sparse group logistic regression model to perform feature selection while considering the binary response. skglm is a new modular, scikit-learn conform, python package that provides implementations of sparse generalized linear models. You can make a feature request, on its GitHub repository, through the issue section . The team will reach out to you asap. Thanks to the modularity of the package, it's a matter of a few hours to implement your desired model. Meanwhile, you can use celer . It offers an efficient implementation of Group Lasso that aligns with the scikit-learn API. Here is also a helpful medium article on celer group Lasso and how it can be used to perform feature selection of continuous and categorical variables.
