I would exepct .NET to handle this, but you can also have look at XmlSerializer class and XmlReaderSettings (see sample generic method below): public static T Deserialize (string xml) { var xmlReaderSettings = new XmlReaderSettings() { ConformanceLevel = ConformanceLevel.Fragment, ValidationType = ValidationType.None }; XmlReader xmlReader = XmlTextReader.Create(new StringReader(xml), xmlReaderSettings); XmlSerializer xs = new XmlSerializer(typeof(T), ""); return (T)xs.Deserialize(xmlReader); } I would also check if there are no encoding (Unicode, UTF8, etc.) issues in your code. Hexadecimal value 0x14 is not a char you would expect in XML :)
