Primary Answer: at the server you can output only the information the browser gave you. So if the browser did not send the information "HTTP_X_CLUSTER_CLIENT_IP", the server and of course php are not able to output it. Besides this, the documentation of $_SERVER does not contain anything like "HTTP_FORWARDED". Bonus Answer: Due to the fact that the browser does not send those information per default, you have to get them via JS and send them by your on, just like tracking tools do (have a look at piwik, it is open code) or grap them from other information you get, like $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] (see comment)
