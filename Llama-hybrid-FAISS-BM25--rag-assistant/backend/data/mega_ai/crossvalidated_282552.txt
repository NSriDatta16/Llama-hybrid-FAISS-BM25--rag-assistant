Reading recommendations for target tracking?

I'm a software engineer working on Deep Learning, but mostly for NLP. I have a Raspberry Pi 3 and some cameras and wanted to play around a bit with target tracking (implementing models from scratch in TensorFlow, not using OpenCV or similar), i.e. actually understand the techniques. What are currently the most important papers in this area? I was unable to find any good reading list for this topic and there are enough papers that starting out it's hard to know which techniques to focus on.
