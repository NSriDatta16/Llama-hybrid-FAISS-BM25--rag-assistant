If everything is reasonable (and an easy way to check this on real data will be to see that the 5 predictions are fairly close), you can take a weighted average with weights proportional to the confidence levels. If the predictions are very different, you'll have to get some idea why; maybe one of the 5 is an overconfident idiot, maybe the travel isn't as random as you think. You can probably do better if you have a more precise understanding of what "I am C% confident that in one second from now, the car will be at location L" actually means, like what is the probability distribution (say, a Gaussian around L?), and where exactly the number C comes from.
