I would take the easy way out. I assume you want to send a HTML mail message here. I suggest you create a HTML file with how you want the mail to look. Replace all names/variables with things like #COMPANYNAME#. save the file and rightclick on your Project in Visual Studio. Go to Properties then Resources. Now drag the HTML file into the resources and give it a decent name (here: MyMailTemplate). Now from your code you can refer to it from Properties.Resources.MyMailTemplate. You can use it as a string. Replace the #PARAMETER# text with the actual values. Done and easy to edit!
