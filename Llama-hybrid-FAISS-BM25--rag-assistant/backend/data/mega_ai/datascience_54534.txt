Classifying whether a chess board square contains a piece or not?

I have an image of a chessboard which I segment into its constituent 64 squares. I want to construct a binary classifier which can detect which square contains a piece or not. I know how to do this via CNN's, but I feel like that might be a bit overkill. I was wondering what would the simplest approach be to this problem? Thank you.
