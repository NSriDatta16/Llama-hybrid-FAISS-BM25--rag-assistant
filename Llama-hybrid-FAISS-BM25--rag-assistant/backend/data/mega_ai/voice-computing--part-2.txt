Some of these include: International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing Interspeech AVEC IEEE Int'l Conf. on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition ACII2019 The 8th Int'l Conf. on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Developer community Google Assistant has roughly 2,000 actions as of January 2018. There are over 50,000 Alexa skills worldwide as of September 2018. In June 2017, Google released AudioSet, a large-scale collection of human-labeled 10-second sound clips drawn from YouTube videos. It contains 1,010,480 videos of human speech files, or 2,793.5 hours in total. It was released as part of the IEEE ICASSP 2017 Conference. In November 2017, Mozilla Foundation released the Common Voice Project, a collection of speech files to help contribute to the larger open source machine learning community. The voicebank is currently 12GB in size, with more than 500 hours of English-language voice data that have been collected from 112 countries since the project's inception in June 2017. This dataset has already resulted in creative projects like the DeepSpeech model, an open source transcription model.
