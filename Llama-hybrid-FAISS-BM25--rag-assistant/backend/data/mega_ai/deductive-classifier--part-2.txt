 significant role in the vision for the next generation Internet known as the Semantic Web. The Web Ontology Language provides a formalism that can be validated and reasoned on via classifiers such as Hermit and Fact++. Implementations The earliest versions of classifiers were logic theorem provers. The first classifier to work with a frame language was the KL-ONE classifier. A later system built on common lisp was LOOM from the Information Sciences Institute. LOOM provided true object-oriented capabilities leveraging the Common Lisp Object System, along with a frame language. In the Semantic Web the Protege tool from Stanford provides classifiers (also known as reasoners) as part of the default environment.
