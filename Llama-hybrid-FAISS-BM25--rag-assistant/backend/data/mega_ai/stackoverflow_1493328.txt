imo it is down to which ever you prefer. Microsoft uses drag & drop controls like update panel, where as jquery is written by hand and in my experience offers a greater degree of flexibility. JQuery seems to be the framework of choice at the moment for DOM scripting and AJAX, it just makes javascript related tasks a lot quicker and easier to implement.
