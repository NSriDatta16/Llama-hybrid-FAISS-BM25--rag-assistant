One way I've seen being used in several applications is concatenating the data in the end of the executable, then appending the size of the data itself. You can then fopen the executable file, go to the end of the stream and read the size of the data, then go back that size and read the resources. Note that the resources will be exactly as you put them, so organization might be at risk. I also can't tell if this is a best practice, but it seems to work.
