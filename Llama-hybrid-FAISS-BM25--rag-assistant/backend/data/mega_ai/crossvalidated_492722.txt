Cross-validation using Caret in R: Why are coefficients from FinalModel identical to those from lm()?

I think I must be missing some fundamental part of the logic of cross-validation, or machine learning in general. Using the caret package in R, I ran a repeated k-fold cross-validation and compared the resulting coefficients to an identical model fit using lm() : trainControl They are identical, all the way out the the 4th decimal place. Why? I thought cross validation uses resampling to calculate coefficients, get the average, and these will perform better on future data than coefficients from a standard linear model. The point is that the latter coefficients are usually overly optimistic. Am I misunderstanding this process, or did I just use the incorrect code, miss a step or something? Thank you in advance for your time.
