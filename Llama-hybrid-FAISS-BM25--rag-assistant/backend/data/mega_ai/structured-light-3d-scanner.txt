A structured-light 3D scanner is a device used to capture the three-dimensional shape of an object by projecting light patterns, such as grids or stripes, onto its surface. The deformation of these patterns is recorded by cameras and processed using specialized algorithms to generate a detailed 3D model. Structured-light 3D scanning is widely employed in fields such as industrial design, quality control, cultural heritage preservation, augmented reality gaming, and medical imaging. Compared to laser-based 3D scanning, structured-light scanners use non-coherent light sources, such as LEDs or projectors, which enable faster data acquisition and eliminate potential safety concerns associated with lasers. However, the accuracy of structured-light scanning can be influenced by external factors, including ambient lighting conditions and the reflective properties of the scanned object. Principle Projecting a narrow band of light onto a three-dimensional surface creates a line of illumination that appears distorted when viewed from perspectives other than that of the projector. This distortion can be analyzed to reconstruct the geometry of the surface, a technique known as light sectioning. Projecting patterns composed of multiple stripes or arbitrary fringes simultaneously enables the acquisition of numerous data points at once, improving scanning speed. While various structured light projection techniques exist, parallel stripe patterns are among the most commonly used. By analyzing the displacement of these stripes, the three-dimensional coordinates of surface details can be accurately determined. Generation of light patterns Two major methods of stripe pattern generation have been established: Laser interference and projection. The laser interference method works with two wide planar laser beam fronts. Their interference results in regular, equidistant line patterns. Different pattern sizes can be obtained by changing the angle between these beams. The method allows for the exact and easy generation of very fine patterns with unlimited depth of field. Disadvantages are high cost of implementation, difficulties providing the ideal beam geometry, and laser typical effects like speckle noise and the possible self interference with beam parts reflected from objects. Typically, there is no means of modulating individual stripes, such as with Gray codes. The projection method uses incoherent light and basically works like a video projector. Patterns are usually generated by passing light through a digital spatial light modulator, typically based on one of the three currently most widespread digital projection technologies, transmissive liquid crystal, reflective liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) or digital light processing (DLP; moving micro mirror) modulators, which have various comparative advantages and disadvantages for this application. Other methods of projection could be and have been used, however. Patterns generated by digital display projectors have small discontinuities due to the pixel boundaries in the displays. Sufficiently small boundaries however can practically be neglected as they are evened out by the slightest defocus. A typical measuring assembly consists of one projector and at least one camera. For many applications, two cameras on opposite sides of the projector have been established as useful. Invisible (or imperceptible) structured light uses structured light without interfering with other computer vision tasks for which the projected pattern will be confusing. Example methods include the use of infrared light or of extremely high framerates alternating between two exact opposite patterns. Calibration Geometric distortions by optics and perspective must be compensated by a calibration of the measuring equipment, using special calibration patterns and surfaces. A mathematical model is used for describing the imaging properties of projector and cameras. Essentially based on the simple geometric properties of a pin
