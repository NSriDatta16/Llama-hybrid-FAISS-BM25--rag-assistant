Perfect programming languages tend to be found in science fiction novels. For example: Orson Scott Card's Ender Series - To create you must go to a different dimension and form a pure thought in your mind. When you return, it is. Robbert A. Heinlein explored the concept of world as myth in Number of the Beast David Brin's Earth has programming through sub vocals combined with eye and finger movements. It all still comes down to the same basic quandary. Any programming language that does not force the human to learn a skill tends to limit the freedom of thought. Natural language is not good either since it has many ambiguities. I wouldn't mind one that combines freedom with power and minimal syntax. I've recently started learning lisp, and it seems very good so far.
