Which statistical test to use to check if the variance is due to a particular factor?

I have 2 observations for 9 departments within an organization - one observation corresponds to the fraction of women among all employees in the department and other observation corresponds to fraction of white women among all employees in that department. The question I am trying to address is, whether white women % in each department is in line with total women % for each department or not? Which statistical test should I use for this kind of analysis? Whether the distribution across the departments is in line with the overall representation of women in each department?
