What is a model suitable for prediction of binary values based on time series?

There is a time series of stock quotes, length $n=500$ . The data looks like: Date open close high low volume Indicator 0 2020-01-03 259.18 259.00 261.90 257.77 8.962850e+09 0 1 2020-01-06 259.00 256.55 259.00 254.80 7.209356e+09 1 2 2020-01-08 256.25 255.79 257.32 254.77 6.547262e+09 0 3 2020-01-09 255.69 254.07 256.68 251.82 8.444500e+09 0 4 2020-01-10 254.00 251.90 254.60 251.20 7.220011e+09 1 For each element of the series, the binary indicator (0; 1) is calculated. The $i$ -th indicator value $i=1,2, \dots, n$ deterministically depends on $k$ previous rows, $k . This dependence is known function $f(X(t))$ , $X(t)=(x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t), x_4(t), x_5(t))$ where $t$ is Date and $x_j$ are prices and volume , $j=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ . In the simplest case $k=1$ and one row defines the Indicator value. The classes ratio in a sample: 0/1=480/20. It is required to predict some characteristics like: on what is date the 1 appear (out the sample)?, the probability that in the $n+1$ day the indicator takes "1"? Question. I'm looking for the possibilities of applying regression models. Is it possible to use logistic regression here? Or a Poisson process more suitable here?
