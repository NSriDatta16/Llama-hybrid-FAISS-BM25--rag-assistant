Overwriting a file programmatically in Cocoa

This code copies the referenced file and places it in the Docs Directory. I'm trying to build a simple backup solution. The problem is this operation does not overwrite the existing file if the operation is repeated. Two questions: What's the best way to overwrite in code? How difficult would it be to append the current date to each copied file? In this case there would be no overwrite operation. This would be much more useful for keeping incremental backups. If I decide to do it this way I understand I would need to create a new path in order to keep things organized. Thanks. Paul NSString * name = @"testFile"; NSArray * files = [NSArray arrayWithObject: name]; NSWorkspace * ws = [NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace]; [ws performFileOperation: NSWorkspaceCopyOperation source: @"~/Library/Application Support/testApp" destination: @"~/Documents/" files: files tag: 0];
