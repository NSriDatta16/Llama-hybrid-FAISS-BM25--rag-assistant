Online learning with random action set?

Suppose I have an online bayesian linear regression problem for which I can updated the posterior distribution of parameters. Using this posterior, I want to make a point forecast by sampling from it. In a complex regression environment, i.e. with non stationarities, model miss specification etc., it may not always be best to pick the posterior mean to minimize to out of sample objective. Therefore we have this online learning problem that should balance between exploitation/exploration of where to sample from the posterior. The tricky thing here is that if the posterior itself is the action set, it changes at each time step. Im wondering if there are any online learning algorithims that are suited to this problem?
