Here's a tutorial on doing it with a parallel port . Though I would recommend an Arduino which can be purchased very cheaply and would only involve the following code: /* Blinking LED * ------------ * * turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to a digital * pin, in intervals of 2 seconds. Ideally we use pin 13 on the Arduino * board because it has a resistor attached to it, needing only an LED * * Created 1 June 2005 * copyleft 2005 DojoDave * http://arduino.berlios.de * * based on an orginal by H. Barragan for the Wiring i/o board */ int ledPin = 13; // LED connected to digital pin 13 void setup() { pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // sets the digital pin as output } void loop() { digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // sets the LED on delay(1000); // waits for a second digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // sets the LED off delay(1000); // waits for a second } http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BlinkingLED
