where to change the Database connection settings in Orchard MVC CMS

I set up a site in Orchard CMS. While choosing data storage settings I chose Use an existing SQL Server(or SQL Express) database Instead of Use built-in data storage(SQL Server compact) It has worked fine for me but I am wondering where to change the data source that is the database server name. I didn't find the connection string settings in web.config file.
