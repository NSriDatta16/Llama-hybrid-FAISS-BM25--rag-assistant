Best way to assess statistically significant differences between average days between different groups

I have been tasked with looking at statistically significant differences in the average number of days between Event A and Event B for a number of sites within my organisation. This is not my area of expertise. Could anyone please advise which types of statistical tests/processes they would undertake with data such as the below so I can undertake research on how to take things forward? Thank you. Site Observations Average Days 1 100 6.3 2 250 4.4 3 600 8.7
