Probability of event at the individual level from Bayesian posterior mean distribution

This is the first time I've come across this type of problem. I really appreciate any comments or suggestions. In a Bayesian model implemented through Stan, with populations as the units of analysis (e.g., hospitals or institutions) , I have estimated a continuous parameter denoted as $\mu$ . In this context: $\mu_i \sim N(\theta, \tau^2)$ where $i$ denotes the mean for the $i^{th}$ population (for $i$ = 1,..., $k$ ) and $\tau^2$ represents the between-population variance. Thus, $\theta$ represents the average of true means across populations. Based on $n$ samples from the posterior mean distribution, I want to calculate the probability that a person/individual (across all populations) has a value greather than 50. In other words, assuming that the value for the $j^{th}$ individual in the $i^{th}$ population is represented by: $\mu_{ji} \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$ I want to calculate Pr( $\mu_{ji}>50$ ) where $\sigma^2$ represents the population-specific variance, assumed to be the same for all populations for simplicity. To compute Pr( $\mu_{ji}>50$ ), I calculated for each sample from the posterior distribution Pr( $\mu_{ji}>50$ ) = 1- $\Phi\left(\frac{50-\mu_{i}}{\sigma} \right)$ and obtained the median across all $k$ samples Is this a reasonable approach? Any suggestions are welcome.
