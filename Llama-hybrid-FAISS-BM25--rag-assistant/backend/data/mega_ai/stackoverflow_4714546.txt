library not found - Command /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 failed with exit code 1

Im getting a compiler error when switching my active target to iPad. No errors occur when the active target is set to iPhone. I tried modifying 'Library Search Paths' to the following below, but no luck. - $(inherited) - \"$(SRCROOT)\" - \"$(SRCROOT)/Classes\" ld: library not found for -lGoogleAnalytics collect2: ld returned 1 exit status Command /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 failed with exit code 1 -GoogleAnalytics lives in Classes/thirdparty/libGoogleAnalytics.a Classes/thirdparty/GANTracker.h Is there a property build setting Im missing?
