The standard error ($\text{SE}$) of the sampling distribution is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. It is less than the population standard deviation $\sigma =5$, because taking the mean of a group smooths out extreme values. The sample mean is a consistent estimator . If they had asked you for the probability of the sample mean being less than $70$, the answer would have been $1/2$ - the lower one-half of the bell's curve. But the question is "less than $77$". So you have to find the cumulative probability for the quantile $\frac{77-\mu}{\text{SE}}$, corresponding to the normalized $77$ value. Does it make sense? Yes, you don't even need a calculator to see that this is the case: The $\text{SE}=2.5$ grams, and the value you are interested in is $7$ grams above the mean. So how many standard errors is it above the mean? Almost $3$, right? What is the probability that if you sample a group of $4$ people and measure their height, their average will be shorter than an NBA player, whose height is $3$ standard deviations above the mean? Would you consider betting on it?
