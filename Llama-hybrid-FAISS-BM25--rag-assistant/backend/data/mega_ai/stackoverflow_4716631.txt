Well, there aren't many things that can help you with something that. AFAIK there are two possibilities: Option 1. If all the xml fragments have the same root-node, ie. " ", then you can simply find loop through the occurrences of finding the next occurence of the closing , extract the text between the two and use a normal XML parser. Option 2. If it's a anything xml goes kind of thing then you could use this Regex based Html Parser I wrote some time ago. It should handle that input without issue; however, you will have to deal with the open/close elements and determine what to do with them.
