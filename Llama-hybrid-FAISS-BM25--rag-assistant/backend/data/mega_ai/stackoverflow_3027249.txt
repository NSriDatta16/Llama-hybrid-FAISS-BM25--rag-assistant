I didn't find a universal way to get the remaining limit on the browsers I needed, but I did find out that when you do reach the limit there is an error message that pops up. This is of-course different in each browser. To max it out I used this little script: for (var i = 0, data = "m"; i From that I got this information: Google Chrome DOMException: code: 22 message: "Failed to execute 'setItem' on 'Storage': Setting the value of 'data' exceeded the quota." name: "QuotaExceededError" Mozilla Firefox DOMException: code: 1014 message: "Persistent storage maximum size reached" name: "NS_ERROR_DOM_QUOTA_REACHED" Safari DOMException: code: 22 message: "QuotaExceededError: DOM Exception 22" name: "QuotaExceededError" Internet Explorer, Edge (community) DOMException: code: 22 message: "QuotaExceededError" name: "QuotaExceededError" My solution So far my solution is to add an extra call each time the user would save anything. And if the exception is caught then I would tell them that they are running out of storage capacity. Edit: Delete the added data I forgot to mention that for this to actually work you would need to delete the DATA item that was set originally. The change is reflected above by using the removeItem() function.
