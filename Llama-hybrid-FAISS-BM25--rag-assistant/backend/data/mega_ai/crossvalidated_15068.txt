Forecasting binary time series

I have a binary time series with 1 when the car is not moving, and 0 when the car is moving. I want to make a forecast for a time horizon up to 36 hours ahead and for each hour. My first approach was to use a Naive Bayes using the following inputs: t-24 (daily seasonal), t-48 (weekly seasonal), hour of the day. However, the results are not very good. Which articles or software do you recommend for this problem?
