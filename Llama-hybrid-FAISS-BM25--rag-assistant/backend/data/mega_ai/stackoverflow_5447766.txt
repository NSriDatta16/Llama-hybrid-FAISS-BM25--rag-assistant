Your program causes all kinds of undefined behaviour. You could get any kind of output imaginable. Your compiler is probably giving you all kinds of warnings when you compile this code - try fixing those up and you should be headed in a better direction. Assuming you have a normal sort of system, the reason you're getting the output you see can be explained: modifying un->foo overwrites storage with the value 300 - then you print it out. modifying un->bar overwrites storage with the value 600 - then you print it out. modifying h->first overwrites storage with the value 1200 - then you print it out. modifying h->second (DANGEROUSLY) overwrites some memory with the value 1600 , then you print out storage again - it's still 1200 .
