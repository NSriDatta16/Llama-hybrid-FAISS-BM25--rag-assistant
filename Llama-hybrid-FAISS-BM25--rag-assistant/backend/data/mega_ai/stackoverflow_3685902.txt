PHP dynamic class loading

Lets say that I have an array that I want to convert to a value object. My value object class is as follows: /* file UserVO.php*/ class UserVO { public $id; public $email; public function __construct($data) { $this->id = (int)$data['id']; $this->email = $data['email']; } } And I create my array of value objects as follows: /* file UserService.php*/ $array = array( array(...), array(...)); $count = count($array); for ($i = 0; $i OK, so this all works fine. However, I'd like to specificy the VO that is to be created dynamically, so that I can have a single dynamic function to create my VO's. Something like: $ret = create_vo($array, 'UserVO'); function create_vo($data, $vo) { $count = count($data); for ($i = 0; $i I realise that I could do this with a switch statement (iterating through all my VO's)...but there is no doubt a much much more elegant solution. It would also be supercool if I could lazy load the VO's as needed, instead of having multiple 'includes' Any help much appreciated.
