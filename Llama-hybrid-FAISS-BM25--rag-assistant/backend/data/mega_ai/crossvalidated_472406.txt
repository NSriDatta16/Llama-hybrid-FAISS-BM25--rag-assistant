There are multiple issues present. The first one is that otm.arxiv() does not follow the standard R practice of returning a fitted model that one applies forecast() to. Instead, it performs fitting and forecasting. To obtain a forecast from otm.arxiv() , you need to supply an h parameter to it: otm.arxiv(y,h=3,thetaList=seq(from=1,to=5,by=0.5),g="SE") The second problem is that otm.arxiv() will apparently throw an error if h h=2 otm.arxiv(y,h=2,thetaList=seq(from=1,to=5,by=0.5),g="SE") gives us the rather unhelpful error message Error in groe function: m (Incidentally, this is not due to your control parameters; we get the same error for otm.arxiv(y,h=2) .) You may want to bring this to the package maintainers' attention. At the very least, it would be good to see the restriction on h in the help page, and to have this error caught with a more informative error message. So overall, you can get a useful e1 error matrix by changing two lines as follows: ftheta Of course, e1 is now a 50 by 3 time series matrix, not a vector of length 50 any more, so you will need to adapt the rest of your code. And of course it still contains some NA values for the initialization part and where we can't forecast the full 3 periods at the end.
