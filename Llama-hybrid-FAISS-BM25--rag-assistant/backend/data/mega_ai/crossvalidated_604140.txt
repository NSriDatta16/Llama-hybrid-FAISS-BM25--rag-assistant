R SVM classification with kernlab and user-defined kernel

I am trying to perform multi-class classification using SVMs (C-SVC). I am using the ksvm function from the kernlab package in R. The problem is that I want to use a periodic kernel, which is not one of the kernel functions provided by kernlab . Reading through the documentation and based on a post I found here, I saw that one can compute the kernel matrix on the input data with a user-defined kernel using the kernelMatrix function and then input the resulting matrix in ksvm . However, the results do not really seem to agree for kernels that have already been defined. As a reference, I am including some R code used to replicate the laplacedot kernel results. Note that dtframe is a dataframe with 2880 observations, 2 continuous and one discrete variable and I am trying to predict the discrete variable (this is feature number 1 and takes 4 levels) using the 2nd and the 3rd variables (both continuous). # Data generation library(mvtnorm) library(clusterGeneration) library(kernlab) # categorized numerical variable function intv 1){ new_lvl There is a huge difference between the results, which probably shows that there is something wrong with my attempt to perform multi-class classification using the kernel matrix instead of the kernel function (I know that the Laplace kernel should work for this data by the way, as I have generated them myself using the code above; I further include a plot of the data below). The code for the laplacekern function is taken directly from the source code of laplacedot . I am mainly wondering what I'm doing wrong in my manual implementation. Any help will be very much appreciated - thanks!
