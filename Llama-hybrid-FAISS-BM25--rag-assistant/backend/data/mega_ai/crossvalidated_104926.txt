Method to compare ratings from multiple different sources with missing data

I want a method to compare ratings from multiple sources and find a single measure that best reflects all the ratings. To give a specific example, let's call it "The fellowship review committee problem" (but please don't hate me, I am not part of a fellowship review committee, this is just an example): A college fellowship review committee tries to decide which of their students best deserves a fellowship. It reviews 1000 student applications and wishes to focus on the grades of each student in up to 5 specific courses (let's say the courses are A, B, C, D, E). Not all students are required to have taken all 5 courses, some have taken 3, some 4, and some 5 (but all applicants have taken at least 3 out of A, B, C, D, E). What is the best single number that measures which student is better? My initial idea to solve this problem was to use principal components analysis (PCA). If all applicants had taken all 5 courses, that would work well. Now, I see in this post that PCA does not work well with missing data. I have two questions: If there is no missing data (all students have taken all courses), is there a better way than PCA to find a single measure? If I do have missing data, is there a better solution than the so-called DINEOF procedure described in the link I posted above?
