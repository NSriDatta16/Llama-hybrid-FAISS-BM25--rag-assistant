Hibernate best practices talk about using natural keys for the equals / hashCode methods. Yes so I won't elaborate on this. We do have a composite key which consists of 2 parameters (say String name, Organization org) to which a particular object belongs. Unfortunately I can't use org since it is lazily loaded and leads to other issues. Could you elaborate a bit and maybe illustrate with some code? I'd like to understand how you got this working exactly and what the problem is. What kind of options do I really have since in the above Object (name, org) fields are unique and I can't just write my logic just based on the name field itself. As I said, providing more details might help. But just in case, note that calling org.getId() on a proxy should not trigger the loading of the entity, as long as you're using property access type , so you should be able to use this in your equals implementation.
