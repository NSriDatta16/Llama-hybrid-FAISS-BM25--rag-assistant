If you're after some trend analysis, does it really mean anything to measure beyond SLOC? Even if you just doing a grep for trailing semi-colons and counting the number of lines returned, what you are after is consistency in the SLOC measurement technique. In this way today's measurement can be compared with last month's measurement in a meaningful way. I can't really see what would a trend of McCabe Cyclometric Complexity give? I think that CC should be used more for a snapshot of quality to provide feedback to the developers. Edit: Ooh. Just thought of a couple of other measurements that might be useful. Comments as a percentage of SLOC and test coverage. Neither of which you want to let slip. Coming back to retrofit either of these is never as god as doing them "in the heat of the moment!" HTH. cheers, Rob
