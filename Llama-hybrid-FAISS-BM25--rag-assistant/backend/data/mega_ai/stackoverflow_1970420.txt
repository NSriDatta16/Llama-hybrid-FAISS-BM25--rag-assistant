How much faster is MyISAM compared to InnoDB?

People say InnoDB is not so fast like MyISAM. But how much slower? Just as a rule of thumb in the wind, of course. I mean... is it usually 0.5x as fast as MyISAM? or even worse? Or does the average visitor not recognize any temporal difference when surfing an MyISAM platform vs. same thing with InnoDB?
