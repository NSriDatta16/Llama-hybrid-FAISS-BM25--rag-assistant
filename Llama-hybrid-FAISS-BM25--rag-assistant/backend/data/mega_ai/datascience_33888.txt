Can GAN generate very happy facial expression

I have some dataset ${(x1,y1), (x2,y2)...(xn,yn)}$, where, $x$ is the picture of a facial expression，while $y$ is the fraction corresponding to their degree of the happiness (happy laugh: $y$ close to $100$; sad cry : $y$ close to $0$). The range of the $y$ is $0$~$100$. In my dataset, I didn’t have the sample with $y$ value greater $80$，but I want to get a very happy facial expression. In other words，I want to get a facial expression with very high y value $(y>95)$. Can GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) implement this? If not，is there any model that can implement this goal?
