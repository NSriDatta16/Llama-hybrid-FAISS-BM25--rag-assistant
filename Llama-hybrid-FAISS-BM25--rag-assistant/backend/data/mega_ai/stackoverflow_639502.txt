Try BCEL (byte code engineering library). You can implement a Visitor interface, which you can use to generate what ever you want (source code in another language, a custom AST , xml, what ever). I used it for a project in college where I (mostly) modified a program analysis framework that worked over Java source code into one that could also work against Java byte code. That task involved generating nodes for the analysis framework's internal AST representation. Also, I briefly skimmed the documentation for the "ASM" project you mentioned. It looks like it defines several vistior classes. You should be able to use those to do what you want as well. If you are not familiar with the visitor pattern, check out the description here . Also, if you haven't read it yet, the " Gang of Four " book is a good read.
