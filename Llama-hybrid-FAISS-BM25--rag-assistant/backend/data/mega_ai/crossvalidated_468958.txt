As @gunes (+1) has said: Taken exactly as stated, you have the same question either way. $X \sim \mathsf{Binom}(n=100, p=0.1)$ is the probability a modem/doctor will be busy at a given time. And you seek $P(X > 15) = 1 - P(X \le 15) = 0.0399.$ In R, where pbinom is a binomial CDF, the computation is shown below: 1 - pbinom(15,100,.1) [1] 0.03989053 However, neither model deals explicitly with the period of time over which a modem/doctor may be engaged. Also, in the hospital situation it seems artificial to say the the potential population served is 100 people. It might be better to get data to estimate the rate at which patients arrive for doctors' services and model the number needing service at any one time as Poisson. For example, if records show the Poisson mean to be $\lambda = 9.5,$ so that $Y \sim \mathsf{Pois}(\lambda =9.5),$ then $P(Y > 15) = 0.0335.$ 1 - ppois(15,9.5) [1] 0.033473 If you want to take into account the average 'service time' of doctors, then you would need a queueing model with appropriate rate of arrival and rate of service by a doctor. Then the issues become the percentage of time there are more than 15 patients in the system, necessitating a queue (waiting line) of patients, and the average waiting time in the queue.
