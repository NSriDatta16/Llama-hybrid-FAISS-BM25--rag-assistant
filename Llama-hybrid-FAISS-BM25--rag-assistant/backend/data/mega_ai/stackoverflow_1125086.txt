SQL Server Reporting Services: Limit Legend to One Series for Chart that has Multiple Series

I have a chart with these characteristics: chart type is XY (scatter ) all XY data have x-values that are integers; they are called "Update Cycle" numbers. This represents "score" data from a given program. in addition to the values that produce the XY data, I've added two other elements to the "Values:" list: one that is the average of the XY data for any Update Cycle (x-axis) value, and another that is the average of "similar programs" for any Update Cycle. These elements are plotted as lines ("trend lines") on the chart. Category Group is Update Cycle number Series Group are (1) PersonID and (2) ProgramID It all plots fine, but here's my problem: If I add a Legend, it wants to add Legend entries for each and every point for each and every person (because of SeriesGroup1) - I imagine it's also showing legend entries for the second series, but there are so many for the first series, I can't read anything. Question: How do I supress legend entries for the first series and only display the two legend entries for the 2nd series?
