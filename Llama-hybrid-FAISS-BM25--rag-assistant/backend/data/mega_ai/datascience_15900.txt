I found 3 ways to do it : you have to use the Data Info widget who gives the number of rows of your dataset and the Box Plot widget who prints the average and the standard deviation of each feature in your dataset. Pro: easy to use. Con: you are unable to use this data. you can create a Python script who will compute the average and the standard deviation using the statistics package. Pro: you can reuse your data. Con: you have to write a script and format the output data correctly. it exists an add-on call "Orange3-Timeseries" with a Moving Transform widget who can compute the average and the standard deviation of your series. Pro: easy to use. Cons: the package is still a beta-version and have some bugs, the widget only works with timeseries.
