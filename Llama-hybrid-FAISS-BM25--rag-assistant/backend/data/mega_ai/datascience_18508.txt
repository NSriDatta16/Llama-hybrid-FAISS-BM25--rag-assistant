Your problem looks to me more like a classification problem than a time series problem. My suggestion: Split the date into several sub-variables (year, month, day, week-of-day (maybe). Then just use this and the other values as input for a classification algorithm. Ideally you try several. I can recommend sklearn for this ( http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html ) One advice: Depending on the classification algorithm you need to first normalize your data. I find the following blog useful for entry-level problems (with code examples-- if you want to approach this from a time-series perspective he also talks about this) and documentation http://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/ . Hope that helps.
