jnlp unaivalable service exception

I am trying to use the FileOpenSerivce, but I always get an UnaivableServiceException regardless of whether I run it from Eclipse, or from my local webserver using the jnlp file. I am using an unsigned jar, which from what I understand is ok. I got a debugger connected, and when running under Webstart, everything seems to succeed just fine. I am attempting to get FileContents like so: FileContents fileContents = fileOpenService.openFileDialog(null, null); I never see a dialog, and fileContents is always null. Thanks!
