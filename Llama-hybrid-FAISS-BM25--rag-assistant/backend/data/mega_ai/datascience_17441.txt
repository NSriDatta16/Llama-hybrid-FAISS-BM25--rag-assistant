It is not really possible to alter input feature array size per example on normal CNNs. Instead this is fixed when the model is built for the first time, before you start training. Depending on your goal, it might be possible to work around that using some kind of pipeline that worked with image patches (taking multiple slightly randomised patches to augment the training data can improve results and doing the same with prediction inputs can also drive up classifier accuracy). Or a more complex variant using RNN/CNN hybrid to consume an image as a sequence of parts, which might also be used for multi-object recognition. However, these solutions are complex, and state-of-the-art results in image classification can be achieved by simpler techniques such as taking a centre crop and/or padding. Provided your training data is also treated the same way, and aspect ratios are not extreme this can work adequately.
