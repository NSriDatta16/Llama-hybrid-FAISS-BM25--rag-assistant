when returning by address, doesnt this go out of scope? ( SDL)

this is a code example from lazyfoo's SDL tutorials. SDL_Surface *load_image( std::string filename ) { //Temporary storage for the image that's loaded SDL_Surface* loadedImage = NULL; //The optimized image that will be used SDL_Surface* optimizedImage = NULL; //Load the image loadedImage = SDL_LoadBMP( filename.c_str() ); //If nothing went wrong in loading the image if( loadedImage != NULL ) { //Create an optimized image optimizedImage = SDL_DisplayFormat( loadedImage ); //Free the old image SDL_FreeSurface( loadedImage ); } //Return the optimized image return optimizedImage; } Here shouldn't optimizedImage go out of scope when it returns? seeing as it is local.
