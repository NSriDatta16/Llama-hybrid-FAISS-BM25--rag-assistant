Usually it is the way strings are generated e.g. msg template will be loaded from db or some file and things inserted in between, what is url and name in your case? This works on my machine >>> temp_body = 'Hello %s, please visit %s to confirm your registration.' >>> temp_body%("anurag", "stackoverflow") 'Hello anurag, please visit stackoverflow to confirm your registration.' Also try if str(name), str(url) works , ost probably it won't and try to fix that problem instead.
