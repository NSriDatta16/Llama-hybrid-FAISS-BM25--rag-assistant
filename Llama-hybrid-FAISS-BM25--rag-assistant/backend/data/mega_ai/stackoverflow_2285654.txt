This question was answered on the VS 2010 Architecture & Modeling forum. Basically, this functionality will appear in a power tool release around VS 2010 RTM. I encourage you to post in the forum if you have more questions. UPDATE You can now do this by getting the Visual Studio 2010 Feature Pack 2 .
