Just to clarify, ADFS leverages the SAML token but is NOT interoperable with the SAML protocol. Since you need to support SAML for your websites, then you'd need to implement the same SAML protocol as your SSO partners will be using - either 2.0, 1.1 or 1.0. We have a lot of info about SAML in the information library portion of our website: http://www.pingidentity.com/information-library/index.cfm Of course, we also offer an simple and secure solution for these requiremetns - PingFederate.
