I think you might want to take a look at Leo . This is one guys attempt at answering what you're asking about. I still can't wrap my VIM head around it personally, but others take to it quickly. It's not just a programming IDE, but more of an information organizer. It's written in Python, but I don't see why you can't code in other languages with it. The power of Leo is not so much the language, but the ability to express your thoughts and organize them whether it be in code, diagrams, images, or diagrams. Look over the tutorial and examples to get a feel for it. You might like it.
