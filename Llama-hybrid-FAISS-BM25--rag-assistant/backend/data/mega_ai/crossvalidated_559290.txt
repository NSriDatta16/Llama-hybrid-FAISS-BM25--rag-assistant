It would deserve more than a simple answer... but if you think about it, it actually makes sense! Intuitively, in your first model you try to explain your outcome variable with only one independent variable, while in your third model you want to explain it with 3 variables. It cannot be the same, right? The selection of your model (and inclusion of the relevant independent variable) must be supported by your knowledge of the subject area you are investigating. This is one of the main challenges. Some relevant CV resources: Variables selection ( EdM ) Predictor identification ( Frank Harrell ) Variable selection vs Model selection ( Aksakal ) Dealing with collinearity ( Robert Kubrick / Frank Harrell ) Variables selection and correlation ( whuber ) Challenges with automatic algorithms (stepwise) ( gung )
