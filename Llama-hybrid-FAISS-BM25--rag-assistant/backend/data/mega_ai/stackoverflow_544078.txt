ASP.Net Mapping Values Lookup

Currently in my ASP.Net applications web.config I have an application setting that stores a comma delimited list of mapping values, like the one below. In the code behind I need to perform a lookup on this data based on input values 1, 2, 3 etc. I can either string split it and loop until I find a match, or use Regex to pull the value from the config string. Currently i'm using Regex to get the mapping value. I'm not opposed to changing how the data is stored in the web.config. Is there a more simple and elegant way of handling this?
