As mouviciel mentioned, nothing is perfect. Aim to gently encourage users who might buy your product to buy it, and forget about the people who never will. Some general tips: Don't bother implementing your own protection, unless you have experience doing so. This is an area where paying someone who's specialty is providing some type of licensing/protection is probably worthwhile (just keep in mind it won't be perfect). Choose a license key system that is difficult to keygen. Again, picking a pre-built licensing system will likely suffice. Creating your own from scratch will likely not. Take the time to properly integrate whatever licensing system you choose. If you just "protect/wrap" your executable(s), the protection will quickly be removed. Most licensing/protection products offer easy integration tools/macros that make automated cracking much more difficult. For corporate software, the best thing you can do is make it easy for administrators to ensure they are within the license boundaries (# of instances/installs, etc.). Provide a central place for them to verify this, and gently remind them if they go slightly over, before you take any more drastic actions. In a large network environment, software licensing can get very complex for the IT dept. Make their job easier and they'll thank you.
