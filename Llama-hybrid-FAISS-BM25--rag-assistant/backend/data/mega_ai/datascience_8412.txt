The data has such a property that one or very few vectors influence strongly the class label. The best (and easiest) approach would probably be to simply train a classifer on each vector and then average the predictions across the vectors for a given sequence. The important vectors would be strongly influential in their predictions, whereas the predictions for the unimportant vectors would be close to 0.5 (or similar for a non-binary classification problem).
