Does scriptaculous come with Ruby on Rails?

I read that prototype does but didn't know if that means scriptaculous does. I looked at the javascript folder and it had prototype, dragdrop, controls, effects, and application. Is that all scriptaculous? Do I just add a link to it in my layout to use it? Also, The scriptaculous website said all sorts of "big names" use it, but I've only use jquery. Is Scriptaculous okay compared to Jquery? Is it about to "die" or anything that would make it better for me to install jquery in the javascript folder of RoR? I have used jquery but am no expert and don't mind switching to the other if it's not a dead language. thanks
