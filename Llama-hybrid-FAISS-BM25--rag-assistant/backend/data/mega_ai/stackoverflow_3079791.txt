Can I use tmpfs in this way?

I have plenty of RAM on my development machine. Can I move my Rails' application sources to the tmpfs partition in order to gain performance boost because of in-memory storage which is order of magnitude faster than HDD? I understand that tmpfs is temporary storage by its nature BUT can I use it for this task if I'll write some script to move sources from HDD partition to tmpfs and backup it back to HDD before reboot? Is it sane?
