Data leakage if I add prediction as feature?

I have a training set and a test set. Let's assume the following: I train random forest on the training set I make prediction on training set and test set Then I add those prediction as features back into the training set and the test set Now I train another random forest but on the training set from step 3 Finally I make prediction on the test set from step 3 with the model from step 4. Would it count as data leakage when I use prediction from step 2 as feature to the model in step 4-5.
