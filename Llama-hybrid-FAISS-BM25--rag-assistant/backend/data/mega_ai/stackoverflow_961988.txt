Choose between view controllers

I have a certain UIViewController (ViewController1), which shows contents of a database. And I want to show another view controller(ViewController2) if the database was not loaded before. So when user enters ViewController1 and the database was not loaded before, I want to take him to ViewController2 instead of ViewController1. Something like this: @implementation ViewController1 - (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated { [super viewWillAppear:animated]; if (isDatabaseLoaded) {show contents of ViewController1;} else {take user to ViewController2;} } How can I do it? What is the most elegant way to do this? Thank you in advance.
