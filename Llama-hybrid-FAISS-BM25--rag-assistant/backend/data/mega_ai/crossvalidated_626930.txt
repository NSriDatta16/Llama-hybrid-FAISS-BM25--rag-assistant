Calculating the 95% CI for a 10-point increase in the independent variable in a logistic regression

I am trying to calculate the 95% confidence interval for a 10-point increase in a continuous independent variable in a logistic regression. For a 1-point increase, the 95% CI would be exp(1 beta +/- 1.96 SE). For a 10-point increase in the independent variable, would the 95% CI be exp(10 beta +/- 1.96 SE) or would it be exp(10 beta +/-10 1.96*SE)?
