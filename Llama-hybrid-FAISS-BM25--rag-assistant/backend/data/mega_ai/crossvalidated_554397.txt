AR/ARMA model - test residual for independence or lack of correlation

Shumway and Stoffer (2017), a great book that I highly recommend, define an AR(p) model as $x_t=\phi_1 x_{t-1}+\phi_2 x_{t-2}+...+\phi_p x_{t-p}+w_t$ , where $w_t$ ~ $wn(0,\sigma_w^2)$ ; $w_t$ is not assumed to be Normally distributed. Notice that means $w_t$ is white noise (uncorrelated) not i.i.d. noise (independent). The ARMA process is also defined with white noise residuals. Yet on page 139 as part of model diagnostics they state: " If the model fits well, the standardized residuals should behave as an i.i.d. sequence with mean 0 and variance 1.... Unless the time series is Gaussian, it is not enough that the residuals are uncorrelated ". In my mind, there is a clear inconsistency here. We've assumed that the model has uncorrelated errors, not independent errors; it therefore seems necessary to test for correlation only. Is there an inconsistency here? I checked a number of textbooks and I've only seen ARMA models defined with white noise errors. This makes me wonder, in R when fitting a model with the sarima command of the astsa package (written by the authors of the above mentioned book) what is assumed of the error term? Independence or lack of correlation?
