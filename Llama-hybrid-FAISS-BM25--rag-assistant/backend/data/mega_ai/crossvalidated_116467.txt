Does that mean that in that case there is no bootstrap occurring at all since all samples are being used? No. Bootstrap draws with replacement (as the help page you linked explains), so on average only $1 - \frac{1}{e} \approx \frac{2}{3}$ of the cases are drawn into the training set. I guess it is time to read up about the bootstrap, bagging, and out-of-bag estimates, e.g. the references that help page gives.
