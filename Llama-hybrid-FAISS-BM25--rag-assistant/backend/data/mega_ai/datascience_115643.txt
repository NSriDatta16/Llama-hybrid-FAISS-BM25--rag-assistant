Is it a multi-variate time-series forecast? If yes, you can add several features that could improve predictions. The most common one is using LSTM neural networks: https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/ But you might have better results with XGBoost: https://cprosenjit.medium.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-using-xgboost-1728762a9eeb If you have several features that don't change much with time, random forest could be interesting: https://towardsdatascience.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-using-random-forest-2372f3ecbad1 In every case, some data analysis to know the correlations in your data and some patterns could be necessary before choosing the right algorithm: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/10/a-comprehensive-guide-to-time-series-analysis/
