Iphone App behaves differentlt when downloaded from store vs testing on phone

Having an issue with an app I have done that has been approved and is on the app store. The problem is I have a section that adds some float values together then uses, NSnumberformatter to convert them to currency. On the iphone simulator and if uploaded to the phone (in debug or release) it works fine and adds up the correct price When you download the app from the store it goes crazy and instead of adding the correct amount you end up with a figure of $80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00 And no, I'm not exaggerating the number of zeros. I can only see this figure in the console window of organizer, on the phone it shows as a negative number. My problem is given it won't do it to me in any form of the test environment its a little hard to debug. Is the problem likely to be in the use of floats with conversion(it converts strings to floats and then back again, due to how they are read in and how they are display) Or is it more likely the currency formatter is going wild, would I be better off using a straight decimal formatter and then manually adding a $ to the display. Could there be an issue with it not figuring out the correct currency or something? Thanks in advance Michaek
