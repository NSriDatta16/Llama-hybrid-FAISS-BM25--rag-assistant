A few reasons: POP3 does need far less server side storage. POP3 is much easier to implement. POP3 is private by default (it assumes that you want to delete email off the server after downloading it). Initially almost all ISPs had tiny storage limits (since their are free large storage email services this matters less now) so deleting emails that you downloaded was a must. (for completeness - thanks Evan) POP clients open a TCP/IP connection to the server, authenticates itself, asks for any email and does whatever processing it needs, and then close the connection. IMAP clients generally keep one or more TCP/IP sockets open with the server the whole time they are running, taking up those resources. POP is a much simpler protocol to implement and can handle a greater number of clients with the same amount of resources.
