How does one publish a static void NSString in a protocol?

I have a defined a custom error domain that I want to publish in a protocol. The domain is defined in the implementation file like this: //in the .m file static void *MyErrorDomain = (void *)@"MyErrorDomain"; The .h file implements a protocol, and I would like to publish MyErrorDomain there as well. I can't, however, figure out the correct form. The one that gives the fewest errors is: // in the protocol static extern void * TBPluginErrorDomain; The Xcode error is: "Multiple storage classes in declaration specifiers". I thought that the static void construction turns MyErrorDomain into a kind of function, but "static extern void TBPluginErrorDomain();" only incremented the number of errors. In short, I'm wandering in a morass of ignorance and all guidance will be greatly appreciated.
