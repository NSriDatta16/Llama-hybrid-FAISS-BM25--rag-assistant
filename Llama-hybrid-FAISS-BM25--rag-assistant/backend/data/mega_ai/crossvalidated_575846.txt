Is stationarity of variables neccessary condition for Bayesian VAR?

I am trying to run a BVAR on 5 variables. Four out of five are non-stationary. So shall I do the first difference of the non-stationarity variables or take them in level for running the BVAR? And what are diagnostic tests I can perform on BVAR estimation? The online resource on BVAR is lacking.
