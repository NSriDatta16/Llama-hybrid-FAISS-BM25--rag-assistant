The Eclipse GWT plugin doesn't yet support Galileo , so use the latest Ganymede release (3.4 SR2). The comparison page can help you decide which particular version to use. I'd probably take the classic version unless you know you only want to do GWT development. Of course you can always pull additional packages from the update site so it doesn't really make much difference (it's just easier to add than remove). If you can't download a package, check out the Eclipse torrents . You can pick the package/platform. I just tried to get the Java EE Cocoa package and it started fine.
