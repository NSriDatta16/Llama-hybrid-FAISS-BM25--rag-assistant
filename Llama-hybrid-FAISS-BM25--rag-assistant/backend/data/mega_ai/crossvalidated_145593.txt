You are looking for prediction intervals (not to be confused with confidence intervals , which are about unobservable parameters, whereas prediction intervals are about quantities that will be observable in the future). As the linked Wikipedia article makes clear, these are common in "standard" regression, AKA Ordinary Least Squares . If you are specifically interested in time series forecasting, you may want to look for the term interval forecast , as in (very roughly speaking) "there is an 80% chance that next year's inflation rate will be between 1% and 3%". These are often visualized using fan charts . Interval forecasts can be derived from more general density forecasts (cf. probabilistic forecasting ), where you don't forecast a single value (a so-called "point forecast"), but output a full "predictive density", i.e., you try to forecast the full future distribution of your observable. You can obviously derive interval forecasts with any given coverage probability from a predictive density. I hope this gives you enough terms to google ;-)
