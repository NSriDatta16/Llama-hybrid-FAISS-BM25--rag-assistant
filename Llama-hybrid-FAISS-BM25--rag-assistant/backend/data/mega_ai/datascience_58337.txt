Can we Create Neural network(Simple one such as Multi Layer perceptron) that only contains positive weights only?

I was wondering if there is a specific method to create a well performing neural network with only positive weights (I already tried clipping the weight before training or so and initializing the weights with only positive value ) but still doesn't give a good results so is there any other method to do so ? Thank You
