What are the differences between Convolutional1D, Convolutional2D, and Convolutional3D?

I've been learning about Convolutional Neural Networks. When looking at Keras examples, I came across three different convolution methods. Namely, 1D, 2D & 3D. What are the differences between these three layers? What are their use cases? Are there some links or references to show their use cases?
