Deep Learning - Find most similar images - Triplets vs Pairs

I am working with Python, scikit-learn, keras and with 450x540 rgb images of front-faced watches (e.g. Watch_1 , Watch_2 ). My aim to run an autoencoder or a Siemese Neural Network to find the most similar watches among them. However, I am not sure if I will get better results by comparing pairs of images or triplets of images. As it is defined in this research paper , triplets of images consist of one target image, one image which is (more) similar to the target image and one image which is not (so) similar to it. Can someone explain me in simple terms why using triplets of images will (necessarily) yield better results than using pair images, as research papers like the previous one claim?
