Transformer model for series classification

the title more or less says it all. I want to use the transformers architecture, i.e. a transformer model, for series classification. I donâ€™t want to predict time series, just to classify them. The series are not very long, the average length is 220 elements, and I will try to modify it, if there is constraint on the model input. Is there a suitable model for that?
