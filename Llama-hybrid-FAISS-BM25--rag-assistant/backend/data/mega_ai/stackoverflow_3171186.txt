How can I create many divs on on top of the other using CSS/jQuery?

Basically, I want many(>25) divs to be displayed one on top of the other so that only one can be seen at a time. I have the jQuery UI draggable implemented, so once a div is dragged away, the next div is shown. What CSS do I need to make such a stack of divs? jQuery is also available if required. Thanks!
