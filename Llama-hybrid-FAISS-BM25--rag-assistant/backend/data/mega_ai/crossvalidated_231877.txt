Apparently this question didn't receive a lot of attention. Also, it seems that there's no package for R which computes simultaneous confidence bands for linear regression (!). Since there are R packages for basically everything, this is a bit surprising for me, but it looks like that's how it is. Thus, I decided to write my own function, based on Working-Hotelling bands (basically, Scheff√© method applied to a regression surface). It looks like it's working fine, thus I'm posting it as an answer. simultaneous_CBs
