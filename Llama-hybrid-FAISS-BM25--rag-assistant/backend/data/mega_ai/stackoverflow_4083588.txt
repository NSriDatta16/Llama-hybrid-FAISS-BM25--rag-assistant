You make a valid point in saying that Java is more suited to enterprise software. That's really where Java shines: it works very well for enterprise programming. However, your gripes about the tools in Python and Ruby are unfounded. PyDev for Eclipse takes full advantage of the same features that you would enjoy if you were developing in Java. Ruby has a similar plugin for Eclipse. Unit testing frameworks like pyunit, nose, and others exist for both languages (and I believe PyDev has support for unit tests). Also, just like a Java compiler would catch an error at compile time, a Python script will give syntax errors before you run it, along with an (IMO) much more understandable error system than a Java compiler. Since Python and Ruby are scripting languages, their area of expertise lies more in small tasks, rapid development, and using frameworks like Django or Rails. So yes, more heavy-duty languages like Java are great for enterprise, but there's something to be said for the elegance and ease of use of Python and Ruby.
