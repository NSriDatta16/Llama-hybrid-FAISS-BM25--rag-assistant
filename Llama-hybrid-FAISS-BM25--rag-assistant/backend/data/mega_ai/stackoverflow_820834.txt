Regarding OLE: COM has its roots in OLE. But today, OLE may be considered to be built on top of COM and is mostly used for what its name suggests -- document linking and embedding. While COM itself defines only a couple of interfaces itself (IUnknown, IClassFactory, IMalloc etc), OLE adds a whole bunch of additional interfaces like IMoniker, IOleItemComtainer, etc. To sum up: COM is the foundation, ActiveX and OLE are layers on top of COM.
