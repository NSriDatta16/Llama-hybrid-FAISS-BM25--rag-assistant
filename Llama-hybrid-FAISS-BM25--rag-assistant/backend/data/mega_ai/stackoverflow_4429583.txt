_displayedItems is a private ivar, so you shouldn't access it, even from a category. That said, you should try compiling the same code with gcc -arch i386 and gcc -arch x86_64 and see the difference. In the 32 bit mode you don't see the error. This shows how fragile the situation is. You really shouldn't. That said, there's a way to get that ivar by abusing KVC: @implementation NSCollectionView (displayedItems) - (NSMutableArray *)myDisplayedItems { return [self valueForKey:@"displayedItems"]; } @end Note that you shouldn't name your method just as displayedItems . That would make an infinite loop, because the KVC machinery would find your method earlier than the ivar. See here . Or you can access any hidden ivar using Objective-C runtime functions. That's also fun. However, let me say again. There's a big difference in knowing you can do one thing and doing that thing for real. Just think of any hideous crime. and doing that by yourself. DON'T DO THAT!!!!!
