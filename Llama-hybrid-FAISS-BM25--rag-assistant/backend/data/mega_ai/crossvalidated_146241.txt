Its a good question and I've been asking myself the same. There are more than two kinds of neural network, and it seems the previous answer addressed the competitive type, whereas the Bayesian network seems to have similarities to the feed-forward, back-propagation (FFBP) type, and not the competitive type. In fact, I would say the Bayesian network is a generalisation of the FFBP. So the FFBP is a type of Bayesian network and works in a similar fashion.
