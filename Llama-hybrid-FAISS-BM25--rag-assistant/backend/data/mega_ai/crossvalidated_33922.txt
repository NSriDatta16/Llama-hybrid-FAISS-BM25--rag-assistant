The analysis of irregularly sampled time series can be tricky, as there aren't many tools available. Sometimes the practice is to apply regular algorithms and hope for the best. This isn't necessarily the best approach. Other times people try to interpolate the data in the gaps. I have even seen cases where gaps are filled with random numbers which have the same distribution as the known data. One algorithm specifically for irregularly sampled series is the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram which gives a periodogram (think power spectrum) for unevenly sampled time series. Lomb-Scargle doesn't require any "gap conditioning".
