After I posted my question I had no patience, and I decided to ignore UI.sortable altogether, building the required functionality from draggable and droppable and using special divs as spacers that would swell up on dragover to facilitate dropping in between tasks. That worked to some degree, except it's all much more code and it's a lot more jittery and bugprone than sortable, even with the refreshPositions option set to true. Still, there might be other valid reasons to want to circumvent UI.sortable. In very brief faux code: $(.taskitem).draggable revert: invalid start: animate height of spacers from 0 to 5 $(.spacer).droppable over: animate height from 5 to 50 out: animate height back to 5 drop: insert draggable after spacer find spacer with same index as draggable and move it along
