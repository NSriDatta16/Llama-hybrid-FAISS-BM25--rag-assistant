Are credible intervals confidence regions?

I understand that I'm asking a very pedantic question, but as far as I'm aware a confidence region is a multi-dimensional generalization of a confidence interval and therefore as a credible interval is not a confidence interval, it is not a confidence region, however despite this I'm seen many sources act as if this is not the case. One such example being Hoff's A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods, which spends its entire 'confidence regions' chapter talking about credible intervals. Have I missed something? Why are there sources that treat credible intervals as confidence regions despite them not being the same things?
