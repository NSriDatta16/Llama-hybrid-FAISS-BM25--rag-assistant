If you are regressing GDP time series then you should apply log-transformation to the GDP. Two popular ways of modeling GDP are: $$\ln GDP_t=c + g t + \varepsilon_t$$ and $$\ln GDP_{t+1}-\ln GDP_t = g + \varepsilon_t$$ The first one is exponential growth, the second one geometric brownian motion. In any case you have to apply log, otherwise the heteroscedasticity will show up
