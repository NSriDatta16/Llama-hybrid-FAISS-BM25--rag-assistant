I suspect you may need to read further into the documentation on EM_SETMARGINS . It states: The HIWORD specifies the new width of the right margin, in pixels. This value is ignored if wParam does not include EC_RIGHTMARGIN. Edit controls and Rich Edit 3.0 and later: The HIWORD can specify the EC_USEFONTINFO value to set the right margin to a narrow width calculated using the text metrics of the control's current font. If no font has been set for the control, the margin is set to zero. Note the second paragraph regarding EC_USEFONTINFO to set a narrow width. This may be implying that this is the ONLY way to set a narrow width. I don't know for sure as I haven't tried it, but it may help. Note also that Rich Edit Controls and regular Edit Boxes have different behaviour, so check which one you're using.
