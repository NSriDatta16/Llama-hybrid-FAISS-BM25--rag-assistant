Type II errors are rarely if ever quantified. Usually, you select, among the available tests which don't inflate type I error, the one that has the highest power (and thus the lowest type II error ceteris paribus). It is difficult to quantify type II errors because it depends on the (unknown, otherwise there would be no need to test anything at all) true population average. You can say for instance: If the true population average is x, then by comparing it to our null hypothesis value of 0, we have a probability of y to commit type II error. True population averages that are distinct from-, but very close to the value under the null hypothesis have much higher probabilities of type II errors than those that are far off the value under the null hypothesis. (Arguably, those type II errors, though more likely, are also less severe since the size of the effect that we missed to detect is smaller)
