Tree based methods predict the target (dependent) variable as the averages of the leaf values. The values in the leaves occurs in the training set, so you can't get an out of range output from the trees. This could happen even if the features (independent variables) are in their respective training data ranges. But, a new value (extrapolation in your saying) for a categorical variable (IV) breaks the model. And this is not particular to tree based algorithms. With a new surprise category, you won't be able to execute a linear regression well (or at all).
