The JRM Syntax-rules primer is quite good, but Chapter 36 of Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation, by Shriram Krishnamurti http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/ ) also has good coverage of writing Scheme macros. That material has been used and improved over several short articles, tech reports, etc, over the past 10 years, so it's not a 'this was true about the X implementation of Scheme in 1983 that is no longer accessible' paper.
