CSUPLOAD Error: Cannot find the VM Role Agent-Failed the verification tests

I'm about ready to cry so any help is appreciated: I have prepared a VM Role, installed the Azure Integration Tools and run the sysprep, running csupload from a 64bit command prompt machine, but still am getting this error: Cannot find the VM Role Agent Failed the verification test Cannot prepare VHD..... I tried just bypassing with skipverify, but when trying to run, the instance is declared unhealthy. Any ideas?
