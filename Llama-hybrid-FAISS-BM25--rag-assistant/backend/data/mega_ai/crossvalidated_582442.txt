The fitting is supposed to account for the noise. Nevertheless, I am also a pragmatist who observes he gets more believable results if he smoothed the data first. I’m curious to see the take of theorists, to learn if I introduce problems by doing the signal pre-processing. The data you have seem to be “filterable” using a low pass Fourier Transform filter, at first glance. I only recently read into that technique, and now I’m slapping myself for all those times that I did it in much more difficult ways.
