Correcting for spillover bias in experiments?

Suppose I have an experiment designed where I'm interested in observing the effect of daily walking on self-reported joint pain in elderly adults. The population of interest are elderly adults who reportedly do not partake in daily walking who have noticeable, self-reported joint pain. I've randomized, started, collected data, and I'm ready to analyze my experiment. Originally, I had planned to model the results as such where the binary variables, (treatment) group and (time) period have a product of 1 if an exposure occurred (treatment group during the post-start period.) $$ pain_i = \beta_1*group_i + \beta_2*period_i + \beta_3*(group_i * period_i) $$ Looking at the observed data, very few adults in the treatment group have walked every day. Most have walked between 3-5 days. Fortunately, no members of the control group have done any walking during the experiment. As such, I want to account for varying levels of exposure where the level could be the average number of days walking per week. Or alternatively, level could be the total weekly minutes spent walking. (Or the log minutes spent walking because if someone theoretically had spent an arbitrarily high number of minutes walking, the regression model might predict a negative pain.) $$ pain_i = \beta_1*group_i + \beta_2*period_i + \beta_3*level_i $$ One could argue that I should still consider exposure as a binary variable, but then I would be studying the effect of some walking, perhaps not daily or even weekly, which is not the research question. To answer this question, please address 1/ whether varying levels of exposure is a reliable means to address such bias 2/ if this proposed solution is viable and 3/ (if not viable) what should I do instead or where can I read more if solution space is too expansive to capture in a single Q/A.
