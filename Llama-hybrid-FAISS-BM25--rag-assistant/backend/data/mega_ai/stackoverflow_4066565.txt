I think MADAM would work well for you. I'm using MADAM to make RSS feeds available that are specific to logged in users accessible to RSS Readers. I am also planning on using it when we implement mobile app access into our application. That way we can use the same controller logic and change the authentication using MADAM. I would suggest that you use HTTPS requests if you're doing BASIC authentication. Also, if you are using IIS 7, make sure you add the http modules configuration into the system.webServer/modules section. I wasn't paying much attention and wasted time diagnosing why it was working locally and not on the development server in IIS 7.
