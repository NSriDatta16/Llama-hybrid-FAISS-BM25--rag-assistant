On password-protected site, how to whitelist certain referring domains?

I have a site that is password-protected using a .htaccess and .htpasswd file. I'd like for users to bypass the login prompt ONLY if they come from a certain domain. Can this be done by embedding the .htaccess credentials as parameters in the link somehow? I do manage the domain I'd like to whitelist, so how can I pass GET parameters in the link that the .htaccess file will process?
