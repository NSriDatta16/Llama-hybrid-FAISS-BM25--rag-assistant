Does it make sense to run a PCA on the difference between the two questionnaires (Z1-Z2)? I don't see why not. If you want to use differences Z1-Z2 as your predictors, then compute these differences and then do whatever regression-type analysis you prefer. Principal component regression (PCA + regression) is one possibility. I don't see any problems associated with "repeated measures" here. [...] which is the best approach in this case, if my primary interest is to reduce dimensionality before the regression analysis? [...] the primary purpose is to evaluate which regressor mostly explains the independent variable (if any). It is not very clear what your "primary purpose" really is. If you want to build a good regression model, I would suggest to look into penalized/regularized regression methods, such as ridge or lasso or elastic net. It sounds as if you are interested in which specific predictors affect your outcome, and for that you need L1 penalty, but you also have not enough data and probably high collinearity, so you need L2 penalty as well; this suggests elastic net. If you do want to "reduce dimensionality" as a primary purpose (this is a different purpose!), then PCA can make sense.
