If your program is running as elevated admin, then it will not redirect to c:\users folder. You can run the program as elevated admin by embedding a manifest to the file. see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control for details on tasks that trigger the UAC prompt. Also note that 64 bit Windows 7 does not support File System Redirection.
