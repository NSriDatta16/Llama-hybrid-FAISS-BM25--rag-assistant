These tags all describe meaning or with a nice word, semantics . Visually impaired people who uses screen readers depend on that the web page is built with tags that tells them what the different chunks of text on the page is. E.g. H1 , H2 , Hn all tell them that it's a header. P tells them that it's a paragraph. UL / LI tells them that it's a bulleted list. etc. A person with a screen reader uses these tags to scan through the page. They can "see" how many header tags ( H1 , H2 , Hn ) tags that are on the page and then just browse through them to find the section they want to read.
