Some questions / ideas: Are you hitting all 11 indexes for a single request? Can you reorganize the indexes so that you hit only 1 index (i.e. sharding) ? Have you run a profile of the application (using dotTrace or similar tool)? Where is the time spent? Lucene.Net? If most of the time is spent on Lucene.Net, then if you migrate to Solr the latency should be negligible (compared to the rest of the spent time). Plus, Solr can be easily distributed to increase performance. I'm not all too familiar with Lucene (I use Solr) but if you're searching 11 indexes per request, can you run those searches in parallel (e.g. with TPL ) ?
