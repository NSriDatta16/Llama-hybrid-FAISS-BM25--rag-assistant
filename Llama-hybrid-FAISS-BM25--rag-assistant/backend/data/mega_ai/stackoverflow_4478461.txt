As an admin, not a developer, I don't have a code solution for you - but do have 2 no-code "solutions" for you to consider. SP allows for a different set of throttling rules for the list / site collection owner - the default I believe is set at 10000 - but that can be bumped up. The idea being that the average end user is throttled, but not the list owner. That might be helpful. SP also allows for the admin to define times of the day when queries can be executed without any type of throttling. So if its possible to run your queries at midnight etc - that might be an option. Both these settings are adjusted at the Web Application level
