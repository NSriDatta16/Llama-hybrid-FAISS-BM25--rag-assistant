It depends upon what you know and the motivation as to why you are doing it. Since you are not concerned with any of the uncertainty about $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , we will remove that uncertainty by using the predictive distribution. It would solve $\Pr(\alpha;\beta|\tau).$ Bayesian methods are generative methods, so in the best of all possible worlds you understand how $(\alpha,\beta)\rightarrow\tau.$ In other words, you would know the function that does the mapping. I am going to assume that this is not true. If it is true, then that should be used to create your likelihood function instead of what I am purposing. The solution will need to distinguish between observed $\alpha$ and the parameters that drive $\alpha$ which will be denoted $\theta_\alpha$ for $\alpha$ and correspondingly, $\theta_\beta$ for $\beta$ . In addition, $\theta_\nu$ are any nuisance parameters such as variances. You are solving $$\Pr(\tilde{\alpha};\tilde{\beta};\tilde{\tau}|\alpha;\beta;\tau)=\int_{\theta_\alpha\in\Theta_\alpha}\int_{\theta_\beta\in\Theta_\beta}\int_{\theta_\nu\in\Theta_\nu}f(\tilde{\alpha};\tilde{\beta}\tilde{\tau}|\theta_\alpha;\theta_\beta;\theta_\nu)\Pr(\theta_\alpha;\theta_\beta;\theta_\nu|\alpha;\beta;\tau)\mathrm{d}\theta_\alpha\mathrm{d}\theta_\beta\mathrm{d}\theta_\nu,$$ in order to use this to get to $$\Pr(\tilde{\alpha};\tilde{\beta}|\tilde{\tau}=T;\alpha;\beta;\tau)$$ to construct your marginal slice of $$(\alpha,\beta)|_{\tau=T}.$$ You will need some version of functional form for $\tau=g(\alpha,\beta)$ . Essentially $\tau-\gamma_\alpha\alpha-\gamma_\beta\beta$ which would be a linear regression or whatever would be rational, or , in the alternative, if you have it split into cells rather than as continuous functions, so a local curve on a near manifold. If you do not know the curve structure, then if you have enough data, you could create multiple models and treat the models as an additional parameter. You could then wrap this in $f(\tau,g(\alpha,\beta))$ . $f$ is your likelihood function, $g$ maps the variables deterministically plus a random variable. $f$ , if it were a distribution, would be the distribution of that variable. $\Pr(\theta_\alpha;\theta_\beta;\theta_\nu|\alpha;\beta;\tau)$ is your posterior distribution based on $f$ and $g$ , which means you will need to create priors, possibly one prior for each cell. Now as to how to tackle this mechanically. I don't have a good answer. It would likely involve some MCMC algorithm to find the posterior and then probably again to try and map the bivariate prediction for any chosen $\tau$ . Just thinking in terms of the requirements for the software, I don't have an answer because this isn't a trivial problem. If you could divide it into cells so that locally linear relationships are close enough, you could create a normally distributed vector regression as $f$ .
