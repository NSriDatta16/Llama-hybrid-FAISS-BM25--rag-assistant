When you make an Ajax request you're suppose to set the ' X-Requested-With ' HTTP header to something like ' XMLHttpRequest ' eg. Host www.google.com User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; (snip...) Accept */* Accept-Language en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 115 Connection keep-alive X-Requested-With XMLHttpRequest Referer http://www.google.com This 'X-Requested-With' header is what the 'IsAjaxRequest()' method looks for. Normally, jQuery's Ajax methods will send this header automatically. My guess is that for some reason the jQuery Calendar plugin isn't sending this header. I would download something like fiddler , or install Firebug for Firefox and check the raw HTTP Request/Response data when the Ajax request/Calendar control is fired/initialised. See if the X-Requested-With header is being included.
