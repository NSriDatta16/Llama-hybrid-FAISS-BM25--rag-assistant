I personally find it very valuable to discuss these options in light of the maximum-likelihood principal component analysis model (MLPCA) [1,2]. In MLPCA one applies a scaling (or even a rotation) such that the measurement errors in the measured variables are independent and distributed according to the standard normal distribution. This scaling is also known as maximum likelihood scaling (MALS) [3]. In some case, the PCA model and the parameter defining the MALS scaling/rotation can be estimated together [4]. To interpret correlation-based and covariance-based PCA, one can then argue that: Covariance-based PCA is equivalent to MLPCA whenever the variance-covariance matrix of the measurement errors is assumed diagonal with equal elements on its diagonal. The measurement error variance parameter can then be estimated by applying the probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) model [5]. I find this a reasonable assumption in several cases I have studied, specifically when all measurements are of the same type of variable (e.g. all flows, all temperatures, all concentrations, or all absorbance measurements). Indeed, it can be safe to assume that the measurement errors for such variables are distributed independently and identically. Correlation-based PCA is equivalent to MLPCA whenever the variance-covariance matrix of the measurement errors is assumed diagonal with each element on the diagonal proportional to the overall variance of the corresponding measured variable. While this is a popular method, I personally find the proportionality assumption unreasonable in most cases I study. As a consequence, this means I cannot interpret correlation-based PCA as an MLPCA model. In the cases where (1) the implied assumptions of covariance-based PCA do not apply and (2) an MLPCA interpretation is valuable, I recommend to use one of the MLPCA methods instead [1-4]. Correlation-based and covariance-based PCA will produce the exact same results -apart from a scalar multiplier- when the individual variances for each variable are all exactly equal to each other. When these individual variances are similar but not the same, both methods will produce similar results. As stressed above already, the ultimate choice depends on the assumptions you are making. In addition, the utility of any particular model depends also on the context and purpose of your analysis. To quote George E. P. Box: "All models are wrong, but some are useful". [1] Wentzell, P.
