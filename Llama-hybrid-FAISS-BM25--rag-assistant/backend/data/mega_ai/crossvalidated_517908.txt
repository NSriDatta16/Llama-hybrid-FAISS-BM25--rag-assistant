What the term tensor means depends on the context it is used in: Field Meaning Machine learning Multi-dimensional array (usually numeric) 1 2 Maths an algebraic object describing a (multilinear) relationship between sets of algebraic objects The machine learning term is inspired by the fact that in a fixed basis/coordinate system, a tensor can be expressed as a multi-dimensional array. However, there are alternative representations , depending on the sub-field, with varying degrees of abstraction. Tensors, also known as multidimensional arrays, are generalizations of matrices to higher orders and are useful data representation architectures. Tensors in Statistics Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application (2021) Tensor The primary data structure in TensorFlow programs. Tensors are N-dimensional (where N could be very large) data structures, most commonly scalars, vectors, or matrices. The elements of a Tensor can hold integer, floating-point, or string values.
