As a historical VFP devloper (over 20yrs with Foxpro/VFP, and STILL have people asking me to write / update their systems with VFP, for a variety of reasons), its still very powerful. However, while researching and taking much of my OOP and development experience and working with .Net, I do find some things in .Net much easier, especially the strong type-casting. However, doing a basic report REQUIRES all strong type-casting to the database tables / structures / objects, and in many cases thus far, a PITA to do. The price tag for a rewrite is always of significant consideration, but so too is the collapse of ANY system... regardless of VFP, VB, Access, or other. I would strongly suggest getting a consulting company in to help in the re-modeling of your system and maybe act as a project manager / mentor to your in-house staff of programmers who may be able to offer their talents even though it may require some training in the new development environment. This way, you can get a good basis of a strong talent in the language, yet keep some costs down by using your own programming staff -- yet you may need to hire supplemental programming staff. The learning curve from VFP to .Net is there, and can still be a head scratcher. There are a variety of companies out there who were VFP specialists that have subsequently migrated their services to .Net world and may offer a perfect match for your organization having the historic knowledge and professional experience of BOTH worlds. I know they can act as mentors too for the development of such work.
