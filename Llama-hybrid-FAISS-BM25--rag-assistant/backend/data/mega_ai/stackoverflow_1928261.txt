Image inside dragable div is stalling my drag and drop when dragged

Client has asked that a whole div is dragable, the div contains some text and an image. I converted the div to be a tag and used Mootools draggable goodies to get it all working. That is until the client clicks on the image and starts dragging it in IE. Then the browser thinks you want to drag the image around and ignores the drag and drop events for the parent li. Any clues as to what I can do to stop the image being draggable? Or at least to trigger the parent's onmousedown event? Here's some sample HTML: Blah blah blah Blah blah blah Blah blah blah And here's some of the JS I use to do the drag and drop: // Set up drap and drop $$( 'ul.asset_list li' ).each( function( item ){ item.removeEvents(); item.addEvent('mousedown', function(e) { e = new Event(e).stop(); // Create our clone of the asset for dragging var clone = this.clone( true, true ); clone.removeEvents(); clone.addClass( "dragging" ); clone.setStyles(this.getCoordinates()); // this returns an object with left/top/bottom/right, so its perfect var drag = clone.makeDraggable({ droppables: [TrailStream.playlist], precalculate: true, revert: true, } }); // this returns the dragged element drag.start(e); // start the event manual }); });
