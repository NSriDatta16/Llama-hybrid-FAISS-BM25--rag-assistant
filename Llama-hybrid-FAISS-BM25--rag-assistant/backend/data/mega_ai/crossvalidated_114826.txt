If we increase the number of hidden layers then the neural network complexity increases. Moreover many application can be solved using one or two hidden layer. But for multiple hidden layers, proportionality plays a vital role. Also if hidden layer are increased then total time for training will also increase. Overfitting may arise due to network complexity. But if you aim is to achieve accuracy then multiple hidden layers can do that.
