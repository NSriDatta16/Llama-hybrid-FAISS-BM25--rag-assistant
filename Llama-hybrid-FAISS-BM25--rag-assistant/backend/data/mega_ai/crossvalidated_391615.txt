There is nothing inherent about coupling localization with classification. For example - you could, in principle, train a neural network to predict for a given image four values, representing the bounding box of an "object" in that image. If you have enough data and you engineer the network properly, this could actually work. More generally, people have sometimes referred to this problem of a class-generic object detector as "objectness". You can think of it as a foreground object segmentation task, where "object" is interpreted rather generally, so these approaches don't use specific class labels. Two concrete examples to get you started: the Objectness Measure quantifies how likely a given image window is to contain an object of any class, as opposed to backgrounds. To process an image, they have some approach for sampling a few candidate windows, and each window is evaluated based on their objectness measure. Another project that seems more up-to-date and less computationally heavy is Pixel Objectness . They produce a pixel-level mask for all "object-like" regions, which are not restricted to the object types encountered during training.
