There's no problem in having negative correlations, in fact, if you change C to -C the correlation will be positive and every machine learning model I know should be equivalent trained on a variable or the same one with the sign changed. So no, in any supervised case, regression or classification, it doesn't matter if there are negative correlations among features, and it happens almost every time.
