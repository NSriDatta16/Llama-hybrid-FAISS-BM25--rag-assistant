What does averaging do for the noise level of my signal

We are measuring data with a high sample rate (20 kHz) and calculated a big standard error due to our system setup. Currently we are only interested in slow signals (in the order of Hz's) is it valid to use averaging (once per 20.000 samples) and thus lower our standard error with an order 20.000?
