Just a few thoughts regarding some of the things you stated : "The solution proposed was the addition of a "Type" field... " If there is an apparent need for some of your business things to be 'typed' because somewhere somehow there exists some relevant distinction between obejcts of such distinct "types", then from a relational database persepective that is a key indication that you want/need to set up multiple tables (one for each type), AT LEAST at the logical level. How you organise that PHYSICALLY, is a different matter, and it is a sad but true reality that SQL fails to make a proper distinction between logical/physical, and it is an even sadder and truer reality that because of SQL's failure on that level, lots of developers don't have a clue on that level either. "Also, currently there is NO method to sort the items." Keep in mind that at the logical level, relational database do not know any concept of ordering. Ordering is a presentation issue. The dbms/database is only implicated in that its physical design characteristics (indexes, notably) CAN be used to provide the queried items ordering that the client/user asks for. Whether or not such indexes are included in the design is a physical database design decision. "They want to add a 'sort order' field to fix this." Sounds anywhere between "pretty silly" and "totally insane" to me (depending on what this sort order field is supposed to contain). "but they claim, this is how all databases are set up. It's what they are for." Sounds like fundamental ignorance to me. But I only read your part of the story, which is possibly biased. "the below hierarchy has many less duplicate entries and duplicate trees than the real page hierarchy". I'll tell you "what databases are for" : they are for registering statements/assertions of fact. Each row in a database represents a statement of fact, which is believed to be true. And now for the duplicates : "If something is true, then saying it twice will not make it any truer." Copyright E.F.Codd. No database should ever hold any duplicates (that are intended to mean the same thing, of course).
