Silverlight cross-scheme access to jpegs denied

I've got a Silverlight4 app that I'm running on https, deployed to Azure. Everything's working except for one small glitch. I've got content in the form of jpg thumbnails and associated zip files with a .gld extension. My app is supposed to display the thumbnails, and allow the users to download the associated .gld/zip files. The downloads works fine, but, the thumbnails won't display in my UI. I get AG_E_NETWORK_ERROR from my ImageFailed handler. I do have a clientaccesspolicy.xml file in the root of my cdn domain. Fiddler does not show Silverlight accessing this file. Here's the clientaccesspolicy.xml: I'm stumped as to how Silverlight can access the downloadable content, but not the image files. The app does pick up the thumbnails if I deploy them to blob storage in azure (with the same clientaccesspolicy.xml file in the $root folder), but it would be ideal if I can continue the same file structure that already exists on my cdn provider. Everything displays perfectly if the Silverlight app runs in http rather than https. Thanks in advance for any ideas! Michael Conner
