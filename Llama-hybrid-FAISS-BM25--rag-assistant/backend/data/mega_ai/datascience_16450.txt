This paper Apples-to-apples in cross-validation studies: pitfalls in classifier performance measurement by Forman and Scholz discuss the different methods for computing the average F-score in cross validation. The paper shows that under very high class imbalance some of the computation methods (average of individual folds F-scores or F-score based on average of individual folds precision and recall) can lead to biased results. The paper recommends computing the F-score by adding the TP, FP, FN from each fold, computing the precision and recall and finally the F-score.
