Get yourself set up and complete a "Hello World" tutorial, there are so many all over the next. Once you know you can compile a Java program and view the output. Think of a small program. It might something as simple as converting Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. Build that, using Google and whatever other resources you need to to find what you need to do. Once you get that running, think of something more complicated. Build that, keep doing this for a little while. By building real apps, that give you something you want you will be much more motivated and you will understand what you are doing better because all the curly details haven't been solved for you the way they are in online or book tutorials. You may not use the most elegant design but you will learn more. However at some point you will need to start to delve into books about Object Oriented architecture etc. but for now just jump in and force your brain to learn.
