How to produce a read only iphone app like a book

I'm new here to stackoverflow, so bear with me. I have a book that I wrote, that I would like to have available as an iPhone app. All I want it to do is just show my content. I have done some work putting my book into excel, then into a csv format for importing into a database, so the content is all organized ok, and is in fairly accessible condition. Can someone give me a point in the right direction? From a foundational standpoint whats the best way to make my book? Thanks
