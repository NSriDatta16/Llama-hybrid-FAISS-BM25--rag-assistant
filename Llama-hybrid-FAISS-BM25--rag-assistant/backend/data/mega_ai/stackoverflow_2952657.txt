Magento seasonal products

I'm looking for an easy way to set up a product in the Magento catalog so that it appears on a date that I specify and only until a date I specify. This would operate similarly to the current sale_from and sale_to dates, but hide the products entirely outside the given date range. For reference, this is for holiday products that are only relevant until a given date. Anyone? Thanks, Joe
