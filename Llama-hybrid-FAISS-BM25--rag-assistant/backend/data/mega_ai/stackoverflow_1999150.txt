Is it possible to have identically named source files in one visual studio c++ project?

I'm working on a static library project for a c++ course I'm taking. The teacher insists that we define only one function per source file, grouping files/functions belonging to the same class in subdirectories for each class. This results in a structure like: MyClass \MyClass.cc (constructor) \functionForMyClass.cc \anotherFunctionForMyClass.cc OtherClass \OtherClass.cc (constructor) Whether this is good practice or not is something I'd not like to discuss, since I'm simply obliged to organize my project in this manner. I'm working in visual studio 2008, and somehow got strange link errors when using an identically named function (and thus filename) in two classes. This appears to be caused by the fact that visual studio puts all .obj files (one for each source file) in one intermediate directory, overwriting earlier generated object files when compiling identically named source files. This could be solved by putting the object files in subdirectories based on the relative path of the input file. Visual studio allows one to configure the names of object files it generates and has macros to use in there, but there appears to be no macro for 'relative path of input file'. So, is there some way to get this to work? If not, is using one project for each class the best work-around?
