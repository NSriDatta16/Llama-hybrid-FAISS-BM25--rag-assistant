Using a rolling window is a very typical approach. Conceptually, they estimate the model every day using the last 500 days, so when a day is over, the next day they will update all the estimates based on the new most recent 500-day window. So they will re-estimate the whole model using the previous 499 observations plus the new one (yesterday observation). This is what they do conceptually. The reason why they do is simple: the problem with time series and all historical data in general is that when you use more data points (keeping the frequency constant), in general you have the benefit of more data. However this benefit may be partly offset by the fact that you will use old data, so you are exposed to the risk that something has structurally changed in the series and that behavior will not be recurring in the near future. Clearly there are ways to control for it, but in general this is a very common problem when you use historical data (the more data, the better, but the older data, the worse). At least this is something well known in financial literature. So the reason why they use a rolling window is to control for the problem of using data being too outdated and far in the past: indeed the window is shifted forward on each day, so that you will use the most recent and updated window of information for each estimate. the hope is that, within that window, no structural changes in the series have occurred (no change in the market behavior and functioning) and the recorded recent behavior will be comparable to that in the near future. That is also why, typically, those rolling windows are used to make 1-step-ahead forecast (or at most a very-few-step-ahead forecasts).
