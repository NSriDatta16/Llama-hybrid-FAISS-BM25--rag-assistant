Yes it will definitely affect the result. If you are going to use CNN pre-trained models for feature extraction you have to remove the last output layer. Along with that you have to remove all the densely(Fully) connected layers since those will act as ANN for processing to predict the results. We need only the features to be trained using other models like SVC, Random forest etc.
