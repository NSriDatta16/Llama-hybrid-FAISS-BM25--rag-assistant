Standard caveat about class overrides being the last resort for implementing your own functionality It's probably possible to fiddle with the loading of the Magento global config to strip out a core Magento Observer, but there's no supported way for doing it. However, consider how the Core observers are configured. widget/observer prepareWidgetsPluginConfig Observers are Magento Model classes. If a Model's been configured with the URI/path based syntax widget/observer as opposed to a full PHP class name Mage_Widget_Model_Observer you can create an override for the Observer Model class (just as you can for any other Model). If a PHP class name's been used, you're out of luck. (You could place a local file in local/Mage/Widget/Model/Observer.php if you're willing to take on the responsibility of maintenance, but I don't recommend it) So, to override the above observer, you would Create a custom module that include an override for the class Mage_Widget_Model_Observer. In your override class, either redeclare prepareWidgetsPluginConfig to do what you want OR override the specific method. This could include a empty method to completely remove the functionality.
