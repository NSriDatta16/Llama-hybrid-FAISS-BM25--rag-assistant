I do not dispute @Porter's Answer (+1). However, it seems useful to focus directly on the key difficulty with CIs based on data from small finite populations. If you take too large a sample from a small population, t methods no longer work. The t statistic becomes much less variable than a true Student's t distribution. In particular, the "95%" CI becomes very short and it's coverage probability approaches 100% as sample size $n$ approaches the size $N$ of a finite 'population' chosen to be roughly normal. I have done too many simulations (in R) to show here, but a few are shown below to illustrate my main point. Finite population. Begin with a fictitious "population" s of size $N = 110$ with known $\mu = 1000, \sigma = 200,$ as in the Question. set.seed(123) z1 = rnorm(110) z2 = (z1-mean(z1))/sd(z1) s = z2 * 200 + 1000 mean(s); sd(s) [1] 1000 [1] 200 qqnorm(s, col="skyblue2"); qqline(s, lwd=2) Take samples of size $n=10,$ less than 10% of $N.$ set.seed(2021) n = 10 # less than 110 m = 10^5; a.sm = s.sm = t0.sm = numeric(m) for (i in 1:m) { x.sm = sample(s, n) a.sm[i] = mean(x.sm) s.sm[i] = sd(x.sm) t0.sm[i] = (mean(x.sm) - 1000)*sqrt(n)/sd(x.sm) } mean(abs(t0.sm) For $n = 50,$ coverage probability is about 99%; for $n = 100,$ nearly 100%. [Change n in code above, simulations not shown.] Graph for $n = 100$ below: hdr = "n=100, N=110; Null Dist'n of T with T(99) Density" hist(t0.sm, prob=T, xlim=c(-3,3), col="skyblue2", main=hdr) curve(dt(x,99), add=T, col="red", lwd=2) Infinite population. For samples of size $n=100$ from a population of unrestricted size (using rnorm ), of course, coverage probability is 95%. set.seed(2021); n = 100 m = 10^5; a = s = t0 = numeric(m) for (i in 1:m) { x = rnorm(n, 1000, 200) a[i] = mean(x) s[i] = sd(x) t0[i] = (mean(x) - 1000)*sqrt(n)/sd(x) } mean(abs(t0)
