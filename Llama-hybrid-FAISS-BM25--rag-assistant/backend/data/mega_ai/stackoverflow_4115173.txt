Any efficient searching algorithm will require sorted input data. Then you can easily retrieve the bounding indexes in O(log(n)) time. Constant time retrieval can probably only be achieved by generating a lookup table. If you know the bounds for a and b, that should not be too hard. You'll be trading time efficiency for memory space, though. Guess this is what you mean by "counting sort".
