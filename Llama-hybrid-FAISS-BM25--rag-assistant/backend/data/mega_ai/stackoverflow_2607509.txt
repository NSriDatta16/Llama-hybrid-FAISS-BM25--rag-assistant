The most important thing in a development team is to stick to the standards, even if you dont agree with the standards. If everyone does their own thing, then there is no point in having standards. You could keep the unit tests for your own personal satisfaction/confidence. Maybe one day you can demonstrate that your approach has stop a bug from reoccuring or benefitted the team in some way and then it may be easier to get your point accross. One day you will be the guy setting the standards and then some people will disagree with you. Then you can tell them this story. Disclaimer: I use unit tests when appropriate and anyone who works for me will be encouraged to as well.
