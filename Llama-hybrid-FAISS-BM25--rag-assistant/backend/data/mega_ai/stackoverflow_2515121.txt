Best IDE for javascript server development

After reading http://www.pragprog.com/magazines/2010-03/javascript-its-not-just-for-browsers-any-more I'm wondering which is the best IDE to develop server-side javascript applications? I want a nice development environment with commonjs and node etc. Preferably windows but anything is interesting really. Is there any IDE with some nifty refactoring tools, maybe some intellisense-like function, etc etc.. Or is it notepad++ ftw?
