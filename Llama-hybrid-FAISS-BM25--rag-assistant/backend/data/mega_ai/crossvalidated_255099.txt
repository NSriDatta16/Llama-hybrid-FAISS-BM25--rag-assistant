Consider using Dirichlet Process K-means original paper with implementation on github . The DP means algorithm creates new clusters as more data arrives. It doesn't require a prior knowledge of the number of clusters K. DP means is a Bayesian non-parametric extension of the K-means algorithm based on small variance asymptotics (SVA) approximation of the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model.
