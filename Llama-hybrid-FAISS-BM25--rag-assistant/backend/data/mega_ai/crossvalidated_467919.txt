It’s impossible to say in general. It’s even impossible to say in general what makes for an acceptable $R^2$ value in linear regression! This will depend on the problem at hand and what has been done on the same or similar data sets. You may think that 95% accuracy is fantastic. For MNIST, for instance, that’s nothing special. Finally, I would encourage you to read what Frank Harrell and others on this Stack have to say about accuracy (even AUC) as opposed to “proper scoring rules” (such as Brier score). Shamelessly, I will link a post of mine where I challenge this a bit, though it even contains an example where you can see an argument for why accuracy might not be the best performance metric. Proper scoring rule when there is a decision to make (e.g. spam vs ham email)
