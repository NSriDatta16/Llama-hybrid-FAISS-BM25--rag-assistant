The standard DQN architecture as presented in the original " Human level control through deep reinforcement learning " Nature paper actually takes as input the 4 last states to take a decision. Using $k$ last states could work in some situations, however it limits the scope of available "memory". Using recurrent neural networks could be another solution to look into (see DRQN).
