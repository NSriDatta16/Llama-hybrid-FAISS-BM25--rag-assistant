Ordinal logistic regression is a fine choice for this situation. Your one issue is what to do with your independent variables. I would recommend against collapsing categories into just high vs. low, in general. For ordinal categories, you could represent them as nominal, via dummy codes, or represent them with a set of continuous numbers that represent your theoretical belief about the appropriate underlying values that are represented by each category. The latter is an approach advocated by Agresti (you could use his Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis as a citation, if you need one). He makes this suggestion based on the fact that your models will be approximately right unless your posited continuous values are way off.
