SQLServer Binary Data with ActiveRecord and JDBC

I'm using the activerecord-jdbc-adapter with ActiveRecord to be able to access a SQLServer database for Rails Application running under jRuby and am having trouble inserting binary data. The Exception I am getting is below. Note I just have a blurb for the binary data from the fixtures that was working fine for MySQL. ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: ActiveRecord::ActiveRecordError: Operand type clash: nvarchar is incompatible with image: INSERT INTO blobstorage_datachunks ([id], [datafile_id], [chunk_number], [data]) VALUES (369397133, 663419003, 0, N'GIF89a@') When I created the tables the migration had binary and SQLServer used Image instead. We're using Rails 2.3.5, SQLServer Express 2008. What I'm looking for is a way to get the binary data into SQLServer with ActiveRecord. Thanks in advance for the help.
