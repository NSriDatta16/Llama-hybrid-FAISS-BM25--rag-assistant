You might be able to glean some information using tools such as Spy++ to look at Windows messages. Debugging/tracing tools ( Windbg , or etc.) may allow you to see API calls that are in process. The Sysinternals tools can show you system information to some degree of detail of usage. Although I would recommend against this for the most part -- is it possible to contact the solution provider and get documentation? One reason for that is fragility -- if a vendor is not expecting users to utilize that aspect of the interface, they are more likely to change it without notice.
