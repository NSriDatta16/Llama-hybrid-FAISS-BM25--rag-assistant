Selective serialization with SubSonic generated classes

I've been using SubSonic 2 for a while now, but as I am starting a new project, I'd like to upgrade to 3. In my old project, I used a custom, non-sustainable hack to serialize things for web services. I really would like to find a more elegant solution. I'm using Mono, so I need to stay within implemented classes, e.g. DataContractSerializer is probably out. Still on ASMX, though would love to upgrade to WCF as soon as the support is solid. Moonlight/Silverlight will be the initial clients. JSON/protobuf in the future... The standard Xml serializer is opt-out, so I'd need some way to take control of it. Which brings me to IXmlSerializable. I'm rather unfamiliar with SS's templates, but it seems that editing these would allow me to generate the serialization code necessary to not touch the rest of the hierarchy chain. Is this a "good idea"? I'd love to just use SS's POCO support, but I don't think it supports complex types or arrays. Other thoughts/options?
