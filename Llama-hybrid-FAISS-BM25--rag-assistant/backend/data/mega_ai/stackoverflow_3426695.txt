Things using NSURLRequest use NSHTTPCookieStorage by default. Of course, cookies aren't shared between apps. You can additionally store things with NSUserDefaults or using the keychain (SecKeychain* functions); the keychain APIs are a bit cumbersome but there are examples out there. I'd prefer using the keychain for anything particularly sensitive; most files are stored unencrypted and most people don't enable encrypted backups (I'm not sure whether using the keychain with no passcode is secure either, but hey...) You might also want to worry about how long the token is saved for (typing on an iPhone is a pain and browsers don't save passwords by default) and how easily it can be revoked.
