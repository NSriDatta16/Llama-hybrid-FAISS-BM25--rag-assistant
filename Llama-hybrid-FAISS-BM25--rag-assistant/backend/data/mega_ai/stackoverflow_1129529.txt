Heres something I found on the publib site: Comparing IDENTITY columns and sequences While there are similarities between IDENTITY columns and sequences, there are also differences. The characteristics of each can be used when designing your database and applications. An identity column has the following characteristics: An identity column can be defined as part of a table only when the table is created. Once a table is created, you cannot alter it to add an identity column. (However, existing identity column characteristics might be altered.) An identity column automatically generates values for a single table. When an identity column is defined as GENERATED ALWAYS, the values used are always generated by the database manager. Applications are not allowed to provide their own values during the modification of the contents of the table. A sequence object has the following characteristics: A sequence object is a database object that is not tied to any one table. A sequence object generates sequential values that can be used in any SQL or XQuery statement. Since a sequence object can be used by any application, there are two expressions used to control the retrieval of the next value in the specified sequence and the value generated previous to the statement being executed. The PREVIOUS VALUE expression returns the most recently generated value for the specified sequence for a previous statement within the current session. The NEXT VALUE expression returns the next value for the specified sequence. The use of these expressions allows the same value to be used across several SQL and XQuery statements within several tables. While these are not all of the characteristics of these two items, these characteristics will assist you in determining which to use depending on your database design and the applications using the database.
