Visual Studio 2010 Project on shared folder: fatal error C1033: cannot open program database

I am running Windows 7 inside VMWare on a Mac as I am working on a cross plattform project. I want to keep all my plattform independent files in the same folder - that's why I want to organize everything in a folder on the mac and share it with windows that's running in the VM. When I try to compile the project in the shared folder, I get fatal error C1033: cannot open program database '\vmware-host\shared folders\audio\vst3 sdk\base\win\win32\debug.base_vc9\base_vc9.pdb' I am able to write and read files on that folder using the windows explorer. Did try to run Visual Studio as administrator. Didn't help. If I just copy my folder from the shared folder to the local drive I am able to compile the project without any problems. But it's not an option to copy my whole project just to make a windows build. Does anyone have a clue what's going on? How do I get around this? Update: I disabled my antivirus in Windows: Didn't help. However, a colleague from work pointed me to a workaround: Setup SMB File Sharing under Mac os and connect to the samba share with windows. Surprisingly I am able to compile the project on the samba share. Would be glad if anyone could explain that issue though.
