Extracting text from few areas on product label

I'm trying to achieve algorithm that will extract text from few areas(marked with red color) on label(similar to attached image) and QR code on a single photo taken with mobile camera so label may be in a little bit different position. I'm struggling with choosing and executing good enough solution to accomplish it. I was wondering about labeling images with marked boxes around my area of intersts and then put it into some CNN. I've encounter some interesting paper on text spotting but I'm not sure if it would be good solution for my problem. I will be more than thankful for any help and suggestions. Thanks in advance :)
