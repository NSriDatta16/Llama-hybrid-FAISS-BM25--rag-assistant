Does LSTM just mocking previous data?

I am trying to do a numerical time series prediction using LSTM but it seems that the LSTM just mocking previous data(Even when I use many-to-many prediction with different lengths) and when I plot the results that I get from LSTM , I a have very similar graph to real graph just with a time-delay! The green graph is real and yellow graph is LSTM prediction(mocking).
