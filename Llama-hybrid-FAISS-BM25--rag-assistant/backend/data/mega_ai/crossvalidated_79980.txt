Initial Probabilities of an HMM

I have a learned Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from a certain sequential data using Gibbs sampling. I have managed to obtain the transition probabilities (transition matrix) of the Markov chain and the params of the probability distributions of the hidden states. The only set of params that I have yet been able to obtain are the initial probabilities $\pi$ that specify where the Markov chain would start. So given the parameters that I have estimated, is there a way to figure out $\pi$? Or how can I specify the Gibbs sampler to find out $\pi$?
