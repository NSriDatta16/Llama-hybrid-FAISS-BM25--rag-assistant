You probably should have posted a little more context for code. Here is the paragraph in Programming Collective Intelligence which immediately precedes that code: This function will create a new node in the hidden layer every time it is passed a combination of words that it has never seen together before. The function then creates default-weighted links between the words and the hidden node, and between the query node and the URL results returned by this query. I realize it still doesn't help answer your question, but it would have helped Gareth Rees out with his answer by giving less guesswork. Gareth still got it correct, anyway, since he's clever. The intention is to restrict the number of word nodes a hidden node can be associated with, and the author chose the arbitrary number of 3. Just to agree with Gareth, again, that paragraph should have totally been in the docstring, and the purpose of the line in question should have been in a comment above the line. I hope the next edition isn't so sloppy.
