If the treeview is going to collapse every time the user is navigating to another page/node, it is going to annoy the hell out of them. It is not acceptable from an end-users perspective if they are going to make more than at most two rounds at it. I would say that it is very good that you uses good old pages if the users are going to bookmark and/or send links to the different parts of the application, or especially if you want Google, Yahoo! et.c. to index your application. Else you can use an IFrame / #hash-link combination for your application; the IFrame can generate history events, thus forward and backward navigation even if the user is on the same top-page. On the state for the treeview you can use localstorage for the most browsers to store the current state including all the data, for other browsers you can use " Flash cookies ", which allows for storage up to 100kb.
