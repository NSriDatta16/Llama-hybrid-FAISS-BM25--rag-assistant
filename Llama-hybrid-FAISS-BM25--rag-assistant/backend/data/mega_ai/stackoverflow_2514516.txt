How to make nested vertical menu with jQuery accordion?

Can anyone point me to a good example on how to implement nested vertical menu using jQuery accordion? Something like here (at the left of the page, starting from third item), but nested. There is no example of nested structure in Accordion docs on some reason. Or may be there is a good jQuery component on organizing vertical nested menus I somehow missed (whatever based, not necessarily accordion)? I beleive there should be one. Can you suggest some with good initial design and preferably easily skinnable?
