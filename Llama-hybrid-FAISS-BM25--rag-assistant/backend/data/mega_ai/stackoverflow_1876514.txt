In machine learning : we use Bayesian (and other probabilistic) models all the time, and we use quadratic programming in the form of Support Vector Machines , not to mention all kinds of mathematical transformations for the various kernel functions . Calculus (derivatives) factors into perceptron learning. Not to mention a whole theory of determining the accuracy of a machine learning classifier. In artifical intelligence : constraint satisfaction, and logic weigh very heavily.
