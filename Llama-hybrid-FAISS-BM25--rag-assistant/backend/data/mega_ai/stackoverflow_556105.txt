Why isn't this library linking with a pragma comment?

I'm using Fmod in a project I'm working on in Visual C++ 2008. If I include ../fmodapi375win/api/lib/fmodvc.lib in Project->Linker->Input, it works fine, but for some reason if I use #pragma comment(lib,"../fmodapi375win/api/lib/fmodvc.lib") instead it works the same as if that line wasn't there: it builds with no linker errors then crashes with a stack overflow from a million access violation exceptions. What's going on, and how can I fix it so I can define the lib in code?
