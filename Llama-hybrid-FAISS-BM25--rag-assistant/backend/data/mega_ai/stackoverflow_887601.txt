If your goal is to make the user distinguishable at a glance within the chat room, it depends on how large your user base is. If the average size of a chat room is, say, 10, but your user base is in the thousands, having a unique color for each of them is not going to work. Eventually you would end up with slightly different shades of the same color showing up in the same chat room. In that case just keep a short list of blatantly different colors and assign them within the single chat room.
