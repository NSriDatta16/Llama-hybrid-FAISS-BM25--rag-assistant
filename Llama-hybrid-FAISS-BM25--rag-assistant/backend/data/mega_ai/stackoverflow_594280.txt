Something to keep in mind: arrays can easily be added to a memory cache (eaccelerator, XCache, ..), while objects cannot (they need to get serialized when storing and unserialized on every retrieval!). You may switch to using arrays instead of objects when you want to add memory cache support - but by that time you may have to change a lot of code already, which uses the previously used object type return values.
