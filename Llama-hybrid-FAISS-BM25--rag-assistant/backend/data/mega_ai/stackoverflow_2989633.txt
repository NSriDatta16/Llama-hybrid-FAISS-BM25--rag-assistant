As can be seen in Creating Menus sub menus can not contain sub menus. You could show a Context menu after clicking on the item in the options menu. This could show your five more options in a floating view above the screen. You have to overwrite the onCreateContextMenu to create a ContextMenu and I think you have to call the contextMenu manually in the onOptionsItemSelected method. For resources on how to create the context menu see this paragraph in the article mentioned above. To open the ContextMenu you can call openContextMenu in your Activity. You may need to register the menuitem before to enable your activity to find the correct context menu.
