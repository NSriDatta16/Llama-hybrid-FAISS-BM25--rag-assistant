No, they are not O.K., but I've implemented a few allocators, memory dumpers, and leak detectors, and have found that as a pragmatic matter it's convenient to allow one to mark such an allocation as "Not a Leak as far as the Leak Report is concerned" ... This helps make the leak report more useful... and not crowded with "dynamic allocation at static scope not free'd by program exit"
