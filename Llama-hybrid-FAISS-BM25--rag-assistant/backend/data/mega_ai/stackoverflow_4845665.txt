where are the project assets stored in wp7?

I wanted to access a few of my assets ... in particular, my app comes with a bunch of text files and mp3 files. They are not downloaded from the net later, but come with the app itself. so I was wondering how the isolated storage comes into the picture if at all ? all I want to do is read the text file / play the mp3 file. And these files come with the app itself. I know the location of the files relative to the project folder. some thing like : project/textFiles/textFile1.txt ... project/mp3Files/mp3File1.txt ... how do I access these files ? the general filestream / streamreader ....doesn't seem to be working.
