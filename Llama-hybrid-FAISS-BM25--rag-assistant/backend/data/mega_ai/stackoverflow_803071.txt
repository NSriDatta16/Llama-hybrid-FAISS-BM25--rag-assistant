You don't just have to worry about character count, you also have to worry about image heights if there are images or any other kind of embedded objects in your pages that can take up height. Character count will also not give you an idea of paragraph structure (a single long paragraph with more characters than a page with many paragraphs might be shorter). If you're willing to use JavaScript, that might be the ideal solution, post the entire article to the client and let JavaScript handle the pagination. From the client you can detect image and object heights. You could use PHP to place markers about where you think the pages should be, and then use JavaScript to make it happen. Unless the pages are very long I don't think you'll need to do several xmlHttpRequests (AJAX). For just a straight PHP solution is also simple, but probably not ideal as you're not dealing with a matter of managing row counts. You could use a GET variable to determine where you are in the page.
