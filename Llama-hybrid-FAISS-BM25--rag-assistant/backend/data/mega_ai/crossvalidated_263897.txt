Severe Case of Missing data

I have a dataset with i number of variables. One of the variables has only 50% available data ( total is about 1500). If I distribute the records into regions (=27) (or stratum), sample size per stratum would be too small. If I do multiple imputation, will the resulting dataset valid for per stratum analysis? The set of predictors I will use to do the multiple imputation can correctly classify the records about 60% at a time based on a multinomial logistic regression result.
