Analysis of a time series with a fixed and random factor in R

I have a dataset which I am not sure how to analyse. The dataset came from the following experiment: I grew plants (2 different types) and measured their height at different time point (each plant was followed individually). I had in total, 3 boxes in which I grew the plants and, in each box, 3 plants of each type. I took the measurement at 4 different time points. So, if I am not wrong, the plant type is a fixed factor and the box a random one. Here is how it is structured: time, box, type, height 1, 1, 1, 1.2 1, 1, 1, 1.3 1, 1, 1, 1.1 1, 1, 2, 1.4 1, 1, 2, 1.5 1, 1, 2, 1.6 ... 2, 1, 1, 1.2 2, 1, 1, 1.3 ... 1, 2, 1, 1.2 1, 2, 1, 1.3 I would like to know what is the correct way to check if there is a difference between the different plant types using R So far, what I have done is this: lme1 but I do not know how to include the time variable in the analysis.. Here is the plot of the height evolution with time, for the different plant type. Each line is a plant.
