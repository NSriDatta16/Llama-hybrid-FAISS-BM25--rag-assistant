You seem to be confused betwen two different models which both uses the term logistic , but else has little in common: Logistic regression, used with binary responses. Here the logistic function is used to model the conditional probability for success , given the observed values of the predictor variables $X$ . Nonlinear regression for a numerical response variable, with the conditional expectation for the response $Y$ modeled via a logistic (or logit ) curve. Typically estimated via nonlinear least squares. For examples see Regression with nonlinear function (almost logistic) or Confidence intervals for values estimated from the nonlinear regression model .
