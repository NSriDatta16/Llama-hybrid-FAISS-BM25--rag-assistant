To improve database performance you typically look for ways to: Reduce the number of database calls Making each database call as efficient as possible (via good design) Reduce the amount of data to be transfered ...and you are doing the exact opposite? Deliberately? On what grounds? I'm sorry, you are doing this entirely wrong, and every single problem you encounter down this road will all be consequences of that first decision to implement a database engine outside of the database engine. You will be forced to work around work-arounds all the way to delivery date. (if you get there). Also, we are talking about a forum? I mean, come on! Even on the most "web-scale-awesome-sauce" forums we're talking about less than what, 100 tps on average? You could do that on your laptop! My advice is to forget about all this and implement things the most simple possible way. Then cache the aggregates (most recent, popular, statistics, whatever) in the application layer. Everything else in a forum is already primary key lookups.
