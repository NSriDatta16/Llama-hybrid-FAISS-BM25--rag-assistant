Listing here two Bayesian Network Classifiers projects that I am aware of: CI Bayes - active, last release is 2.0, released on 6th of Oct 2010 and available from their Maven2 repository jBNC - inactive for several years, listing it here just for completeness sake. I'm not sure how they compare to Infer.NET, so you better make your own tests.
