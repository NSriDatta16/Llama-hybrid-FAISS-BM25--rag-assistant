Django stopped running tests

Hey, I have a problem similar to this one ( click ). Approx 2 hours ago Django stopped running my tests. And I have no idea why. I did some refactoring, then got an ImportError and after I reverted the file, Django stopped running any of my tests. I already deleted all the *.pyc files but nothing changed. The situation: I organize all my tests in a sperate test-package. The structure is the following: /app /tests /model __init__.py ... __init__.py ... The __init__.py files define a suite() method that will return all the tests inside the packages like this: def suite(): suite = TestSuite() suite.addTest(model.suite()) suite.addTest(user.suite()) return suite I tried to debug and set a breakpoint in the topmost __init__.py file in the test-package but this breakpoint is never reached. Any ideas what I am missing?
