Accuracy, Precision, Recall RMSE and MAE values are same for SVM, Naive Bayes and Random Forest

I am studying on sentiment analysis of tourist reviews. 90% of reviews are positive the rest are negative. My Accuracy, Precision, Recall RMSE, and MAE values are the same for SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. Is it possible or is there any mistake? Btw, I am using Python. Thank you.
