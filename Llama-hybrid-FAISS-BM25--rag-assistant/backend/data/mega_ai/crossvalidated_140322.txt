Model comparison between glm (with Firth correction), random Forest, penalised SVM

I am currently developing three models to classify features of gene sites. I was using glm (with Firth correction), random Forest and SVM to build the models and I used forward and backward selection for glm ( forward and backward functions from logistf ), selection using the oob error (with the function varSelRF from the package varSelRF ) and the function svm.fs from the package penalizedSVM to select variables for the models. I used cross-validation to validate the model building of training data. I generated ROC curves of the performance on the test data as I want to use ROC as a goodness-of-fit measure. Now my question: In terms of the best (i.e. best predictive accuracy) model, is it enough to compare the AUC of each ROC curve and choose the model with the highest AUC as the best model? Thanks for your answer!
