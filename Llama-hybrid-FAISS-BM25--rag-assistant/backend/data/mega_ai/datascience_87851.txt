Will images modification get me a better machine learning model?

Will images modification get me a better machine learning model? I have the following scenario. Camera is fixed and does photos of a process. The process has a few states. Now I want to train a model given a photo to classify to which state, does the photo belong. I.e. what is the current state of the process. For the model training I was given only one photo for each of the process state. Now my question is whether I should train my model with one photo in each class or should I take that one photo and do random modifications to the photo so that to get a few photos for each class? I am thinking that it is better for the training to have just one but real photo. Instead of a lot modified. Am I right? I use the ML.NET plugin for a Visual Studio to train the image classification model.
