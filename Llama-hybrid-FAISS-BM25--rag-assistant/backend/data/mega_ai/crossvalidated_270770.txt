Logit model - why is also important to have highly correctly predicted borrowers?

I am trying to make model with logistic regression. My results are: At first my results with CUTOFF 0.5 was: good borrowers predicted: 95.02% and 33.05% for bad borrowers. then I realize that the predicton of bad borrowers are low only (33.05%) so I try to make better results so then I changed the cut off to 0.2 and the results was: good borrowers predicted: 74.97% and 75.91% for bad borrowers. My question is why is also important to have high score of good borrowers for model? Are these results considered a good? Yes it is true that is unbalanced is that not good sample then? Yes overall model with cutoff at 0.5 does better but only predict 33.05% bad borrowers which is not good. I do this in Eviews (which I regret) because you can not do ROC curve inside this software. Why is important to predict good borrowers also not only bad borrowers?
