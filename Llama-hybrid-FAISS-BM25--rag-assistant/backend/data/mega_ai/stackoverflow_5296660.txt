How to determine lag in time series?

I am working on a time series problem and want to decompose to get some basic info on lag. Goal is to evaluate lag of the output variable based on changes in the change variable as part of the example data.frame below. Full data.frame has more data but it is all by week and follows the same structure as this example. year I created a time series object with the following. timeObject However, when I ran decompose(timeObject) I got an error message stating that I had no or less than 2 periods. I'm clearly missing something here, any advice is appreciated.
