No, Chrome unfortunately (?) won't sync your WebSQL DB. You have to handle syncing through your server. Just look at the choices Chrome gives you in the sync preferences: Preferences Bookmarks Extensions Autofill Themes Apps Notice that not even Cookies are listed, let alone WebSQL databases. Syncing Databases would also be technically difficult, because they can get pretty big. The initial limit for WebSQL databases seems to be 5MB or something like that, but they can request more as needed. I think installed web apps can even request unlimited storage permissions. Also there would be concurrency problems if two users edited the same data at the same time.
