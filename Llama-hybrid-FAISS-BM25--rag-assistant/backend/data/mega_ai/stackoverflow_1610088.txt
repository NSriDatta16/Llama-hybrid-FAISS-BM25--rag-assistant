A few years ago, I would have agreed completely. More recently, a doubt began to make its way, because that makes taking the address of a getter or setter ambiguous. With tools like tr1::bind, this is really annoying. For example: struct A { void Foo(int); int Foo()const; }; std::vector v = ....; std::vector foos; // Extract Foo std::transform( v.begin(), v.end(), std::back_inserter(foos), //Ambiguous // std::tr1::bind(&A::Foo) //must write this instead. Yuck! std::tr1::bind(static_cast (&A::Foo)); ); Leaving aside the question of should you have them at all ;-)
