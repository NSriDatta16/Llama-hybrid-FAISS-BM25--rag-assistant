I guess not; It's better to do it like this: CompanyName Slogan here Since your logo is part of the layout and not a image in context (for example a product picture) you should put it in the h1 background. Do your CSS like this: h1 { background-image: url(logo.png); width: 200px; height: 80px; cursor: pointer; } h1 span { display: none; } This way it is both readable for the and user and a search engine.
