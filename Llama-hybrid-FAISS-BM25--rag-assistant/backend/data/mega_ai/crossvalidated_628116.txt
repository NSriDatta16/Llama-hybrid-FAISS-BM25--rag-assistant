my goal is to minimize the number of actions to get one reward That seems to change to setting quite a bit. Does that mean that you are playing until you get one reward, and then the episode ends? (And your goal is to minimize the amount of rounds before the first reward is generated.) If that's the case, then the awerage reward observed from all arms is 0 for the whole game before end. Thus, the optimal strategy would be to play the arm with smallest amount of attempts in each round. (i.e. cycle between all arms, until the first reward is generated.)
