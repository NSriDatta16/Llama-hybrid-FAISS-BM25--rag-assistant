Does bayesian neural network good for text/document classification?

I've tried to do my research online, but I find most of them are image classification . I guess that is because nature(downside) of Bayesian DL: it's significantly slower than traditional DL, then few people use it for text/doc classification. Am I right? Or is there a more specific reason for that. Please correct me if I'm wrong/ missing some text/document implement on code during my research, thanks guys!
