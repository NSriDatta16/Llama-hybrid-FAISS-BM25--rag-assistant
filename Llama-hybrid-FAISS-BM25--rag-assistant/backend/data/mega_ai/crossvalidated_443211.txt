I would suggest calculating the cophenetic distance(also called cophenetic coefficient). For items belonging to multiple sets, we can evaluate the average cophenetic distance of the object from the other set. Here is a link to the brief description of the same: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cophenetic It can be evaluated from this function in python: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.0/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.cophenet.html
