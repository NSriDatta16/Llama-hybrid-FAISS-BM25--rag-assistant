This is not a common complaint, which makes it likely it is environmental. Some random shots in the dark: Not having at least 2 GB of RAM Installing VS2010 on an old machine with a badly fragmented disk drive Editing extremely large source code files (> 10,000 lines) Keeping a very large number of editor tabs opened (> 50) A bad interaction with a Visual Studio add-on A bad interaction with a system add-on The IntelliSense engine for C++ has lots of tweakable items in Tools + Options, Text Editor, C/C++, Advanced. This blog post describes these options in detail. If your machine is old and not well maintained (i.e. never ran a disk defrag, lots of shell extension handlers) then consider a new one or a system wipe.
