Have you looked into using the CSS z-index property to make the container dev be "on top" of the svg? Because the div is (presumably) transparent, you will still see the image exactly as before. This, I believe, is the best-practice, non-hack, intended way of solving your problem. z-index is only useful for elements that have a position property of fixed , relative , or, as you've heard, absolute . However, you don't actually have to move the object. For example: .svgwrapper { position: relative; z-index: 1; } For what it's worth, it would also be a little more elegant and safe to not use onClick at all, but instead to bind the click event using javascript. That's another issue altogether, though.
