You can use Python directly with CGI. It should be faster than calling Python from PHP. It should be easier to configure too. Simple example. #!/usr/bin/python import cgi; import codecs; form = cgi.FieldStorage() my_a = form.getvalue("a","") wFile = codecs.open("test.txt", "w", "utf8") wFile.write(my_a); wFile.close() print("Content-Type: text/plain") print("Location: ../plain.html") print() You have to put this python file into directory for CGI scripts. The most common is /cgi-bin/ . Well, the server may need some configuration too. The 3 last lines are simple http headers. In my example it just redirect to other site. There is no content to display. The getvalue("a","") will return value of field "a" or the empty string (second argument). Well, almost regular Python file.
