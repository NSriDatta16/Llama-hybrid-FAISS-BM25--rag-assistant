It is the responsibility of the calling function to provide valid input and implicitely anything not in the enum is invalid (Pragmatic programmer seems to imply this). That said, this implies that any time you change your enum, you must change ALL code that accepts it as input (and SOME code that yields it as output). But that is probably true anyways. If you have an enum that changes often, you probably should be using something other than an enum, considering that enums are normally compile-time entities.
