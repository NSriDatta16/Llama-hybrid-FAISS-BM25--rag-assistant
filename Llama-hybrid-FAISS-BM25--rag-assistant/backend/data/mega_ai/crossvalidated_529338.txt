What is the influence of the number of channels on the input of a CNN?

Let's say I want to pass an RGB image through a CNN. It has three channels, each containing a 8 bit integer per pixel, ranging from 0 to 255. Let's say I know encode this three channels in only one channel, using a "24 bit integer" that ranges from 0 to 16777216 for each pixel. What are some practical differences in processing this two inputs in the current frameworks (tf, torch, etc)?
