The problem you describe in your question is discussed in detail in the following paper: Bojinov, Iavor, and Neil Shephard. "Time series experiments and causal estimands: exact randomization tests and trading." Journal of the American Statistical Association 114, no. 528 (2019): 1665-1682. It would not be very useful to summarize the paper here, because of the significant amount of setup that would be required; besides, you state that you are looking for a "canonical answer."
