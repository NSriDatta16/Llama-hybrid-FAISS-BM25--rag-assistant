For handling external email, I would look into using a Bayesian filter to categorize them. This is how many of the most successful spam filters work, and that technique can be adapted for classifying content other than spam. I haven't used it, but try NClassifier . If that doesn't work, search for Bayesian filter and see what turns up.
