How many people at any given time

I have been tasked with finding out approximately how many people were in a location at a given time. I know how many people arrived per hour and how many people left per hour and the average time someone was here by arrival hour. So data looks like so: arr hourly_arrival avg_time_here hourly_leaving 0 1631 7 2575 1 1294 7 2434 2 1135 6 2248 3 930 6 2011 4 878 7 1803 5 856 7 1619 6 1152 6 1603 7 1710 6 1091 8 2354 6 1487 9 3153 5 1605 10 3652 6 1913 11 3873 6 2220 12 3901 6 2642 13 3766 6 2983 14 3623 6 3355 15 3672 6 3515 16 3613 6 3607 17 3644 6 3672 18 3735 6 3599 19 3654 6 3343 20 3423 6 3702 21 3072 6 3832 22 2675 6 3595 23 2124 6 3092 0 being midnight and 23 being 11pm. What is the best way to go about this? What I have done is the following but it just does not seem right. I took the hourly_arrival column and divided each row by 365.25 as the data encompasses a year and got the average arrival per hour. The avg_time_here column represents the average hours someone is here for that given arrival hour. For hourly leaving, I did the same as hourly_arriving. avg_hrl_arrival becomes avg_hrl_arr = hourly_arrival / 365.25 avg_hrl_leave becomes avg_hrl_leave = hourly_leaving / 365.25 Then at each hour I said avg_people_here is avg_people_here = avg_hrl_arr * avg_time_here
