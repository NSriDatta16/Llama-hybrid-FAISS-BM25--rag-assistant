Validation set in presence of cross-validation

I am new to machine learning and want to ask regarding a confusion I have. I have a data set which is labeled and I want to do supervised learning. My question is related to cross-validation and validation set. I checked other SO question like this and a paper from academia. I understand that I need training and test sets. I have labeled set of data, so I see that cross-validation may be an option for me to check my classifier accuracy (correct me if I'm wrong on the accuracy part). I want to ask if I plan to do the above, will validation set still have any significance ? I read that it is used to try different settings for the algorithms. If I do try different settings e.g. if I try Naive Bayes and do 10 fold cross-validation, and also want to try some settings for Naive Bayes, what is will be validation set in this situation or is a validation set even needed ?
