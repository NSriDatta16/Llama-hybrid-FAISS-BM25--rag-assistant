You may want to have a look at this very readable article (especially the introduction): http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/guyon03a/guyon03a.pdf The article first outlines basic questions that give an easy-to-grasp horizon when and how to proceed with feature selection. Furthermore, it gives an overview about single and multiple variable selection methods, most of which are available off-the-shelf in the usual ML libraries. As you note that you have a "large universe of features", section 5 on dimensionality reduction gives a good start to get "more informative" features to be fed into classifiers that do not just find linear connections.
