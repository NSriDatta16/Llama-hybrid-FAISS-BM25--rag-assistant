You don't need a classifier for what you're doing in the first step necessarily. DNN classifiers consist of two parts, a feature extractor and a classification head. The feature extractor typically makes most of the networks parameters and the classifier head is often just a simple linear model. Basically you transform your data into a space where you can easily make decisions with a linear model. However, training this model jointly requires tons of labeled data. Instead, you could also use a feature extractor in an unsupervised fashion where you only require large amounts of unlabeled data. For images, people use methods like BEiT (BEiT: BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers). I don't work in music but maybe this paper has some useful ideas. With such a feature extractor you could then train a classifier on songs you labeled or maybe even use some sort of recommender system (although those typically learn from larger databases of what songs different users like).
