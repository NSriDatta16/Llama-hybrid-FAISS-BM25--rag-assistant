If you assign a static type to a variable, you can subscribe to static events. For example: $MyStaticType = [MyStaticNamespace.MyStaticClass] Register-ObjectEvent -InputObject $MyStaticType -EventName MyStaticEvent -Action {Write-Host "Caught a static event"} To find any static events a type may have, you can use Get-Member with the -Static switch [MyStaticNamespace.MyStaticClass] | get-member -static -membertype event EDIT: I did notice when trying to access [Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents] events, that I needed to be running in an elevated prompt (on Vista and above) in order to access the messages.
