ANOVA requires that the dependent variable is numerical (comparing means among groups). Is your "Organizational Culture" a numerical variable? It sounds like a categorical variable to me. In your model, you only have 0.371 for your variation, as opposed to 10.874 for your errors. I would ignore those values because it's likely that you've violated the assumptions of ANOVA. Double-check the assumptions and in particular the type of the dependent variable.
