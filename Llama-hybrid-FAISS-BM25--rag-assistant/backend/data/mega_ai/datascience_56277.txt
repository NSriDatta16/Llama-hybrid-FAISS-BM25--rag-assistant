Don't understand classification equation for hard margin SVM

I am trying to get a grasp of hard margin SVMs. In the lecture I am watching the professor talks about a classification equation which when a positive sample is input, returns a value of $1$ or more; and when a negative sample is input, returns a value of $-1$ or less. The graph below shows the vector $\overrightarrow{w}$ which is perpendicular to the separating hyperplane and an arbitrary point with unknown class $\overrightarrow{u}$ . In the lecture it says that: $$\overrightarrow{w} \cdot \overrightarrow{u_+} + b \geq 1 \textrm{ , for positive class samples}$$ $$\overrightarrow{w} \cdot \overrightarrow{u_-} + b \leq -1 \textrm{ , for negative class samples} $$ To me it seems that we should take the projection of $\overrightarrow{u}$ on $\frac{\overrightarrow{w}}{|\overrightarrow{w}|}$ , since this would give the component of $\overrightarrow{u}$ in the direction of $\overrightarrow{w}$ . If this component is greater than the distance to the decision boundary/hyperplane, $b$ , then $\overrightarrow{u}$ is a positive sample, if it is less then it is a negative sample. In math terms $$\frac{\overrightarrow{w}}{|\overrightarrow{w}|} \cdot \overrightarrow{u_+} - b > 0$$ $$\frac{\overrightarrow{w}}{|\overrightarrow{w}|} \cdot \overrightarrow{u_-} - b If $\overrightarrow{u}$ lies on the decision boundary then the above expressions will be equal to 0. If $\overrightarrow{u}$ lies on a support vector hyperplane, then the above expressions will be equal to $m$ or $-m$ for positive and negative samples respectively, where $m$ is the margin from the decision boundary to any support vector. I don't understand the lecturer's equations. Why is the value for positive sample classification $\geq 1$ ? Why is the value for negative sample classification $\leq -1$ ? Furthermore, what does $b$ represent in the lecturer's equations? Basically, I have trouble understanding the proposed equations, but they should be doing the same thing as mine.
