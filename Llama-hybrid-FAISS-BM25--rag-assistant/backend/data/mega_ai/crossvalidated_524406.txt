Since this is temperature time series, there is certainly autocorrelation, which must be taken into account. Let the time series be $Y_{jt}, j=1,2;\quad t=1,2 \dotsc, T$ . Since the interest is in the paired comparison calculate the difference time series $D_t = Y_{2t}-Y_{1t}$ . The mean temperature difference can be estimated by the mean of $D_t$ (other estimators as the median or some trimmed mean ... could replace the mean). But the autocorrelation makes it non-trivial to find the standard error of this estimate. Some ideas: Estimate the autocorrelation function and use it to find the se. Use moving block bootstrap? Calculate an autocorrelation-resistant standard error?
