Using RDA on a Desktop Application?

I have a .NET 3.5 Compact Framework project that uses RDA for moving data between its mobile device's local SqlCe database and a remote MSSql-2008 server(it uses RDA Push and Pull). The server machine a virtual directory with sqlcesa35.dll (v3.5.5386.0) setup for RDA. We usually install these cabs on the mobile devices and the RDA process does not have any problems: sqlce.wce5.armv4i.cab sqlce.repl.wce5.armv4i.cab Now I am trying to run this application as a desktop application. RDA Pull (download) has been working well. But the RDA Push (upload) is giving me some problems. This is the exception that I get on the desktop application when I try to use RDA Push: System.Data.SqlServerCe.SqlCeException The Client Agent and Server Agent component versions are incompatible. The compatible versions are: Client Agent versions 3.0 and 3.5 with Server Agent versions 3.5 and Client Agent version 3.5 with Server Agent version 3.5. Re-install the replication components with the matching versions for client and server agents. [ 35,30,Client Agent version = ,Server Agent version = ] I have tried copying the file C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition\v3.5\Desktop\SqlServerCe.dll (v3.5.5692.0) to bin\debug I have also tried copying another version of SqlServerCe.dll (v3.0.5206.0) to bin\debug. But this just gives me a slightly different exception: System.Data.SqlServerCe.SqlCeException [ 35,30 ] Is there a different setup or any different dlls that I need to use?
