First of all, you should understand why Temporal Fusion Transformer(TFT) is such an awesome model. The biggest advantages of TFT are versatility and interpretability . In other words, the model works with multiple time series, with all sorts of inputs (even categorical variables!). Also, it is not a black-box model: With attention weights you can can find which features are important, as well as the dominant seasonal patterns in your dataset! How cool is that? I recommend reading this article . It explains in depth the different components of TFT and how they work together. A slightly difficult concept to grasp in case you are not familiar with is the Attention mechanism. Besides, TFT is a Transformer-based model so it uses attention (with some extra perks). If you hear the term attention for the first time (in the context of deep learning), take a look here - this is the best source on the internet that explains attention, plus it uses illustrations!
