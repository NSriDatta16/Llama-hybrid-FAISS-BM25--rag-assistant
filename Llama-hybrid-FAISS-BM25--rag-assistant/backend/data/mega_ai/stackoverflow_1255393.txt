There are 2 limits By itself, you are limited to what 64bit Windows will provide as an addressable space - that amounts to 8TB. When a future version of 64bit Windows expands that maximum you should see that immediately reflected in .NET applications running on the 64bit CLR - there is no hardcoded or .NET architectural limit within the 64bit address space. However .NET does have a hardcoded limit of 2GB per object . About the only realistic way you can reach this is by defining really big arrays, such as new int[1000000000] . This is also the main reason for the limit (apart from some issues with memory fragmentation), as the .NET framework standard defines array indexes as an int .
