Clustering efficiency in a discrete time-series

Is it possible to identify the point in time where the cluster separation is at its most in a discrete time series clustering? Say I have 4 clusters of discrete time series and I want to pick a point in time where I can tell with the least bias which cluster it belongs to after a kmeans clustering, what other criteria than classification success can U use to identify my cluster separation performance?
