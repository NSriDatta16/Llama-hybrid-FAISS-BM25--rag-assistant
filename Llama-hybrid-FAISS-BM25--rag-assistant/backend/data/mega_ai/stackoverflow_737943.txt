Filtering most out of XML with XSL?

I need to transform a lot of XML files (Fedora export) into a different kind of XML. Trying to do it with XSL stylesheets and checking with the msxsl transformer. Supposedly I have xml file like this (assuming there are actually other nodes inside AAA, OBJ, amd all other nodes), Source.XML: example Which I need to look something like this (Target.XML): contents of OBJVERS with the biggest id OR creation date (whichever is easier to do) go here contents of node go here The main problem that I have is that since I am new to XSL (and for this particular task do not have enough time to learn it properly) is that I can't understand how to tell XSL processor not to process anything else, I keep getting output from , for example. Update: basically, I solved this problem meanwhile. I will post my own answer and close the question. Update2: OK, Andrew's answer works, too, so I am just accepting it. :)
