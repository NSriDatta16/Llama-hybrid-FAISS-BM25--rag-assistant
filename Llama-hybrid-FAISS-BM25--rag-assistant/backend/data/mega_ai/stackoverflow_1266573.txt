Why is my index getting fragmented?

I have a simple little table (just 8 fields) an hour ago I rebuilt one of the indexes on the table, which reset it to 0% fragmentation, but now itâ€™s up to 38%. The table itself has 400k records in it, but only 158 new ones have been inserted since I rebuilt the index, there have been no updates to records but perhaps a couple of deletes. Why should the index be getting so fragmented? The index is non-unique, non-clustered just on one field. The database is running on SQL Server 2005 but with a compatibility level of SQL Server 2000. Thanks
