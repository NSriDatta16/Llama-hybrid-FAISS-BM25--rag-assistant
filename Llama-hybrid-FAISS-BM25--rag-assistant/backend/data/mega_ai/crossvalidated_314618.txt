Can we use Cross-Validation to estimate parameters?

Suppose we are running a 10-Fold Cross Validation on a linear regression with 5 Variables (x1, ... , x5). In total we will have 10 fittings i.e. 10 sets of parameters β0, β1, ... , β5. Could we use each ones average as an estimate for the model (i.e. β0est=avg(β0-1, β0-2, ..., β0-10) ?
