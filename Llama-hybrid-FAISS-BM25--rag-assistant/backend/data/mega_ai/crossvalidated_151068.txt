Identifying whether some drivers are not collecting boarding passes

Here's the problem. I work for a transportation company and we're trying to prove the following hypothesis: Drivers are allowing passengers on the vessel without taking taking their paper boarding passes. The assumption is every passenger on the vessel purchased a pass, but some portion simply shows the driver a confirmation email. Here's the data I have Travel date: MM/DD/YYYY Schedule:ABC (roughly 60 different schedules operate every day on different routes) DriverID: NAME. Drivers can operate different schedules. Count(Passes): Total of the day's boarding passes The dataset is the COMPLETE ticket count from January 1 through April 30, every ticket we've received. How would I go about finding if the average of a given driver boarding pass count is significant from the population's average? Thanks
