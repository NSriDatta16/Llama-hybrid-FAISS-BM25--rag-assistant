I didn't see any documentation either, but I can't imagine that a call to waveOutWrite would be considered safe to be run concurrently with a call to WaveOutRestart on the same handle. If you're using VS2010 Beta2 I would look at the various walkthroughs for the Agents Library and attempt to turn this into a producer consumer problem where you are passing messages like write,pause,restart, etc. If you aren't using Visual Studio 2010 (or can't) I would encourage you to find a way to break this into a producer consumer problem using threads and some sort of internally synchronized queue that stores the commands to process. If the messages aren't that frequent and given that you only have 2 threads working on this queue, you may be able to get away with puting a plain old Win32 critical section around a std::queue... hope this helps.
