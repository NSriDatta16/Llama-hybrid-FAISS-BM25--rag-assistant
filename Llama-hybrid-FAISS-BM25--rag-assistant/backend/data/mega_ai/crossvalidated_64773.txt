What isn't comparable? If you mean because they are measured on different scales, this is why people use correlation based PCA; so you could standardize/center your variables and then calculate euclidean distances. Keep in mind that the so called "Hellinger transformation" is simply the square root of relative abundances; does it make sense to do that to your environmental data? Is it possible to do this, yes. Does it make sense, I don't think so.
