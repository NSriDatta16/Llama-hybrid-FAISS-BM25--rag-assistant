how to handle values that only appear once in a column?

Counting the values of a column using pandas I got the following result: Human 195 Mutant 62 God / Eternal 14 Cyborg 11 Human / Radiation 11 Android 9 Symbiote 8 Kryptonian 7 Alien 7 Demon 6 Atlantean 5 Alpha 5 Asgardian 5 Cosmic Entity 4 Inhuman 4 Human / Altered 3 New God 3 Animal 3 Saiyan 2 Eternal 2 Frost Giant 2 Human-Kree 2 Demi-God 2 Human / Cosmic 2 Vampire 2 Metahuman 2 Amazon 2 Icthyo Sapien 1 Czarnian 1 Rodian 1 Martian 1 Clone 1 Zombie 1 Maiar 1 Yoda's species 1 Human-Vulcan 1 Zen-Whoberian 1 Mutant / Clone 1 Korugaran 1 Dathomirian Zabrak 1 Parademon 1 Kaiju 1 Flora Colossus 1 Human-Spartoi 1 Yautja 1 Ungaran 1 Human-Vuldarian 1 Neyaphem 1 Xenomorph XX121 1 Bizarro 1 Human / Clone 1 Gungan 1 Bolovaxian 1 Talokite 1 Luphomoid 1 Tamaranean 1 Kakarantharaian 1 Spartoi 1 Strontian 1 Gorilla 1 Name: Race, dtype: int64 I am new to data science, but I think that all those value appearing only once in the dataset is not going to help the classifier, so is there a good way to handle those values? I was thinking about grouping all those values that appear less than 5 times, or maybe I should remove the lines. By the way, I do not know if it is important to know, but I want to apply the gaussian naive bayes, knn and logistic regression to this dataset. This column is a feature to predict a binary value.
