If you want to report the two numbers, that would be reporting the first and third quartiles ; this is a fine thing to report, but not what is conventionally intended by the term "interquartile range". The use of the term dates back to Galton,1881 and his use of it then appears consistent with the current convention, which is to refer to the difference of the quartiles (e.g. as in the opening paragraph of the relevant article in Wikipedia ).
