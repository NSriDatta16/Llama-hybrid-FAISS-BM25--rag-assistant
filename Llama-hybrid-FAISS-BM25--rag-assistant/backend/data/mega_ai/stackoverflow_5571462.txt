Openlayer how to enable dragging of feature after placing it?

it seems that i have a simple requirement but my knowledge on OpenLayer seems to limited. I have a need to place 1 feature inside a map and after placing it, drag this feature to the right place and then get the Lat / Long coordinates. It would be nice that i can delete the feature to start over.. But to start with: I have managed to place a feature, but am not able to switch from drawfeature to dragfeature. If there a better ways to achieve my goal i am more then happy to learn! // create the map variable map = new OpenLayers.Map("map"); // create layers var mapLayer = new OpenLayers.Layer.OSM(); // openstreetmap var vectorLayer = new OpenLayers.Layer.Vector("Vector", {styleMap: styleMap}); // vector // add the layers to the map map.addLayer(mapLayer); map.addLayer(vectorLayer); map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.MousePosition()); var drawFeature = new OpenLayers.Control.DrawFeature(vectorLayer, OpenLayers.Handler.Point); var dragFeature = new OpenLayers.Control.DragFeature(vectorLayer); map.addControl(drawFeature); drawFeature.activate(); vectorLayer.onFeatureInsert = function () { drawFeature.deactivate(); // how to switch to drag feature??? // dragFeature.activate(); does not seem to work } ... map.setCenter (lonLat, zoom); Thanks Marco
