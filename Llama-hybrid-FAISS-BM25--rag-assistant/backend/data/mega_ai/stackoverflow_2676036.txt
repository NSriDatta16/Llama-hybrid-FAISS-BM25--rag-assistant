I thought I had a few tidbits to add to this, but they turn out to NOT solve the problem. definitely use the input 'name' (not id) one of the other parameters is 'ifq', not sure how it works to bundle this with 'formkey' (a string is just a string, right?) to completely mock the Google form, add these additional fields: pageNumber=0; backupCache=''; submit=Submit I get the same '405 Method not allowed' error though...
