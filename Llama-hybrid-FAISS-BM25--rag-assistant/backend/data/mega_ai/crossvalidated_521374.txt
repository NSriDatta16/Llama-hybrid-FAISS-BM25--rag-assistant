Time as a covariate in linear regression predicting prices

This is a somewhat broad question that I encountered at work the other day. I am trying to fit a linear regression to predict prices depending on several covariates. The observations are collected over time and I can spot a clear seasonality (higher prices in certain months and on certain days of the week). I tried to group the covariates depending on these two time-dependent factors. The fitted model was decent, but unfortunately there is a clear trend in the residuals. They tend to be above zero for some months and below zero for others. Do I have to go for time series models now? Are there other ways to include seasonal trends in a linear regression, and how would my model diagnostics and inference change?
