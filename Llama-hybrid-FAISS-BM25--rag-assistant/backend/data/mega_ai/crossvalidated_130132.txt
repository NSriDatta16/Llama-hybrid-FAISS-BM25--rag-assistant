What you're looking for is a cross spectral analysis. These notes show how it works for a bivariate case, but it's easy to apply this to multivariate series. You start with multivariate time series:$x_t=(x_{1t},\dots,x_{nt})$. You define the matrix of autocovariate functions $\Gamma(j)=\gamma_{mk}(j)\equiv cov(x_{mt},x_{k,t-j})$, then the cross spectrum matrix is $f(\omega)=f_{mk}(\omega)\equiv\frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty e^{-i\omega j}\gamma_{mk}(j)$. From here you go on and define cross periodogram, cross spectral densities and all the usual stuff. For instance, the squared coherence is: $\rho_{mk}=\frac{|f_{mk}(\omega)|^2}{f_{mm}(\omega)f_{kk}(\omega)}$ Similarly, you can get cross phases.
