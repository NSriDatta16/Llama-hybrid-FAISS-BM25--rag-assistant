Unless someone can tell me otherwise, the only "independent association" I can think of occurs in spurious correlation . Spurious correlation is a non-causal association between variables. Spurious correlation occurs when two independent (i.e., orthogonal and unrelated) variables are related through a modifying third variable that has a causal link to both otherwise independent variables. For example, consider the famous nonsense statement, "Ice-cream consumption causes drowning." That is, if we plot a time series of monthly ice-cream sales, it is highly correlated to monthly drowning case occurrences. In this case the modifying third variable is temperature. When it's hot, people eat more ice-cream and drown more frequently. Spurious correlation has many websites, here is one . It can be hilarious. So a completed sentence from the partial quote might read as "A is independently associated with B... through modifying variable C." Also, the phrase "independently associated" appears in the medical literature with some frequency. It sounds nicer than "spurious correlation via some modifying variable the nature of which, we may not have even thought about." Why don't you cough up the rest of the sentence? We could all do with a good belly laugh if it is indeed spurious. Update: Having the paper now in hand, it is, indeed medical. The evidence for independence is soft, and the evidence for correlations with a modifying variable is indirect. Unfortunately, "We are not amused."
