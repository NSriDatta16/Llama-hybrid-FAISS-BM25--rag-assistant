Is there such a thing as a C# style extension method in C++?

I'm currently learning C++ and i run into the simple problem of converting an int to a string. I've worked around it using: string IntToString(int Number) { stringstream Stream; Stream but though it would be more elegant to use something like: int x = 5; string y = x.toString(); but how do i add the toString() method to a built in type? or am i missing something totally fundamental?
