Create dynamic array from each in jquery?

Is it possible to create a dynamic array using something like this and store X elements, then get the average? How would that be possible? $(xml).find('student').each(function(){ var name = $(this).find("name").text(); var myArray = DYNAMIC ELEMENTS student_list.append(" "+name+" "+cid+" "+grade+" "); }); I want to store a set of grades for each class, then get the average of ALL the elements in the array. I would need to get a count of all the elements for it has increasing "key:value" Correct? Along these lines: myArray[1] = "54" = myArray[i] = g
