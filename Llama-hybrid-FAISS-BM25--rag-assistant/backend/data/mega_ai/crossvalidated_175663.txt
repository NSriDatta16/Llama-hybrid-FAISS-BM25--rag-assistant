How to report bootstrap simulation?

I am conducting a simulation study, I simulate $N=10000$ samples of size $n=50$ from a distribution $F(;\theta)$, then I obtain a bootstrap sample of size $B=1000$ from the MLE of $\theta$. Some bootstrap samples of the MLE of $\theta$ contain extreme observations, so I want to avoid summary statistics involving moments. I want to report the coverage of some bootstrap intervals as well as some other statistics. What do people typically report in this kind of studies?
