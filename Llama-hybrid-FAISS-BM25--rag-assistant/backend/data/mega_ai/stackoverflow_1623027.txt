Going through the wxPython demo and looking at all the examples would be a good start. You'll likely find page Using Images | DragImage to be useful, since you'll probably want cards that you can drag. Generally, the demo can help you do most things in wxPython, and also show you what wxPython can do, and it's worth the time to see every demo. This approach works for everything except the very first step of getting an app running and putting a frame in it (since the demo itself is an app, but not a simple one). Any of the basic tutorials can help you get started with an app and frame in just a very lines of code.
