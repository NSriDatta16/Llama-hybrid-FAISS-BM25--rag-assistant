Sequencing 2 lines of jQuery

I have the following lines of jQuery: // When dragging ends stop: function(event, ui) { // Replace the placeholder with the original $placeholder.after( $this.show() ).remove(); // Run a custom stop function specitifed in the settings settings.stop.apply(this); }, I don't want settings.stop.apply(this); to run UNTIL the line above is ( $placeholder.after( $this.show() ).remove(); ), right now what's happening is the settings.stop is running to early. With jQuery, how can I sequence these two lines to not proceed until the first is complete?
