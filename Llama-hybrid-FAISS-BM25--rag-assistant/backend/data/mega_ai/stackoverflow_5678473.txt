How to add another instance of date picker in given code

I have downloaded the complete zip of PopCalendarXP (Lite Edition) 9.8.309 from: http://www.calendarxp.net/downloads.shtml In the given folders various type of datepickers are there, but every page contains only one instance of date picker. I need to add two or more instances. How can I change the code of HTML/JavaScript/CSS? I'm not able to do that. Can anyone having a good command of jQuery and JavaScript help me out?
