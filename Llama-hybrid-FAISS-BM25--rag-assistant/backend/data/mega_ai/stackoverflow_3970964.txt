If I were you I would continue to do it the way you are doing it. In fact I do! The advantages of having the actual .sql files right there in a folder for you to use/edit/look at in my opinion are far better than the advantages you get by using a DB project. DB Project would be used if you were doing something like Storage Reports, were you have to communicate with like 8 databases and compare then to 8 different databases and save result sets etc... Now don't get my wrong there are advantages of Database Projects, I just don't think they are actually doing much help when you have such a simple setup that works already. Advantages of the SQL Server 2008 Database Project in VS10 : Not having to switch back and forth from your current client you use to communicate with your SQL server. Decent Data and Schema compare tools. Gives you a one-click way to reverse engineer a database into source control, and keep it up to date. You can compare projects to physical databases and vice-versa. (This makes it pretty easy to keep your database up to date, no matter where you make change it: file system database project, or in the physical database itself) If the current tool your using is not specifically tailored to SQL Server, this one is. Extremely helpful if you need to do unit tests directly on the database without using abstractions.
