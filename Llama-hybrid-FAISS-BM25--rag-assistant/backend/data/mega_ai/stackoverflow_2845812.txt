You can, but why would you want to? Embedding NUL in an std::string is just asking for trouble, because functions to which you pass an std::string may very well use it's c_str() member, and most will assume that the first NUL indicates the end of the string. Hence this is not a good idea to do. Also note that in UTF-8, only '\0' will result in a 0, so even for i18n purposes, there is no justification for embedding NULs.
