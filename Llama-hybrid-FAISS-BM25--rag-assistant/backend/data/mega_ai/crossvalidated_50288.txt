Logistic regression may be the easiest way to do it, if you want the idea of the full 3 dimensional table then include teh interaction term between your predictor variables. There is also the loglin function that will analyze multidimensional contingency tables (though it is more like the chi-squared test than Fisher's exact test). Fisher's Exact test could be extended to 3 dimensions if you really need it (but for large sample sizes the other techniques would give equivalent results). But I think a Fisher's exact test for a 3 dimensional table would be an all or nothing test where the logistic regression would let you test each of the 2 predictors. So I would recommend the logistic regression approach.
