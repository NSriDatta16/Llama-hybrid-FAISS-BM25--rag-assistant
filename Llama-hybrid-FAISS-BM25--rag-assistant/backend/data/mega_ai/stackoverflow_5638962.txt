Can I use GetDataRow() on a view if the view's datasource is IQueryable?

I am implementing drag and drop functionality in a form and I'm running into a situation where I need to GetDataRow, but the view has been bound to an IQueryable, as such: private void stackOverFlow() { Func query = i => from p in _data.PERSON where p.FavoriteNumber == i select p; gc1.DataSource = query(17); var row = ((GridView) gc1.DefaultView).GetDataRow(0); } The row is always null due to the nature of the binding... Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks
