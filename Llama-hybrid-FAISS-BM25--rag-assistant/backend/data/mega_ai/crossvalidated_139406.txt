I think the null hypothesis represents the "skeptical choice". In this problem the skeptical choice is to assume that average fitness does not affect the physical therapy time. Hence, I would cast this problem as a hypothesis test on the difference of two means. $H_0: \mu_2 - \mu_3 = 0$ and $H_1: \mu_2 - \mu_3 > 0$
