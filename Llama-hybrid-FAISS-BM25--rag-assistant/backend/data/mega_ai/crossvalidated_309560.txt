What is the meaning of white noise in AR model?

I am new to Time Series. I want to know the meaning of white noise. By definition it is given that $w_t\stackrel{_{_\text{iid}}}{\sim} N(0,σ^2_w)$, meaning that the errors are independently distributed with a normal distribution that has mean $0$ and constant variance. What does it actually mean?Can someone explain with example? And how by adding this with previous time value gives current time value as in the equation below? $x(t)=δ + ϕ \cdot x(t−1) + w_t$
