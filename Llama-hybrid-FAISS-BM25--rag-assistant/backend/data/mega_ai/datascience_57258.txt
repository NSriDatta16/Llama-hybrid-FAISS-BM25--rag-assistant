Trial and error is an important part of Deep Learning. There are situations where missing data has meaning and there situations where missing data is just noise. As an example, when tracking facial features like eyes, nose, or ears, missing data is informing the neural network that the feature is outside of view. Other times it is noise from bad data collection. I recommend fitting your deep learning model with the following data: Use 0 for missing data. Remove rows with missing data. Use the mean for missing data. Single variable feature imputation or Multivariate interpolation. Use Multivariate feature imputation
