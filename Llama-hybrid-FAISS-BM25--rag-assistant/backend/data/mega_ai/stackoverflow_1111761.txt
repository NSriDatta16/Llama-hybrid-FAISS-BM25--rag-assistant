What is the built-in PHP function for "compressing" or "defragmenting" an array?

I know it'd be trivial to code myself, but in the interest of not having more code to maintain if it's built in to PHP already, is there a built-in function for "compressing" a PHP array? In other words, let's say I create an array thus: $array = array(); $array[2000] = 5; $array[3000] = 7; $array[3500] = 9; What I want is an array where $array[0] == 5, $array[1] == 7, $array[2] == 9. I could do this: function array_defragment($array) { $squashed_array = array(); foreach ($array as $item) { $squashed_array[] = $item; } return $squashed_array; } ...but it seems like the kind of thing that would be built in to PHP - I just can't find it in the docs.
