Plotting averages when there are missing values

I have count data for a number of subjects in different groups I would like to compare. The averages of the cumulative sums are shown in the figure below. As you can see the Red group has a spike at the end. This is because one subject in that group had fewer trials. This subject had the lowest cumulative number of counts for the previous trials and was pulling down the average. How would you plot and interpret data like this? I wish to avoid imputation or other techniques "fancier" than calculating simple statistics, ideally I would plot only the data itself. I already have a plot containing each individual, but also want a group comparison. Edit: The y axis is cumulative # of successes while learning a new task at each block of trials. The x axis should probably read "Block #" rather than trial number. The successes were followed by a reward, so cumulative number of successes is also a measure of total reward received over the course of the study, which may be the outcome the subjects were attempting to attain. Alternatively the learning can be measured as the number of successes per block over time. Some subjects may learn slower but end up with higher final performance and thus appear "better", however subjects that used a "quick and dirty" strategy may be maximizing the total reward attained despite their apparent lower skill level.
