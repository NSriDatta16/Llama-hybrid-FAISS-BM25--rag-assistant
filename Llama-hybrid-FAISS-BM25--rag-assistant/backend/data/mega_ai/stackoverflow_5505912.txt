Are there any resolution independent approaches for dealing with this? Use dimension and drawable resources. You haven't indicated how your buttons are "40dipx40dip". If they are set that way via specific heights and widths, instead of having 40dip in a layout or in a style, use @dimen/toolbar_btn . Then in res/values/dimens.xml define that to be 40dip and in res/values-large/dimens.xml (or maybe res/values-large-land/dimens.xml ) define that to be, say, 60dip , or whatever works for you. If the buttons are "40dipx40dip" because of images, then it's merely a matter of creating somewhat larger images for tablets and putting them in, say, res/drawable-large-mdpi/ resource directory.
