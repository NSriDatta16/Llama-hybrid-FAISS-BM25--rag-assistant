iphone 2d drawing newbie question

I've been programming the iphone for a couple of months now and have 3 apps in the store already. However, I have not done any kind of graphics programming in the platform. Given that I'm planning on starting my 5th app (the 4th is under Apple's review) I wanted to ask for some pointers as to where to get information for this (been googling for a while but nothing matches what I'm looking for) I need to create an App where I can 'drop' some shapes from a menu (a rectangle, circle, squares, and then some complex shapes) onto a main window. the idea is that the user can drag them around. BUT, I want them to 'snap' to each other (kind of like in a CAD package where a circle has quadrants on the edges that snap to any other geometry entity in the drawing). So if I had a circle on the left of the screen and a rectangle on the right and then I move the circle around, it would stop moving to the right If I hit the rectangles edges. Not completely stop but giving some sort of 'resistance' to the continuity of the movement. Also, if I have several overlapping drawings, is there a way to 'divide' them (any overlapping becomes a shape on itself but is removed from any other shape composing the overlap)? The reason for this is that I need to calculate the area of the drawing (along with other properties) I'm thinking of CALayer 1, 2, 3,..., n on of top of the other, each one with a drawing (with CGPath?), that may or may not overlap the others. Then I need to somehow obtain information of the 'projection' of all those on a single CALayer. I'm clueless here. Should I look into Quartz2D? is CALayer and CGPath enough for this? this is not for a game. Just an engineering application I have in mind. Any help is appreciated. regards dh
