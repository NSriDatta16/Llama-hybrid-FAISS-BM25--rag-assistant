What do you recommend for a PHP Coding Standards tool/system/program?

I'm working on a PHP project with several developers, each who has their own style. The styles differ significantly, and can make the code really hard to read, and everyone is in agreement that we need to standardize our style. The issue I'm having is that I can't find any good program or system to help enforce standards for PHP. I've used a number of programs in the past for C++ and Java, and I'm a huge checkstyle fan, but I can't find anything so elegant for PHP. What program, tool, or system would you recommend to help developers adhere to a common set of PHP coding standards? Additionally, it would be great if the solution also handled PHP embedded in XHTML, but that is not a requirement.
