(iphone) InAppSettings/InAppSettingsKit library questions

It seems there are many advocates of InAppSettings https://bitbucket.org/keegan3d/inappsettings/wiki/Home In my app, I need to have multiple different settings page from different views. (Conceptually there are multiple apps within the app, and each app needs its own setting page) I thought maybe there will be some easy way to create settings page without IB or enourmous coding, and surely found InAppSettings and InAppSettingsKit( http://inappsettingskit.com/ ) I have 2 concerns before digging into one of them. Is it possible to create multiple settings page as mentioned above for one app? I don't like apps that create settings entry in the iPhone settings app, I just want the settings appear inside my app only, is this possible with the two libraries? (very optional) would be nice to be able to show an image when there are huge empty spaces below all the settings in a given setting page. Thank you.
