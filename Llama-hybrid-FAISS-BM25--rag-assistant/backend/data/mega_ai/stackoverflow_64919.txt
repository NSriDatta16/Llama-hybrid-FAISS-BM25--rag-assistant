the XNA Live API doesn't give you access to leaderboards ... so your real only option is to store the scores locally. If you want users to see each other's scores ... you could use two different stores. The player's store for his own save data ... and then title storage to store scores. Of course then, if the 360 has more than one storage device, they'll have to select it twice ... but you could only let them choose the device for scores if they go into the high score section.
