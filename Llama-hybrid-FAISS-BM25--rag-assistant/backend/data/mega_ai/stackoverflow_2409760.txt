Check visitors Operating System in ColdFusion

Paul Silver had this post 7 years ago to check various browsers. Has there been an updated script since then? What I'd like is an if/then construct to tell what Operating System the user is on - it doesn't have to go all the way down to the browser version. I'm using the cgi.user_agent string to infer what OS they're using.
