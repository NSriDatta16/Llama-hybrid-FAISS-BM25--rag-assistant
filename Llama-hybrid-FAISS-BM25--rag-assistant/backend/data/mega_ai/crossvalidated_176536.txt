You try to fit a single normal $\mathcal{N}(\theta,1)$ model to your sample, which means that the posterior will concentrate on the largest [in $\theta$] values of \begin{align*}\prod_{i=1}^n \exp\{-(x_i-\theta)^2/2\} &=\exp\left\{ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\theta)^2/2\right\}\\ &=\exp\left\{ -\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{x}_n)^2/2-n(\bar{x}_n-\theta)^2/2\right\}\\ &\propto\exp\left\{-n(\bar{x}_n-\theta)^2/2\right\}\end{align*} Due to the normal modelling, all that matters is the data average, $\bar{x}_n$, since the posterior is $$\theta|x_1,\ldots,x_n\sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{x}_n,1/n),$$ so it is natural that the largest posterior weights are around $7$ and $8$. That $7$ gets most of the weight is a reflection of the sample, another round would put more weight on $8$. In other words, there is no information in the normal model that the data is from a mixture, hence no reason to identify two means.
