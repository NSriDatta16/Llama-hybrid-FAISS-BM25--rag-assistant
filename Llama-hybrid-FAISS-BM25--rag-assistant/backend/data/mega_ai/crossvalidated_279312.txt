I think your question itself say the answer. You can use auto-encoder and usually euclidean distance is used to compare the reconstruction errors. And you can find more resources on line. Here I provide the Theano implementation of Stacking De-noise Autoencoder and also wiki link . But notice, when applying auto-encoder, it's better to avoid trivial solution where the identical transformation happens. You can either add noises to training data or regularizer term to make the weight parameter sparse.
