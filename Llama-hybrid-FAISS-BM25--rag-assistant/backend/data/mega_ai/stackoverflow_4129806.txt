jQuery Drag and Drop: What's the best way to store multiple object positions in database?

I have something like this: Example1 Example1 Example1 Example1 Basically all classes "drag" are draggable and droppable. I was wondering what's the best way to store everything in the database. Is it a good idea to store everything as a JSON blob when user does any drop within wrapper and save it as JSON in a row in mySQL? Or should I just save whatever individual object was moved in a separate table in mySQL? If it's JSON blob, how would I use jQuery to make serialize the divs inside #wrapper into jSONS? Thanks!
