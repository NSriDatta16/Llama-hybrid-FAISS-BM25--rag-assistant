I don't think there's a CursorManger in flash, only flex. The way i'm doing is with a custom class which hides the cursor and drags the customized cursor at mouse_move. You have to set it to mouseChildren=false, otherwise will flickr or the buttons will not be clickable. One problem i found is with custom contextual menus.
