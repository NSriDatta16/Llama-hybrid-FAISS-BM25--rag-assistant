Assuming you're limiting yourself to stationary processes: Usually that's how it's done, yes. No, it's not whether. It's really more like how few frequencies. The fewer the better. Any stationary process can be written in terms of a sum of fourier frequencies with random weights. That's the spectral representation theorem. I would say this entropy is like any other entropy. The higher the value, the larger the average “surprise” (log density), and in this case, the flatter the density. A completely flat periodogram is the periodogram of white noise, which is completely unpredictable. Regarding other assumptions, I'm not sure. I can't rule out things with any certainty, but I would venture to guess they're assuming stationarity.
