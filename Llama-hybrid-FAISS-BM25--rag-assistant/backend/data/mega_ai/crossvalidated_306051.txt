Possible simultaneity issue in time series analysis

Let $Y_t$ be the amount of sales at time $t$ and $X_t$ be the amount of expenses in marketing activities. I want to estimate the effect of $X_t$ on $Y_t$. However, we suppose that $X_t$ is determined by the sales in previous period, so $X_t$ depends on $Y_{t-1}$. Does this problem involve a case of simultaneity? Consider that $Y_t$ and $Y_{t-1}$ are independent. Can I use normal OLS or other methods are needed? Specific references would be appreciated.
