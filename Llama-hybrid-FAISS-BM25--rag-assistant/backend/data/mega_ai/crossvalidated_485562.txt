Wrong sign in regression coefficient?

I have been getting these extremely puzzling results in my logistic regression model. "New.Regs" is a dummy variable indicating whether or not an observation came after a certain law was passed. The coefficients in the interaction model are extremely large. Without the interaction, the most important variable "New.Regs" is the wrong sign and has an odds ratio below 1 when in reality it has a positive effect. These results are not a symptom of complete separation (I have checked), and I also tried nonparametric smoothing for the Years variable (which is coded as a decimal, meaning an observation could for example be 2.7345 years after the first observation) but get the same results. Also, anova comparing models shows no evidence for non-linearity of Years. Also, n=250 before the law and n=40 after the law. Any ideas? Some output is below. I know the graph isn't using the logit curve but you get the idea. Model with interaction: glm(formula = Quantified ~ New.Regs * Years, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = fws) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.5728 0.3260 -4.824 1.40e-06 *** New.Regs -126.1103 44.7100 -2.821 0.00479 ** Years 0.2359 0.0547 4.314 1.61e-05 *** New.Regs:Years 12.7242 4.5394 2.803 0.00506 ** AIC: 368.2 Model without interaction: glm(formula = Quantified ~ New.Regs + Years, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = fws) Coefficients: Estimate Std.
