Human body organs growth graph or data

I am looking for a graph or data for relative growth of human body organs, more importantly head size and total body height. The full data I would like to have—each as a function of time from birth (and preferably until death)—are: Head size, preferably for both male and female, Hand size, Leg size, Cerebrum weight, Body height, and, Body weight. I have only found the two last ones, but I'd rather have all data from a single study.
