Debugging touchesEnded NOT being called when swiping in 1 direction only

Totally stumped in debugging a simple swipe movement for my application. When I swipe in a left direction, I correctly get a touchesEnded message-method call. BUT, if I drag in the other direction, touchesEnded does NOT get called. Anyone have a clue as to why this might be? I'm using a TapDetectingView as my view for my viewController class. And user intraction and multiple touch are both enabled for this view in IB.
