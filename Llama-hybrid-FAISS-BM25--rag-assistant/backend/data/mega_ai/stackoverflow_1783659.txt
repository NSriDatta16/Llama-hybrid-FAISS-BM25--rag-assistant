Does git clone work through NTLM proxies?

I've tried both using export http_proxy=http://[username]:[pwd]@[proxy] and git config --global http.proxy http://[username]:[pwd]@[proxy] . I couldn't make it work. It looks like git uses Basic authentication: Initialized empty Git repository in /home/.../.git/ * Couldn't find host github.com in the .netrc file, using defaults * About to connect() to github.com port 8080 (#0) * Trying 10.... * Connected to github.com (10....) port 8080 (#0) * Proxy auth using Basic with user '...' > GET http://github.com/sunlightlabs/fiftystates.git/info/refs HTTP/1.1 Proxy-Authorization: Basic MD... User-Agent: git/1.6.1.2 Host: github.com Pragma: no-cache Accept: */* Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive Google search returned mixed and probably not updated results. Somewhere it says that curl is (was?) used under the hood, but its options are (were?) hardwired into code. For example, curl --proxy-ntlm --proxy ...:8080 google.com works, and I'd like to use the same option with git. I need some more definite answers here: has anybody succeed using git through Windows proxies? Which version? Thanks.
