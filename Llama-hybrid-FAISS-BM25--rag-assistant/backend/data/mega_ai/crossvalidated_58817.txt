Data visualization of average and standard deviation over a small time series

I am trying to find the best way to visualize the following data: I have values for 3 different times/dates, each time/date has the same 20 species. For each species I have the average height and standard deviation (that was obtained from n observations). I don't have the observations from where the average and standard deviation was obtained. This is how the data looks like. Species are numerated from 1 to 20. t1 = cbind(seq(1,20,1),runif(20,0.5,5.0),runif(20,0,1.0)) t2 = cbind(seq(1,20,1),runif(20,0.9,6.0),runif(20,0.2,1.5)) t3 = cbind(seq(1,20,1),runif(20,0.1,8.5),runif(20,0.4,1.0)) Can anyone give any advice on what would be the best plot/graphic to use? I want to show the evolution of the average and standard deviation in time, however I don't want to do a line plot, and for a heat map I have a small dataset.
