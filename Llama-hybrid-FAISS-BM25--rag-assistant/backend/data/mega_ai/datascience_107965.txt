Technically I don't think there is a difference in the output in the two methods, with the main reason being that fitting the PolynomialFeatures class to data does not save any parameters internally, as is the case for example for the StandardScaler class (see also the source code for PolynomialFeatures ). However, I would say that it is still better to use transform instead of fit_transform to be consistent with other transformers from scikit-learn .
