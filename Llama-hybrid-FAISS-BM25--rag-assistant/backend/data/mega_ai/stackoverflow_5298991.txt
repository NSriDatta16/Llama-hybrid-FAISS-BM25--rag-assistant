First, create a list of the right length - it just makes things easier and is good practice to allocate storage before filling objects in via a loop: boxplots Then we can loop over the data you want, assigning to each component of the boxplots list as we go, using the [[x]] notation: for (x in seq_along(boxplots)){ boxplots[[x]] Before, your code was overwriting the previous boxplot info during subsequent iterations.
