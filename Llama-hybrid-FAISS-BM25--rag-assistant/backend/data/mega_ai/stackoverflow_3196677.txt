How do I overflow the contents of a column into the next column using CSS?

I have a table with three columns in which I'm trying to get some long paragraphs to flow dynamically from the first column into the second and then into the third. Currently, the table will continue on a next page when the first column overflows instead of moving into the second column and so I get several pages filled with only a single column's worth of data. How can I fix this?
