One option is to do this by splitting the entire file into words. Not 100% the same result in terns of knowing the context but very fine-tuned to the type of change you care about. Example : cat file1 | perl5.8 -e '{s/\s+/\n/g;}' > file1.split_words cat file2 | perl5.8 -e '{s/\s+/\n/g;}' > file2.split_words diff file1.split_words file2.split_words You can do even better if the text has special properies, to be more specific, the reflow only happens within the bounds of a paragraph which is defined as 2 newlines in a row - simply replace all the single newlines with spaces and run regular diff -w on results.
