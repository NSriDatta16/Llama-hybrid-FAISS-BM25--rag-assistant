I have done what you are saying, and there are a couple of ways to do it. Using linux is the easiest, and the only platform where I have actually implemented this. On linux there are two ways you can do this. 1., use iptables and NQUEUE and pass received packets to an application process that do whatever you want with them. Use iptables rules to only pass up packets you are interested in, such as those with IP dst N2, N4 etc. 2. use libpcap, and link you program with this library and configure a capture filter to capture the packets you are interested in.
