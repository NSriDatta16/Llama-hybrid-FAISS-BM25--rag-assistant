You shouldn't need it, if it is a string. It will be collected, when you make sure that there are no references hanging on to it. To force garbage collection, you could create a class that implements IDisposable interface, provide necessary implementation, use that class in the code & release it by calling Dispose on it. e.g. using (WrapsTheStringAndIsDisposable blah = new WrapsTheStringAndIsDisposable()) { ..... } I would go on to say, don't worry about it.
