Wrap your text in a block-level element such as a paragraph or heading: Number From To Your styles shouldn't need to be set to inline if they're spans, so your CSS becomes: .filter-field { height: 20px; } .filter-title { width:90px; padding-right:10px; } .filter-extension { width: 40px; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; } .filter-control { } At worst, you might replace your display: inline; declarations with float: left; but I don't see why you'd need to. If you are still having problems, I would suggest your span styles are probably inheriting a display: block; property from elsewhere in your CSS.
