You could consider interpolating, padding, or forward-filling the data over "missing" observations, before aggregating per-month targets, as a simple first approach. For example, you could input (speaking very roughly) ... and output a binary value for whether the target event does/not occur in the month following the input sequence. If you have a smallish set of low-dimensional input features, though, an RNN might be overkill - you may be able to get a lot out of a simpler logistic regression first instead.
