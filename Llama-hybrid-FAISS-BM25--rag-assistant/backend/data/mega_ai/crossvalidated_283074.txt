Yes linear regression is a good idea for a start. The question is not so much whether the dependant variable is discrete or continuous, but whether it represents a quantity where natural order means something (1 the more anxiety increases, the more the outcome increases the more gym increases, the more the outcome decreases... ... And this seems to be realistic in your case. Whether your variable is continuous or discrete does not change very much the appropriateness of linear regression. Linear regression is meaningless when the dependant variable are numbers that represent categories arbitrarily. Like a job : 1=butcher 2=policeman 3=cook ... Typically this case would require multinomial logistic regression. A question that may appear in your case is whether linearity is realistic enough or if a non linear regression would be better : like a generalized linear model. But discrete or not discrete is not much important.
