You can't use column names in variable expressions. I'm afraid there is no way to easily "clone" this logic in SSIS. I would suggest, however, that you don't attempt to clone hard-coded logic like this. Construct a reference table and use a Lookup component to fetch the value. That way, if your "case" statement ever changes, you only need to do one modification - you don't need to hunt down everywhere this logic gets used. And configuration of the Lookup is pretty drag and drop easy.
