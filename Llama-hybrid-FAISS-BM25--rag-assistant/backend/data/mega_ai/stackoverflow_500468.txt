I'm sure that this is probably a matter of taste, but I find that creating 3 files (list, add, edit) for 1 table is flexible enough while keeping it easy to understand, especially for developers new at php. that way, whenever you need to do CRUD on another table, just create another 3 files for it. ... includes/ views/ add_member.php edit_member.php list_member.php add_widget.php edit_widget.php list_widget.php ... with includes/ folder storing the config and function files and the views/ folder containing various fragment files to be included, such as header, navigation, footer, etc.
