Unable to get correct coefficients for logistic regression in simulated dataset

I devised this toy example library(sigmoid) N =0.5, T, F) hid The variable hid contains 4304 FALSE and 5696 TRUE. I would have expected to get the correct coefficients out of the logistic regression. Instead I am getting -39.46 for the intercept and 0.79 for the slope. Both with p-values $\approx$ 0. What am I doing wrong?
