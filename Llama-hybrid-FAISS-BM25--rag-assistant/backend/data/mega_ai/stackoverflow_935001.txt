Another approach to take would be Latent Semantic Analysis, which leverages a large corpus of data to find similarities between documents. The way it works is by taking the co-occurance matrix of the text and comparing it to the Corpus, essentially providing you with an abstract location of your document in a 'semantic space'. This will speed up your text comparison, as you can compare documents using Euclidian distance in the LSA Semantic space. It's pretty fun semantic indexing. Thus, adding new articles will not take much longer. I can't give a specific use case of this approach, having only learned it in school but it appears that KnowledgeSearch is an open source implementation of the algorithm. (Sorry, its my first post, so can't post links, just look it up)
