The Facebook Graph API would be the best solution, but if it is buggy, as Herr Kaleun pointed out, and you need more than 50 items or 30 days of posts, then I have another idea. It may not satisfy your distribution requirements, but if it does you can implement this as a GreaseMonkey user script. GreaseMonkey is a system for web client automation that is javascript-aware. It lives in the web browser and is written and controlled by javascript, and can also pragmatically simulate a user affecting javascript. GreaseMonkey is a Firefox plugin, but Chrome also has native support for user scripts (the language is slightly different, but most GreaseMonkey user scripts will work in Chrome).
