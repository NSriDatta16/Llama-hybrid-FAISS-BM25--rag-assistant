Negative binomial vs binomial distribution for proportion data

I'm sorry if this is a duplicate question; I searched around for an answer for some time, but couldn't find anything. I want to build a model in R, with the proportional number of individuals ('count'/'allCount') as a response variable. 'count' is the number of individuals within a specific group, and 'allCount' the number of individuals with all groups combined. Here is the data, which is a subset for this specific group (a foraging guild of birds, within a larger bird community): "count","allCount","site","treatment","elevation","field.season" 3,20,"CM","fragmented",800,"2016" 4,19,"CM","fragmented",800,"2016" 0,12,"SM","continuous",800,"2016" 1,21,"CA","fragmented",1200,"2016" 3,11,"SA","continuous",1200,"2016" 3,29,"SA","continuous",1200,"2016" 0,16,"SB","continuous",300,"2016" 12,38,"CB","fragmented",300,"2016" 3,22,"SM","continuous",800,"2016" 2,19,"CM","fragmented",800,"2016" 0,22,"SA","continuous",1200,"2016" 3,28,"CA","fragmented",1200,"2016" 15,39,"CB","fragmented",300,"2016" 3,19,"SB","continuous",300,"2016" 15,38,"CA","fragmented",1200,"2017" 12,22,"CA","fragmented",1200,"2017" 3,10,"CM","fragmented",800,"2017" 1,10,"SM","continuous",800,"2017" 1,11,"SM","continuous",800,"2017" 1,17,"CM","fragmented",800,"2017" 5,17,"SA","continuous",1200,"2017" 4,10,"SA","continuous",1200,"2017" 1,21,"SB","continuous",300,"2017" 1,9,"SB","continuous",300,"2017" 1,14,"CB","fragmented",300,"2017" 2,19,"CB","fragmented",300,"2017" 0,6,"CA","fragmented",1200,"2017" 4,14,"SA","continuous",1200,"2017" 2,12,"CM","fragmented",800,"2017" 1,12,"SM","continuous",800,"2017" 2,11,"SB","continuous",300,"2017" I have tried three different ways of fitting the data. 1. Binomial with lme4 I started with a binomial family in the package lme4 : model1 Curiously, this first model failed: Error in pwrssUpdate(pp, resp, tol = tolPwrss, GQmat = GQmat, compDev = compDev, : Downdated VtV is not positive definite 2. Binomial with glmmadmb I then tried fitting the same model in the package glmmadmb , this time without the error message: model2 After checking overdispersion, it seemed like something was wrong with this model, too: > overdisp.glmer(model2) Residual deviance: 1848789055.502 on 24 degrees of freedom (ratio: 77032877.313) Here the model fit: 3. Negative binomial Finally, I tried fitting the model with a negative binomial distribution. This time, it converged without problems, and the residuals seemed well dispersed: model3 overdisp.glmer(model3) Residual deviance: 21.87 on 24 degrees of freedom (ratio: 0.911) My Question: Is there something conceptually wrong with choosing the negative binomial distribution in this case? Why did my first model fail in the first place / why did the binomial model look so bad?
