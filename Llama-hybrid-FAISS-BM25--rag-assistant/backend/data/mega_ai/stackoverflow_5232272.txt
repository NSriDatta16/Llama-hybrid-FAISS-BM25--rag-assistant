Most efficient data storage

I need to transform/convert/process TransXchange data dump to reduce the size of data as some of the xml files can be up to 400 MB. I have the following options: Sqlite database CSV files Binary Serialization ? What is the best method of reducing the file sizes so that they would be feasible for use in a Windows Phone 7 application? EDIT: I am going to create journey planning application that will allow users to specify source and destination. The application will then present the available services. In down under we have spotty mobile broadband coverage therefore I am aiming to have offline application.
