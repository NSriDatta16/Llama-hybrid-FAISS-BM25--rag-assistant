I don't understand why the logo is taken into account in your algorithm. Generally speaking, you have to take into account variables in your algorithm that make sense, either because it is very obvious (which seems to be your case) or because you didn't find any correlation with other data (through a correlation algorithm). My suggestion is to remove the logo from your model first. Then, the two remaining variables might not be enough to do predictions with a data science algorithm. Perhaps the active days in last month is enough? Of course, the customers who have a high age and were present in the last month have lower chances to churn. What could be interesting in your case is predicting when a customer is most likely to churn thanks to a model that recognize time series patterns. However, I'm affraid there is no enough variables to reach interesting results, nor enough data because 1000 rows may not cover most scenarios and statistical sets.
