Longitudinal Study with variable sampling periods

I came across a dataset of a longitudinal study that has the following characteristics: Participants enter at any time in the study They can exit the study at any point for various reasons but cannot re-enter Samples are taken at semi-random intervals (e.g >2 months from each sampling period to the next but can be up 3 months or 1 year). Each subject has at least 3 samples (but can have e.g. 7). Each subject is monitored for a different amount of time. At each sampling point a few thousand parameters are recorded. The disease is in general progressing across time. I am familiar with different time-series / repeated measures models but they require a more well defined structure. Many of the characteristics of the study are similar to a survival analysis, especially the flexibility of observations, monitored time, etc. Furthermore, the great number of parameters measured is also a factor to take into account. Do you know of a model that can tackle elegantly this setup? Correlations of clinical variables across time as well as a linear/mixed model are definitely within the list but I was wondering if there is something that seems to address this setup better
