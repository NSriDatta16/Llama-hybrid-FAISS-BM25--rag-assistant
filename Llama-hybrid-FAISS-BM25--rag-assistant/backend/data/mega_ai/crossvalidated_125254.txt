I recommend you two great books on MCMC by Robert and Casella, one with examples in R and the second, very detailed, handbook . Hope they will make things more clear. As about your questions: 1a. in M-H you use the formula: $$A(x\rightarrow x') = \min\left(1,\frac{p(x')}{p(x)}\frac{q(x'\rightarrow x)}{q(x\rightarrow x')}\right)$$ so the fact that $q(x|x')$ is not always $> p(x)$ is not a problem. 1b. see the formula above. Check the books I recommended on this. Generally, your proposal should fit the data you want to simulate. If you use Normal distribution with std being too small, or too big the algorithm would not be efficient, however Normal distribution is not the only choice. No. See comment by Glen_b. No, it's not, because in independent M-H your proposal is independent, but your acceptance probability is dependent on previous draw. What you want to use MCMC for is to draw samples from posterior distribution, not "usually" but always in Bayesian framework. In Bayesian framework if want to estimate some unknown parameter $\theta$ you take some data $D$, some prior distribution of your choice for the parameter of interest, and then apply the Bayes theorem : $$p(\theta|D)=\frac{p(D|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(D)}$$ so you use distribution of your data given your prior $p(D|\theta)$, distribution of your prior $p(\theta)$ and likelihood $p(D)$ and get a posterior $p(\theta|D)$. So "posterior" is your "estimate".
