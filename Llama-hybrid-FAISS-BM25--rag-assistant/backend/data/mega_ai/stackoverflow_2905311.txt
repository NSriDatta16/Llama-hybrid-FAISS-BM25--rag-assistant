You seem to have two separate issues here: (1) credential storage on the client, and (2) communication with the service. You can address service communication (and prevent the stream interception) by operating your service under SSL. The entire communication stream is encrypted. Credential storage on the client is outside the bounds of your API -- you can't control what someone does with credentials. If you're also responsible for deploying and maintaing the desktop client that calls your API, there are strategies for retaining credentials on the client (OS dependent.) Otherwise, your safest bet is simple -- don't store the credentials, require the user to supply uid/pwd parameters with each session. Again, it's all dependent on the host OS and client application.
