Jaynes writes at length about Lindley's paradox in the commentary at the end of Bernardo (1980), A Bayesian analysis of classical hypothesis testing . I found it more or less by chance after I'd stopped searching for anything Jaynes wrote about it and carried on reading generally about Lindley's paradox. I'm not sure if the paper or the comments are well known (there are other interesting comments including from Lindley himself, so maybe it is). Jaynes doesn't cite work by himself about Lindley's paradox, which suggests he did not write about it elsewhere.
