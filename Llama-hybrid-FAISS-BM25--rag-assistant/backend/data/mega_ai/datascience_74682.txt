Is over fitting okay if test accuracy is high enough?

I am trying to build a binary classifier. I have tried deep neural networks with various different structures and parameters and I was not able to get anything better than Train set accuracy : 0.70102 Test set accuracy : 0.70001 Then I tried machine learning algorithms such as KNN and Decision Trees etc. And I found that Random forest Classifier from Scikit-learn with n_estimators=100 gave me Train set accuracy : 1.0 Test set accuracy : 0.924068 I tried adjusting other parameters such as max_depth , criterion But the decrease in training set accuracy also caused the test set accuracy to drop. Like Train set accuracy : 0.82002 Test set accuracy : 0.75222 My question is, is this Train set accuracy : 1.0 Test set accuracy : 0.924068 acceptable ? Even thought the model is over fitting, the test set accuracy is better.
