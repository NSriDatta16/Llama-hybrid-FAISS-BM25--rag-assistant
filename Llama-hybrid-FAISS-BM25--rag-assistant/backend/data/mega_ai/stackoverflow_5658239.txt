In your comment, you mentioned the word 'sprint'. That tells me you may be using Scrum(or any other Agile) methodology. In Scrum you hardly 'freeze' anything :) Flexibility, risk identification and mitigation, and above all, in terms of engineering, continuous integration matter a lot in Scrum. Given this, the team should be cross-functional and the code will be continuously integrated. As a result, you may not have things like 'code freeze'. You just have a releasable product at the end of the sprint. It should have been tested continuously and you should have already got the bug reports which you should have fixed already. Well, this is theory. However, good scrum teams aren't too far from theory, as scrum is mainly about principles. There aren't too many rules. I personally won't split too many hairs on the terminology, but the intention behind the term. Most certainly, the term is used to identify a stage in the SDLC, in your organization. Speaking strictly as per Scrum, it doesn't have a bug fix phase. In case you're dedicating one or more sprints to fix bugs, then this term can mean, "no feature backlogs will be included in the sprint, but only bug fixes". This can be easily handled at the sprint planning (and pre-planning) meeting(s) and the team doesn't even have to worry about the terminology. Even better, this terminology/intention doesn't even have to go beyond the Product Owner.
