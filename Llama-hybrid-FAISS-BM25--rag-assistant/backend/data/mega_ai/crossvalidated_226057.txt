It sounds like they are classifying material types where the material in question does not necessarily fill the entire image. The preceding sentence from the same paper More recent datasets such as FMD and DTD remove this limitation by building on images downloaded from the Internet, dubbed images “in the wild”. However, in these datasets texture always fill the field of view of the camera. In this paper we remove this limitation by experimenting for the first time with a large dataset of textures collected in the wild and in cluttered conditions. My guess is therefore that they are literally talking about a class of materials that are in the background of what they want to classify, which is a common term in image based machine learning where for instance a picture of a dog on a road requires learning the target class, 'dog', but also includes a background class 'road'. Note that an image might include more than one background class such as 'road', 'car' and 'sky' [1]. They go on to mention that Texture is traditionally described by orderless pooling of filter bank responses as, unlike in objects, the overall shape information is usually unimportant. However, small under-sampled textures may benefit if recognized in the context of an object So for them recognizing the background or context class is important as some materials show up with some objects and possibly even on some backgrounds more often than others. Background class also seems to be used as a term for the majority class which contrasts what you are trying to classify. The terminology makes sense particularly for binary classification of varied datasets, for instance finding pictures of birds in mixed pictures of animals. In that case you are classifying 'bird' vs. 'not-bird' and it makes sense to look at bird pictures as the signal and everything else as the background noise. tl;dr: In the cited example it seems like they are actually talking about the literal background and otherwise background class can be used as a synonym for majority class.
