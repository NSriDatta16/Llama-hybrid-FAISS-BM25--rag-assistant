How to sample a total variation prior?

I am interested in drawing samples from a total variation prior: $$\pi_{\mathrm{pr}}(\boldsymbol{x})=\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)^n\exp\left(-\alpha\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\vert x_{j+1}-x_{j}\vert\right)=\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)^n\exp\left(-\alpha\Vert\mathbf{L}\boldsymbol{x}\Vert_1\right)=\mathrm{Laplace}(\Vert\mathbf{L}\boldsymbol{x}\Vert_1;0,\alpha^{-1}),$$ where $\mathbf{L}$ is a difference matrix and $\alpha$ is the inverse of the scale parameter of a Laplace distribution. My initial guess was to generate sample paths of a process such that: (i) it starts at 0, (ii) the increments are independent, and (iii) the increments are distributed according to $\mathrm{Laplace}(\cdot;0,\alpha^{-1})$ . Is this procedure correct? Or is there any other way to generate samples from such distribution (other than MCMC)? Thanks in advance!
