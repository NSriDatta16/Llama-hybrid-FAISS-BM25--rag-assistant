Core dump and gcov coverage report

I'm doing stress testing on multi-threaded program and collecting coverage as well. As far as I know, gcov doesn't produce .gcda files when program is terminated by _exit() or some signals such as SIGABRT, SIGSEGV and so on. When the program crashes, core file is generated by signal and gcov coverage data isn't generated. Obviously I could handle the signal and generate the coverage data but in this case I couldn't generate core dump file. But I'd like to generate both core dump and gcov data file to figure out the cause of the crash. My question is that is there any way to generate core dump without signals or is there any way to generate gcov coverage data file when the program abruptly terminates?
