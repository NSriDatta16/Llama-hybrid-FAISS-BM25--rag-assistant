A similar question has already been asked. but... I would say not anymore . It was originally intended to hide generated code from WinForms in early versions of .NET. With partial classes the need seems to go away. IMHO it gets way overused now as an organizational construct and has no compiler value whatsoever. It's all for the IDE.
