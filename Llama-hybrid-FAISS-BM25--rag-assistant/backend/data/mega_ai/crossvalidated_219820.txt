The plural of anecdote isn't data, but in almost any course I've seen, at least the basics of probability comes before statistics. On the other hand, historically, ordinary least squares was developed before the normal distribution was discovered! The statistical method came first, the more rigorous, probability based justification of why it works came second! Stephen Stigler's History of Statistics: Measurement of Uncertainty Before 1900 takes the reader through the historical development: Mathematicians, astronomers understood basic mechanics and the law of gravity. They could describe the motion of heavenly bodies as a function of several parameters. They also had hundreds of observations of the celestial bodies, but how should the observations be combined to recover the parameters? A hundred observations gives you one hundred equations, but if there are only three unknowns to solve for, this is an overdetermined system... Legendre was first to develop the method of minimizing the sum of the square error. Later this was connected with the work in probability of Gauss and Laplace, that ordinary least squares was in some sense optimal given normally distributed errors. Why do I bring this up? There's a certain logical elegance to first build up the mathematical machinery required to derive, understand some method, to lay the foundation before you build the house. In the reality of science though, the house often comes first, the foundation second :P. I'd love to see results from the education literature. What's more effective for teaching? What then why? Or why then what? (I might be a weirdo, but I found the story of how least squares was developed to be an exciting page turner! Stories can make otherwise boring, abstract stuff come alive...)
