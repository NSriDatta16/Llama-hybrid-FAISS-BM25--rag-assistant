BERT Optimization for Production

I'm using BERT to transform text into 768 dim vector, It's multilingual : from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer model = SentenceTransformer('paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2') Now i want to put the model into production but the embedding time is too much and i want to reduce and optimize the model to reduce the embedding time What are the libraries that enable me to do this ?
