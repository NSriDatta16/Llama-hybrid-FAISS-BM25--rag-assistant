Suggestions on slow loading sites/server

We have a cloud hosting account that gives us 2GB of memory and 3GHZ processor using cpanel and centos as the OS. The problem we are having is pages seem to load slow and not just for us. Others have mentioned its slow. But we only have one web application and the load is almost at zero with over a gig of memory showing still available. The web application uses a theme we bought at themeforest and it has a ton of css styling and javascript for curved corners, drop shadow etc. Im wondering if the template itself is causing the slowness because of it doing a lot of rendering via the browser? It seems faster on a desktop than on an ipad. Is there any tools to determine any potential loading issues? Again we watch the load average while people use it and there is hardly any load yet from clicking from page to page it seems to take a few seconds to render. The page size shows under 2kb. When pinging the server it ranges 70-90ms and it takes 10-12 hops. Any suggestions at all?
