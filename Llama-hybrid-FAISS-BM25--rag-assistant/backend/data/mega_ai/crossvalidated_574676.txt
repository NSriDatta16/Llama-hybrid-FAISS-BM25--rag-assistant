Strictly speaking (in my humble opinion), you cannot build up an empirical distribution from the data to then detect outliers in the data (sort of a chicken and the egg problem). You can evaluate the statistical leverage each observation has on an estimate to determine if it is influential. However, as the comments pointed out, you have a nice matrix of time series data. How do you organize this unstructured dataset? Unsupervised learning! Personally, I would use the dtwclust package in R as seen in this wonderful tutorial here . Essentially, this package performs standard clustering methods but with a time series focused distance metric (as opposed to Euclidean). What this will pop out is groups of similar time series, hopefully with some luck and tweaking you find a nice decision boundary to identify what you call irregular sleep patterns.
