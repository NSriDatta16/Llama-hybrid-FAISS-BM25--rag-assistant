I would take documents from various languages and reference them against Unicode. You could then use some bayesian reasoning to determine which language it is by the just the unicode characters used. This would seperate French from English or Russian. I am not sure exactly on what else could be done except lookup the words in language dictionaries to determine the language (using a similar probabilistic approach).
