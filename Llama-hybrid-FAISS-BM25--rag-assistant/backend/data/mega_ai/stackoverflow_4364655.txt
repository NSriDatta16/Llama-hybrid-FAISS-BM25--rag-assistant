The IS-A relationship is also known as the gen-spec design pattern. Gen-spec is short for "generalization specialization". Relational modeling of gen-spec is different from object modeling of gen-spec because the relational model doesn't have inheritance built in. Here is a good article that shows how to implement gen-spec as a collection of tables. http://www.javaguicodexample.com/erdrelationalmodelnotes1.html Pay particular attention to the way primary keys are set up in the specialized tables. That's what makes using these tables so easy. You can find lots of other articles by googlin "generalization specialization relational modeling".
