how to detect javascript features on Android 1.5

I'm trying to write a code that can run on Android 1.5 and 2.0.1, but I have issues with the javascript engine used on Android 1.5. alert(localStorage); just hang on v1.5 while on v2.0.1 it alerts correctly. is there an unblocking way to do it or to detect the version of Android with javascript?
