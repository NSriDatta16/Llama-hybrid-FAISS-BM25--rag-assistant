JavaScript is a client-side language (and should stay that way!). You cannot run statements against a database from JavaScript. You need a server-side language for this (ASP.NET, PHP, or the like), or a web service for JavaScript to ping to kick it off. Once you determine that, though, you can use sp_start_job to kick off a SQL Server Agent job that in turn kicks off the SSIS package for you. Or, you can use an exec command (depending on the language you use), and you can use the dtexec utility to directly start the package.
