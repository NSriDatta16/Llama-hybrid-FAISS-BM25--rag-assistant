Clarification for the test and validation set

I have been trying to figure out the difference between validation and test set used in the machine learning studies. In almost all places, I found that I have to split the dataset into three parts (ie. 50/20/20) ratio to obtain the training, validation, and test sets, respectively. However, I have a question that whether it would be possible if I do this following method in my study: I split my data set into 80:20 for training and validation set. And then, I will use a completely new dataset (as an external set) for my test set. Is it legit? Would appreciate any insight on this.
