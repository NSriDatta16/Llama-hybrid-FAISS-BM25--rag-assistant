While it isn't strictly PHP, (it is a executable) one i really like is w3c's HTML tidy. it will show what is wrong with the HTML, and fix it if you want it to. It also beautifies HTML so it doesn't look like a mess. runs from the command line and is easy to integrate into php. check it out. http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/
