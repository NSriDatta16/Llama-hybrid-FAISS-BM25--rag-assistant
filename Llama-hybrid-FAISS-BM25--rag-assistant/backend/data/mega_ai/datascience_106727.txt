Your question is whether you violate best practice if you use the delta in your HMM, and if there's any pitfalls. I think to answer the first, and prevent the second, you could do what is often done in the case where people want to use a HMM whilst using information from more than one previous state: rewrite the latent chain, such that it becomes a 'standard' Markov chain again. This will probably require some wrangling, but prevents violating the Markov property and any potential pitfalls you're worried about. Say your original latent chain is $X_t$ . You can rewrite this to $Y_t=(X_t, X_{t-1})$ . This $Y_t$ then meets the fulfills the Limited Horizon assumption in the sense that it only depends on $Y_{t-1}$ . Depending on your specific use-case, make sure to also adjust the definition of the original state $Y_0$
