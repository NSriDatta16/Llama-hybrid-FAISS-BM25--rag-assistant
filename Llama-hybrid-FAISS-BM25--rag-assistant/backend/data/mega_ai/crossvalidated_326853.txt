Typically, you'd use an RNN to learn to classify the sequences. So, convert each timestep of your input data into some features, eg 1-hot over the pitch, or similar. Feed the input data for each timestep into an RNN. Put a classifier over the final hidden state of the RNN (you should probably use the 'LSTM' form of an RNN by the way). Train your network :)
