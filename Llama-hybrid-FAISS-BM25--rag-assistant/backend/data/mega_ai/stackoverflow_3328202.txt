It's personal preference. The best advice we can give you is consistency, legibility and ensuring the relationships are correctly named as well. Use names that make sense and aren't abbreviated if possible, unless the storage mechanism you are using doesn't work well with them. In relationships, I like to use Id on the primary key and [table_name]_Id on the foreign key. eg. Order.Id and OrderItem.Order_Id It works well if using a surrogate key as a primary key. Your storage mechanism may or may not be case sensitive, so be sure to that into account. Edit: Also, there is some theory to suggest that the table should be named after what a single record in that table should represent. So, table name "User" instead of "Users" - personally the plural makes more sense to me, just keep it consistent.
