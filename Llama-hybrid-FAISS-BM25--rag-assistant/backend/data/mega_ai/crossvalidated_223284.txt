From a logical point of view, I'd say you want to cluster the groups, not the group members? Doing this with k-means is peobably equivalent to clustering the group averages. With EM the situation is a bit more complicated, but roughly it should be equivalent to making each group a Gaussian, then clustering the Gaussians using EM. I would also try hierarchical clustering. Define a similarity function of groups akin to the linkage criterions: minimum distance between group members? average? $$d(G,H):=\frac{1}{|G||H|}\sum_{g\in G}\sum_{h\in H} d(g,h)$$ and then run AGNES on the resulting matrix.
