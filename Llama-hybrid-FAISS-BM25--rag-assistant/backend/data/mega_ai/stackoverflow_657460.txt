its really one of those debatable things like tables vs divs etc etc. In my opinion, theres a lot of developers so entrenched in OO that they try to stick it on everything, first Javascript and now CSS. Dont get me wrong JavaScript has elements of OO as well, but i digress. Since CSS is already a buzzword in itself (all the employers want the web 2.0 CSS approach) a lot of new developers are discovering it. This is not a bad thing, however as developers they did what they do best and tried to improve on CSS. In a developers mind (I'm a developer) organizing CSS according to the OO principles makes perfect sense - hence the new buzzword. Ultimately what I am trying to say is that OO CSS is just an approach that certain people take, since it seems more logical. If you are writing CSS that is going to be maintained by developers then this approach will suit well. It really comes down to you how you write your CSS and your own personal style... Personally I don't care how people write their CSS - if it falls on me to maintain it, Firebug makes the job trivial anyway.
