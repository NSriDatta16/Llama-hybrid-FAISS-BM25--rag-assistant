How I can convert distance (Euclidean) to similarity score

I am using $k$ means clustering to cluster speaker voices. When I compare an utterance with clustered speaker data I get (Euclidean distance-based) average distortion. This distance can be in range of $[0,\infty]$. I want to convert this distance to a $[0,1]$ similarity score. Please guide me on how I can achieve this.
