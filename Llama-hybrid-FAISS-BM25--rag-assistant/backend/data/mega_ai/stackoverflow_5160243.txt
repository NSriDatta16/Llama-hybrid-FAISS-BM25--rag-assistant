MySql + InnoDB + PHP Single Quote Discrimination?

Okay, I've recently converted a number of tables to the InnoDB storage engine and I've been getting errors whenever I use a single-quote ' in the column list of the INSERT statement: INSERT INTO 'Table' ('Col1', 'Col2') VALUES ('Val1', 'Val2') When I tired using phpMyAdmin to generate a proper statement, it looked virtually the same, so I pasted it in my app, and it worked. Then my next statement had the same error so I started to get suspicious. After a bit of playing around I found that the problem was that the query needed a back-tick instead of single-quotes, but not for the whole thing. INSERT INTO `Table` (`Col1`, `Col2`) VALUES ('Val1', 'Val2') works, so it's not like MySql doesn't understand the single-quote. What is going on here? I also can't just leave the columns unquoted like before with MyISAM (ie: Table(Col1, Col2))
