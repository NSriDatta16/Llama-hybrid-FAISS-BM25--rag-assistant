Sharing Google Analytics with Clients

We develop websites for clients and want to give them access to their site analytics. Not all our clients have their own google accounts, and moreover we want a unified system where multiple people at a client organization can have access to their site's analytics. At first I thought I would set up an analytics account under our company's google apps account, and add our clients as users with varying access. However, I've just discovered that Google Analytics works only with personal google accounts- NOT with Google Apps accounts?! You can only access Analytics reports using a valid Google Accounts email address. You cannot sign in to Analytics with an email address hosted by Google Apps. ( See here ) That leaves us with two unappealing options: Add clients as users to the Google Analytics associated with my personal google account. Create personal google accounts for each client organization we want to set up with analytics. Does anyone have a better approach to this? Thanks--
