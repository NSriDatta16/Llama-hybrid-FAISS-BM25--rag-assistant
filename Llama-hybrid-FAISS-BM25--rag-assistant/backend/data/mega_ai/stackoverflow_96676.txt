I'm just about to start doing Javascript TDD on a new project I am working on. My current plan is to use qunit to do the unit testing. While developing the tests can be run by simply refreshing the test page in a browser. For continuous integration (and ensuring the tests run in all browsers), I will use Selenium to automatically load the test harness in each browser, and read the result. These tests will be run on every checkin to source control. I am also going to use JSCoverage to get code coverage analysis of the tests. This will also be automated with Selenium. I'm currently in the middle of setting this up. I'll update this answer with more exact details once I have the setup hammered out. Testing tools: qunit JSCoverage Selenium
