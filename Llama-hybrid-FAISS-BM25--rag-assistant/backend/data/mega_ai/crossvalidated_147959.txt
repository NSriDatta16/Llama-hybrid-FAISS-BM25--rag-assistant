Does PCA of high-dimensional data yield inaccurate reconstruction?

I have a data $1600\times5000$ matrix $X$ containing 1600 datapoints in 5000-dimensional space. Using MATLAB's built-in pca function, I get the loadings in coeff . In theory, coeff*coeff' should give us a almost-indentity matrix. For example: coeff = pca(rand(1000,1000)); coeff*coeff'; However, in my case, coeff*coeff' is far away from identity, with some of the diagonal entries as low as 0.01. As a result, if I wish to reconstruct my data points, even with all the PCs, I worry that the results may be lousy. What is the possible explanation for this? And is there a way I can get around this problem?
