Normal approximation to the posterior distribution

Suppose we have a posterior sample of parameter $\theta$ obtained by fitting some Bayesian model to $n$ data points. In black is the empirical posterior density and in red is a normal approximation to the posterior. Is there a way to write the normal approximation to the posterior in terms of $n$ ? (My goal is to have an idea of what the posterior distribution would have been if I had had a larger $n$ .)
