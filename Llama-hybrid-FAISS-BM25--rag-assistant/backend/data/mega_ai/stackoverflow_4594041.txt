Error logging and retrieval in an ad-hoc application build?

Hi there friends Is there someway that we can log errors from a ad-hoc build running on a testers iphone and mail it? The situation is, the application runs fine, but it depends on a lot of factors, location etc and crashes on the ad-hoc testers phone; the ad-hoc tester is in a totally different country. Is there anyway to generate an error log when the app crashes and mail it or send it to a server? Thanks
