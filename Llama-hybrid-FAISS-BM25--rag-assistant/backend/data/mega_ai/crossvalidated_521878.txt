Not a naive question at all. I'm not an expert, but I think this is actually a rather difficult question. As you may be aware, Rubin's Rules assume that the full-data estimate, $\hat{\theta}_{full}$ , would be normally distributed. Then from the $M$ imputed estimates, $\hat{\theta}_{1}, \ldots, \hat{\theta}_{M}$ , we average them to find the point estimate $\hat{\theta}_{imp}$ and also combine the within- and between- variances to estimate the variance of $\hat{\theta}_{imp}$ , $\hat{\text{V}}[\hat{\theta}_{imp}]$ . Then we can use traditional methods for normally distributed values to find confidence intervals and perform tests. If the estimates $\hat{\theta}_{i}$ are not normally distributed then this will not work. My understanding is that the Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistic, $W$ , is asymptotically normally distributed. So in contrast to the SPSS manual, I think you could pool the estimates if you had a large sample. Although if it isn't supported by SPSS you'd probably have to program the calculations yourself. But, it sounds like your sample isn't nearly large enough to consider this. $W$ is not close to normally distributed in small samples. An alternative you could consider would be pooling the p-values from the imputed datasets themselves. I don't know enough to offer guidance on it, but you can read about the procedure in section 5.3.2 of Flexible Imputation of Missing Data, https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/sec-multiparameter.html#sec:chi . The basic idea is to transform the imputed p-values to be approximately normally distributed, pool those transformed values, then transform back to find the final p-value. You can see some sample code in this answer, How to get pooled p-values on tests done in multiple imputed datasets? Of course, if the amount of missing data is very small, you could consider using a complete-case analysis instead. The results would probably be very similar.
