magento bundle.js error

I just discovered on my site using magento 1.3.2.2 that on a bundled product, when adding different options the price does not change in internet explorer. It works fine in all other browsers however. In internet explorer I get the error message. Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 34 Char: 9 Code: 0 URI: /skin/frontend/my_new_interface/design2/js/bundle.js So I checked out line 34 and found parts = selection.id.split('-'); I verified that selection.id is a string. I'm not a javascript expert and I'm not familiar with prototype. On a lark I decided to split up the line as: var parts = selection.id; parts = part.split('-'); Well that fixed the problem. Furthermore I went back and just reduced to: var parts = selection.id.split('-'); Which still worked as well. I don't think this is a file I should be messing with though. I'm assuming this javascript class should work fine in ie without me having to change anything. I'm hoping someone has an idea of why this might have fixed the problem or what I can do to find out what the real problem is. Do you see any problem with me leaving this fix the way it is?
