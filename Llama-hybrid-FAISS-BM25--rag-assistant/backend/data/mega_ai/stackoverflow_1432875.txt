What is a good and USEFUL project to code to learn WCF?

I like my learning projects to also be useful. If not to me then to somebody around me. What are some good projects I could code using WCF (to learn it) that I will be able to put to use for myself, or for someone or some organization I may know? What I am not interested in tutorials, or books on how to learn it. Thanks.
