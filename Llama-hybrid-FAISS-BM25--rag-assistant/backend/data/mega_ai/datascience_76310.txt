In the first example there are 60000 images of 28 28 which is a 2d grayscale image. But in order to use CNN your images must be 3 dimensinal with height, width and channel as a new dimension. So you have to resize your every 28 * 28 image into 28 28*1 image before you can send it into your CNN layers.
