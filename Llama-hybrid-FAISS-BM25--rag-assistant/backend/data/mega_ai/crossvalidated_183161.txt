Confusion in Training Logistic Regression Model

I have a confusion in Cost function in Logistic Regression, I have a set of data Cond.1 and I have used logistic regression to plot this data lr.model = glm(ind~values+I(values^2), dat, family="binomial") lr.preds = predict(lr.model, type="response") ord = order(dat$values) dat = dat[ord,] lr.preds = lr.preds[ord] windows() with(dat, plot(values, ifelse(ind=="cond2",1,0), ylab="predicted probability of condition2")) lines(dat$values, lr.preds) Now, I want to apply a Loss function to it. I dont know how to train the model or how to get h(x) (hypothesis/response surface or the predicted values). I also saw somewhere that in Logistical Regression h=log(p/(1-p)) where P is probability +ve outcome. If that is true then the predicted values are comming from 'test data'. I have a confusion here, How to train the model? If h(x) is comming from test data then is there need to train the model ? If not, then how to get training data? I have 39 observations in each condition, if I train the model with 20 and test it with 19, will it be wise or I have less data?
