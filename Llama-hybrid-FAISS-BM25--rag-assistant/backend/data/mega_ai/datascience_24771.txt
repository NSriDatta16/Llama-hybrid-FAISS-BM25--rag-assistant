The question "how NN can be applied if not in machine learining" is incorrect. It's like "how cats can be applied if not in animals"? Cats are animals. And neural networks are a kind of machine learning . So a meaningful question is "where machine learning can be applied?", or "where statistics can be applied?", or "where math can be applied?". And the answer is: everywhere.
