Unemployed people are one reason that average salaries are usually denoted in literature by the median, not the mean. If you use the median as the average, it does not matter quite so much whether they are included or not. As an aside, another reason is outliers on the other side: people making many, many more times than the average which can skew the mean badly. If you want to communicate what the average person is making, the one person making $100,000,000 a year is not really relevant.
