Hypothesis test testing for monotonic group mean change

I wonder if there is a statistical hypothesis test testing whether group average monotonically increases across groups? For example, I have four treatment groups, A, B, C and D. I would like to test the hypothesis if the averages increase monotonically, i.e. $\bar{A} ?
