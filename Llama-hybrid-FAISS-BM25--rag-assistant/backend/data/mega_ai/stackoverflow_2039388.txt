Can a NSFormatter be used with a NSPopUpButton?

This question is similar to this one: How do I use an NSFormatter subclass with an NSPopUpButton As mentioned in that question, it seems like the 'formatter' used by the cell of a NSPopUpButton doesn't seem to work. I'm wondering if this is expected, or if there is actually a purpose to setting the formatter of a NSPopUpButton. Right now, I have a NSPopUpButton whose "Content Objects" are bound to the arrangedObjects of a NSArrayController whose "Content Array" is a NSArray of NSNumbers. Setting the formatter of the NSPopUpButton cell to a simple NSNumberFormatter which formats NSNumbers in a currency format doesn't work; the pop up menu displays the numbers un-formatted. I'm wondering how I can format strings displayed in the pop up menu of an NSPopUpButton? I feel like this should be fairly straight-forward; having to use a value transformer, or a special value for the display path, seems like overkill and should be easier. Thanks in advance.
