Is training in Biostats sufficient to get into Data Science?

I'm considering going back to graduate school after a few years working as a market analyst. I prefer to stay in my current city, where there are two statistics programs I'm interested in. The first is a more traditional stats program at a private university and the other is a biostats program at a public university. The biostats program is significantly cheaper, which isn't the sole factor but it is a big one. I would like to do consulting after grad school (a company like Accenture, for example). The core curriculum for both is similar - regression analysis, applied modeling, etc - but obviously the Biostats program has classes like epidemiology and survival analysis whereas the traditional program has electives in data mining and visualization. Would the biostats program be enough to get a solid data science job or should I stick to a traditional program?
