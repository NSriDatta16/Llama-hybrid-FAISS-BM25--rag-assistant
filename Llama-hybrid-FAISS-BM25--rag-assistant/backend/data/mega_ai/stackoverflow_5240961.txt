I'm pretty sure that you cannot autoincrement in pairs like that. However, you can easily treat a column that has 1,2,3,4,... as if it had 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,... by using FLOOR((match_id+1)/2) instead of match_id . You can either use that expression in your data retrieval statements or else denormalize your data base and define a column where you insert that value along with the autoincrement value.
