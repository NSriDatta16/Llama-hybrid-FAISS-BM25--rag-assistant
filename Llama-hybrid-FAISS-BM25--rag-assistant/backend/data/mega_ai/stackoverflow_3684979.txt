I think that you were unable to export the private key because the constructor you have used to create the certificate X509Certificate2(filePath, password) does not mark the resulting certificate as exportable. I suggest to use one of the overloaded constructors that allows you to specify the exportable flag - X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable, for example X509Certificate2(filePath, password, X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable) . Details on available constructor overloads for the X509Certificate2 and other X509KeyStorageFlags on MSDN Library. Also you should check the X509Certificate2.HasPrivateKey property to make sure that you have a private key associated with the certificate.
