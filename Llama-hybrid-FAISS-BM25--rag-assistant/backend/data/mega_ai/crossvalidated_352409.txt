I'd say lmer(Homerangesize~park*year*month+(1|ID), contrasts=list(park="contr.sum",year="contr.sum",month="contr.sum"), data=your_data) makes sense. That estimates the full three-way interaction between park, year, and month as fixed effects, but uses sum-to-zero contrasts so that the reported main effect of month is the average across all park $\times$ year combinations. You should in principle also allow for the variation in among-year/among-month variation in home ranges per individual, e.g. Homerangesize~park*year*month+(1|ID)+(1|ID:month)+(1|ID:year) although this model might be slightly more complex than you can fit with your data.
