Dealing with drawables for various screens sizes

I have observed from the HDPI, MDPI and LDPI icons from a new Android project, they are in the ratio of 6:4:3 (72:48:36). So would it be a good idea to scale my other drawables in the same ratio? If not what is the best way to scale drawable resources for an application for deployment?
