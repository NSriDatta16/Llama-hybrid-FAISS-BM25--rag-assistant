What kind of learning is feature generation for score maximization?

What kind of deep learning is the generation of numerical features (Y) from objects (X) used to compute a score (f(.), differentiable) that is to be maximized directly? Basically NN $\theta$ (x) = y, f(y) = score, so $\frac{d score}{d\theta} = \frac{dy}{d\theta} \frac{d f(y)}{dy}$ can be used for backpropagation; f(.) can be seen as a form of loss function. This doesn't seem like supervised learning as no label exists for $x$ . A good one could be found, but the best label score-wise isn't known and the search shouldn't be guided with potentially sub-optimal $y$ s. This isn't reinforcement learning, as the score is differentiable and used for backprop; there is also no sequential decision-making. Is this a form of deep unsupervised learning? Self-supervised learning?
