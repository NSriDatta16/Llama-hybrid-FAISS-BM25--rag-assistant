client agent framework (web-services)

I have a scenario where my server side java code needs to interact with an application on the client desktop. So I was researching on if there are any simple frameworks to enable such interaction, say using web-services or pure java-servlets. I could create one custom framework to enable this, but the technical challenge I foresee would be to figure out the URL (or the IP) to post the request to the client servlet. Any ideas or knowhow would be of great help. Thanks Venkat
