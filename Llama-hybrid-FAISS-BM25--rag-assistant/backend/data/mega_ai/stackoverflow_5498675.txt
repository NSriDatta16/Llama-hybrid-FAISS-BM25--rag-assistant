First of all your truth table is wrong: It give 1 of a!=b, 0 otherwise. Second the point used in graphics is (at least was in Pascal :) you can draw a shape and each pixel's color will be Original_pixel_color XOR shape_color. If you do this twice, the shape disappears because double XOR gives you the original input. I used it e.g. when I was drawing something in simple graphic editor. When you create the object using mouse you can simply draw it using this special XOR usage without need to remember the background, because you can erase it simply by drawing it again (when for example sizing or moving the object dragged by mouse). Hope this helps :)
