interpretation of logistic coefficient

I have some toy data for an experiment where subjects are shown pictures A,B and C and then they are given a choice between choice A or choice B. I am interested in determining the effect of the pictures on the response. I am running a logistic regression to see how the pictures increase or decrease the liklihood of choose A or B. Here choosing A is coded 1 and choosing B is coded 0. Here is some toy data for 100 subjects and the output of the logistic regression: > set.seed(666) > choice = sample(c(1,0),100, TRUE) > sex = sample(c("M","F"),100,TRUE) > picture = sample(c("A","B","C"),100,TRUE) > data = data.frame(choice = choice, sex = sex, picture = picture) > s=summary(glm(data = data, choice ~ factor(sex) + factor(picture), family = binomial(link = logit) )) > s Call: glm(formula = choice ~ factor(sex) + factor(picture), family = binomial(link = logit), data = data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.2957 -1.1216 -0.8907 1.1685 1.4943 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.1200 0.4133 0.290 0.7716 factor(sex)M 0.1539 0.4186 0.368 0.7132 factor(picture)B -0.2527 0.5191 -0.487 0.6264 factor(picture)C -0.8399 0.4962 -1.693 0.0905 . --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 137.63 on 99 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 134.51 on 96 degrees of freedom AIC: 142.51 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 > c = coef(s) > log_odds_ratio = c[,c("Estimate")] # log odds ratio > log_odds_ratio (Intercept) factor(sex)M factor(picture)B factor(picture)C 0.1199990 0.1538543 -0.2527420 -0.8398664 > odds_ratio = exp(log_odds_ratio) > odds_ratio (Intercept) factor(sex)M factor(picture)B factor(picture)C 1.1274957 1.1663209 0.7766682 0.4317682 > probability = odds_ratio/(1+odds_ratio) > probability (Intercept) factor(sex)M factor(picture)B factor(picture)C 0.5299638 0.5383879 0.4371487 0.3015629 The coefficients reported are in log odds so I take the exponential of the coef vector to make the odds_ratio vector. My question is on interpretation of the picture B and picture C odds ratios: 0.7766682 0.4317682 I am interpreting 0.7766682 that seeing picture B will increase the odds ratio of choosing A (i.e. response=1) 0.7766682 MORE than picture A. Is that correct? I then calculate the probabilities using the odds ratios above. probability (Intercept) factor(sex)M factor(picture)B factor(picture)C 0.5299638 0.5383879 0.4371487 0.3015629 How should one interpret these probabilities? Picture B has a .437 probability of what? Finally, how would you graphically show the different effects of the 3 pictures so interpretation can be understood for a non-statistician audience? Would you plot the regression lines?Using log odds Betas or exp(Betas)? If so can you give an example plot? Thank you very much
