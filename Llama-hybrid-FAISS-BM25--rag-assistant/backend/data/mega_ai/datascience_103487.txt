How to combine binary classification with patient stratification?

I am working on a binary classification model (healthy/diseased) based on gene expression data of different patients. As a second task, I would like to stratify these patients and find subgroups. I expect that the summary pattern of different genes within an experiment will be the strongest predictor of the outcome (differential coexpression analysis). How do I deal with the importance of the group-setup in my ML model if I need to follow the rule not to include IDs (in my case experiment IDs) in a model? Also, I have repeated measures of the same patients and also hope for significant differences between some patient groups - does that mean I should just include the patient IDs as well, or pre-define some groups, or use all patient characteristics that could be interesting as features? This is how my data is currently organized: experiment ID gene expression patient ID label 1 A 11 1234 healthy 1 B 5 1234 healthy 2 A 3 4356 diseased 2 B 9 4356 diseased 3 A 13 1234 healthy 3 B 6 1234 healthy
