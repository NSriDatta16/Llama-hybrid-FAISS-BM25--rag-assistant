How to compute the maximum value of a trace function?

The problem is given by: $$ \text{maximize}_{W} \ \operatorname{Trace}(W^T H W L) \tag{1} $$ $$s.t: \ W^TW=I$$ where $W \in R^{n \times n}$ is a matrix variable and $H,L$ are constant square positive definite matrices that have the size of $n$. I am thinking of converting it into a generalized eigen decomposition problem like other linear dimensionality reduction methods. However, in most of previous work on those problems, the objective function will be similar to $W A W^T $. The appearance of matrix $L$ in (1) makes the problem difficult. Any advice ?
