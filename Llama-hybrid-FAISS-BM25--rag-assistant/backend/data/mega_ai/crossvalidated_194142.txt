What does 1x1 convolution mean in a neural network?

I am currently doing the Udacity Deep Learning Tutorial. In Lesson 3, they talk about a 1x1 convolution. This 1x1 convolution is used in Google Inception Module. I'm having trouble understanding what is a 1x1 convolution. I have also seen this post by Yann Lecun. Could someone kindly explain this to me?
