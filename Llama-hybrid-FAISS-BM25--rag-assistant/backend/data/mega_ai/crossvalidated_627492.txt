See Relative variable importance/explained variation from a single model fit for a related discussion where a permutation-based importance measure breaks down with high collinearity but a new linear model projection technique does not. The new relative explained variation measure applies to any regression model and may possibly apply to machine learning algorithms if a saturated linear model can approximate their outcomes. This is along the lines of preconditioning AKA model approximation.
