Display image outside where overflow:hidden?

I'm using Ganesh's very wonderful jCarouselLite jQuery plugin to display a scrolling series of thumbnail images at the top of a page. The container div necessarily has overflow:hidden to limit the number of thumbnails displayed at any one time. I would like to display a larger version of the thumbnail when the mouse hovers over it. I'm most of the way there using CSS but I can't persuade the large image to display outside the confines of the parent div due to the overflow setting and it displays "clipped" within that div. Is this possible using CSS?
