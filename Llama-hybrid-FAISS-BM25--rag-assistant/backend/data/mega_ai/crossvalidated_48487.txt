In case anyone's interested, I have implemented computing this expectation in two ways via a multivariate normal integral , using Alan Genz' MVNEXP FORTRAN library: (Check out the conditionalExp method down the page) Via Gibbs sampling , using a truncated normal distribution for MCMC ( also check out this paper ) In regards to @whuber's comment, the integration is NOT necessarily the faster approach; the Gibbs sampling is numerically simpler and can be sped up significantly by using fast (but less accurate) versions of the univariate normal. The multivariate normal integral is also tricky to use and has a tradeoff between accuracy and speed...just like the Gibbs sampler. In preliminary testing, it's inconclusive which one is faster for a given accuracy.
