If your userbase is large enough to require a high-performance DB, your bandwidth and storage charges will not be cheap; why skimp on the database? MS SQL has free and/or cheap editions which are performance-inhibited. I always start with them, and if the site takes off, I upgrade. Probably Oracle offers something similar. Edit: I should have said at the start that you're unlikely to outgrow MySQL anytime soon, and that this whole question might be a case of premature optimization.
