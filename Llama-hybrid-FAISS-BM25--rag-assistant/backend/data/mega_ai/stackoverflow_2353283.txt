Scrum is very popular (although it's just a management technique rather that a technical discipline) Extreme programming is a lot less popular, although it does get applied. (I've done loads of commercial XP projects - although it is hard to find teams that want to do XP. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is part of XP, although many people do it (and a lot more say that they do...) Lots of people seem to misunderstand concepts like refactoring, pair programming and the general concept of self-organising teams... those can be difficult for people who've gotten a measure of success from waterfall and have gotten entrenched in that way of doing things. It is a problem getting those people to try XP.
