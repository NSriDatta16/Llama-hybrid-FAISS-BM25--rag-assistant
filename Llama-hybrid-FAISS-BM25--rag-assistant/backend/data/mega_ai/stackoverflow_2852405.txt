You may wish to take a look at unicast for this, particularly if your clients are on multiple directories. You should be able to send TCP or UDP traffic out with your data to each of your clients, particularly if bandwidth needs are small. IP multicast works best to groups of nodes on networks near each other. Loop over client addresses repeatedly, and send your data. Moderate the rate at which you loop to limit the data rate. Pay attention to the reliability issue: correctness is not the only problem with UDP; you also have no acknowledgment that your data was received, and no guarantee on ordering. Baud doesn't really apply here, as the data is segmented into more or less discrete chunks.
