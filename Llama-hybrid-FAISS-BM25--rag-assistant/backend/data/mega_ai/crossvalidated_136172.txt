These are not appropriate for computing missing data - consider the case of heteroskedasticity in the data - neither of these approaches would work if their were 'weird' or idiosyncratic values in your data. In fact it would be more damaging (ie less accurate) to use mean or median replacement in this case if youre familiar with R, you could check out the MI package (my fave) or mice. This essentially runs a series of chained (ie bayesian) regressions on the data until some convergence criteria other options are expectation maximization (subject to overfitting problems IMO) and Hotdeck imputation check out these resources for more explanation about why mean/median replacement is generally a bad idea Rubin, D.
