Be sure to draw your conclusion from individual analysis not averages. Unless you would be answering a different question that includes packs in the hypothesis and not just A and B. Averaging then performing the analysis results in threats to ecological validity. The data within the packs could possibly be related, and this could be biasing your standard errors, making them smaller than they should be, resulting in small p -values. You could go about this in two ways: Calculate something called the design effect , and if it is large enough (greater than 2), you might need to account for the bias in your standard errors. One way to do this would be to multiply your standard errors by the root of the design effect (DEFT), and conduct the statistical test of significance for the correlation again. Another thing you could do would be to model the clustered nature of your data. One way to do this would be a mixed effects model. This is possible in many statistical packages. And your analysis would be quite easy given the simple nature of your problem. As a starting point, you can use this tool to calculate the design effect under the Intraclass correlation option. If you can upload your datafile in CSV format. Use the pack ID as the cluster variable, and B as the outcome (I'm assuming it is). I'd be glad to answer any questions you have in the comments. This article briefly introduces the problem with clustered data, and has several references. This other article goes into some detail of how one can use the DEFT to reduce the bias in the standard errors.
