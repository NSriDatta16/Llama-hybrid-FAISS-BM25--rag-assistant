ASP.NET MVC Areas: How to hide "Area" name in URL?

When running the MVC 2 Areas example that has a Blog Area and Blog Controller the URL looks like this: http://localhost:50526/Blog/Blog/ShowRecent in the format: RootUrl / AreaName / ControllerName / ActionName Having just discovered MVC Areas, it seem like a great way to organise code, ie create an Area for each section, which in my case each section has its own controller. This means that each AreaName = ControllerName. The effect of this is the double AreaName/ControllerName path in the Url eg /Blog/Blog/ above Not having a complete clear understanding of routing, how could I setup routing to not show the AreaName? EDIT: I am trying to reduce the amount of work with routes as these appear to effect each other (ie require specific ordering) and may cause major headaches :-) In converting an existing webform app to MVC, I have converted a couple of core sections, These have one Controller each and a fair amount of View/Actions and although most of the Data Access is code is in assemblies the number of Model/ViewData classes is growing... I am currently creating sub-folders in the Root Models/Views folders for these sections (or Areas) and was hoping that creating Areas would work the same way except having the code organised (with the use of a basic route that covers the Area) Any comment on this?
