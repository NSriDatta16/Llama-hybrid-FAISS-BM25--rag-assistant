and Database Insert of File Name

I am having a problem with the cffileupload tag and then inserting the names of the files uploaded into the database. It seems like there are no hooks back from the CF Action page that would say if it was successful, if the file was renamed, what the new filename is, and Basically, I want a user to be able to upload mulitple files (up to 10) without a timeout and storing the name of the files in the database. Any suggestions would be welcome! I've dug around on the interweb, and there doesn't seem to be any elegant solutions.
