Perl DBI fetch portion of database?

I'm working on a database, where the number of rows is somewhere above 1,000,000. I have my select statement, but if I fetchall to begin with, I run out of memory quickly. Here are my 2 questions: Since I dont know the exact size of the database to start, is there any way to find out the size of the database without doing a fetchall? The computer literally cannot support it. Is there any way to fetch say a certain chunk of the database, maybe like 5,000 at a time to process, instead of doing an individual fetchrow for each and every line? I just finished running a test, and to do it row by row, its looking to be almost 4 minutes per 1000 rows worked on, and the boss isnt looking favorably on a program that is going to take almost 3 days to complete. This is my code: while ($i fetchrow(); ($nameOne, $numberOne, $numberTwo) = someFunction($lineCount,@array,$nameOne,$numberOne, $numberTwo); } } else #run for loop for j
