I think there is a better approach. Here are the approximate steps: Drag a DataFlow task onto the design surface. Open it up and add a OLE DB source and OLEDB Command components to the design surface. Modify the source to use the query you have described. Connect the source to the Command component. Modify command component to use "Update PreorderStatus set StatusID = 2 where ProductID = ?" query and on param mapping page map the ? variable to the input coming from the datasource. HTH
