Given an array of different non integer values, how do I find the value where 99% of the data is above and value where 99% is below

I can easily find the min and the max of the list by going through the list, But I can't seem to figure out how to get 99% of the min and 99% of the max. I need this mainly because there are some spikes in data and I want to draw it without those spikes I would think taking a weighted average of the entire distribution, then dividing by the weight*99 would give me the 1% location, and weight/99 would give me the 99% location. Is this correct? I am trying to solve the problem without sorting the array
