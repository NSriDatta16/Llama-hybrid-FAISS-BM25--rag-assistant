There is a difference between IS NULL and = NULL and this is because of the three-valued-logic of SQL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_%28SQL%29#Three-valued_logic_.283VL.29 Extract of a relevant paragraph: Challenges Null has been the focus of controversy and a source of debate because of its associated three-valued logic (3VL), special requirements for its use in SQL joins, and the special handling required by aggregate functions and SQL grouping operators. Computer science professor Ron van der Meyden summarized the various issues as: "The inconsistencies in the SQL standard mean that it is not possible to ascribe any intuitive logical semantics to the treatment of nulls in SQL." Although various proposals have been made for resolving these issues, the complexity of the alternatives has prevented their widespread adoption.
