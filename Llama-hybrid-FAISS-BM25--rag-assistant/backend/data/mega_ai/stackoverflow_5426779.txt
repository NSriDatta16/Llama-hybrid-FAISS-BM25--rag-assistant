Several reasons come to mind: Exceptions shouldn't be very visible, since they are designed to be thrown deep in the bowels of a library and caught somewhere high up in the call stack (even as high as main() ). They are intended to signal exceptional (i.e., rare and unexpected) faults. For example, failure to open a file isn't particularly exceptional. So, by default, the iostream library doesn't throw an exception when it fails to open a file. Exceptions are very expensive to throw, which encourages adherence to the design intent. C++ libraries that throw exceptions don't interface easily with C programs.
