Is it valid to use the distribution of individual tree predictions in a Random Forest to approximate predictive uncertainty?

Methods of estimating the uncertainty associated with a specific prediction from a Random Forest (Let's say Regression) by looking for a distribution to construct a CI from are quite involved/complex (jackknife and all that magic). I assume that since those methods exist, simply taking the individual predictions of trees and using that as a distribution is somehow invalid? Is this due to how the trees are constructed and the fact that they are not independent? I feel like I am missing something very obvious.
