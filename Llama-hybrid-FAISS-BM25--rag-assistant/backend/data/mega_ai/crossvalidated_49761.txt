After further thought I decided to de-trend the data by taking each subject's first differences in the response variable and dividing them by the corresponding first-differences in observation time. So, the new model is $${Z = {\delta Y\over\delta age} = \alpha_0^* + \alpha_1^* mutation + \alpha_2^*treatment + alpha_3^*age+{\alpha_4^*mutation\times~age~+~\ldots}}$$ etc. The intercept terms are now the initial rates of $Y$'s change over time under various combinations of treatments. The terms involving age are the rates of acceleration or deceleration of $Y$'s change over time under various combinations of treatments. I can obtain estimates and confidence bounds for the age at which the response peaks and treat these ages as survival data (with individuals whose $\delta Y\over{\delta age}$ never drops below zero during the observation period interpreted as censored data points). If I use the lower confidence bound as the event time, it can be interpreted as the latest age after which it's likely that the response stops increasing. If I use the upper confidence bound, then it's the earliest age at which the response is likely to have not only stopped increasing but has now started to go down with age. The $\delta Y \over {\delta age}$ in the data I tried this on so far is reasonably linear and at the very least monotonic, and the residuals of the models I fit this way seem well behaved. And, no bootstrapping. This doesn't directly test hypotheses about magnitudes of the peak values of $Y$, but as it turns out those are confounded by starting values anyway; the timing of the peaks and the acceleration/deceleration are more biologically meaningful. Before I accept this answer, though, does anybody see any problems with what I have described? Is it valid to use fitted values from a linear model as response variables in a survival model? Any suggestions for validations I should perform before trusting this approach? Am I reinventing something someone has already done better than I have? Actually, if you have answers for the above paragraph that I can use, you're the one who deserves credit for answering this question, so you might post your response as an answer. Thanks.
