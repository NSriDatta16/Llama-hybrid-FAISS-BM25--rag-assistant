JavaScript Regexp to Wrap URLs and Emails in anchors

I searched high and low but cannot aeem to find a definitve answer to this. As is often the case with regexps. So I thought I'd ask here. I'm trying to put together a regular expression i can use in JavaScript to replace all instances of URLs and email addresses (does'nt need to be ever so strict) with anchor tags pointing to them. Obviously this is something usually done very simply on the server-side, but in this case it is necessary to work with plain text so an elegant JavaScript solution to perfom the replaces at runtime would be perfect. Onl problem is, as I've stated before, I have a huge regular expression shaped gaping hole in my skill set :( I know that one of you has the answer at the tip of your fingers though :)
