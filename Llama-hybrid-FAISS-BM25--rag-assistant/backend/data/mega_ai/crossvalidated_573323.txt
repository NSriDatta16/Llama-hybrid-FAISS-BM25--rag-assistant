Read the documentation for KernelPCA around inverses: there is no analytical inverse depending on the kernel, and so they approximate the inverse transform by learning a ridge regression between the PC basis and the original feature space. You can adjust the regularization parameter for that regression using the parameter alpha ; setting alpha=0 in your example produces (nearly, as in np.allclose ) equal k_orig as train_set (though presumably a less-faithful inverse for data that isn't your training data).
