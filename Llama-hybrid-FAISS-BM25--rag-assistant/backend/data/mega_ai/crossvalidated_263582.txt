How to compare two data sets to know if they are not similar?

I want to write a program which when given two data sets, should be able to tell whether the data sets differ significantly or are roughly similar. Details on the two data sets: Both data sets will have same number of values. A value in a data set may not be related to other values in the same data set. Aim is to get a final score which tells about 'similarity' of the two data sets. I am completely new to statistics. I am trying to learn AI and feel that this will be a good basic start towards Data Science. Also, I want to visualize this. Example: Data Set 1: A = 2 B = 120,000 C = 70 Data Set 2: A = 5 B = 240,000 C = 80
