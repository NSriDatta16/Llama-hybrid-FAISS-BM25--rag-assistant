Multiple solutions : 1 ) Maybe a complicated one but that is really promising : The best way to exploit the correlations between time instants is probably to build a Multitask Gaussian Process that gives you a correlation matrix over time and features . By looking at the final correlation matrix, the outliers will be easily observable as they are clearly less correlated with the other series. In you example, a gap of intensity will be clearly distinguishable when the sensor starts to generate anomalies. 2) Just look at the auto-correlation ... You can easily see a gap when the sensor starts to generate fake values. 3 ) An easy one that is really often used in the case of anomaly detection: you can look at the distribution of the data and approximate this distribution with a Mixture of Gaussian for example. You can then define the lower bound of the admissible values and categorize the rest as anomalies... In this case, it's important to have sufficient good data, so outliers are considered as exceptions... 4 ) If the data are highly correlated, it should be easy to generate some of the features with some others. You can build an autoencoder to predict the feature values. If the accuracy decreases drastically, you can be confident that this is an outlier.
