For your first question, I bet the numbers will match if you used [self.timestamp timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate] instead of since 1970. For your second question, my hunch is that the date in the managed object storage is not exactly the same as self.timestamp. For instance, could it be that the stored date only contains a day and not time? You might need to do some rounding to get those to match.
