You could possibly (read "untested") find all non-anchor links using something like $('a').not('[href^="#"]') From there, you could wrap the element in a ... block. Keep in mind that if you're wanting to replace the links in-place, you may need to close off the surrounding paragraph (if using a paragraph) as lists do not belong there.
