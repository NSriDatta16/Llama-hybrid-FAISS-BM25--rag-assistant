scale Image in an UIButton to AspectFit?

I want to add an image to a UIButton, and also want to scale my image to fit with the UIButton (make image smaller). Please show me how to do it. This is what I have tried, but it does't work: Adding image to button and using setContentMode : [self.itemImageButton setImage:stretchImage forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [self.itemImageButton setContentMode:UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit]; Making a "stretch image": UIImage *stretchImage = [updatedItem.thumbnail stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:0 topCapHeight:0];
