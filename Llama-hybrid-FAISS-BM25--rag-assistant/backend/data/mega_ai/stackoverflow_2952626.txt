User-based model instances filtering in django admin

I'm using django's admin to let users manage model instances of a specific model. Each user should be able to manage only his model instances. (except for administrators which should manage all). How do I filter the objects in the admin's changelist view? Thoughts: I guess the most elegant approach would be to use Object-level permissions . Anyone aware of an implementation of this? Is it possible to do by overriding the admin's view using ModelAdmin.changelist_view? Does list_select_related have anything to do with it?
