For TFS 2008 Team Build, how do I change where $Temp points to?

We have recently built a new TFS 2008 Team Build server. I don't want users putting their builds in the default temp directory that is pointed to by $Temp for the Build Agent, but I also don't want to force developers to change the path to somewhere else - this runs the risk of developers either (a) not bothering, or (b) making paths that are not consistent with other teams. So I would like to keep the $Temp there (which is the default for when creating a Build Agent), but change the location where that points to. How do I do that?
