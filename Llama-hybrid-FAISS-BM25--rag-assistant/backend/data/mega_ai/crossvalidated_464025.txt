What I have changed now, using the Bayesian linear regression approach: applying the Kalman filter multiple times to each new sample before regressing, feeding the filtered result back to it as input; using a high variance estimate for the process noise $w_t$ . I don't know if the first part is an appropriate thing to do, but it works very well. It seems like it makes the results a little worse for near-optimal initial values, but it improves overall convergence for other values. I'm guessing that's because the extended Kalman filter can only give approximately correct results.
