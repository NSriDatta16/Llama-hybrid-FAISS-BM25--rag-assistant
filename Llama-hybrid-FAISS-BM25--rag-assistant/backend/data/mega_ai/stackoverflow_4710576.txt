php check if session_write_close() has been called(aka, is the session currently writable)

I am trying to figure out if there is a recommended way to check if the current session is still writable, but I cant seem to find any changes in the global var or the cookie that would seem to indicate that the session was not writable. my make do solution was to make a function that contained: @session_start(); is this a more elegant solution?
