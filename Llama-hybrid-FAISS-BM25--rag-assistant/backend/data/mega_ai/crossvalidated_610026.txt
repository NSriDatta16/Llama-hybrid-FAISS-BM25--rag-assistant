What is the broad area of study or technique that deals with the above problem? You already have the actual sales. The second thing that you need are the expected sales. That can be found using time series forecasting . Also noteworthy to mention is some details about the statistical lingo. Expected refers to something more specific: Expected value: The average outcome of a random variable. For example, a six sided dice roll has an expectation value of $\frac{1}{6}+\frac{2}{6}+\frac{3}{6}+\frac{4}{6}+\frac{5}{6}+\frac{6}{6} = 3.5$ Estimated value: Some estimate of a value related to a population. For example when we have a small sample than we can use the properties of that sample to estimate the properties of the population. Any values computed from the sample are not necessarily equal to the related actual values of the population, but are probably close to it. Predicted value: An estimate that is some sort of extrapolation. Based on samples from a population given certain settings, we make an estimate of the population given different settings. For example when we have a set of samples/observations in the past, we might extrapolate some trend line to the future. You seem to be looking for a 'predicted value' of the covid-time sales based on the pre-covid-time sales.
