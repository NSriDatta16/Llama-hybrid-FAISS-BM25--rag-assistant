How to visualize SVM classification just given the inner products?

I've implemented a custom kernel called the Partial Tree Kernel (designed for text classification) for my SVM. It doesn't use feature vectors as input; instead, documents are parsed into a data structure called a dependency tree, and the kernel is computed directly between these trees. (Don't worry if you don't understand what a dependency tree is; the point is that they're not vectors, so they can't be graphed directly.) How I've implemented the SVM in Python is by using SVC with kernel='precomputed' and feeding it the kernel matrix, that is, all of the pairs of inner products. Is there any visualization tool that just uses the inner products to produce a visualization?
