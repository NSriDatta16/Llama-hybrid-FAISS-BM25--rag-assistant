I have no reputation to simply add a comment. I do totally agree with Wayne’s comment: With greater power comes greater responsibility . GAMs can be very flexible and often we get/see crazy-complex smoothers . Then, I strongly recommend researchers to restrict degrees of freedom (number of knots) of the smooth functions and to test different model structures (interactions/no interactions etc.). GAMs can be considered in between of model-driven approaches (although the border is fuzzy I would include GLM in that group) and data-driven approaches (e.g. Artificial Neural Networks or Random Forests who assume fully interacting non-linear variables’ effects). In accordance, I do not totally agree with Hastie and Tibshirani because GAMs still need some detective work (Hope no one kills me for saying so). From an ecological perspective, I would recommend using the R package scam to avoid these unreliable variable crazy-complex smoothers . It was developed by Natalya Pya and Simon Wood and it allows constraining the smooth curves to desired shapes (e.g. unimodal or monotonic), even for two-way interactions. I think GLM becomes a minor alternative after constraining the shape of the smooth functions but this is only my personal opinion. Pya, N., Wood, S.N., 2015. Shape constrained additive models. Stat.
