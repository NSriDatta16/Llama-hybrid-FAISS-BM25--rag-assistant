Is it possible to only enable Agent Smith inspections in ReSharper?

We would like to have an intern go through our source files for spell checking and naming convention enforcement using the Agent Smith plug-in to ReSharper. It would be very nice to minimize the "noise" from ReSharper inspections by disabling all inspection options except those provided by the Agent Smith plug-in. Is this possible?
