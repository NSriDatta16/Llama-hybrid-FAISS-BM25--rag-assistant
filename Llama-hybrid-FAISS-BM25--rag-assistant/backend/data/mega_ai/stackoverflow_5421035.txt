No, there's no way of doing * EXCEPT some columns . SELECT * itself should rarely, if ever, be used outside of EXISTS tests. If you're using SSMS, you can drag the "columns" folder (under a table) from the Object Explorer into a query window, and it will insert all of the column names (so you can then go through them and remove the 17 you don't want)
