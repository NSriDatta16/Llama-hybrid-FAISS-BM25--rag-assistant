Non-convergence in nonlinear regression

I've been studying a manuscript from the chemistry literature (not mine) that resorted to a trick to obtain convergence of a non-linear model fitted to experimental data. They wanted to estimate a total of 5 parameters (a1-a5), but the model wouldn't converge. So they estimated a1-a4 (with a5=0), then held a3 constant at the value just obtained while estimating a1-a2 and a4-a5. Then they re-estimated a1-a4 with a5 constant at the value just obtained. And once again fitted a1-a2 and a4-a5. They used this process using the same model for 9 different data sets and reported the averages and standard deviations for the 3 parameters of real interest (a3,a4, and a5), which should be the same regardless of dataset. The data analysis tool they are using doesn't permit all 9 datasets to be combined and analyzed together. In any case, the results are supported by independent evidence that the parameters are consistent with values of parameters for related reactions. As I understand it, there can be 2 causes for non-convergence: poor initial guesses and under-constrained model (data truly don’t allow all parameters to be estimated). The process they use should help get past bad initial guesses, but not an under-constrained model. If bad initial guesses were the cause, I’d think once the iterative process “converges” they should have been able to use those estimates as initial guesses and obtained convergence with all parameters estimated simultaneously. Would that be considered a legitimate approach to handling lack of convergence? I would think that without the last step, the iterative process described would not be recommended. In the case of an under-constrained model, convergence would never be obtained with a single curve, but there may have been enough information in all 9 curves together to make it work. I would have liked to have seen a simultaneous fit to all the curves, but in the absence of the proper tool, it seems like what they did was decent. So, what I'm asking is whether the conclusions that I reached about the aforementioned data analysis are correct. Responses will be appreciated.
