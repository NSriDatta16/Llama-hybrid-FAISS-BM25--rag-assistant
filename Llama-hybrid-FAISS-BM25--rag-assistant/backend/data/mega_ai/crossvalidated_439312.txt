Given a dataset of students' exam scores across 5 years, how can I determine what consists of a significant change in score?

Suppose I have the data below, of student's scores changes between 2013-2016 in : +---------+--------------+-----------------------+-------+ | Student | Score Change | Absolute Score Change | Year | +---------+--------------+-----------------------+-------+ | A | -5 | 5 | 13-14 | | B | 3 | 3 | 13-14 | | C | -8 | 8 | 13-14 | | D | -7 | 7 | 13-14 | | E | -1 | 1 | 13-14 | | A | -4 | 4 | 14-15 | | B | 1 | 1 | 14-15 | | C | -4 | 4 | 14-15 | | D | -4 | 4 | 14-15 | | E | -5 | 5 | 14-15 | | A | -5 | 5 | 15-16 | | B | -5 | 5 | 15-16 | | C | 3 | 3 | 15-16 | | D | -4 | 4 | 15-16 | | E | -3 | 3 | 15-16 | +---------+--------------+-----------------------+-------+ Given this, I want to calculate what would consist of a significant change in score for any given student, compared to the average change in score for students. For example, if a student's score changed by more than 5 (x) points, this would be considered significant. How can I calculate this "x"? Would it be as simple as finding the T-value associated with the score change at 95% CI (assuming this is what I'm interested in), and converting it back to a change in score? In the same way, would the way to go be to look at score change or absolute score change? I'm not sure I understand what the difference in results would mean between the two. If decided to go with the raw score change, would there be 2 numbers?: Significant if more than x points, or less than -y points.
