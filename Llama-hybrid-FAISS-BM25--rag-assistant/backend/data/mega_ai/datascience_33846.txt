Normalizing test data

I have a problem in data normalization. I have data for which I need to create an SVM. I will be using the model for real-time predictions. I know that the test tuples should be normalized using the exact same values as per the training data. However, my test tuples can have values that exceeds the maximum value of the data in the training set. For example, in the training set I have following values for a given feature. Maximum : 20457 Minimum: 3 In the testing tuple, I sometimes get values like 35002. This is present in most of the features. The problem would have been solved if I knew the maximum and minimum values for all feature, but it no possible. The maximum value can go up to any value. How do I do data normalization in a scenario like this? Can someone please help me with this?
