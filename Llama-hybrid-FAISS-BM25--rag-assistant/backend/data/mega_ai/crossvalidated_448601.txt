From a theoretical perspective, the Bayesian comparison of $M$ models $\mathfrak M_m$ $m=1,...,M$ proceeds by the comparison of their posterior probabilities $$\pi(M_m|\mathbf x) \propto \pi(M_m) \int_{\Theta_m} f_m(\mathbf x|\theta) \pi_m(\theta_m)\,\text d\theta_m$$ and therefore implies all priors over all models and over all model parameters. The selection of a model cannot operate from a single model perspective. Approaches based on pseudo-priors are only useful from a computational perspective, as in Carlin and Chib (1995) , when one is exploring the posterior over the product space $\prod \Theta_m$ by Monte Carlo or Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
