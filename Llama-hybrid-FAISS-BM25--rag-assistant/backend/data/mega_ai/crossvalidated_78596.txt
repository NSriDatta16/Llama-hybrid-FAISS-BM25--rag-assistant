When combining p-values, why not just averaging?

I recently learned about Fisher's method to combine p-values. This is based on the fact that p-value under the null follows a uniform distribution, and that $$-2\sum_{i=1}^n{\log X_i} \sim \chi^2(2n), \text{ given } X \sim \text{Unif}(0,1)$$ which I think is genius. But my question is why going this convoluted way? and why not (what is wrong with) just using mean of p-values and use central limit theorem? or median? I am trying to understand the genius of RA Fisher behind this grand scheme.
