how to do feature engineering on Atari Pong game in code?

In RL context, I know that features are explanatory variables that represent or describe the states. If I want to do feature engineering on atari games and use it to solve RL task, how should I implement it? Can anyone point me out any starting code to do this? for instance, in cartPole, features can be cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole velocity at tip. we know the observation from environment, but how should I represent those features in code? In my experiment, I am building agent with policy gradient algorithm to solve RL task, I want to know how should I represent or define hand-crafted features as vector numerically in code. Can anyone show me possible starting code for representing features in pong game? Any thoughts?
