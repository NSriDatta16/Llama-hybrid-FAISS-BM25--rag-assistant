Why does a dynamic JNLP generated from a JSP always fail with a localhost href?

I have a JSP that spits out a JNLP file as shown below. Work son localhost, when deployed to a remote server, Java Web Start errors out with an exception - Unable to load resource: http://localhost:8080/jnlp/myjnlp.jnlp ExitException[ 3]com.sun.deploy.net.FailedDownloadException: Unable to load resource: http: // localhost:8080/jnlp/myjnlp.jnlp at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.updateFinalLaunchDesc(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.updateFinalLaunchDesc(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.prepareToLaunch(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.prepareToLaunch(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.launch(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Main.launchApp(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Main.continueInSecureThread(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Main$1.run(Unknown Source) at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) The included JNLP file is getting its codebase line replaced based on server's URL. Attaching a debugger to the JSP show sthe correct codebase line with server's IP /Host name. Don't understand where the localhost comes from ? "; } %>
