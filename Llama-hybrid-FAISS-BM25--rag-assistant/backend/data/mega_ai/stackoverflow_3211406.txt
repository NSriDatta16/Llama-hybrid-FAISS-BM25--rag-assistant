NCover coverage widley differnt from UAT build to a Live build

Using TeamCity running an MsBuild task for an MVC2 C# application, we successfully run 1561 XUNit tests in both the UAT and the Live builds but the NCover coverage falls from 51% on the UAT build to 35% on the live build. The soulution has identical configuration manager settings. As our minimum covergae is less than 50% our build subsequently fails with the following error: "NCover.Reporting.exe" exited with code 3. A bit lost as to why the coverage drops when it is the same source from svn and identical test run being performed. Has anyone else experienced this?
