In my opinion, I would discourage to approach. When you need more than 255 characters, use TEXT are some more suitable. Update: VARCHAR is now limited to 65535 bytes, but a row in MySQL cannot contain more than 65535 bytes. You have to know that VARCHAR and fields like that are stored directly into your database when TEXT for example will be stored outisde the row why a pointer inside the row linking to it. So if you want to use big VARCHAR, make sure they will not be too big and won't interfere with the rest of the data in the row. For example, having mutltiple VARCHAR fields that can contains up to 65K char would be a bad idea.
