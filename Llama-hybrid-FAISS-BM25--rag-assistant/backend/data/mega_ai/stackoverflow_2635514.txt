At the company where I work, we tried Alfresco, but we are not all to optimistic about it. It is overly complex and require a lots of time to learn. The documentation is not so great either. On the other side, I have tried Nuxeo a bit, and we found it to be well documented, easy to start with, and easy to extend. Going throuhg the developer training mention by Glenn, you can easily become productive. One more good thing about Nuxeo is that they try to follow standards. That means if you want to expose a webservice (Rest or SOAP), you can use JAX-WS and JAX-RS respectively. Storage Also Nuxeo uses VCS as storage backend, which stores the data directly in the Database in separate tables for each schema. This means that you can view / modify data in the database easily.
