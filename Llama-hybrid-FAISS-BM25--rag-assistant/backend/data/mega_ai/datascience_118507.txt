The argument I can see in favor of the claim that most machine learning methods do worse as you add more data is that you start getting data from different sources. For instance, a mentor of mine once told me about a great speech recognition system he built, only to discover that it had badly overfit to that particular brand of microphone. That is, by getting more data, additional aspects of the patterns had to be uncovered, and his method was not up to the task. That said, the original claim really sounds like someone being provocative, even if there is a sense in which the claim can be true.
