It is an approximation of the pseudolikelihood, as defined, e.g., in Equation (18.20) in Goodfellow et al.'s "Deep Learning" (c.f. http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/partition.html ). In particular, instead of summing over all visible variables, the scikit variant picks "only" one at random. It is obvious that this gives a drastic performance gain (when the number of visible units is large). Regarding the precision (that is how close it is to the true pseudolikelihood), I have no answer... It is worth reading the remaining of the above chapter, which gives useful references regarding the randomised approximation.
