Yes there is! One-line code and one loop of the array. int[] source = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 4, 4, 4, 8, 9, 4, 4, 4 }; var result = source.Where((item, index) => index + 1 == source.Length || item != source[index + 1]); And according to @Hogan's advice, it can be better: var result = source.Where((item, index) => index == 0 || item != source[index - 1]); More readable now i think. It means "choose the first element, and those which isn't equal to the previous one".
