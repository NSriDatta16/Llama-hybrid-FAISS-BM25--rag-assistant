Is there an online user agent database?

How do you parse your user agent strings? I'm looking to get: Browser Browser Version OS OS Version from a user agent string. My app is written in perl and was previously using HTTP::BrowserDetect . It's a bit dated and is no longer maintained. (Edit: it's since been updated.) I'm in no way tied to using perl for the actual lookup. I've come to the conclusion that automagic parsing is a lost cause. I was thinking of writing a crud type app to show me a list of unclassified UA's and manually keep them up to date. Does such an resource already exist that I can tap into? It would be awesome if I could make an HTTP call to look up the user agent info. Thanks!
