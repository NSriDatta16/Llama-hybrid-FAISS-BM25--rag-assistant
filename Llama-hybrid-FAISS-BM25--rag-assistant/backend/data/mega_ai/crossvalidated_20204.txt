I'm a bit late to the show here, but John Kruschke's recently published book Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R and BUGS has a whole chapter (19) on this. His book is written in a highly accessible and practical style, well worth checking out for his description of the approach. He also includes R and BUGS code for his examples. His website accompanying the book is interesting reading also: http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/DoingBayesianDataAnalysis/ and includes all the code in the book.
