How Linear SVM works for Text Classification

I am working on text classification problem with Linear SVM. I have some basic knowledge on SVM. I am looking for information on how exactly SVM works for text classification problems, i.e. its internal mechanism. It would be really appreciated if someone can share resources where I can learn about SVM in depth.
