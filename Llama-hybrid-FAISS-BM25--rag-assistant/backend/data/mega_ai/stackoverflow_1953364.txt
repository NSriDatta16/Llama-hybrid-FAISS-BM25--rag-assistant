Determine size of functions/stub/namespace in memory

I have a couple of functions in a namespace called stub . I have to determine the exact start address of the namespace and the end address, of at least the size of the namespace in memory (to copy these functions into another process). While this worked perfectly in Visual C++ 2008 by adding a void stub_end() { } at the end of the namespace and using size_t size = reinterpret_cast (stub_end) - reinterpret_cast (stub_start); to determine the size of the stub. This worked because Visual C++ preserved the function order as it is in the .cpp file, however that does not seem to be the case in Visual C++ 2010 anymore. How can I find out the size of the functions or the whole namespace/stub by using pragma directives, compiler/linker facilities or similar?
