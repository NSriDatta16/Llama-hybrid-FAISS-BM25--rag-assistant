In theory, as you also mentioned, you just need to use some standard interface like JPA, and change the implementation or the storage behind it. Unfortunately, in practice this doesn't work so smoothly. It can be done, but you're surely gonna spend some time on issues you just didn't expect. I would start by stabilizing the service interfaces, and migrate them feature by feature . Start with the easiest one, something that is small enough and separated from the other parts of the system. However, as a first step, it's not a bad idea to rewrite your code to use some standard interface. JDO is known to handle non-relational databases somewhat better, so you might benefit from choosing it. As for Google App Engine , most probably you will need to change your data model entirely, if you have already designed it with an RDBMS in mind. Just to mention a few constraints, there is no JOIN, and you also cannot use OR in your queries. So I suggest you to experiment with it before you jump into some huge migration project.
