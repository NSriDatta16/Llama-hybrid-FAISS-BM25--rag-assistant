You can use the File API , part of HTML5, to do this: http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/file/dndfiles/ For a discussion on posting with it you can start with http://groups.google.com/group/play-framework/browse_thread/thread/6223a9b25b87a839/6c74eda4f7b33010 Basically, using the File API , javascript can read files from the local system, if the browser supports it, and then you can just post that through an ajax call, along with whatever else you need to submit. If you need to submit multiple files, this may be a good starting point: http://robertnyman.com/2010/04/22/using-the-file-api-for-reading-file-information-multiple-file-uploads-another-sister-specification-to-html5/ If you must use jQuery, then you can try this plugin, though I have never used it: http://plugins.jquery.com/blueimp-file-upload-jquery-ui/
