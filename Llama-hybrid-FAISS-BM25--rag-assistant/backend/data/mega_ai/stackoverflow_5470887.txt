Drag Manager in Flex - how to get rid of the red cross?

I'm making a Matching Game, where I have some pictures on my left side and they can be dragged and dropped onto matching pictures on my right. I'm using the Drag Manager, which works great, but I have one problem. When dragging an object, I can see a small icon of a red cross, if the picture can not be dropped at this place (and it can't be dropped, if it doesn't match). Of course, in case of the game, I don't want the user to know instantly where he can drop the picture... Is there any way to get rid of this indicator?
