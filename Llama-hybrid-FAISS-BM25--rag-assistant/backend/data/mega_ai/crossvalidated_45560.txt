confidence interval question

I need some hints for the following questions. Let $X_1, \dots, X_8$ be a random sample from a normal population having known mean $\mu$ and variance 2. Let $\bar X_7={1\over 7} \sum_1^7X_i$ be the average of the first 7 of them. What is the mean and variance of $X_8-\bar X_7$? If $\bar X_7=4$, give an interval that will contain the value of $X_8$ with 95% confidence.
