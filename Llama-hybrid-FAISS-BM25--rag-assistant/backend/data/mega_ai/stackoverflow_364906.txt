XUL explorer is a tool that lets you drag and drop XUL. It's good for mocking up an interface or starting to learn about the various elements you can use. xulrunner is Mozilla's binary that allows you to run XUL/XPCOM/javascript applications. The Mozilla Developer Center is your friend. If you use IRC, check out #xulrunner on irc.mozilla.org . They are fairly tolerant of some questions from beginners. I don't think there's going to be away around allowing the user to see (or potentially modify) the actually XUL interface. There are some paths for trying to secure JavaScript in some way (some surface level, like obscuring, minifying, but then some possible secure loading methods). XPCOM can be written in C++ or JavaScript, to name a few, if you put more of your code in XPCOM it should be more secure, I think. A fun start for seeing what you can do in XUL is to check out the XUL Periodic Table .
