If an ANOVA test showed no statistically significant results, you should ignore any post hoc pairwise tests. On the other hand, even if an ANOVA test shows statistically significant result, post hoc significance is not guaranteed. Edit: ANOVA is an omnibus test . Short version: ANOVA tests the average score of each group with the average score of all groups, taking into account the size of each group and the variance of each group. It's just one Sum (Î£). So, due to "blindness/chance/randomness" you would have 5% chance for false positive for each ANOVA.
