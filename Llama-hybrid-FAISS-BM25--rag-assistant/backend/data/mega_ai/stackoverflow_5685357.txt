XSLT node transformation in a predefined order

How do I make transformation follow xml node order? The xml file is something like this First paragraph Second paragraph Unordered list name First element Second element Third paragraph I would like to transform it to HTML ... First paragraph Second Paragraph Unordered list name First element Second element Third paragraph ... When I use xsl:for-each It outputs all paragraphs first and then the list, or the other way round. I want to keep the order of the XML file. I am aware this might be very basic but I seem to be getting nowhere using xsl:choose and xsl:if . So please help me someone.
