An author of the topicmodels package was so friendly to provide a sample code which explains how to do it: library("topicmodels") data("AssociatedPress", package = "topicmodels") ## We fit 6 topics. ## We specify five seed words for five topics, the sixth topic has no ## seed words. library("slam") set.seed(123) i EDIT : The variable j determines the seed words by column number of the simple tripled matrix. In order to feed in your own words, you could do the following: data % cast_dtm(paragraph, word, n) # Document term matrix i $dimnames$ Terms %in% seedWords[z]) # the final triplet matrix is not allowed to have NAs; thus, make sure # first that your seed words actually appear in the DTM }
