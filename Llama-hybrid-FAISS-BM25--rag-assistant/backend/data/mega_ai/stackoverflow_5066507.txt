There is a jQuery drag and drop plugin that has support for mobiles / touch-screen devices: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/mobiledraganddrop On a mobile device, you tap to pick up the item and tap to select the drop location. This gets around the issue of drag actions being hijacked by the device / browser.
