Using OpenGL selection mode is the best way to do this, since it can handle arbitrarily complex rendering, not just spheres. You can see many tutorials for this, but roughly: you start by setting GL in selection mode: glRenderMode (GL_SELECT); Then, you draw the scene, after setting up a selection buffer that captures the names of the fragments that you are rendering. This article will get you started. Nehe's tutorial is long, but very good too.
