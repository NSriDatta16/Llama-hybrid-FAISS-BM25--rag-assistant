SSIS task succeeding but SQL Agent reporting failure

The SQL Agent job is returning DTSER_COMPLETION (2) after running an SSIS package. The task of SSIS is completing correctly but is showing many of the following errors: ......Removing this unused output column can increase Data Flow task performance I am not sure whether this can be solved by modifying something in SSIS or the SQL Agent job. I do not want to modify the SSIS package since it is being supplied by an outside source. The is being run on SQL Server 2008
