To be honest, I'm not too familiar with this control, but... You need to hide the drag handler div (or whatever is in the 'DragHandleTemplate' I believe) and/or change its class. Two suggestions: 1) Add a javascript startup script to disable the divs in question. 2) Subclass this control... Override the Render() method. Replace it with original code from ReorderList, but check the Item to see if you should render the drag handle.
