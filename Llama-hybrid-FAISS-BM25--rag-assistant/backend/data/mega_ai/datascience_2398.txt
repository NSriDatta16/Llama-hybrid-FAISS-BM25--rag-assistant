Python Machine Learning Experts

I'd like to apply some of the more complex supervised machine learning techniques in python - deep learning, generalized addative models, proper implementation of regularization, other cool stuff I dont even know about, etc. Any recommendations how I could find expert ML folks that would like to collaborate on projects?
