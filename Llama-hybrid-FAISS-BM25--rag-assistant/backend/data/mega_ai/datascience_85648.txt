You executed the code either inside a cell of a jupyter notebook or in jupyter lab. That explains why no graph was shown. If you would ran the same code as a pure python script it shows the graph properly. Plotly provides two different solutions for getting it running inside jupyter: Plotting Inline Please search for Plotting Inline on that page to find the paragraph that explains the solution en detail. Proper running example purePython and Jupyter Notebook I just let it ran as it is also as purePython and as Jupyter Notebook cell: import plotly.express as px df = px.data.election() geojson = px.data.election_geojson() fig = px.choropleth(df, geojson=geojson, color="Bergeron", locations="district", featureidkey="properties.district", projection="mercator" ) fig.update_geos(fitbounds="locations", visible=False) fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0}) fig.show()
