What's the Rails way of making super-minimal websites? (1 form --> results page)

I'm making a website with a simple form on the homepage. When the user submits the form, the application crawls a website and then presents the results on a new page. Domain.com has the search form (:method => "get") Domain.com/search/xxxxxx has the results of the search. I'm having trouble thinking about Models and Controllers when I'm not working with obvious objects like Users, Posts, Threads, or ShoppingCart. What's the Rails way of organizing such an application?
