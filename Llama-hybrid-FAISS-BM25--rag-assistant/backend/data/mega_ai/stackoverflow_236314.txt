An alternative approach would involve storing the ranges in a table, instead of embedding them in the query. You would end up with a table, call it Ranges, that looks like this: LowerLimit UpperLimit Range 0 9 '0-9' 10 19 '10-19' 20 29 '20-29' 30 39 '30-39' And a query that looks like this: Select Range as [Score Range], Count(*) as [Number of Occurences] from Ranges r inner join Scores s on s.Score between r.LowerLimit and r.UpperLimit group by Range This does mean setting up a table, but it would be easy to maintain when the desired ranges change. No code changes necessary!
