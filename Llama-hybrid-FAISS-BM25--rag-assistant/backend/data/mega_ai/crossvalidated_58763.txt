Using factor analysis for scale construction is a bit of an art. It is common to drop items that load to a substantial degree on more than one factor after factor rotation. That said, a few alternative ideas: Consider whether you have extracted enough factors. Sometimes when you extract more factors cross-loading items or items that don't load much at all can load cleanly on one factor. If this is only the initial phase of data collection and you are planning on generating more items, or you already have a large item pool, then it makes more sense to drop cross loading items. If this is a single shot, then you might be more reluctant to drop items. You also need to consider what your threshold is for cross-loadings (.3, .4, .5). If you set it too high, then you might fail to identify problematic items. If you set it too low, then you may pick up cross-loadings that either reflect a little noise in the data or are more generally not going to substantively effect the purity of your factors. Don't forget to think. Think about why the items are cross-loading. What is it about the two factors and the nature of the items that is leading to this cross-loading. There may be theoretical or other reasons why you want to model and retain cross-loading items.
