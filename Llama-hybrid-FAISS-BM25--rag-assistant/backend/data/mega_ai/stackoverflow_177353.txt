.NET - Find all references of property assignment

I am using VB.NET. In Visual Studio, if I right-click a property name and click "Find All References", it searches for all instances of the property being used. However, a property is always used either for assignment (Set method) or retrieval (Get method). Is there any way of searching for only one of these uses? e.g. search for all uses of the property in code where it is being assigned a value, not when the value is being retrieved.
