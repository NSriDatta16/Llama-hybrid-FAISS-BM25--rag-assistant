In the interests of pragmatism, I tend to just do it as a three-stage process: :g/^ /s//XYZZYPARA/g :g/ \+/s// /g :g/^XYZZYPARA/s// /g I don't doubt that there may be a better way (perhaps using macros or even a pure regex way) but I usually find this works when I'm in a hurry. Of course, if you have lines starting with XYZZYPARA , you may want to adjust the string :-) It's good enough to turn: This is a new paragraph spanning two lines. And so is this but on one line. into: This is a new paragraph spanning two lines. And so is this but on one line. Aside: If you're wondering why I use :g instead of :s , that's just habit mostly. :g can do everything :s can and so much more. It's actually a way to execute an arbitrary command on selected lines. The command to execute happens to be s in this case so there's no real difference but, if you want to become a vi power user, you should look into :g at some point.
