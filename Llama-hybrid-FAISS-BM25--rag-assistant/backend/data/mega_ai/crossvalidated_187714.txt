How to compute average precision(AP) for multi label image classification?

In multi label image classification task like that in Pascal VOC 2012, AP and mAP are used to evaluate the performance. My question is: To compute the Average Precision , how many labels and the corresponding confidence scores (maybe a output vector of softmax ) should I give to a single image? Should I give the scores of all C classes(suppose I have C classes) or just top-k (e.g. k=5 ) classes?
