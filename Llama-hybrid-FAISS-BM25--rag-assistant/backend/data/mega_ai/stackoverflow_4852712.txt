You need to determine where the contention is. Is it for CPU time, or is it for some other resource? It might help to do some profiling... Tim Bray recently wrote a good introduction to how and why to do this here: http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/10/traceview-war-story.html For what it's worth MediaPlayer is notoriously slow and heavyweight. What media are you giving it? Are you giving it a stream or buffer that's mostly in memory, or will it be doing tons of I/O to read media over the network or from storage? Out of interest, why do you need face detection once the button has been pressed? Maybe you could stop the thread before starting up the media player?
