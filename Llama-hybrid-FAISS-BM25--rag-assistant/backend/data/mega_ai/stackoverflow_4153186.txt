Obtain Apple software id number before appstore submission (for Appirater)

I'd like to use the wonderful Appirater code to encourage users to rate my app, which I have yet to submit. In order for this to work, you need to have the software id supplied by Apple. As I haven't yet submitted my app, I don't have this id number. I do of course have my Bundle Seed ID and Bundle Identifier but my understanding is that these are not the same. Is it possible to obtain the software id before submission? Or will I have to update the app as soon as it is released? Thanks, Michael.
