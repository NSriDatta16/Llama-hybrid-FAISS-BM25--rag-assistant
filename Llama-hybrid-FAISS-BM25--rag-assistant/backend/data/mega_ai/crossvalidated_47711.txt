Interesting problem! Have you tried using other classifiers? I bet you'd get better performance using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. There's a wealth of literature demonstrating that SVM's can excel in high-dimensional classification problems (such as yours...and many text-classification problems, for that matter). In my experience, Naive Bayes can get mislead by uninformative features, when the problem space gets large. In terms of other features you could try, it might be interesting to have a feature denoting the co-occurrence of a question-type word (e.g., what, when, how), and a noun (e.g., polar bear or basketball). Have you taken a look at the ones that you've labeled as interesting and considered what the characteristics were that lead you to that conclusion?
