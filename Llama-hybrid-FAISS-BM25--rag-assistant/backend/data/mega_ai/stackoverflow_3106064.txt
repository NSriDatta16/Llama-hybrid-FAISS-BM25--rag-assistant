How to use ABAddressBookRef for companies instead of persons?

I would like to use iPhone's Contact address book or ABAddressBookRef to pick up a company, edit a company or create a new company. For editing/creating, I would like to show only fields of name, address1, address2, city and state. I tried to google information about this. What I found are some related constants or strucs, such as: kABShowAsCompany kABPersonOrganizationProperty ABSearchElement Not sure how those are related to my case and how to use them. Are any examples or codes available as reference?
