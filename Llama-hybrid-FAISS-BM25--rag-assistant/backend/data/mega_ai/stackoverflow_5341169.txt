How do you test functionality across browsers and devices?

My Google Fu is failing me today... I want to expand the number browsers I support for my application. The amount of time it takes to test my existing functionality and on multiple browsers has become a limiting factor for expansion. Is there a more pragmatic what to test layout and functionality across the various mobile and traditional web browsers?
