This is my attempt at the design. I only show the static diagram since the algorithm is pretty much laid out already. I would have a plan to have a visitor for the representation of the clusters, could allow different types of output (xml, strings, csv..etc). Maybe the visitor is overkill, if it was then I'd just have something like a ToString method that could be overridden. Note: the Cluster creates a CenterClusterItem on the SetCenter and FindNewCenter methods. The CenterClusterItem is not a PersonClusterItem, it just holds the same amount of AClusterValues as a PersonClusterItem would (since the average isn't really a person). Also, I forgot to make a method on the KCluster to begin the process, but that's implied. Class Diagram http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/499/kcluster.png
