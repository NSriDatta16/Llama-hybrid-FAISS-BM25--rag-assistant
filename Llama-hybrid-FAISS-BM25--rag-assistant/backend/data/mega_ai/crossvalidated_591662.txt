Nested sampling is an algorithm based on simulations from the prior over level sets $$\{x;\ f(x)>f(x_0)\}$$ where $f$ stands for the likelihood. The way the constraint is implemented is via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that starts from $x_0$ and makes a uniform proposal in the vicinity of $x_0$ , &tc.
