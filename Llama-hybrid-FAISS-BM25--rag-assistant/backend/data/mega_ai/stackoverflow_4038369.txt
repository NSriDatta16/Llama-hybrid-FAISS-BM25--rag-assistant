Magento - javascript reliance = huge usability issues

Ok this is a bit of a rant and a question combined - Why the hell is magento so reliant on javascript?? This goes agaisnt all usability guidelines. WHats so annoying is that it even uses buttons instead of correct form submit elements. Why? This makes no sense what sense at all to me. Why is this and is there a way around it?
