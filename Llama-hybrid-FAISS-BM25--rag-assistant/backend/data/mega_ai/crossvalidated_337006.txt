Even if a bit counter-intuitive the statement is correct. Assume $i^*=5$ for this experiment, then the posterior for $\mu_5$ is really $N(x_5,\sigma^2)$. This counter-intuitive fact is a bit similar to Bayes being immune to (secret) early stopping (that is also very counter-intuitive). The Bayesian reasoning would lead to false conclusions if for each such experiment (imagine your repeat it a few times), only the results for the best variety would be kept. There would be data selection and Bayesian methods are clearly not immune to (secret) data selection. Actually no statistical method is immune to data selection. If such a selection was done, a complete Bayesian reasoning taking this selection into account would easily correct the illusion. However the sentence "Bayes estimator are immune to selection Bias" is a bit dangerous. It is easy to imagine situations where "selection" means something else, like for example selection of explanatory variables, or selection of data. Bayes is not clearly immune to this.
