Citing myself on my CS Final Year Project? Is it as weird as it sounds [to me]?

I've developed a graphical IDE for my Final Year Project, basically it lets the user draw the user experience diagram of a webapp, then he/she is supposed to assign HTML templates to the pages and add C++ code to the connectors, that will be executed once the webapp is running and someone clicks on a link. The IDE generates all the C++ code needed, and compiles it through make command, delivering a webapp in a single executable with a simple web server embedded in it. I've made a big effort to write a well founded dissertation, e.g., because I'm generating C++ code and storing them in files, I'm using thread pools and Swing Workers to build a responsive GUI. Similar problems I've faced a few years ago, when I was involved in project to move a single-thread desktop GIS to a multi-threaded environment. So I ended up citing myself on my dissertation, explaining other situations where the use of threads in order to avoid blocking the Event Dispatching Thread , in a Java Swing context, is an essential requirement. My lastname appears next to Doug Lea, Edward Tufte... people I admire and I've been learning from through the years: Isn't it to pretentious/arrogant?
