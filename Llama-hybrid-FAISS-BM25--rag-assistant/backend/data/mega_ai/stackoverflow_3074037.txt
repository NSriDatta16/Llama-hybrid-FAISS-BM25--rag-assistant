Rhino, adding code from multiple javascript files

I am embedding some javascript in a Java application using Rhino. I am following the example on the Rhino website, executing a script by calling the Context's evaluateString method and passing the actual script in as a String. I have a whole bunch of existing javascript code that I would like to make use of. I don't want to concatenate it all into an enormous String and pass it in to evaluateString. I would rather be able to load the code in so that I can call it from the code that I do pass into evaluateString (kind of like the AddCode method works in Microsoft's scripting control). I would like to add code like I can currently add variables by using the ScriptableObject.putProperty method. Is there a way to do this? Can someone provide a code snippet or a link to the documentation. Thanks!
