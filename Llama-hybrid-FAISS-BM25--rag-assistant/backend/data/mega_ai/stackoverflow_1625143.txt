Does jQuery Live work on Safari?

I have just asked this question an hour ago but with regards to IE8 and I was told that the JQuery Live handlers does not support "change" so I switched over to "click", this solved my problem and now I find Safari does not work with click for some strange reason, anyone know why? So I was thinking can I just have both? $('select.htt, select.hst').live('click', function() { var channels = parseInt($('#fancy_div select.hst').val(), 10) * parseInt($('#fancy_div select.htt').val(), 10); $('#fancy_div span.yellow2').html(channels + ' Channels'); }); And change(which works on safari) $('select.htt, select.hst').live('change', function() { var channels = parseInt($('#fancy_div select.hst').val(), 10) * parseInt($('#fancy_div select.htt').val(), 10); $('#fancy_div span.yellow2').html(channels + ' Channels'); }); Or is there something more elegant? EDIT Maybe I can do a conditional. if ($.browser.msie But how would I do this with the above, the above is also in a $(document).ready(function()
