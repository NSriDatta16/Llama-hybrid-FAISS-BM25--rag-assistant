As Jared says, the property doesn't necessarily need any storage location... but you're still overthinking it, I believe. Imagine your interface was actually: public interface IFoo { string get_SayHello(); string set_SayHello(string value); } Just methods in an interface. Are you happy with that? If so, that really is all the property is, along with a bit of metadata to tie those methods together. Nothing to do with fields... just methods. The implementer might want to use a field, but that's entirely separate from the interface.
