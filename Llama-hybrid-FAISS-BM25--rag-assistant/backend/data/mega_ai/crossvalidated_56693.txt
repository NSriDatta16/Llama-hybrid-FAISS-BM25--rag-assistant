How was this summation performed?

Say I have the following simple Bayesian network involving 3 r.v.s A, B, and C: $$ A \rightarrow C \rightarrow B $$ I am trying to prove that A and B are conditionally independent given by marginalizing out C and seeing if I get out $p(a, b) = p(a)p(b)$ in $$ p(a, b) = p(a) \sum_{c} p(b|c)p(c|a) $$ However, I am not sure how to simplify $\sum_{c} p(b|c)p(c|a)$. How do the $c$s go away?
