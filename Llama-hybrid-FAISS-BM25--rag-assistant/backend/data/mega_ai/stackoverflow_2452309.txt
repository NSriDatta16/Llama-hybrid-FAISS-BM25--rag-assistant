GCC Warning options I don't believe gcc has any pragmas for turning off specific warnings temporarily, but those can get rid of them on a per-file basis if your build is set up right. What are the warnings? Even if they originate withing boost, they could be because of how you're using them, in which case you should probably be fixing them rather than ignoring them. *edit: A further search yielded this suggestion.
