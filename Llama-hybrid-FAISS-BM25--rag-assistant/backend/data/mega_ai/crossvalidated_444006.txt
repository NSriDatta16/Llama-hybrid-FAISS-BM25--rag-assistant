Rather than giving a full response I would like add a factor in the distinction between the two. Let's make the example of a neural network used for classification, most of the times when people get the results they wanted they don't know exactly why they are getting those results. While statistics is more rigorous and always comes with a measure of the confidence that doesn't necessarily happen in ML. You wrote that ML skirts the more complicated mathematics by relying on iteration, but it may also rely on the combination of different algorithms in such a way that it would be difficult to estimate the contribution of each of them, that would be more difficult to justify in statistics, while in ML the main focus is on the results.
