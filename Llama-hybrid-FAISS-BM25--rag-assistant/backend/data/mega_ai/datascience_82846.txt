Definition of the Q* function in reinforcement learning

I'm making my way through Sutton's Introduction to Reinforcement Learning. He gives the definition of the $q_*$ function as follows $$ q_*(a) = \mathbf{E}[R_t | A_t = a] $$ where $A_t$ is the action taken at time t and $R_t$ is the reward associated with taking $A_t$ . From my understanding, $q_*$ represents the true value of taking action $a$ , which is the mean reward when $a$ is selected. But I'm confused about why $t$ is included in this equation at all. Should $q_*(a)$ really be $q_*(a, t)$ ? Or are we to understand $q_*$ as taking the expected reward across all $t$ ?
