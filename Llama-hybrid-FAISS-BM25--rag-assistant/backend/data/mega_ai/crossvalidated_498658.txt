Statistical test and p-value for 2 weighted average

I was wondering whether there exist a statistical test to prove that two weighted averages are indeed statistically different (e.g., p-value An example is provided by the plot below. Suppose that we have two groups of devices (blue and green). For each group we test their breaking point (in degrees Celsius). So, numerically, we measure that for the blue group, around 20 devices break at -7, around 120 at -5 and so on. We than compute that the weighted average for the blue group is -3. We do exactly the same for the green group, and we get a weighted average of 3. Is there any test to prove that the difference is significant? Is there any test that works also if on the x axis the values to consider are different?
