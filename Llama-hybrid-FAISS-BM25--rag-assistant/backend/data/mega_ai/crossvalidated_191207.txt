Optimizing Neural Network speed for larger inputs (Facial Recognition)

I am building a neural network to recognise the difference between male and female. The issue is that I have a database with a collection of 250x250 pixels (Not x 3 since I convert to grey-scale). Meaning the input layer consist of 62500 neurons. I use 1 hidden layer with 5 neurons. There are 5000+ images. This is allot of computations that needs to be done. Simply too much. So my what I want to know is if there are better/quicker techniques and ways to use when working with such a large input?
