You intuition seems to be about right. Give the theoretical assumptions of a stationary time series and a 'legible' plot, one would expect identical magnitudes for deterministic seasonality and varying magnitudes for stochastic seasonality. However, you should keep in mind that different types of seasonality can "coexist in a single framework" (Carpolare et al., 2009 , p. 350)—the three types of seasonality being 1) deterministic seasonality, 2) stochastic seasonality in a stationary process, and 3) non-stationary stochastic seasonality. Thus, identifying the type of seasonality in your time series by simply looking at the plot isn't always possible, depending your ts and your plot. In the paper mentioned above, the authors discuss a mathematical procedure to identify the type of seasonality present in a given ts. I also found this blog post to be quite helpful—some ts-plots are provided there.
