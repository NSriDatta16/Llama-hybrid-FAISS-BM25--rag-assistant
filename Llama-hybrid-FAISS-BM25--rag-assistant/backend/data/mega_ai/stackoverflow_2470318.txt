MIDlet + BlackBerry API = verification error?

Is there any way to write a MIDlet, but still use BlackBerry API classes and functions (including the APIs that require code signing)? In particular, I'm trying to use Kuix ( http://www.kalmeo.org/projects/kuix ). A pure MIDlet + Kuix (so without BlackBerry stuff) works perfectly after I converted the jar/jad to a cod file. As soon as I add BlackBerry API-stuff (CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_DIRECT in this case) I get a verification error when trying to run the cod file: Error starting $name: Module $name has verification error 2410 at offset 9a4f What can I do to solve this?
