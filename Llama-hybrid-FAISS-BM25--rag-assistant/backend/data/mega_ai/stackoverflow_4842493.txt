Google Maps API v3: Problem drag and drop jquery with IE

The idea is to drag elements from outside Google map DIV and drop them into Google maps, then a marker must be placed in the lat/long where the element was dropped. Basically i created two global variables for the javascript var latFromMap;var longFromMap; ... google.maps.event.addListener(map, 'mousemove', function(event) { latFromMap = event.latLng.lat(); longFromMap = event.latLng.lng(); document.getElementById("positionLatLng").innerHTML = event.latLng.lat() + " +++++++ " + event.latLng.lng(); }); As you can see the lat/long is always captured into those variables, so i can create a marker. Then i have an element with JQUERYUI drag/drop when it's dropped then a marker is added. When i'm using FF/Chrome it works fine, but when i'm using IE the position is not registered while i'm on the "dragging" time. Anyone can help me out with this ? Regards George PS.
