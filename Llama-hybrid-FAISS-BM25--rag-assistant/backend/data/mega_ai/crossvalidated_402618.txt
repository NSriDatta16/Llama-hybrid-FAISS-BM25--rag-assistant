Can $\sin(x)$ be used as activation in deep learning?

$\sin(x)$ seems to zero centered which is a desirable property for activation functions. Even the gradient won't vanish at any point. I am not sure if the oscillating nature of the function or its gradient can cause any issue during backpropagation.
