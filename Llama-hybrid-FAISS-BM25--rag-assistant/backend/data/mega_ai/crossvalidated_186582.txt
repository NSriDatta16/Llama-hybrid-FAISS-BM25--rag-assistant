The Lagrange formulation requires solving a set of equations simultaneously and the usual course of action is first to determine the value of the multiplier and eliminate it from the equations before proceeding to solve for the variables of interest. For your problem, which actually admits a quite elegant solution, remember that we are maximizing this function under the sum constraint, namely $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^I\pi_i=1$. What your proof says is that for all $\pi_i$ we have the first order conditions $\widehat{\pi} = -n_i /\lambda$, right? But now we can simplify that by using the constraint, that is $$ \sum_{i} \widehat{\pi} = -\sum_{i} n_i/\lambda \implies 1 = -n/\lambda$$ whence we get that the Lagrange multiplier, $\lambda$, equals $-n$. Now, using this knowledge we can substitute back and solve for each $\widehat{\pi}_i$ which quite intuitively turns out to be equal to the relative frequency, $\displaystyle{ \frac{n_i}{n}} $
