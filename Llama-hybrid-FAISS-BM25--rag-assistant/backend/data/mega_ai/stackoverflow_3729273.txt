What regex could I use to extract a body of XML text from a body of unformatted text?

Let's say I have the following body of text: Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; What regex could I use that would return to me the XML embedding in the string? NOTE: I can assume that and will always have the same name.
