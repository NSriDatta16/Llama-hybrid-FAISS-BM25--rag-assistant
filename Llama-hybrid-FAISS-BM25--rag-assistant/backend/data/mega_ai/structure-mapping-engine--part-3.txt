gear) and (switch circuit), and (secondgear gear) and (div10 circuit), are lower. The next section describes the reason for this in more detail. If the inputgear, secondgear, switch, and div10 are attributes instead of entities, SME does not find matches between any of the attributes. It finds matches only between the transmit predicates and between torque and signal. Additionally, the structural-evaluation scores for the remaining two matches decrease. In order to get the two predicates to match, p3 would need to be replaced by p5, which is demonstrated below. transmit torque (inputgear gear) (div10 gear) (p5) Since the true-analogy rule set identifies that the div10 attributes are the same between p5 and p4 and because the div10 attributes are both part of the higher-relation match between torque and signal, SME makes a match between (div10 gear) and (div10 circuit) — which leads to a match between gear and circuit. Being part of a higher-order match is a requirement only for attributes. For example, if (div10 gear) and (div10 circuit) are not part of a higher-order match, SME does not create a match hypothesis between them. However, if div10 is a function or relation, SME does create a match. Structural evaluation score Once the match hypotheses are generated, SME needs to compute an evaluation score for each hypothesis. SME does so by using a set of intern match rules to calculate positive and negative evidence for each match. Multiple amounts of evidence are correlated using Dempster's rule [Shafer, 1978] resulting in positive and negative belief values between 0 and 1. The match rules assign different values for matches involving functions and relations. These values are programmable, however, and some default values that can be used to enforce the systematicity principle are described in [Falkenhainer et al., 1989]. These rules are: If the source and target are not functions and have the same order, the match gets +0.3 evidence. If the orders are within 1 of each other, the match gets +0.2 evidence and -0.05 evidence. If the source and target have the same functor, the match gets 0.2 evidence if the source is a function and 0.5 if the source is a relation. If the arguments match, the match gets +0.4 evidence. The arguments might match if all the pairs of arguments between the source and target are entities, if the arguments have the same functors, or it is never the case that the target is an entity but the source is not. If the predicate type matches, but the elements in the predicate do not match, then the match gets -0.8 evidence. If the source and target expressions are part of a matching higher-order match, add 0.8 of the evidence for the higher-order match. In the example match between p1 and p2, SME gives the match between the transmit relations a positive evidence value of 0.7900, and the others get values of 0.6320. The transmit relation receives the evidence value of 0.7900 because it gains evidence from rules 1, 3, and 2. The other matches get a value of 0.6320 because 0.8 of the evidence from the transmit is propagated to these matches because of rule 5. For predicates p3 and p4, SME assigns less evidence because the arguments of the transmit relations are functions. The transmit relation gets positive evidence of 0.65 because rule 3 no longer adds evidence. The match between (input gear) and (switch circuit) becomes 0.7120. This match gets 0.4 evidence because of rule 3, and 0.52 evidence propagated from the transmit relation because of rule 5. When the predicates in p3 and p4 are attributes, rule 4 adds -0.8 evidence to the transmit match because — though the functors of the transmit relation match — the arguments do not have the potential to match and the arguments are not functions. To summarize, the intern match rules compute a structural evaluation score for each match hypothesis. These rules enforce the systematicity principle. Rule 5 provides trickle-down evidence in order to strengthen matches that
