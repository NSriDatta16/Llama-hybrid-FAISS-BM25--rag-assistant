You are facing extremely different responses to very similar inputs. Regression will not give you meaningful answers. Classification approach. Consider, alternatively, categorical responses such as 'low damage' and 'high damage'. You should be looking for a function $f$ such that $f(p, c)$ is the probability that you will have 'low damage' when a fraction $p$ of the nodes have failed with loss of centrality $c$. You can construct $f$ in the following way. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let $a_{i,j}$ be the number of points in the region $R_{i,j} = [\frac{i}{n+1}, \frac{i+1}{n+1}]\times [\frac{j}{n+1}, \frac{j+1}{n+1}]$ corresponding to 'low damage' and let $N_{i,j}$ be the total number of points in this region. Thus $$ f_{i,j} = \frac{a_{i,j}}{N_{i,j}} $$ is the fraction of points in $R_{i,j}$ corresponding to 'low damage'. You can then let $$ f(p,c) = f_{i,j}\quad \text{ if } (p,c) \in R_{i,j}. $$ If you want something smooth, you can use $$ f(p,c) = \sum_{i,j} f_{i,j} B_{i,n}(p) B_{j,n}(c), $$ where $B_{i,n}(p) = {n \choose i} x^{i}(1-x)^{n-i}$ are the Bernstein polynomials. Improving the model. You could put a prior on the $f_{i,j}$ and on $n$. This would give you a reasonable bayesian model, and fix the small problem that arises when $N_{i,j} = 0$. Visualizing the results. The set of points $(p,c)$ such that $f(p,c) = \frac{1}{2}$ will give you a classification boundary that is an algebraic variety. You also have critical regions $C_\varepsilon = \{(p,c) \,|\, f(p,c) You can calculate the marginal probability of high or low damages for a given fraction of failed nodes and plot this together with the probability surface.
