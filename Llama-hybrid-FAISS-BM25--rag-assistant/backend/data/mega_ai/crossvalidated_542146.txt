Testing for between-samples factor with linear mixed models

I have data from an experiment including 5 biological replicates, each of which has 3 technical replicates. These 5 samples are divided into 2 groups (condition a and contidion b ). My goal is to test wether dv of samples in condition a is different to dv of samples in condition b or not. Here follows the design matrix ( dt ). sample replicate condition dv 1 1 1 a 1.3736170 2 1 2 a 0.8432886 3 1 3 a 1.4026123 4 2 1 a 0.5778786 5 2 2 a 0.9767180 6 2 3 a 0.5853707 7 3 1 b 0.9844947 8 3 2 b 1.0369401 9 3 3 b 1.0300460 10 4 1 b 1.4529099 11 4 2 b 1.0600300 12 4 3 b 0.9304093 13 5 1 b 1.3188977 14 5 2 b 1.2196227 15 5 3 b 1.0311674 What I would normally do is to take the average dv of technical replicates in each sample ( dt.mean ) and then perform an ANOVA test between samples in condition a and samples in condition b as follows. sample condition mean_dv 1 1 a 1.2065060 2 2 a 0.7133224 3 3 b 1.0171603 4 4 b 1.1477831 5 5 b 1.1898959 anova(lm(mean_dv~condition, data=dt.mean)) I was wondering wether mixed models could allow me to test similar hypothesis without aggregation of technical replicates. As far as I understood, my approach would be to fit two linear mixed models (with or without condition as fixed effect) and then compare them with ANOVA: mod0 Is this a correct work-flow and does it apply to this problem? Does it work when testing for between samples factors with replicates? I already found similar questions, but with slightly different experimental desings in which each sample was tested in both conditions (a and b) like this one . EDIT For anyone interest in the answer, I finally found a nice reference book . Under the chapter 6.2 it shows a similar example to the one I reported. It explains how it is possible to test for a between-subjects factor in presence of pseudo-replication (which is my case).
