Region of interest

I am interested to capture only part of the cameraPreview. I have a rectangle which has a onTouchListener. I can use this to drag my region of interest anywhere on the camera preview. My ultimate goal is to capture only that part of the preview. But I am not able to find a way. Is there any API I can make use of? Can anyone guide me here. Thanks
