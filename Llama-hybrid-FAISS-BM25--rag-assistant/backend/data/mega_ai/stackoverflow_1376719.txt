I agree with @silky that your current code is a good solution. A bit of repetitious (though not duplicated) code is not a bad thing, IMO. If you wanted a more python-like solution, you could: Replace the member attributes of ItemDesc with some kind of order-preserving map structure, do the serialization using a common writeTo method that iterates over the map. You also need to add getters for each attribute, and replace all uses of the existing fields. Replace the member attributes with a Properties object and use Properties serialization instead of binary writes. Write a common writeTo method that uses Java reflection to access the member attributes and their types and serialize them. But in all 3 cases, the code will be slower, more complicated and potentially more fragile than the current "ugly" code. I wouldn't do this.
