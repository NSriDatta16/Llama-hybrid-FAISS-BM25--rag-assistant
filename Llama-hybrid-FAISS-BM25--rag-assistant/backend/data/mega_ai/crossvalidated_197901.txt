How to analyse animal arrival times to food

I have created spatial foraging models with populations of 5 animal species that search for food. Each model allows to species to vary in certain parameters e.g. speed. And each model run has multiple food patches. There are 100 runs of a given model. For instance, each model run will have: 116 individuals of species 1, 8 species 2, 80 species 3, 65 species 4 and 42 species 5. I have used R to give me the number of times each species arrives first to a food patch. So I have species 1 arriving first to food 324 times, species 2 arrives first 177 times, 1420 for species 3, 50 for species 4 and 25 for species 5. My question is how do I determine if this observed arrival order is different than expected? Is it simply a case of setting up something like a chi squared test? observed expected species1 324 1996/5 = 399.2 species2 177 399.2 species3 1420 399.2 species4 50 399.2 species5 25 399.2 TOTAL 1996 1996 I feel like I'm missing something here because I'm not taking into account the original population sizes. Thanks. EDIT: Just reflecting on it there. The expected values should be proportions of the total population right?
