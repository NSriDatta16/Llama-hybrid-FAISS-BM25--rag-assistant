Update desktop "show window contents while dragging" setting programatically

One of my programs seems to be changing the Display Properties > Appearance > Effects > Show window contents while dragging setting to off every few hours. I'm not sure exactly which program, or when it happens. I have a number of programs that seem like likely culprits - wallpaper rotators, software for multiple monitors, multiple virual desktops and switching, and a few others. I am just thinking to create a little batch script to run periodically and set the setting back to on. Does anyone know how to do this in windows? I'm using xp pro sp3. Thanks!
