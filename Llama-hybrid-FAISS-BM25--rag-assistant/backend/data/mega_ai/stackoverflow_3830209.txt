ZedGraph - How to make a horizontal line drag-able?

I have some straight horizontal lines that I want the user be able to drag vertically. How would this be possible? I think the best parameter for line selection would be a fixed number of pixels near the line. So if mouse is +/- 2 pixels, I should change the mouse cursor and make the line drag-able.. I see the CurveItem class has properties IsSelectable and IsSelected. Will these have any function in solving this issue? I canâ€™t really understand what they are for from reading the class documentation.. EDIT: It seems that the FindNearestPoint (and FindNearestObject ) only search actual points. How would I make selection to work along the whole section of a straight line? I guess I would need to make make my own custom "Find" routine that loops through all the lines I want to check, and for each calculate it's imaginary Y-point based on the mouse X position ( ? ) I'm also thinking about sloped lines for this purpose, for horizontal/vertical lines it will be slightly simpler. At least it seems this is needed for a curveItem, but I assume the same must be done for selecting (at mid-section of) a LineObj? I actually didn't know about the LineObj existed. It seems the LineObj is not possible to change the X2/Y2 coordinates, as they are ReadOnly . So is it at all possible to drag the X2/Y2 point of a LineObj? EDIT 2: It seems to be an issue with the FindNearestPoint on a JapaneseCandleStick graph; When I click in the graph pane, it does not return the index of the nearest bar, but I believe it instead selects the index with the closest Y-value, no matter how far away on the x axis it is. Sometimes it's a bar to the right of the mouse, sometimes to the left of the mouse. Is this the way it's meant to work? I made this custom function myself, so I guess it's ok.. Still it would be nice to understand why the FindNearestPoint acts this way. This is the code on mouseDown: ' Find nearest curve point: Dim ciNearestCurve As CurveItem Dim iNearestCurve As Integer Dim b As Boolean = zgc.GraphPane.FindNearestPoint(mousePt, zgc.GraphPane.CurveList, ciNearestCurve, iNearestCurve) If b Then With ciNearestCurve(iNearestCurve) Debug.Print(Date.FromOADate(.X) & " " & .Y & " " & .Z) End With
