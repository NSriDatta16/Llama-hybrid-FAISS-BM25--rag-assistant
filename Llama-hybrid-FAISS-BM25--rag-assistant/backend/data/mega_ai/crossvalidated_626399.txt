Your approach looks similar to what is called the "product indicator" approach in SEM. Some related code (with references) is here and here . There is another popular approach, called " Latent Moderated Structural Equations ", that does not require you to estimate/compute latent variables. It deals with the fact that latent quadratic effects/interactions involve products of normal distributions, and those products lead to a difficult likelihood (where the likelihood has integrated out latent variables). So they approximate that likelihood with a mixture of normal distributions. This is not available in lavaan, but I believe it is available in the nlsem package and perhaps others. The Bayesian way is conceptually simpler because you sample the individual latent variables, then take products, then condition on the products. I believe that Sik-Yum Lee has some papers on this from about 20 years ago (sometimes under the topic of "nonlinear SEM"). More recently, there is some work from Brandt and colleagues (for example, here ). In my experience, it is challenging to get the MCMC algorithm to work efficiently and reliably there.
