A good example of a distribution that is hard to sample from is the Hard-Core model, see this page for an overview: http://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/stochastik/lehre/ss06/markov/skript_engl/node34.html This model defines a distribution over $n \times n$ grids for some fixed $n$, where at each point in the grid you can have a value of either one or zero. In order for a grid to be admissible under the hard-core model, no two adjacent points on the grid can both have a value of 1. The image below shows an example admissible configuration for an $8 \times 8$ grid under the hard-core model. In this image ones are shown as black dots, and zeros as white. Note that not two black dots are adjacent. I believe the inspiration for this model comes from physics, you can think of each position in the grid being a particle, and the value at that position representing electric charge, or spin. We want to sample uniformly from the population of admissible grids, that is if $E$ is the set of admissible grids, we want to sample $e \in E$ such that $ p(e) = \frac{1}{|E|} $ where $|E|$ is the number of all possible admissible configurations. Already this presents a challenge, given that we are considering $n \times n$ grids, how can we determine $|E|$ the number of admissible grids? One of the nice things about MCMC, is that it allows you to sample from distributions where the normalizing constant is difficult or impossible to evaluate. I'll let you read the paper on the details of of how to implement MCMC for this problem, but it is relatively straightforward.
