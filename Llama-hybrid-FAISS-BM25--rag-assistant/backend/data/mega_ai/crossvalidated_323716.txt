The Bayes factor is the ratio of two Bayesian evidences and must be computed as an integral over the entire parameter space (see e.g. this review ). For some scientific applications I was using MultiNest and its python interface that you may implement in your code, see the examples in the github repository. Even better, since it is a more efficient algorithm, would be to use PolyChord , but the original code is in Fortran. I just discovered that it also has a python interface, but I never used it.
