The first time it takes a few hours if you never implemented drag and drop, want to get it done right and have to read through the docs. Especially the immediate feedback and restoring the list if the user cancels the operation require some thoughts. Encapsulating the behavior into a reusable user control will take some time, too. If you have never done drag and drop at all, have a look at this drag and drop example from the MSDN. This would be a good starting point and it should take you maybe half a day to get the thing working.
