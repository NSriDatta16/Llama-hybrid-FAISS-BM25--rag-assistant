I'd make a decision base on what you want to do with them afterwards. The sizes aren't really a concern, and neither are the counts. NTFS maxes out at 2^32 file entries, so 100k isn't going to sweat it. And SQL overhead will add little to the 200GB worth of data, so it's not likely that space will be a deciding factor. The same arguments as we always have over whether you should store in the DB (locking, indexable/queryable attributes, ACID, DB security, known backup/recovery, etc.) versus the filesystem (simpler, slightly smaller, well known, can move to external storage easily, etc.) are going to be the deciding factor.
