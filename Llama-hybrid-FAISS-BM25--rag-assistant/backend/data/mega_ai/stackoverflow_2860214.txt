Is it possible to extend indexers in PowerShell?

PowerShell's type extension facility is neat, but I haven't yet figured out the way -- if one exists -- to extend an indexer. I've tried to add a ScriptProperty for the indexer property (Chars in the case of System.String) and a ScriptMethod for the getter (get_Chars), but neither approach seems fruitful. Is it at all possible, or am I wasting my time? :) [Edit] Apparently the proper member type is ParameterizedProperty, but when I try that, I get: Add-Member : Cannot add a member with type "ParameterizedProperty". Specify a different type for the MemberTypes parameter. At line:1 char:11 + Add-Member
