I encourage you to use my own project for this. It's called GarlicSim , it's a platform for making simulations, and it will work great for the kind of simulation you have in mind. (Incidentally, just yesterday I made a big release, version 0.4). It's all Python, and it'll give you a nice GUI too. If you'll be serious about it, I could help you write your simpack. If you want to do it, send a mail on the mailing list.
