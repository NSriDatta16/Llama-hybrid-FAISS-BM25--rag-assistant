How do I learn how to create a quick and easy set of draggable panes in jQuery UI?

I want to enable the user to drag a bar up/down to reveal/hide content in two contiguous panes. I also need to create some buttons that move the bar to some preset locations. I know this is all possible, but am not sure where to start. I'm creating a prototype whose purpose is to figure out the right user experience, so it's OK if it's not going to scale to 300 million simultaneous users on IE6/Windows Millenium. ;-)
