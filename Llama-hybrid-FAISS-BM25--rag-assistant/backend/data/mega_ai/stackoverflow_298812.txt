How do you bring Denormalized Values Into your Business Objects?

I have two Tables. Order - With Columns OrderID, OrderStatusID OrderStatus - With Columns OrderStatusID, Description I have an Order Object which calls to the database and fills its properties for use in my code. Right now I have access to Order.OrderStatusID, but in my application I really need access to the "Description" field. How do you handle this elegantly with good OO design?
