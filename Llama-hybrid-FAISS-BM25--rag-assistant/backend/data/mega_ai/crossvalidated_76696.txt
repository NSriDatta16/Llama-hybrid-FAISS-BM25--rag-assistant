Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting

Suppose I have a non-stationary limited data. Do I have to make it stationary before making forecasts? Can I use exponential smoothing, moving averages or even Holt Winters methods without making my data stationary? I've read that time series should be stationary to use such methods? Is that correct?
