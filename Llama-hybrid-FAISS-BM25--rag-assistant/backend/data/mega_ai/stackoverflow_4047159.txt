Unzipping from SD card - filenotfound error - Android 2.2 SDK

I keep getting a file not found error, even though it exists at /mnt/sdcard/folder/Samples.zip. I downloaded the file there, so there are "write" permissions, but it just doesn't want to unzip! Why is this? ZipInputStream in = null; try { final String zipPath = "/folder/Samples.zip"; in = new ZipInputStream(getAssets().open( Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + zipPath)); for (ZipEntry entry = in.getNextEntry(); entry != null; entry = in .getNextEntry()) { } } catch (IOException e) { System.out.println("file error of some kind" + e); } finally { try { if (in != null) { in.close(); } } catch (IOException ignored) { } in = null; }
