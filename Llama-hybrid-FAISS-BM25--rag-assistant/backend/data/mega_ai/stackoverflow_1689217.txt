As to the need for this sort of coding: You can sometimes use the ternary operator to reduce complexity: For example, I have a web page which needed to verify that at least two out of three specific text fields had values entered. The if/else logic looked pretty ugly, but the ternary operator made it a one-liner to determine how many fields were filled in: var numberFilledInFields = ( (firstName.length > 0 ? 1 : 0) + (lastName.length > 0 ? 1 : 0) + (zipCode.length > 0 ? 1 : 0) ); if (numberFilledInFields This solution appears quite elegant and easy to read than some alternatives.
