T-SQL Query Help Pt. II

The last query I need help with is for a specific reservation show the tentative cost the guest will have to pay. Now this is a bit more complicated because there are two costs, one is the cost for the duration of their stay and the other is for another invoice they get billed to them from another invoice (which is for things such as dining during their stay). The guest reservation table has the following columns with data: (confirm_no, agent_id, g_name, g_phone) The reservation table has the following columns with data: (confirm_no, credit_card_no, res_checkin_date, res_checkout_date, default_villa_type, price_plan) The invoice table has the following columns with data: (inv_no, inv_date, inv_amount, confirm_no). The price plan table has the following columns with data: (price_plan, rate, default_villa_type, bed_type) So I need to somehow list the guests name with their total amount due which will be the ((res_checkout_date-res_checkin_date) * rate) + inv_amount coming from the reservation table, price table and invoice table respectively (and the guest name from the guest reservation table which is linked through the confirm_no). It seems complicated and I'm not even sure where to begin? EDIT: The guest reservation table looks like: http://img535.imageshack.us/i/guestreservation.jpg/ The reservation table looks like: http://img857.imageshack.us/i/reservation.jpg/ The invoice table has NOTHING in it currently. The price plan table looks like: I can't post more than too links but it's the same as the above with the name "priceplan.jpg"
