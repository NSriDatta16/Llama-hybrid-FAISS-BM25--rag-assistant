Calibration of penalized (LASSO or ELasticNet) logistic regression models

I would be very grateful for any help me with the following general query regarding calibration of penalized models with a binary outcome. I would like my prediction model to be calibrated (mean prediction from model = observed event proportion); however, using penalized models (i.e., glmnet in R or lassopack in Stata) this appears not to be the case, whilst a cross-validated logistic model using the same variables is calibrated. Further, in the penalized models, the predicted probabilities seem to be compressed into a limited range with resulting predicted counts not closely approximating observed counts. Am I correct in understanding that this results from the biased regression coefficients in the penalised model? If one is attempting to develop a prediction model across levels of prediction risk (e.g., low, moderate & high), which needs the model to be adequately calibrated (rather than a one level classifier - say sensitivity at 90% specificity) is it acceptable to use penalized models (LASSO or elasticNet) for variable selection and then a cross validated logistic model containing only those variables?
