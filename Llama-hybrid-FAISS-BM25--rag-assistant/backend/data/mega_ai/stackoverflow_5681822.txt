I think you are suffering from basic code organization. For example, you should only create the connection once and then pass it around to whatever methods need it. Typically, people use connection pools so that only a certain number of connections ever exist to the db (because they are expensive) and a connection pool manager will loan them out as needed and keep track of their states. There are a few connection pool libraries in Java (Apache has one) but I have had good luck using: http://sourceforge.net/projects/c3p0/ I dont really like heavy ORMs such as Hibernate but I do I like MyBatis. It lets me wright SQL and doesnt inject itself all over my domain models: http://www.mybatis.org/java.html I think you would benefit greatly by having a Data Access Object layer (DAO). This layer abstracts out communication with your data so the layers above can just fetch collections of data without worrying about the underlying SQL it took to generate that list.
