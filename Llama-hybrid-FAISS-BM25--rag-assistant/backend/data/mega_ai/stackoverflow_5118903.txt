PDF::API2 is low-level. It doesn't have most of what you would consider necessary for a document, things like margins, blocks, and paragraphs. Because of this, I afraid you're going to have to do things the hard way. You may want to look at PDF::API2::Simple. It might meet your criteria and it's simple to use.
