WPF Doesn't Refresh Images (Cache Problem)

I have a big problem with loading an image dynamically in my application. When i start the application the placeholder image source is empty. when i click on a button an image is created and loaded as the placeholder source. when i click again a new image is created but the old image is shown. The creation of the image works perfect. The files on my disk are the files they should be. The following function is setting the source of the image placeholder. public void setImage(string path) { BitmapImage img = new BitmapImage(); img.BeginInit(); img.UriSource = new Uri(path, UriKind.Relative); img.EndInit(); //Set Refreshing Options img.CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.None; img.CreateOptions = BitmapCreateOptions.IgnoreImageCache; placeholder.Source = img; } The two options BitmapCacheOption and the BitmapCreateOptions dont change anything. Can anybody of you help me?
