Bitwise operation on floating point numbers (for graphics)?

Possible Duplicate: how to perform bitwise operation on floating point numbers Hello, everyone! Background: I know that it is possible to apply bitwise operation on graphics (for example XOR). I also know, that in graphic programs, graphic data is often stored in floating point data types (to be able for example to "multiply" the data with 1.05). So it must be possible to perform bitwise operations on floating point data, right? I need to be able to perform bitwise operations on floating point data. I do not want to cast the data to long, bitwise manipulate it, and cast back to float. I assume, there exist a mathematical way to achieve this, which is more elegant (?) and/or faster (?). I've seen some answers but they could not help, including this one . EDIT: That other question involves void-pointer casting, which would rely on deeper-level data representation. So it's not such an "exact duplicate".
