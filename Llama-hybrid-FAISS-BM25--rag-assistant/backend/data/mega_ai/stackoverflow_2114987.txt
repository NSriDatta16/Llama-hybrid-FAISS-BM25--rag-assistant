If you really really need it to be faster, you can do what I did. I rewrote an Apache log file analyzer using Ragel. Ragel allows you to mix regular expressions with C code. The regular expressions get transformed into very efficient C code and then compiled. Unfortunately, this requires that you are very comfortable writing code in C. I no longer have this analyzer. It processed 1 GB of Apache access logs in 1 or 2 seconds. You may have limited success removing unnecessary printfs from your awk statement and replacing them with something simpler.
