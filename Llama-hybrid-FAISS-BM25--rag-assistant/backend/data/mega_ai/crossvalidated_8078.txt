You may also consider simply using a number of transforms of time series for the input data. Just for one example, the inputs could be: the most recent interval value (7) the next most recent interval value (6) the delta between most recent and next most recent (7-6=1) the third most recent interval value (5) the delta between the second and third most recent (6-5=1) the average of the last three intervals ((7+6+5)/3=6) So, if your inputs to a conventional neural network were these six pieces of transformed data, it would not be a difficult task for an ordinary backpropagation algorithm to learn the pattern. You would have to code for the transforms that take the raw data and turn it into the above 6 inputs to your neural network, however.
