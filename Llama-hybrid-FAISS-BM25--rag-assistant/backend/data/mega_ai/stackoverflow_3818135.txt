It partially depends on how your images must be placed in your code. Are you able to display the images as the background of a , or are you required to use the tag? If you need the tag, you may be screwed depending on the browser being used. Some browsers are smart enough to recognize when an image is inside of a hidden object or in an object of 0 width/height and not load it since it's essentially invisible, anyway. For this reason many people will suggest putting an image in a 1x1 pixel if you want the image to be pre-loaded but not visible. If you don't require the tag, most browsers won't load images referenced by CSS until the element in question becomes visible. Mind you that short of using AJAX to download the image there's no way to be 100% sure the browser won't pre-load the image anyway. It's not unbelievable that a browser would want to pre-load anything it assumes may be used later in order to "speed up" the average load times.
