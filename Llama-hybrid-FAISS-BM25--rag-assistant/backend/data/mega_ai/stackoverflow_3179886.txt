Probably I'm too picky. In my book, the character(s) pointed to by a const char* can possibly be changed but not via the const char*. A const char * can point to modifiable storage. Example: char a[] = "abracadabra"; const char * ccp = &a[0]; // ccp points to modifiable storage. *&a[0] = 'o'; // This writes to a location pointed to by const char* ccp So, my wording is: A char * is a pointer that be changed and that also allows writing through it when dereferenced via * or []. A const char * is a pointer that be changed and that does not allow writing through it when dereferenced via * or [].
