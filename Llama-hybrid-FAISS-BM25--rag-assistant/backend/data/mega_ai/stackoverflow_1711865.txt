Accessing a matrix element by matrix[(a, b), c] instead of matrix[a, b, c]

I want to achieve the following: Have a AxBxC matrix (where A,B,C are integers). Access that matrix not as matrix[a, b, c] but as matrix[(a, b), c], this is, I have two variables, var1 = (x, y) and var2 = z and want access my matrix as matrix[var1, var2]. How can this be done? I am using numpy matrix, if it makes any difference. I know I could use matrix[var1[0], var1[1], var2], but if possible I'd like to know if there is any other more elegant way. Thanks!
