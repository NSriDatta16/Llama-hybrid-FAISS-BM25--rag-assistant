Take a look at Cookies and HTML5 Storage. Html 5 storage can be used with the plugin JStorage Example $(document).ready(function(){ if($.JStorage.get('intro_played') == false) { //Play the sexyness. } }); Theres also a cookie plug-in that works in exactly the same way apart from he data is stored differently on user end.
