A number of *.browser files are shipped with .NET: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\CONFIG\Browsers The runtime uses regular expressions from the *.browser files to match against the incoming User-Agent string, and then sets a bunch of properties based on each match it finds (there can be several in the hierarchy). If you need in-depth mobile device support, consider installing the MDBF, which adds support for about 400 devices: http://mdbf.codeplex.com/
