You can compute composite reliability (e.g., McDonalds omega for congeneric factor models) for a given factor in CFA based on the standardized item loadings. Composite reliability indicates how reliable the entire set of items (sum or average) is for a given factor. Since in CFA each item typically loads only onto a single factor (there are few if any cross-loadings in most CFA models), the question of how much of the total item variance is explained by each factor is less relevant than in EFA.
