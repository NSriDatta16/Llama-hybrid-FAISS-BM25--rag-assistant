Hard Error means that sometime in the future the compiler will behave the way you expect it to behave (i.e., it won't compile the source file when you directly access an instance variable outside the defined visibility scope). Right now the compiler simply isn't enforcing Objective-C the visibility restrictions. The warning is there, however, to remind you that you're doing something that you shouldn't be doing and bring you attention to that in case you did it by accident. If I had to hazard a guess as to why the visibility isn't enforced, I'd say that with all the toll-free bridging stuff between the Foundation library and the CoreFoundation library, there is probably a decent amount of library code that accesses instance variables that, strictly speaking, should not be visible. In general, it's a bad idea to directly access instance variable anyway. As long as you can use Obj-C 2.0, it's probably better to use something like properties if you're designing a pure-data model object.
