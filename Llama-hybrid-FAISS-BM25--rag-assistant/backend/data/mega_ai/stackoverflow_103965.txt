Are they running in a browser (applet and SWF), or are they standalone apps? If they're running in a browser then you can use javascript. Both Flash and Java are can access javascript. It's fragile, but it works. If they're running as actual applications then you can have Java open a socket connection on some port. Then Flash can connect to that and they can send XML data back and forth. I've done both of these, so I know they both work. The javascript thing is fragile, but the socket stuff has worked great.
