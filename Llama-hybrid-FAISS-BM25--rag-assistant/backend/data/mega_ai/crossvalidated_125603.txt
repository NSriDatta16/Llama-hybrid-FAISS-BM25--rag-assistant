What is the "pdm" stat in the "rms" R package?

I am building an ordinal logistic regression model (ORM). In order to fit my ORM model, I am using the 'orm' function of 'rms' package from R ( http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rms/rms.pdf ). Now I am trying to assess the goodness of fit of my model. By reading the R documentation, I can see the following statement in the 'stat' property of the 'orm' object (p. 98): (...) Nagelkerke $R^2$ index, the $g$-index, $gr$ (the $g$-index on the odds ratio scale), and pdm (the mean absolute difference between 0.5 and the predicted probability that $Y\geq q$ the marginal median) (...). I don't have enough background to understand the short description of the pdm measure. But when I try to do more research on this measure, I am not able to find related material (e.g. I've been finding "prescription drug misuse"). In summary, my question is: Would you know if the 'pdm' measure has some synonym which is more widely used? Or can you provide some references where I can study the pdm metric?
