Duplicate mousewheel events in Flash on XP Firefox

In Firefox 3, all the mouseWheel events in my Haxe/Flash app are firing twice. This only seems to happen in the Windows version of Firefox; it doesn't happen in IE or Opera, and it doesn't happen in Linux. Is this a known issue, or could I be doing something wrong? Is there a workaround that doesn't involve something crazy like checking the user agent and ignoring every other event? Update: I tested on an old powerbook (after incorporating pixelbreaker's SWFMacMouseWheel scripts), and found that while the OS X version of Firefox behaves normally, Safari (3.2.1) is doubling the events too. I also wrote a simple test in AS3 to make sure it wasn't somehow Haxe's fault; I got the same behavior. The code is below, and you can try it here . package { import flash.display.Sprite; import flash.events.MouseEvent; import flash.text.TextField; public class Test extends Sprite { public function Test() { super(); var tf: TextField = new TextField(); tf.height = 300; addChild(tf); stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_WHEEL, function(e:MouseEvent):void { tf.appendText(e.delta+"\n"); }); } } }
