ASP.Net, Capture image/screenshot of client error

We currently have fairly robust error handling functionality in our ASP.Net application. We log all errors in the database, a text file on the server and also send automated emails containing the error details back to our support people. This all happens on the server of course. We would like to capture (and retrieve) an image of the client browser at the time the error occurred to provide additional info for troubleshooting? Is this at all possible? If so what would be an elegant approach to this problem?
