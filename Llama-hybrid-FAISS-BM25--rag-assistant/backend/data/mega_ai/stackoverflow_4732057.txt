The main disadvantage of output buffering is not knowing (or paying attention to) how deep your buffer stack is. Combine this with overly aggressive error handling or subroutines that exit/die unexpectedly and you will lose whatever is in the buffer, leaving few clues as to what is going on. For example, the Zend framework makes use of output buffering for almost everything, but when it hits a critical error it prints a message and exits immediately. Any helpful debugging information is lost.
