You must add a second argument to the MyClass constructor: public MyClass(Class a, Class > bClass) { super(a, bclass)); } @Bert F: This does "pass the buck" in some sense, but it passes the buck to someone who can actually provide a class literal of the appropriate type. The caller knows the actual value of the type variable A , and so can provide a class literal of the correct type. Due to erasure, MyClass can't do that.
