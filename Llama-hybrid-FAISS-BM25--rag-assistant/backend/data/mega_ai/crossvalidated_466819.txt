Is there a different way to bound probability, with no distributional assumptions, other than Markov's inequality?

I'm having trouble answering this probability interview question from Interview Query: Let's say there is man who is 5.10 ft tall who doesn't know how to swim. Let's say he wants to swim in a lake with an average depth of 5.6 ft. What's the probability of his survival assuming that when the the lake depth surpasses his height, he dies? My approach thus far has been to use Markov's Inequality to obtain an upper bound on the required probability, i.e. using: $$\Pr[X \ge t] \le \frac{E[X]}{t}$$ letting $X$ be the depth of the lake, $E[X]=5.6$ , and $t=5.1$ . However, since $t , the right hand side is greater than 1, and we get: $$\Pr[X \ge t] \le 1.098$$ which isn't a useful bound. Is there a better way to answer this question?
