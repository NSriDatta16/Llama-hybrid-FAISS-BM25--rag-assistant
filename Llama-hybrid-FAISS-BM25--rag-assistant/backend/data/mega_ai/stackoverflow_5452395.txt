I'm not sure if this is a big reason, but I believe the existence of non-realtime features like System Management Mode in the processor doesn't really allow for a real-time OS, because SMM can take as arbitrarily long as it wants to respond to an SMI, and the best the OS can do is just time out and crash when it gains back control -- if it gains back control in a timely manner. So you'd need the BIOS to be realtime as well, which is not quite as easy as having just one company like Microsoft make its OS realtime (which isn't easy by itself anyway). And there probably wouldn't be too much gain for the average user, anyway.
