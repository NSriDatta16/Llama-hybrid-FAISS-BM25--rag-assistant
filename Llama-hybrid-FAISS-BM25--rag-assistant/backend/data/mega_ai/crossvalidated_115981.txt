Requirements for a valid neural network activation function?

What rules define a valid neural network activation function, excluding biological plausibility? What set of principles do softmax, rectified linear units, hyperbolic tangent, sigmoid, etc. follow? "Valid" in this case means that it maintains the universal approximation capability.
