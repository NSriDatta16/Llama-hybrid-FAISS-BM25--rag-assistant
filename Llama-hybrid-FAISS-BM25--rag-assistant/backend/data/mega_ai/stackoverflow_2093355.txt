:nth-of-type() in jQuery / Sizzle?

It surprised me that Sizzle (the selector engine jQuery uses) comes with a built-in :nth-child() selector, but lacks an :nth-of-type() selector. To illustrate the difference between :nth-child() and :nth-of-type() and to illustrate the problem, consider the following HTML document : :nth-of-type() in Sizzle/jQuery? body p:nth-of-type(2n) { background: red; } The following CSS is applied to this document: body p:nth-of-type(2n) { background: red; } This is paragraph #1. This is paragraph #2. (Should be matched.) This is paragraph #3. This is paragraph #4. (Should be matched.) This is not a paragraph, but a div . This is paragraph #5. This is paragraph #6. (Should be matched.) $(function() { // The following should give every second paragraph (those that had red backgrounds already after the CSS was applied) an orange background. // $('body p:nth-of-type(2n)').css('background', 'orange'); }); Since Sizzle uses the browser-native querySelector() and querySelectorAll() methods if those are present (i.e. in browsers that already implement the Selectors API ), stuff like $('body p:nth-child'); will of course work. It wonâ€™t work in older browsers though, because Sizzle has no fallback method for this selector. Is it possible to easily add the :nth-of-type() selector to Sizzle, or to implement it in jQuery (by using the built-in :nth-child() selector , perhaps)? A custom selector with parameters would be nice.
