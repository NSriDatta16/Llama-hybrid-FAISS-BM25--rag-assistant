What you need to do is use an IBAction to select the next field when the return key is pressed. To do this, first add a method like this to your UIViewController. Make sure to add the method declaration to your header. - (IBAction)selectSecondField:(id)sender { //_secondField is the IBOutlet to the second field [_secondField becomeFirstResponder]; } Build and then go to Interface Builder. Select the first text field and open the connections inspector (âŒ˜2) and drag from the dot next to "Did End On Exit" to your controller with the action. A menu of actions will pop up, select selectSecondField. You will need an action for each field. Alternatively, you could have one action and use sender to see which field was returned.
