Distinguising features of linear vs, non-linear machine learning models (algorithms)

What are some examples of linear and non-linear machine learning models (algorithms) for purposes of comparison between the two categories? Which are the parameters (or scalars in a linear algebraic sense) and which are the predictors/factors (or vectors in a linear algebraic sense again)?
