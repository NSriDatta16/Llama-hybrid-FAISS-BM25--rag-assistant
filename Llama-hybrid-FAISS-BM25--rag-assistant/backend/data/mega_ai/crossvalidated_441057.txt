What you should do depends on exactly what you are trying to find out. For many purposes, I think that the average vision across the two eyes would be good; for other purposes, you might want to use better eye or worse eye. And for yet other purposes, you might want to look at the difference. For any of these, the problems of dependent errors disappears. How exactly you would use both at once is unclear to me. Why do you want to do this? If you do want to do it, then GEE is, indeed, one option. You could also uses a multilevel model. But, this seems to answer the question you ask - that is, you use GEE (or MLM) instead of a t-test or chi-square. Both GEE and MLM are available for continuous or categorical dependent variables. I'd also be leery of classifying people into myopic and not myopic. Myopia varies. I would use a continuous measure of myopia; I believe the usual method is to use logMAR (log of the minimum angle of resolution see Oduntan et al (2009) A Comparison of Two Methods of logMAR Visual Acuity Data Scoring for Statistical Analysis and other papers).
