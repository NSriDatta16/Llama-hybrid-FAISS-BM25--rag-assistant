Statistical significance changing in hierarchical regression?

What does it mean if, performing hierarchical linear regression, significance of a variable changes? So, in one step, statistical significance of a variable is 0.006, but in the next one (after adding more variables) it is 0.861. Which of these figures should I pay attention to?
