What architecture can I use to handle a shopping cart where each product requries different attributes to be saved

I am building an application that is very similar to a shopping cart. The user selects a product from a list, and then based on that product, a few properties need to be set and saved. Example. If the user selects a type of paint that allows custom color matches, then I must allow them to enter in a formula number that they received through a color match process. So I have an Order Detail item for a Product that is a type of Paint, and that sku has the attribute of "AllowsCustomColorMatch", but I need to store the Formula Number somewhere also. I'm not sure how to handle this elegantly throughout my code. Should I be creating subclasses or products? Right now I'm saving the data the user enters in an OrderDetails object that has a reference to the Product it is associated with.
