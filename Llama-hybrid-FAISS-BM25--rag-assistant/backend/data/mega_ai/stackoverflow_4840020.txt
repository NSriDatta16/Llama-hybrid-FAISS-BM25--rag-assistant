The main problem which you have is that you try to make 'click' binding with $("a.confirm").click(...) before the elements "a.confirm" are loaded. You should either place the binding code inside of loadComplete or gridComplete event handler or use jQuery.live $("a.confirm").live('click', function() { alert("HELLO"); //$("#dialog-confirm").dialog("open"); }); instead of $("a.confirm").click(...) . One more general remark. The best practice working with jqGrid is dividing data from the HTML markup. I suppose that you place HTML fragment with ... inside of JSON data returned from the server. jqGrid supports another ways to archive the same results. You can 1) use showlink formatter; 2) use custom formatter which allow create any HTML fragment for the grid cell based on the row of data (see rowObject parameter) returned from the server 3) use unobtrusive JavaScript (see my answer with the code example ) 4) any mix from both (see another answer with the code example). The way 3 seems me mostly close to what you do. In any way having clear separation of JSON data from HTML markup is good not only because of design reason. It allows additionally reduce the size of data send from server. (see this answer for more information)
