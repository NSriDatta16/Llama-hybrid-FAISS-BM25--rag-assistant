Environment dependent values

Sometimes I need to use a value that is dynamic in a way that it would be different depending on whether the code is executed on a testing environment or a remote host. To address that I've been using the following function: function localhost($local_host_value, $remote_host_value = "") { if($_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"] == "127.0.0.1") { return $local_host_value; } else { return $remote_host_value; } } Could you suggest a more elegant approach or at least a better name for the above quoted function?
