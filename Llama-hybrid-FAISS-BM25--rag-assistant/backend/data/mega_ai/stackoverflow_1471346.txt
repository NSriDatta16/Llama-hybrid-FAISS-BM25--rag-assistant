You could use Database Level encryption (assuming Sql Server since you said .net) and use Encrypted Connections to Sql Server. This takes care of protection of data while in storage and in transit to the application server. This takes care of security without any special passwords -- it's based being able to authenticate to the database server. Same as you would have to without encryption.
