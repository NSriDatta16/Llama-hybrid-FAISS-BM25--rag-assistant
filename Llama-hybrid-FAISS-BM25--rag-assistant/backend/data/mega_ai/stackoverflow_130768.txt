If your hash is truly gigantic, a better strategy is to probably use an on-disk hash and let the OS worry about getting things into and out of memory. I'm particularly fond of Berkeley DB for storing big hashes on disk, and the Perl BerkeleyDB module provides a full-featured interface, including a tied API. DBM::Deep can also be used as a drop-in hash replacement, but relies on its own format. This can be a pain if your structure needs to be read by other (non-Perl) systems.
