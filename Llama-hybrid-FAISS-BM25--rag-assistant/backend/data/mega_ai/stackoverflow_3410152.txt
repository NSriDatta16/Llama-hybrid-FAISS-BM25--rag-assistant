Assuming your RDBMS of choice doesn't have an ENUM type (which handles this for you), I think best to use ids instead of strings directly when the values can change (either in value or in quantity.) You might think that days of the week won't change, but what if your application needs to add internationalization support? (or an evil multinational corporation decides to rename them after taking control of the world?) Also, that Large, Medium and Small categorization is probably changing after a while. Most values you think cannot change, can change after a while. So, mainly for anticipating change reasons, I think it's best to use ids, you just need to change the translation table and everything works painlessly. For i18n, you can just expand the translation table and pull the proper records automatically. Most likely (it'll depend on various factors) ints are going to perform better, at the very least in the amount of required storage. But I wouldn't do ints for performance reasons, I'd do ints for flexibility reasons.
