Best way handle Features that has boolean value?

I am currently working on a dataset containing feature vector words.The feature vector consists of ordinal as well as binary data type, majority of them are binary data. for eg ( F,T,F,T,T,36). How do I represent such data effectively so that machine learning algorithms outputs the probability value of the predicted class?
