Its an interesting question. I couldn't find anything posted about it either. But Values game are all verified via Steam/VAC so to a certain extent they can take more liberties with what they do on the client side. I would assume they do all the detection client side and just send the results up to the server. None of the achievements I know of are too complex to cause any noticeable change in frame rate on a machine that is strong enough to play Team Fortess. Projectiles and other 'player created effects most likely all have a connection back to the player that created them, or the players achievement database to register all their data as soon as it is created.
