Why is a sum of floating point numbers overflowing? In order for that to happen, you would need to have values near the max float value, which sounds odd. If you were dealing with integers I'd suggest using a BigInteger, or breaking the set into multiple subsets, recursively averaging the subsets, then averaging the averages. If you're dealing with floats, it gets a bit weird. A rolling average could become very inaccurate. I suggest using a rolling average which is only updated when you hit an overflow exception or the end of the set. So effectively dividing the set into non-overflowing sets.
