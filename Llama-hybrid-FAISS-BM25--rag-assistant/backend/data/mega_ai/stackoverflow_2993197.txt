I'd like to store each selection made by the user to be used later. How do I do that? Well, at the tactical level, in your onClick() , you could write the data to a SQLite database. However, it feels like you're putting the proverbial cart before the equally proverbial horse. Unless you actually plan to do something with the data, don't badger the user with dialogs. If you know what you want to do with the data, what you want to do with it would seem to dictate your storage mechanism much more than the fact that it's an AlertDialog raised by an ItemizedOverlay . Is using an AlertDialog in this manner a good idea? Are there better options? There's nothing obviously wrong with it. However, again, this question makes no sense outside of the larger picture. It's like asking a Web designer if using a pop-up window "in this manner is a good idea" -- that can only really be answered in the context of the overall look-and-feel and user experience of the site. So whether you should be using an AlertDialog or some sort of pop-up panel or some sort of animated slide-in panel or a completely separate activity or whatever is a question of how you want your app to look.
