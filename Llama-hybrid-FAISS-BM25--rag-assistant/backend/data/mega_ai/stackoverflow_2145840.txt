Decompile JavaEE

We have a Java EE app which vendor does not exist anymore (due to bankruptcy). Unfortunately we have to make some changes to the functionality of the app, and this means reverse engineering the JavaEE app. We use JD-GUI to reverse-engineer about 70% of the app/classes, and then tweak them manually to build in Eclipse. However the rests are not so easy to be built because they are produced by code-generators? What tools can I use to assist further? Edit: This is one example of the difficulties: return ((SchemaTypeSystem)Class.forName( "org.apache.xmlbeans.impl.schema.SchemaTypeSystemImpl", true, class$schema$system$s322D2AAD7A06BA82525CDB874D86D59A$TypeSystemHolder.getClassLoader()) .getConstructor(new Class[] { Class.class }) .newInstance(new Object[] { TypeSystemHolder.class })); It's hard to know what is class$schema$system$s322D2AAD7A06BA82525CDB874D86D59A$TypeSystemHolder.getClassLoader())
