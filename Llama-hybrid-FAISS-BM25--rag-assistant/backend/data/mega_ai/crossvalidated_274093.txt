When using a VAR, if all variables are insignificant will Impulse Response Functions still make sense?

I have implemented a VAR in Eviews using log first differenced time series data for four stock market indices and the Baltic dry index. The model had autocorrelation when the VAR was calculated on one lag based on the AIC, SIC and HQ. So I added an extra lag to correct for autocorrelation. The resulting VAR has no signficant variables. Is it still possible to proceed with Impulse Response functions as well as variance decomposition?
