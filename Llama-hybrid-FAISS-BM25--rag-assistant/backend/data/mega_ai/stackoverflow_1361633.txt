provision profile

I have an application, it worked on the iPhone OS 3.0 with SDK 3.0. with iPhone OS 3.0.1 I did the update and it seems o.k.: ln -s /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/3.0\ (7A341) /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/3.0.1 But when I want to install my application on the device I get: "Code Sign error: Provisioning profile '...' can't be found" In XCode/Window/Organizer: "A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain" Should I change the provision profile somehow? It was created for iPhone OS 3.0. Should I change smth. in my keychain? Thank you so much for your help! Alexandra
