Browser detection will, without any doubt whatsoever, come back to strangle you in the future. Imagine that Apple launches a new iPhone that supports all this stuff, but then you have yet more options to choose from? What about a competitor platform that pretends to be an iPhone? What about any of the billion other options that could occur..? You see the problem. As Kendall mentions here, the better thing to do is let the user choose which site to see. I know its cool to do it automatically, but its not very maintainable, and annoying for the user. Things like language detection are different, serving a totally different version of the site is not cool for some arbitrary and very unreliable variable that could or could not be present, or could or could not be true. Look up user agent strings for IE, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and you'll start to see what's going on.. There's a pretty entertaining section in PPK's book on javascript about this, but his browser detection script might be handy if you decide to go this route (please dont!)
