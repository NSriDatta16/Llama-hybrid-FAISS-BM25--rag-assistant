Probability density is a density, and may be understood as such. Although this way of thinking is touched on in other answers, and at greater length in other threads, I find it helpful when trying to teach the topic, and to build on what people should already know about density generally and indeed long since. Thus in (high school?) physics or other subjects, people should have met density meaning mass per unit volume. In ecology, epidemiology, demography, geography and many social sciences, population density is number of people (or organisms) per unit area. The same idea is easily applied to counting facilities in an area $-$ or along a route, say the number of Starbucks along a road inside a city. Density has a reciprocal, which is often as interesting or useful. The reciprocal of population density is area per person or organism. The reciprocal of density along a line is the typical distance between objects, both being captured in statements such as there being one Starbucks on average every 200 m. I can think of another example that is perhaps esoteric, but you should have no difficulty grasping it: drainage density is total length of streams in a region (often, but not necessarily, a basin, catchment or watershed) divided by the area of that region. (Small print: measuring the length of a wiggly line is far from obvious.) With a little abstraction we can identify the family resemblance as how much stuff there is in a given space . Time to focus on a concrete example: This is close to default as a common-or-garden histogram in my usual statistical environment. It shows a variable, miles per gallon for a bundle of cars, on the horizontal or $x$ axis and has a (probability) density scale on the vertical or $y$ axis. Now comes the numerical crunch in three parts: The total probability is 1 and is given by the total area of the bars. The range of the variable on the $x$ axis is about 40 (miles per gallon). Rough mental calculations are fine here. So for that to happen the average height of the bars must be about 1/40, because we can think of an implied rectangle with area given by average height of bars $\times$ range on $x$ axis $\equiv$ 1. So, the average height of bars should be about 0.025, which checks out when we look at the graph. (There may be a little arm-waving at this point, but usually the listener can see that the number has the right order of magnitude.) The units (of measurement) of probability density follow from the fact that probability has no units, so units of probability density $\quad \equiv \quad$ 1 / units on $x$ axis Here the units are simple, gallons per mile, but that is often not so. Clearly, the story gets more complicated, but not different in principle, if talking about the bivariate or multivariate density of two or more variables considered together. What doesn't help here is (so far as I can see) an almost universal habit of never specifying units of measurement on a probability density axis. There seem to be three reasons for that: They would often just look odd. Thus hydrologists and many others get used to think of river discharge in cubic metres per second (so $\text{m}^3 \text{s}^{-1}$ ), but they might blench at being told that probability density for discharge has units $\text{m}^{-3} \text{s}$ . (Using non-metric rather than metric units doesn't help.) The units for probability density are just implicit as the reciprocal of the units on the $x$ axis. Nobody else does it, so why should we? David Finney (1917 $-$ 2018) wrote a splendid article on dimensions in statistics. You may have access to https://www.jstor.org/stable/2346969 I've also found even that people whose other education was strong in mathematics or physical science don't automatically think about what they are doing in statistics in terms of dimensions and units of measurement (even though the point does arise, e.g. in explaining why the standard deviation can be easier to think about than the variance). In particular, frequent puzzlement that a density exceeds 1 somewhere is eased by underlining that probability density usually has quite different units from probability itself.
