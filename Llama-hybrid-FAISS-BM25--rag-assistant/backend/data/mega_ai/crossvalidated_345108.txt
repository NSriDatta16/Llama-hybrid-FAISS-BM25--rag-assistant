To quote Wiki with a little formatting of my own: [...] a stochastic process is said to be ergodic if its statistical properties can be deduced from a single , sufficiently long, random sample of the process. In other, perhaps overly simplified words, if you observe a process for a long enough time, then you can know all there is to know about the process in terms of statistical behavior, because what you are observing gets closer and closer (coverges) to the "true" (what the wiki calls ensemble) properties of the process properties. On the same page, the counterexample with the two coins where one is fair and the other has only one outcome shows you exactly a process that is not mean-ergodic: when you pick a coin at random and start throwing it, the average of those throws will never be close to the (ensemble) mean of the process, no matter which coin you ended up picking or how many times you throw it.
