Directed Graphical Models, or Bayesian Networks, model the joint distribution with a specific factorization. Thus, when using DGM, you always consider the step of writing the joint law $p(X,Y)$ from which you can deduce $p(X)$ and $p(Y|X)$ and what you get is a generative model (with $X$ being the hidden variable and $Y$ the observed variable). On the other hand, when using an Undirected Graphical Model, you must consider writing potential functions which a are much less intuitive and harder to use than conditional probabilities used in DGM. That may be why you are feeling this tendency of UGM to be discriminative : energy functions are hard to write, "don't waste ressources" to model the full $p(X,Y)$ if $p(X|Y)$ is all that interests you.
