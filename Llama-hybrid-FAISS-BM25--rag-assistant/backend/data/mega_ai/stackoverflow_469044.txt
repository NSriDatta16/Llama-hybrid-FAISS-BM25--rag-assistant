The fastest way it is to use the Oracle collect function. You can also do this: SELECT * FROM (SELECT deptno, CASE WHEN Row_number() over ( PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY ename) = 1 THEN Stragg(ename) over ( PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY ename ROWS BETWEEN unbounded preceding AND unbounded following) END enames FROM emp) WHERE enames IS NOT NULL Visit the site ask tom and search on 'stragg' or 'string concatenation' . Lots of examples. There is also a not-documented oracle function to achieve your needs.
