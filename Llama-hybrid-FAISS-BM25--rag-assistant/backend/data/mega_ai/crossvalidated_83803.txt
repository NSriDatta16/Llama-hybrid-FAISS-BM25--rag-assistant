Kolmogorov-Smirnov test?

I am studying disturbance caused by ship traffic to a small seabird. I observed focal animals for a set amount of time and record whether or not they fly from the water during the observation. This particular bird does not fly at high probabilities when not disturbed (about 10% of the time). Post hoc, I have appended the distance to the nearest ship to every observation (ships of interest had GPS locators recording a point every 5 sec). I have plotted the cumulative distribution function for ALL observations and for observations where the bird flew from the water as a function of distance to nearest ship. As expected, the majority of the observations in which the bird flew were observed when the ship was close. Can I use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to test if there is a statistical difference in the distribution of the flight observations and the total observations? My thought is if these two distributions are different it would suggest that ship distance has an influence on flight. I worry as these distribution functions are not independent as the flight observations are a subset of the total observations. Thoughts? Having read a bit further on this site I think I can test the distribution of the observations in which flight occurred (F) against the distribution of the observations in which it did not (NF) as these are independent. If these distributions are the same F=NF, then we can assume that the distribution of (F) and (TOT = all observations) are the same as we know that the distribution of (F) is equal to itself and (F)+(T) = (TOT). Right? UPDATE: 2/12/14 Following the suggestions from @Scortchi I investigated the relationship of the incidence of flight vs distance to the nearest ship in a logistic regression framework. There was slight relationship present (negative slope) but the p-value was non-significant suggesting that the true slope could be zero. Based on the desciptive statistics (including the ecdf plots) I suspected that the effect of close ships was being drowned out by the many observations when the ship was not affecting behavior. I then used the R package segmented ( http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/segmented/segmented.pdf ) to try and find a break-point in the model. The program found that breaking the data at 2.6 km from the ship and fitting two separate coefficients was better than the single coefficient model. The coefficient for the slope of the close ship approaches was negative and suggests that ships affect the flight response until about 2.6 km (p-value 100 km away) and 9 of these individuals flew from the water during the observation (0.113 probability). Thanks for all the suggestions. I hope this question along with the suggestions and answers helps others.
