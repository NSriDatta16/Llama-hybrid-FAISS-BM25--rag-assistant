Well, you cannot relate tall and skinny to kurtosis because there is no mathematical connection. The beta(.5,1) distribution is infinitely tall and skinny but has low kurtosis. And the .9999U(0,1) + .0001Cauchy mixture appears perfectly flat over 99.99% of the observable data, but has infinite kurtosis. Contrary to whuber's comment, kurtosis is in fact precisely related to the tails. Larger kurtosis mathematically implies greater tail leverage. See here and here for precise descriptions of "tail leverage."
