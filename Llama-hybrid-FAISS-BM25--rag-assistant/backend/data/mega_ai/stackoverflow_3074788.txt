WPF drag cursor in default cursors

I'd like to use the default drag mouse cursor on mouse-over a UIElement to indicate a control is draggable. The cursor that looks like an arrow and a FocusVisual rectangle with an overlapping plus sign inside a rectangle. Basically, the cursor that is used when setting DragDropEffects.Copy during a drag operation. However I'd like to use this cursor like all the other types by using something like Cursor="DragCopy". Unfortunately it seems this cursor isn't available. I don't want to use a custom cursor because of compatibility and visual standards between OS. Any suggestions?
