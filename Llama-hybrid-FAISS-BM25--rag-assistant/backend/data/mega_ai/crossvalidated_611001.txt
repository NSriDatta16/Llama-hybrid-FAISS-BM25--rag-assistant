Why weighted F1-measure, precision and recall are always very similar to accuracy in my problem?

I'm adopting accuracy and macro and weighted averages of precision, recall and f-measure for evaluating my model in a multiclass problem with an imbalanced dataset. However, I noticed that weighted f1, precision, and recall are always very similar in this context. Is it common? Is it a good practice only use accuracy and macro averages, without weighted averages? Are there scenarios where is justified using weighted averages of precision, recall and f-measure?
