what is "principled feature selection"?

i see the expression "principled feature selection" in titles of various Machine Learning papers and generally in the literature but nowhere do authors really define what they mean. "principled" as opposed to? what's the difference, for example, from "regular" feature selection? and which ML/statistical models apply which?
