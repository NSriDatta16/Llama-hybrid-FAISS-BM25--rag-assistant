I think I have the answers for these questions: Answers for questions (1), (2) and (3) Since you want to compare averages between treatments, I would recommend to you to try first Tukey's test that is the most rigorous among the existent tests. Tukey's test is good if you want to avoid type I erros (reject null hypothesis, when null hypothesis is true). For example: Considering null hypothesis = Ho Average treatment 1 = u Average treatment 2 = uo Ho: u = uo H : u However, if in your results you are expecting a significant difference and you don't observe this difference using Tukey's test, then you should try Duncan's test since it differentiate more easily the treatments than Tukey. However, Duncan's test is more hard-work than Tukey, because Duncan's test requires calculation of several minimum significant differences (m.s.d.) and you have to ordinate the averages from the highest to the lowest. In the ordered set of averages, the comparison between the highest and lowest average corresponds to a range that covers all "N" averages. If the difference between the highest and lowest average is significant, it is estimated another m.s.d. to compare means covering a range of N - 1, and so on. Answer for question (4): In R, since you have repetitions inside the blocks, first, I would recommend to calculate the averages in excel and make a table with these averages of blocks so you can use the follow script in R: fat2.rbd(factor1, factor2, block, response) You should make a table with the factors, blocks and responses in these order in the excel, and save it in csv to run the data. The script: fat2.rbd(factor1, factor2, block, response) It will automatically give to you the factorial ANOVA and Tukey's test. To run Duncan's test you should use the follow script: fat2.rbd(factor1, factor2, block, response, mcomp="duncan") It will give to you the factorial ANOVA and Duncan's test. In ANOVA you will see if there are interactions among the Genetic Materials and the Fertilizers. If there is no interaction between the factors, you can explain the behavior of your data with the following chart: However, if there is interaction between Genetic Material and Fertilizer, a possible behavior could look like the following:
