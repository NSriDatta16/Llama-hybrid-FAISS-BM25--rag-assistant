Very strange JavaScript error

So all this time I had no problem with this script. But all of sudden today, it began to behave strangely. So I have a JavaScript page that loads inside an iframe. This is injected into a page loaded via proxy. $(top.document).ready() , throws an error saying Permission denied... I was surprised, so I decided to try load a different page. Then it was no longer complaining. I rebooted my computer, and when I first loaded a page via proxy, as the iframe containing JavaScript was injected into that page, I got the same error again. What is happening? Is this a problem on my server or my computer?
