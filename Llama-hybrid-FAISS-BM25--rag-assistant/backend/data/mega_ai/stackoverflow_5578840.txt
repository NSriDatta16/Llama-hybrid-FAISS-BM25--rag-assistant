Oauth Foursquare on Android device

I am using this tutorial here to allow the user to sign in to Foursqaure on an android device http://blog.doityourselfandroid.com/2010/11/10/oauth-flow-in-android-app/ What are the parameters that I would use here, as foursquare only has authenticate and access token retrieval: this.provider = new CommonsHttpOAuthProvider( REQUEST_URL, ACCESS_URL, AUTHORIZE_URL); Is there any other tutorials that may be useful?
