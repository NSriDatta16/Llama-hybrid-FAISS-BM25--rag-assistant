In my experience, the use of OpenID by your average home user is low to non-existent. I guess they are either uninformed about the existence, or scared to use it. On a local news site, where commenting can be done by logging in with OpenID, statistics show less than 1% usage. Most of these users have no problem logging in with their (social site of choice) credentials, which they also support. Use of these types of login are very common.
