What to do when GMap Satellite imagery is unavailable

is it possible to programmatically detect with the google maps api (javascript, v2) when satellite imagery is unavailable at a certain zoom level? I am creating some maps automatically and setting them to a certain zoom level, but in a few cases there is no satellite imagery available at that level, in which case I'd like to automatically back up a zoom level. Does the api expose some way of determining this lack of imagery? So far the only thing I can think of is trying to find out, with javascript, whether or not the image requests that the api makes are failing, and then reacting based on those failed image requests, but I can't really get it to work... and it seems a little inelegant. Thanks for your help!
