xcode - load localized images with the same name, not using nslozalicedstring

I'm trying to load a "Play" image(uiimageview) depending on the device language. In my AppBundle there are to folders, en.lproj(english) and es.lproj(spanish) with a Play.png image each one(one in english and one in spanish). I know how to load localized images using a Localizable.strings and images with different name, for example, Play_en.png and Play_es.png... using NSLocalizedString or something like that. But, is there any way to load that localized image with the same name? (primarily to maintain a good organization) This is how looks in xcode: http://a.imageshack.us/img51/8999/1007230001.png Thank you for reading ;)
