This is (again :-) a hard one. You could try to dump snapshots on the nodes using save() or save.image() . You could then try to re-organize your code so that the nodes can resume after the last snapshot. Or you could try to re-organize your workflow such that nodes 'take tickets' and return the results. That way the central node keeps tabs on everything and you can log interim results there. Either way, what you desire is not available out of the box (as far as I know).
