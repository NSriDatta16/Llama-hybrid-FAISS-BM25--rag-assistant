The fastest way would be to use the parent variable which references the DisplayObject parent. var stem:Stems = new Stems(2); stem.x = x; //optional: set stem coordinates to that of Star stem.y = y; parent.addChild(stem); If you want to add the Stems object to the stage every time a star-drag action stops you need to put the above code inside your drop function.
