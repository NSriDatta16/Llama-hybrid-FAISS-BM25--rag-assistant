I have run into the same situation in the past and found an interface to be the most scalable solution. Application cache may be the answer today, but will it scale to meet your needs? If you need to scale up, you may find cookies, or some type of temp database storage to be the trick. Simply add a new method to your interface, and set the interface to choose the "mode" from web.config.
