There is no "standard", that's why the reset exists. I've never heard of a set css file, and while I understand the point of it, rather than creating two separate files it should be merged into 1. It is inefficient to have rules listed twice. The only thing that I always push is 7px of padding on the button of paragraphs. I also like: padding: 0 10px 7px 0 on td tags.
