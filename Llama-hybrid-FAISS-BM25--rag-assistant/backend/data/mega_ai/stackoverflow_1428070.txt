Generate Table/View schema from LINQ-TO-SQL DBML file

I'd like to have a single source of the description of the data structure. Some people are asking can the DBML file being refreshed when it is changed in the database. The way I do is stupid but common; open it, delete all, and drag-drop again. I heard that there are some 3rd party do the tricks. But I am thinking, any way to inverse the operation? In hibernate, there is a way to build the DDL of the target DB from the XML data structure. Is it possible that the DBML file will contain all information to rebuild the DDL of the database? (e.g. have a copy of those VIEW SQL, stored procedure codes), and build the "Create script" on the fly (like what you do in SQL Server Enterprise Manager)
