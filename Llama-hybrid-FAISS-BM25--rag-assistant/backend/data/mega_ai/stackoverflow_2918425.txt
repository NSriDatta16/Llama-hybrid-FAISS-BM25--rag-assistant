jQuery UI Sortable accepts any selector, but the selector is used to choose which items are sortable when the sortable is createdâ€”not when a drag starts. If you change the DOM, it will still remember which items were sortable when the sortable was created. You should be able to return false from sortstart if ui.item contains a , but this seems to not work right now; instead, you can use this, which does: $('ul').sortable({ items: '> li', cancel: 'li:has(form)' });
