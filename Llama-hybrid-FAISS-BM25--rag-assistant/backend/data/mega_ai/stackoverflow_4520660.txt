I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but this might work... I created a spreadsheet with "people" in A1, "day1" in B1 "day2" in C1 Starting in A2 and going down: person1 person2 person3 Starting in B2 and going down: 1 2 3 Starting in C2 and going down: 4 5 6 then in a different column (I used G) I put the label "People" in G1, "Day" in H1 and "Value" in I1 then formulas in Row 2 G2 =$A2 H2 =$B$1 I2 =$B2 I can then drag the formulas down to pivot for what you appear to be looking for. It does have to be duplicated for each "day#" column, but if it's a one time load it shouldn't be too painful (depending on the number of columns). Otherwise the alternative is going to be temp tables that you can stage to do the pivot in the SSIS package.
