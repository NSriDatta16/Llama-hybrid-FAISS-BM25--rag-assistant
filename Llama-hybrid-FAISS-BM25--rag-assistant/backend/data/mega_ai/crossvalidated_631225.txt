It depends on what level of automation you wish to achieve. I would say that sooner than later you will still need some ground truth dataset to validate your model. It is very unlikely that you will be able to reach, e.g., 95% accuracy with a simple formula for detecting the pattern in a data (like thresholding algorithm). I would suggest you split your dataset into same-duration time periods. e.g., swing lasts for 5 sec - then take 5 sec time intervals, define some labels for these intervals, then (down/up)sample your data from particular frames to have, e.g., 100 samples for 5 sec duration, then try to use ML/DL (e.g., SVM), or linear regression even, to categorize your time interval as either: walk, setup/rest, swing. If that will not work, increase the number of samples in your learning dataset and/or try some approaches taking the time into account, such as LSTMs. I mean, you can use some zero (or X) crossing two-factor thresholding, but then you need to do some proper testing, either cross-validation or empirical testing to be sure that your algorithm works fine. If you have raw video available, maybe it will be better to use some posture-processing algorithm to get more joints ( https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/trt_pose ), rather than focus only on the left hand -- it could be very complicated to get the proper model from left hand alone.
