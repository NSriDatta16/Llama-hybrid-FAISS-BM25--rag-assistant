Using non-persistence related methods and fields in persistence entity

I have a persistence related java-ee code which I need to rewrite to make the app work on the Google App Engine and its data storage. When I use java-ee persistence providers, I generate persistence entities with my IDE and I keep them the way they are in case I need to regenerate them. However autogenerating entity classes for app-engine storage is not possible and I would like to know if there are any good reasons why I should keep the entity classes clean and not use fields and methods not directly related to persistence. I use objectify as persistence provider if it matters. Here's an example: public class Dog { @Id Long id; @Transient Integer barkCount; public String bark() { barkCount++; return "woof-woof"; } public String getAgeEstimation() { switch(barkCount) { case 0: return "unborn (or very lazy)"; case 10000: return "this is very old dawg"; default: return "you get the idea :)"; } } }
