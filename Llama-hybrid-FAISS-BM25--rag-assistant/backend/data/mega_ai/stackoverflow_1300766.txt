OK, using the suggested Fiddler app to check the server responses I noticed it was hitting the server, but only once while in FireFox it was hitting the server every two seconds as it is supposed to. Because of the short update interval I never noticed the update in IE. Upon further investigation, IE apparently caches all GET requests and re-serves the old request if the same request is made later. To prevent this, you have to send header info to the browser to not cache the result. Adding the following code to the php script below the content-type declaration resolved the issue: header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT"); header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate"); header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false); header("Pragma: no-cache");
