Using a convolutional network is a bad idea, because The inductive bias of CNNs is that local elements (read: pixels / table entries) are more relevant than distant elements, and that the data is spatially structured at multiple-scales -- from the pixel level up to globally coherent patterns and objects. A table where the row order means nothing because you can permute them, and the column order also presumably means nothing because they are just arbitrarily ordered statistics satisfies none of the criteria which CNNs are designed for.
