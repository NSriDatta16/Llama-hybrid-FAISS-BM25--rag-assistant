HTML - make some pages only accessible through IntrAnet \ some SUBNET

i have certain pages in my website that i would like to only be accessed from the LAN which is within my organization... now those pages are a part of my website because they interact with the database and all... how to do it Now i can make them password protected... but i want to make them inaccessible to the rest of the internet and only display them (without password auth.) and links to them in other pages when they are opened from a subnet\LAN of the company... HOW TO DO IT.... what if i want to extend this from one subnet to multiple subnets like a ACL- Access Control List
