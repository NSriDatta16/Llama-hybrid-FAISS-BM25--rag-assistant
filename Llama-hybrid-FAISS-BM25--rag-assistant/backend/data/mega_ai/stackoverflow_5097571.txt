You can mount the device via USB but (in Win7 at least) it doesn't appear to have its own drive letter; rather it's treated like a camera or another media device. It doesn't mount automatically; you generally need to "opt-in" in the notification area with something like "Turn on USB storage" Don't know about emulators.
