I have a friend who used to work for the US defense department (long time ago, cold war era) and was once asked to answer a question using a single data point. When he insisted that he needed more data he was told that the person who had provided the single data point had been caught and executed for espionage shortly after providing the single data point, so there would be no more data coming. That is when my friend started to learn about Bayesian statistics. I also remember seeing an article several years ago, possibly in the American Statistician, possibly in Chance, that derived a way to compute a confidence interval for a mean based on a single data point (the 95% interval from a value of x was something like -x to 3*x) if you were willing to make certain assumptions (and the usual diagnostics were not of any help with only 1 point). So, yes, you can do valid statistics with very small sample sizes, but you will tend to have low power/precision and large sample properties will not help you, so violations of any assumptions will have a potentially much larger impact.
