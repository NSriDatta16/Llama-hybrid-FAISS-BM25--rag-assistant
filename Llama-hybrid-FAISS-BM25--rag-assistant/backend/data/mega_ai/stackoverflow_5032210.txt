php sentence boundaries detection

I would like to divide a text into sentences in PHP. I'm currently using a regex, which brings ~95% accuracy and would like to improve by using a better approach. I've seen NLP tools that do that in Perl, Java, and C but didn't see anything that fits PHP. Do you know of such a tool?
