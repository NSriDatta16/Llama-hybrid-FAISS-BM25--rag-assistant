I had the same Problem. Its because magento can't find a javascript file. Look at your /var/log/exception.log (You have to enable the log in System -> Config -> Developer Options) In my log was the following error: exception 'Exception' with message 'Warning: filemtime() [function.filemtime]: stat failed for /var/www/js/calendar/lang/calendar-en.js in /var/www/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Helper/Data.php on line 631' in /var/www/app/code/core/Mage/Core/functions.php:245 So I created the file and voila it works !
