The question is who requires you to provide the stats. If it's non-technical people, fake the stats. By "fake", I mean "provide any inevitably meaningless, but real numbers" of the kind you mentioned. If it's technical people without a CS background, they ought to be told about the halting problem, which is undecidable and is simpler than counting and classifying the remaining bugs. There's a lot of metrics and tools regarding software quality (code coverage, cyclomatic complexity, coding guidelines and tools enforcing them, etc.). In practice, what works is automating as much tests as possible, having human testers do as many tests that weren't automated as possible, and then pray.
