How do you do string interpolation with a URL that contains formatting characters?

I'm trying to use URLLIB2 to open a URL and read back the contents into an array. The issue seems to be that you cannot use string interpolation in a URL that has formatting characters such as %20 for space, %3C for ' My code is pretty simple, looks something like this: #Python script to fetch NS Client Policies using GUID import sys import urllib2 def GetPolicies(ns, guid): ns = sys.argv[1] guid = sys.argv[2] fetch = urllib2.urlopen('http://%s/Altiris/NS/Agent/GetClientPolicies.aspx?xml=%3Crequest%20configVersion=%222%22%20guid=%22{%s}%22') % (ns, guid) I've shortened the URL for brevity but you get the general idea, you get a 'Not enough arguments for format string' error since it assumes you're wanting to use the %3, %20, and other things as string interpolations. How do you get around this? Edit: Solution requires Python 2.6+, 2.5 or prior has no support for the string.format() method
