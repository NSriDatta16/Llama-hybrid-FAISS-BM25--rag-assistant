One important information is probably kept from the text: “The misclassified instances are assigned with a greater weight when computing information gain .” It simply means that these instances have a greater contribution when computing model loss. So, the gradients you compute to modifying the model weights are more influenced by these instances so the resulting model can correctly classify them. In other words, the loss computation is no longer an average of individual losses but a weighted average of individual losses - the model receives greater punishment for misclassifying some instances than others.
