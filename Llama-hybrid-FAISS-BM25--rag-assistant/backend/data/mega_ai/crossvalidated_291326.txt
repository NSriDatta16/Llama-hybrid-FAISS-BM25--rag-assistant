If you're thinking about extending the Kalman filter you may be interested in these publications as a starting point. They check most of the boxes except the causality, but that is where you come in: Särkkä, S. (2013). Bayesian filtering and smoothing (Vol. 3). Cambridge University Press. Online version. Van Vaerenbergh, S., Lázaro-Gredilla, M., & Santamaría, I. (2012). Kernel recursive least-squares tracker for time-varying regression. IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems, 23(8), 1313-1326. Online version. [Disclaimer: I'm author of the second one.]
