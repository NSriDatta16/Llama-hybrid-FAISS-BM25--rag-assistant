What's the optimal way to encode a 'month' feature?

What's the optimal way to encode a 'month' feature? A single integer value or 12 binary values don't quite grasp the concept of modulo distance... Say I want to train an SVM for a certain task and believe that the time of the year might contribute some valuable information, how should I transform it into a feature? What's the general approach to encoding numerical values that sit on a ring rather than an axis when using linear classifiers?
