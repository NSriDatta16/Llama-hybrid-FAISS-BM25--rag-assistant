The View property is an alias for the ViewData property. That means that the following code View.Title is equivalent to ViewData["Title"] This works by using the new 'dynamic' feature of the C# language introduced in .NET 4. Basically it allows you to write late-bound code in what has until now been a statically-typed language. There's plenty of resources on the web if you want to learn more. The ViewData property is still available and you can use both interchangaebly. They both use the same backing storage so changes made one way will be available the other way. The advantage of using View is more concise syntax. The disadvantage is that you do not get IntelliSense support. The reason why you can set View.Title in your view page and the correct value shows up in the layout page is due to the rendering order of Razor pages. We call it the inside-out rendering, which means that your view page gets executed first, it's HTML output gets collected into a buffer, then the layout page gets executed, and the buffered view page output gets injected where you call RenderBody .
