What are the techniques used for learning in non-feedforward neural networks?

Suppose our network architecture has a hidden layer in which the hidden units are interconnected, then is there some sort of variation on backpropagation that is used? What about in general recurrent neural networks? Backpropagation seems to really take advantage of the "feed-fowardness" of a feed-forward net. Is this what deep learning is about?
