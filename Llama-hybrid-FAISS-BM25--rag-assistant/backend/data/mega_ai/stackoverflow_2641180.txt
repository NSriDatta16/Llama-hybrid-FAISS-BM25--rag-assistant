Try this, it should work (all i did was remove a single space in the fifth line and add the closing quote on the sixth): %script(type="text/javascript") $('#mylink').click(function() { $('#mylink').after(' - @myarray.each do |options| #{options.name} '); )}; However, assuming you're running this with a ruby script or framework of sorts, why not just do it outside the template? That would probably be most appropriate. In rails/sinatra and other frameworks, you could use a helper method to do this. If you look at the haml reference, they actually discourage use of - to evaluate ruby.
