Hard to know quite what to suggest unless you post some code. There's nothing wrong with Papervision, but it's probably overkill for a simple carousel. Lee Brimelow has a good tutorial for a 3D carousel here: http://www.gotoandlearn.com/play?id=92 which drags around without distortion quite nicely. (It might be worth noting that the 3D carousel is way overplayed, but that's as may be.)
