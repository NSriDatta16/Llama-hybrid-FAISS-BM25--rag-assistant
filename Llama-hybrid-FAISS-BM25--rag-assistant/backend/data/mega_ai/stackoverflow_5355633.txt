Create Android.mk to build a C library

I'm developping an app which needs to use a Java library (jpcap: http://netresearch.ics.uci.edu/kfujii/Jpcap/doc/download.html ). The problem is that library uses JNI to call methods written in C code. In order to call correctly the Java methods I have to compile the C code of the library using the Android NDK. To compile the C code I have to write an Android.mk file to use it with the ndk-build script which provides the NDK. I've never written before an Android.mk and I don't know how to write the file to fit my needs which are the next: Compile the following source files: JpcapCaptor.c JpcapSender.c JpcapWriter.c packet_arp.c packet_datalink.c packet_icmp.c packet_ip.c packet_ipv6.c packet_tcp.c packet_udp.c Include the following libraries: jni.h pcap.h Link using the -lpcap option. If any of you guys could tell me which lines do I have to write in the Android.mk file or tell me where to find a manual which explains this I would be very thankfull.
