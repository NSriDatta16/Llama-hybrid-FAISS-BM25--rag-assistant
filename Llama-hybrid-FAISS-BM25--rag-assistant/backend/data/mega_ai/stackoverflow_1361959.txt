MVC with Microsoft and Oracle

I am curious about the strategies adopted by the two leading vendors on MVC. Whereas microsoft has currently unvieled MVC 2 and Oracle seems to have Oracle ADF which is based on Java and JSF but provides darg and drop functionality . Does this mean in the MVC race because of Oracle ADF drag and drop they are ahead of microsoft in this ?
