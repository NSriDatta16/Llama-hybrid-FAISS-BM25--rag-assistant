Magento website server migration issues

I'm currently in the process of transferring my magento instalation, alog with its database, to a new web server. I edited the config files so they would match the new domain's database data, and uploaded the same files to the other server. When I'm trying to run the system, I get the following error: Warning: include_once(Varien/Autoload.php) [function.include-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/content/73/6502373/html/app/Mage.php on line 50 Warning: include_once() [function.include]: Failed opening 'Varien/Autoload.php' for inclusion (include_path='/home/content/73/6502373/html/app/code/local:/home/content/73/6502373/html/app/code/community:/home/content/73/6502373/html/app/code/core:/home/content/73/6502373/html/lib:.:/usr/local/php5/lib/php') in /home/content/73/6502373/html/app/Mage.php on line 50 Warning: include(Varien/Autoload.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/content/73/6502373/html/app/code/core/Mage/Core/functions.php on line 68 Warning: include() [function.include]: Failed opening 'Varien/Autoload.php' for inclusion (include_path='/home/content/73/6502373/html/app/code/local:/home/content/73/6502373/html/app/code/community:/home/content/73/6502373/html/app/code/core:/home/content/73/6502373/html/lib:.:/usr/local/php5/lib/php') in /home/content/73/6502373/html/app/code/core/Mage/Core/functions.php on line 68 Fatal error: Class 'Varien_Autoload' not found in /home/content/73/6502373/html/app/Mage.php on line 53 Do you have any Idea on how I can debug this? Just put me in the right track. thanks!
