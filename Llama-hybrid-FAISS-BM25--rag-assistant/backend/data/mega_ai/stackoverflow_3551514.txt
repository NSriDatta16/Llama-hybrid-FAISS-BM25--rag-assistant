Wow, what the hell is that ?! For your question, I'd replace GL_LUMINANCE in your 3 glDrawPixels by GL_RED, GL_GREEN and GL_BLUE respectively. However : glPixelTransfer is bad glDrawPixels is bad Is there a single reason why you're not using a super-simple fragment shader to do the conversion ? It's a simple matrix multiplication, and you're under ogl3.0... Create a texture from imageData, this needs to be done only once. Make a shader that reads the color from the texture, multiply it by the color conversion matrix, and display it Bind the computed color matrix Draw a fullscreen quad. Even an 5 year old card will get 500 fps out of this.
