Detecting if a browser is using Private Browsing mode

I'm building an extranet for a company paranoid about security. They want to make sure that (among other things) their users are browsing the site with the Private Browsing mode switched on in their web browser so that no cookies or history is kept. I found only this http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2009/03/detecting-private-browsing-mode.html and https://serverfault.com/questions/18966/force-safari-to-operate-in-private-mode-and-detect-that-state-from-a-webserver The ideal solution would use no or minimal javascript. Would attempting to set a unique cookie work for all browsers and platforms? Anyone done this before? thanks! update http://crypto.stanford.edu/~collinj/research/incognito/ uses the CSS visited technique of the browser fingerprinters mentioned by other posters- thanks for the hints. I like it because it is small and elegant, but still want to be able to do it without javascript if possible.
