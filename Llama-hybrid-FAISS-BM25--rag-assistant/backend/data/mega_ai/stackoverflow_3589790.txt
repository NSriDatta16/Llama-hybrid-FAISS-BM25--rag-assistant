Facebook Graph Api is the best.The url is http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api The Graph API uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization. Check out the authentication guide for the details of Facebook's OAuth 2.0 implementation. OAuth 2.0 is a simpler version of OAuth that leverages SSL for API communication instead of relying on complex URL signature schemes and token exchanges. At a high level, using OAuth 2.0 entails getting an access token for a Facebook user via a redirect to Facebook. After you obtain the access token for a user, you can perform authorized requests on behalf of that user by including the access token in your Graph API requests: https://graph.facebook.com/220439?access_token=... Check out the PHP example code or the Python example code on GitHub to see a complete example of obtaining an access token for the current user. The steps to obtain an access token are: Register your application to get an app ID and secret. Your Facebook app ID is your client_id and your Facebook application secret is your client_secret. Redirect the user to https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize with your client_id and the redirect_uri. The redirect_uri parameter needs to begin with your app's URL. For instance, if your URL is http://www.example.com then your redirect URI could be http://www.example.com/oauth_redirect . https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize? client_id=...& redirect_uri=http://www.example.com/oauth_redirect After the user authorizes your application, we redirect the user back to the redirect URI you specified with a verification string in the argument code, which can be exchanged for an oauth access token. Exchange it for an access token by fetching https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token . Pass the exact same redirect_uri as in the previous step: https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token? client_id=...& redirect_uri=http://www.example.com/oauth_redirect& client_secret=...& code=... Use the access token returned by the request above to make requests on behalf of the user: https://graph.facebook.com/me?access_token=...
