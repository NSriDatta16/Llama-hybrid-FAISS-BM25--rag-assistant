I assume you're asking about persistence of triples (and possibly graphs via quads) where the storage is either a "native" triple store (for example, TDB ) or a relational database with a triple store overlay (like SDB ). If you an elaborate on your requirements, I'm sure Stack Overflow members can offer a more directed answer, but just off the top of my head: Native triple stores typically have better performance when the size of the dataset gets very large. See some numbers from the W3C . Native triple stores can offer in-store reasoning/inferencing (like Oracle's semantic toolkit, although it doesn't fully support SPARQL). Triples in an RDBMS can be "easily" integrated into traditional reporting tools (like Jasper Reports) since you can query them with SQL.
