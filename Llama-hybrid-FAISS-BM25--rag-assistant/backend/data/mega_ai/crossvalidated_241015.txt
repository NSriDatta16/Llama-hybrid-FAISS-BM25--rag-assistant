The Wikipedia article you mention, One-shot learning , does seem specific to computer vision. A broader term is semi-supervised learning , which may be more appropriate. (I am not an expert in Machine Learning or its various sub-communities, but the above is consistent with the first pages of results on Google Scholar for these terms.)
