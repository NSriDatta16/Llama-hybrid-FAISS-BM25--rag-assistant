Why is variational Bayesian mixture model an alternative to MCMC? What are the similarities?

Why do people say that a variational Bayesian mixture model could be an alternative to MCMC for clustering? For example see the details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_method . What is the purpose of the Markov Chain in MCMC? Does it correspond to the beta / Dirichlet distribution in variational Bayesian method? Do I make sense of the probability model described in Markov Chain?
