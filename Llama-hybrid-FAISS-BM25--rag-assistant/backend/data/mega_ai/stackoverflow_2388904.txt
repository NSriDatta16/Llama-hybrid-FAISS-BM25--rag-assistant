MS Excel, 35 chars =IF(A1/2=ROUND(A1/2,0),A1/2,A1*3+1) Taken straight from Wikipedia : In cell A1, place the starting number. In cell A2 enter this formula =IF(A1/2=ROUND(A1/2,0),A1/2,A1*3+1) Drag and copy the formula down until 4, 2, 1 It only took copy/pasting the formula 111 times to get the result for a starting number of 1000. ;)
