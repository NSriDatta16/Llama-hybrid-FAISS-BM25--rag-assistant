It is a pretty simple problem. You need to handle MouseDown, MouseUp, and keep track of when you start and stop dragging your selection rectangle. Now that you have done that you already have the selection rect, so just use that to take a portion of the whole image. If you are displaying a scaled version just find the ratio between the control's dimensions and the dimensions of the image.
