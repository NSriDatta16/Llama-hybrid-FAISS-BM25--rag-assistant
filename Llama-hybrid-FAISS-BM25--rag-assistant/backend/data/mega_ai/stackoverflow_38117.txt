Inbox Management (in Outlook)

I've gone back and forth between having an organized inbox and having an inbox with absolutely everything I've received in it. Would you recommend leaving everything in an inbox, or organize it? If you organize it, is there any method to your madness or possibly an Outlook (2003) plug-in to aid in this task? For what it's worth, I feel way more productive with everything in my inbox, grouped by date. I feel like a spend way more time doing inbox management any other way.
