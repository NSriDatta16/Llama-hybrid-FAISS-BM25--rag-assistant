Crafting .webloc file

I'm writing a program (for Mac OS X, using Objective-C) and I need to create a bunch of .webloc files programmatically. The .webloc file is simply file which is created after you drag-n-drop an URL from Safari's location bar to some folder. Generally speaking, I need an approach to create items in a filesystem which point to some location in the Web. As I understand .webloc files should be used for this on Mac OS X. So, is it possible to craft a .webloc file having a valid url and some title for it?
