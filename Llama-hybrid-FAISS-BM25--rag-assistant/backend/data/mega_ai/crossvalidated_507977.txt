How to penalize the duration of unexpected events in an elegant way?

Maybe a stupid question...em...I want to penalize the unexpected events and define the reward like this: $r_{t} =-10* (t - t_{s})$ , where $t_{s}$ denotes the starting time of the event, $t - t_{s}$ is the duration of unexpected events. My question is: do I need a state to directly describe $t - t_{s}$ , or I just use a flag to record $t_{s}$ ? In a word, how to penalize the duration of unexpected events in an elegant way?
