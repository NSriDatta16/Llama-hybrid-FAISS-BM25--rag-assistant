Simple Android File Output Problem

I'm kinda stuck with something which must be appalingly simple. I'm trying to write a few variables to a file, each on it's own line so that I'll be able to use readLine in another method to read the variables back in. Here's the code: package com.example.files2; import java.io.BufferedWriter; import java.io.File; import java.io.FileInputStream; import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.FileWriter; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.InputStreamReader; import java.io.OutputStreamWriter; import android.app.Activity; import android.content.Context; import android.os.Bundle; import android.os.Environment; import android.widget.Toast; public class files2 extends Activity { /** Called when the activity is first created. */ @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); String string1 = "Hey you"; String string2 = "Is there anybody there"; String string3 = "Can you hear me"; setContentView(R.layout.main); try{ File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "file.txt"); BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file)); writer.write(string1); writer.newLine(); writer.write(string2); writer.newLine(); writer.write(string3); writer.newLine(); writer.flush(); writer.close(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} The file writes OK, but instead of each variable being on it's own line, I get just one line which reads'Hey youIs there anybody thereCan you hear me'. So I guess .newLine() isn't working but why? Is there a simple answer to this problem or a better way to achieve it? Thanks all, comments warmly appreciated. Joe
