Qt QCompleter multiple matches

I am trying to make QCompleter match several equivalent options which are separated with commas. There seemingly is no easy way to do that, but one line of QCompleter reference caught my attention, describing function QCompleter::splitPath: "When used with list models, the first item in the returned list is used for matching." Could this be used in the way I need - split the input string and return it so the unfinished last item is the first in the list? I didn't manage to make it work, but I may be doing something wrong.
