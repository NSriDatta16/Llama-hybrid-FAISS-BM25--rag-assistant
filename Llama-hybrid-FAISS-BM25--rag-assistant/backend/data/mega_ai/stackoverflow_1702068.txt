NHibernate - access the ID of an associated object without lazy loading the whole object

I have two associated business objects - A and B. the association is (A->B)many-to-one, with B.Id a foreign key in A (so A has A.B_id in the DB). I'm using lazy=true and solved most of my problems, however in A's ToString I want to print also A.B.Id, which I should have without further trips to the DB. but accessing A.B activates the proxy, and since this isn't in the context of an open session, throws an exception. one easy but ugly solution would be to have A.B_id property. but that's part of the stuff we were trying to avoid in the first place. any "organic" way to do this? :) thanks! UPDATE: just read about caching and Session.Get vs. Session.Load. before I only new that one throws an exception if the object doesn't exist (Session.Load), and the other returns a null object (Session.Get). after reading about caching here , it's clear that Session.Load returns a proxy to the object, and only lazily fetches it when a property other than the ID is accessed, which is very much like what I need from associations! for now I added the separate object ids (added B_Id to A so I can access it as A.B_Id instead of using A.B.Id)
