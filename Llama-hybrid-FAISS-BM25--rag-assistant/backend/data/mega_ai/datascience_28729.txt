How to use pca results for linear regression

I have a data set of 11 variables with allot of observations for each one. I want to make linear regression on the variables with the observed $\vec{y}=\alpha +\beta*\vec{X}$ when X is matrix. I'm trying to reduce my parameters so I activate pca algorithm on X. I get the "loading" data but i don't understand how to use it to get only four (for example) variables to estimate instead of 11. somebody can help?
