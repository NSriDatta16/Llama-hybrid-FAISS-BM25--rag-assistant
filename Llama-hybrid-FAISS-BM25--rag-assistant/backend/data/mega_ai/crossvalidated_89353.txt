Difference between iid data and non-iid data for a simple regression problem

I am trying to understand the difference between iid and non-iid data. Let's consider a given time series, and say it's reasonable to assume that at each time point the random variable $X_t$ depends on $X_{t-1}$. Now say someone gives me the dataset $ D = \{ ( t_i, x_i ) \} $ for $i=1 \dots n$. I might be tempted to apply some regression method, which usually assumes that the corresponding pairs of random variables $(T_i, X_i)$ are iid. Would that be a bad idea if we really believe that $X_{t}$ depends on $X_{t-1}$?
