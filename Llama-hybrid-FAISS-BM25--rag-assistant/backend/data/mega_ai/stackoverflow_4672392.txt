Create Image from Data URL

What I was hoping to do was use the JavaScript "readAsDataURL" method of the "FileReader" object in order to read file input from a drag and drop. Then I wanted to use Ajax with a PHP upload file in order to create a file and upload it to an "uploads" folder on the server. I was wondering if there was a function in GD or something that would allow me to read in a data URL and output a file in which I could move to that folder.
