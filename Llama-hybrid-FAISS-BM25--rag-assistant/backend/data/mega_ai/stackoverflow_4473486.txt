iPhone SDK - Can't upload Update to the iTunes Store

I want to upload my Update to the iTunes Store (Universal App) but it doesn't work. Everytime I try it I get this answer: "An error occurred uploading to the iTunes Store". I don't use the application loader (won't work) - I'm using the organizer in Xcode to upload it. Yes, I have experience with uploading new Applications and Updates on this way, but I have no idea what happend now. I hope there is anyone who could help me. Thanks a lot, mavrick3.
