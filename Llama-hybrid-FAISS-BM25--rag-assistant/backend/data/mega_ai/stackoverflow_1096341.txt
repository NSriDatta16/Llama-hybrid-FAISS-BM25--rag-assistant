Function pointers casting in C++

I have a void pointer returned by dlsym(), I want to call the function pointed by the void pointer. So I do a type conversion by casting: void *gptr = dlsym(some symbol..) ; typedef void (*fptr)(); fptr my_fptr = static_cast (gptr) ; I have also tried reinterpret_cast but no luck, although the C cast operator seems to work..
