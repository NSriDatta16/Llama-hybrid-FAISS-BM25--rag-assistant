RMSE punishes large errors

Every text book will usually say that RMSE punishes large errors (because of the quadratic nature of it). What if the average errors are all between 0 and 1? Example: we measure temperature and we get very good predictions. Our MAE is around 0.5 - in that case RMSE punishes low errors. Am I missing something out?
