Embedding an OpenXML document within another OpenXml document

I have a need to gather a number of .docx files in a folder and "chain" them into a single document that will be displayed to the user. Now I've read Brian Jones' article but while it sounded promising I have encountered a problem. When I perform the actions manually using Word 2007 I end up with a copy of the docx file in the /embeddings folder and when I open the document I am presented with the embedded content. However, when I do the same thing through code I end up with a file called package.bin in the /embeddings folder and when I open the document I'm greeted with the alternate image telling me to Double-Click on it to activate the embedded document. This is not what I wanted. Can someone clarify how I embed the document(s) so that they appear as .docx files rather than .bin? I'm hoping that this will overcome the Double-Click to Activate issue as well. Thanks in Advance
