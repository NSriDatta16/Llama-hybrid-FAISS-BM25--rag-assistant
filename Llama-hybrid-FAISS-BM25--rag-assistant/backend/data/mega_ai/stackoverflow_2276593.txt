The largest distance between any two points in a set S of points is called the diameter . Finding the diameter of a set of points is a well-known problem in computational geometry. In general, there are two steps here: Find the three-dimensional convex hull composed of the center of each sphere -- say, using the quickhull implementation in CGAL. Find the points on the hull that are farthest apart. (Two points on the interior of the hull cannot be part of the diameter, or otherwise they would be on the hull, which is a contradiction.) With quickhull, you can do the first step in O(n log n) in the average case and O(n 2 ) worst-case running time. (In practice, quickhull significantly outperforms all other known algorithms.) It is possible to guarantee a better worst-case bound if you can guarantee certain properties about the ordering of the spheres, but that is a different topic. The second step can be done in Î©(h log h), where h is the number of points on the hull. In the worst case, h = n (every point is on the hull), but that's pretty unlikely if you have thousands of random spheres. In general, h will be much smaller than n . Here's an overview of this method.
