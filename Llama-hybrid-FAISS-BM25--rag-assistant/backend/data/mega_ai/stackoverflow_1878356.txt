In short, no. I've been looking into this as well. Since I work with the Flash IDE, Haxe, and flex I'll outline the different methods for accessing content by embedding it in a swf. It doesn't look like there's a way to directly instantiate a symbol. If your assets were exported by the Flash IDE, normally you would set the properties to export for Actionscript to get at the symbol. In Haxe you'd specify a class to match that in the swfmill xml. With flex you'd define a class and use the Embed metadata tag to access the symbol by embedding the swf. http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=embed_4.html This script which might be helpful to you for generating the export classes. http://wiki.disemia.com/HaXe_SWFMILL_Resource_Converter If you're using AS3, you'll probably have to use mxmlc anyway if you're compiling your project from the command line. Since speed is the issue for you, you should consider using fcsh.
