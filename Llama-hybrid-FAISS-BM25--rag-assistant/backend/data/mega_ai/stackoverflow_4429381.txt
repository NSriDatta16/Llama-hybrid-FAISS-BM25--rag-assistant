If you need to Strassen your source code, you should first check if doing that is legal in your jurisdiction. Then you need to verify whether you need to be a licensed practitioner to do so. If a license is required and you are not one, you need to find a licensing practitioner - I would recommend Yellow Pages or Google. You also need to pay attention to your local ethical/morality standards. In certain communities you might get shunned or frowned upon if you Strassen your source code.
