In short: No! There is no such library to create a dashboard or actionbar in a short way. In this video Android UI design patterns , however, developers state in Q&A part that they may release a library to achieve those UI design patterns in the future. Until then you need to design and implement your dashboard and stuff. I strongly recommend to checkout and take a look the code at iosched as Eric already mentioned. There is a beautiful dashboard implemented. You can also use DroidDraw to design and implement UI views easily by drag&drop. DroidDraw can also then export your design to android xml file. Hope that helps
