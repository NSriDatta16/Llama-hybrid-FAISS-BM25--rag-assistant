Inference vs. estimation?

What are the differences between "inference" and "estimation" under the context of machine learning ? As a newbie, I feel that we infer random variables and estimate the model parameters. Is my this understanding right? If not, what are the differences exactly, and when should I use which? Also, which one is the synonym of "learn"?
