In my dataset all the features are in Categorical. How can i convert it into numbers?

I am not able to apply OHE because tags feature has around 100 words in it so how can solve this problem? Here is my data book={'Title':['Geophysical deep learning','Deep learning for algorithm portfolios','Polymer electrolyte and polymer'], 'tags':['method comprising:\nselecting type geophysical data;\nselecting type algorithm;\ngenerating synthetic geophysical data selected type geophysical data based least part algorithm;\ntraining deep learning classifier framework based least part synthetic geophysical data generate trained deep learning classifier framework;\nreceiving acquired geophysical data geologic environment;\nimplementing trained deep learning classifier framework generate interpretation results acquired geophysical data; and\noutputting interpretation results, wherein interpretation results characterize structural','features indicative hydrocarbons geologic environment. A method comprising:\nselecting a type of geophysical data;\nselecting a type of algorithm;\ngenerating synthetic geophysical data of the selected type of geophysical data based at least in part on the algorithm;\ntraining a deep learning classifier framework based at least in part on the synthetic geophysical data to generate a trained deep learning classifier framework;\nreceiving acquired geophysical data for a geologic environment;\nimplementing the trained deep learning classifier framework to generate interpretation results for the acquired geophysical data; and\noutputting the interpretation results','method suppressing non-specific cross-hybridization repetitive sequences present nucleic acid probes homologous repetitive sequences target genomic nucleic acid, said method comprising steps of:\nidentifying repetitive sequences representative genomic region;\nsynthesizing suppressive nucleic acid derived said identified repetitive sequences, said suppressive nucleic acid substantially comprising said identified repetitive sequences substantially'], 'Target':['Deep Learning','Deep Learning','Polymer']} pd.DataFrame(book) In this we have to predict the Target feature on the basis of Book and Tags. so how can i solve this problem? I can't use OHE because in tags feature i have 100 of different words.This is a demo dataset my original dataset has an shape of (200,3)
