Strange exception on Rails 3 caused by google bot (or something pretending to be a googlebot)

Last night I got an exception on my website caused by a request with agent:googlebot. HomeController# (ActionView::MissingTemplate) "Missing template home/index with {:formats=>[:\"\\\"*/*\\\"\"], :locale=>[:en, :en], :handlers=>[:haml, :rjs, :rhtml, :builder, :rxml, :erb]} in view paths \"/disk1/home/slugs/302902_9453ada_84cd/mnt/app/view I don't understand what it means. It seems like the weird thing is the format. Anyone experienced something similar? Thanks.
