How to limit the number of Installations on a Setup package

I am developing a C# Win Forms application that needs to be installed on a client machine(Windows XP / Windows 7). The problem i have is , i need to limit the number of installations Per Installation package to 2(or some number). Is there any way to achieve this through Install Shield or by any other means? Is embedding the key in the file name , a good practice? Awaiting for the answer. Thanks in Advance, Vijay
