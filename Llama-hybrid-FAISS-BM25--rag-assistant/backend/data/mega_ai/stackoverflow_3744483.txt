If you need the tooltip, then span should be a better choice, since it carries no semantic information. An anchor would usually indicate a link, so if clicking on that price won't lead anywhere, then an anchor isn't appropriate. Almost all HTML elements can carry the title attribute for accessibility reasons, but you shouldn't depend on it for carrying important information since it is dependent on the user agent (ie. browser) on how best to display this information.
