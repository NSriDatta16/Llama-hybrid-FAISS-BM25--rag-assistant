You could base64 encode your image/binary data and store it as a string in localStorage, using base64 urls doesn't work in a few browsers so it's not a perfect solution. CSS and js would be fine, you could write them into the page, or use a base64 url also. I wouldn't worry about doing this breaking the site for non JS users, as is JS is disabled you cant access localStorage anyway.
