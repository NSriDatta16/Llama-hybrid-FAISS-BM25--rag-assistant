Getting the flash object using the DOM

I am embedding a flash video using the SWFObject static publishing option. The code is found at: http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/documentation I am embedding a youTube video and want a javascript function to start playing the video. I have tried using the document.getObjectById and document.getElementById methods. Neither of these are working. I know that there is a Play() method once I get access to the movie object. I have also added to lines of code from the example: Any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks
