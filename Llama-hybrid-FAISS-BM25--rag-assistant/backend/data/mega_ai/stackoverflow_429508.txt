Are there alternative methods for saying 'next' in a pl/sql for loop?

So I've got a for loop that processes a list of IDs and has some fairly complex things to do. Without going into all the ugly details, basically this: DECLARE l_selected APEX_APPLICATION_GLOBAL.VC_ARR2; ...snip... BEGIN -- get the list ids l_selected := APEX_UTIL.STRING_TO_TABLE(:P4_SELECT_LIST); -- process each in a nice loop FOR i IN 1..l_selected.count LOOP -- do some data checking stuff... -- here we will look for duplicate entries, so we can noop if duplicate is found BEGIN SELECT county_id INTO v_dup_check FROM org_county_accountable WHERE organization_id = :P4_ID AND county_id = v_county_id; -- NEXT;! NOOP;! but there is no next! EXCEPTION WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN dbms_output.put_line('no dups found, proceeding'); END; -- here we have code we only want to execute if there are no dupes already IF v_dup_check IS NULL THEN -- if not a duplicate record, proceed... ELSE -- reset duplicate check variable v_dup_check := NULL; END; END LOOP; END; How I normally handle this is by selecting into a value, and then wrap the following code in an IF statement checking to make sure that duplicate check variable is NULL. But it's annoying. I just want to be able to say NEXT; or NOOP; or something. Especially since I already have to catch the NO_DATA_FOUND exception. I suppose I could write a letter to Oracle, but I'm curious how others handle this. I could also wrap this in a function, too, but I was looking for something a little cleaner/simpler.
