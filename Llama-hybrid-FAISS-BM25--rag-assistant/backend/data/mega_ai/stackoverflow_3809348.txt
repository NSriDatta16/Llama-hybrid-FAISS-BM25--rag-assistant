Copying a controller into the app/code/local path doesn't work unfortunately due to Magento's autoload architecture. It does work with Blocks, Models and other objects, but not controllers. There is a detailed walkthrough of how to override a controller on the wiki . And a blog post by @prattski Try following those, then come back with any specific questions. HTH, JD
