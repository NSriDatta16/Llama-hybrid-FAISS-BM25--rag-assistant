It seems that we need to identify points in time where the time series "doesn't fluctuate that much" (I've put it into quotations because the how much depends on how many false positives etc we allow ourselves to have) Furthermore, I see from your model that you fitted and AR(3). Thus, I will take the standard deviation of the last 3 observation for each step. I am open to recommendations here but I just thought that I had to draw the line somewhere and last 3 would make sense as the 4th lag wouldn't correlate with the current one. In R: st_dev And afterwards you can apply a rule that says "if 1 of the standard deviation points is below a threshold (can be identified after the person's average measurements or I guess from other studies) then a small alarm. If two consecutive ones are below that threshold then yellow alarm and if three then red alarm." This is just an idea and an example based on the data you've shared but you can find more generic rules similar to the above idea that would fit the apnea cases.
