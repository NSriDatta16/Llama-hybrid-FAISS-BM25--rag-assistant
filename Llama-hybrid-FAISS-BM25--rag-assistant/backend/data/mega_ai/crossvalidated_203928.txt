Calculating error of MCMC algorithms?

If for example the Transitional MCMC algorithm is used (or does it matter which one?), what are the common approaches for calculating an error (some sort of distance from the actual PDF), or validating that the samples drawn by the MCMC algorithm correspond to the PDF? Maybe my question is wrongly formulated and uses wrong terms. I apologise for that since I am quite new to the area. Thanks in advance!
