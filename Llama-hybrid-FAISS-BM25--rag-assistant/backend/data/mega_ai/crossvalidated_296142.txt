Automatic variable selection for imputation modelling

I have a large data set with 10.000 observations and 1.000 variables. Some of my variables have missings and need to be imputed. R Packages like mice suggest to use all available variables as imputation model. However, with 1.000 variables this is not possible due to computational problems. Since it would be a huge workload and very difficult to select the best predictors manually, my plan is to use automatic variable selection methods such as lasso, elastic net, and/or random forest. The procedure would look like follows: Step 1) Apply automatic selection methods to find an appropriate imputation model for each variable. Step 2) Impute based on these models. For me, this procedure seems to be very intuitive and there is a lot of literature about automatic selection methods available. However, I am struggling to find any research literature about the application of automatic selection in the context of imputation modelling. I am therefore wondering if there are any flaws in my procedure. Question 1: Are there any problems with my suggested procedure? Question 2: Is there any research literature about this topic available?
