Turns out it was the version of Git, not the OS that was the issue. I had installed Git version 1.7.?. The Server was running version 1.6.4. Byt downgrading my client to 1.6.4 I have not had any issues. Thanks for your assistence on this. I still think I will likely go back to ClearCase until there is more support for Git within my organization. As for adymitruk's comment "You just can't beat what Git enables you to do.", that may be true in general, but I have seen little advantage of Git over SVN for my work. Maybe I am just not enough of a Geek. Maybe I am just stupid as Linus say all SVN users are. Thanks again Pat O
