I've used both and IMO I like the Web Site Project better - our company even switched from Web Application to Web Site. It's easier to understand, and compiling everything, all the time, is a big pain. From the answers listed : You prefer dynamic compilation and working on pages without building entire site on each page view? use Web Site project. You prefer single-page code model to code-behind model? use Web Site project. (IE, a little simpler for most to grasp) I don't really see a lot of difference between the two besides the bullets listed (here) , there's not really a gigantic learning curve to be afraid of if you choose the "wrong" one (versus choosing between C#/VB ). When people think about ASP.NET, the terms 'Web Site' and 'Web Application' rarelyrarelyrarely ever come into the conversation, it's kind of one of those configuration things we developers would rather not think about if we can help it.
