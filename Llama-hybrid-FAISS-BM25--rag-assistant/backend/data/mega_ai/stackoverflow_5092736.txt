If WCF is in a MVC application, should it use the controller to access the database to keep 'DRY'

I have an MVC application that accesses SQL and Windows Azure. The logical flow looks like this: Person View Controller.ConvertPersonHere(x) StorageContext.DoDataAction AzurePersonTableEntity ConvertPersonHere is the answer to this Stack Overflow question and it converts the Model entity to the Storage entity public class Person { public string Name {get;set;} public int ID {get;set;} } public class PersonEntity : TableServiceEntity { public string Name {get;set;} public int ID {get;set;} // Code to set PartitionKey // Code to set RowKey } Now that I'm adding WCF to the mix, how should I go about accessing data functions? Assume I have currently have a method to .Save(Person) in the controller and want to Save(Person) from my WCF call. Do I need to abstract out the data actions in the controller?
