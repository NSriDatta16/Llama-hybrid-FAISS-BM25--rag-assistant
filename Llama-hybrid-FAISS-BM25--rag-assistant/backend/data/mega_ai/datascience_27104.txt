Multidimensional regression in Scala

I have a queuing model written in Scala where different categories of people end up a different queues. We have a dataset providing a map of features to the numbers of people ending up at each queue, ie multiple inputs to multiple outputs (continuous values) I have some experience using mllib for single value predictions in Scala but I can't see that multiple outputs are supported. It doesn't even look to me that mllib has continuous value output support as I can't see how to get a layer without an activation function. Does anyone know of an ml library that can both support multidimensional regression (please correct me if I have the terminology wrong) and integrate with Scala? Going forward I'd also love to try an RNN as our data has a time sequence element to it, but I believe this is even rarer in ml libraries.
