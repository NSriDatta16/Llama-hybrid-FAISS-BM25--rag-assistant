How do I use Machine Learning to analyze process statistics of automated test results?

(I am newbieeee in machine learning) At the end of every automated test (Python), I collect a lot of information from our product. The information includes CPU, Memory Usage, Disk Activity, Postfix Queue statistics, and various other stats. I want to come up with a script/tool(Python) that leverages machine learning and automatically analyze the results for me, instead of me looking at the results manually every day. I want to train the tool on what acceptable levels are for various components like CPU, Memory, depending on product's specifications, and various inputs. From what I read online, I think I need to implement supervised classification in my tool, build a model, train it for a few days. But what I don’t know is where to start. When I looked at Supervised learning , I see a bunch of stuff and don’t really know what is really relevant to me. I appreciate if I can get some suggestions on what I need to focus on and how to implement this. All the data can be in memory before my original script completes, or I can get the data from a database to which my original script writes to.
