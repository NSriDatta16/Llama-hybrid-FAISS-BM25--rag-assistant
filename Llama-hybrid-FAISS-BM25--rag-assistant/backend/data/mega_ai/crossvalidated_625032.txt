To add one aspect to the other answers (I'm not discussing the neural networks case in any depth so for that look elsewhere): OLS regression can easily be shown to be affine equivariant. This means that linear operations on the data, including standardising the variables, will produce equivalent solutions; it just doesn't make a difference theoretically. For neural networks it will depend on how exactly they are set up, see other answers. (Dikran Marsupilami in the comments makes the case that for unregularised networks it is possible to initialise them in order to be invariant against standardising.)
