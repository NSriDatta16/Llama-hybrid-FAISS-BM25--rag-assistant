The linear regression model may be written as $$ y_i=x_i'\beta+u_i $$ The reference says In many applications, the error term consists of many miscellaneous factors not captured by the regressors. The Central Limit Theorem suggests that the error term has a normal distribution. So, Hayashi asks why $u_i$ ought to be assumed to be normally distributed. In my understanding, the logic goes as follows: The error term $u_i$ captures all influences on $y_i$ that are not already accounted for by the regressors $x_i$ . Now, you could think of a great many influences that have not been accounted for. Ideally, the important influences have already been included via the regressors, so that $u_i$ captures "unimportant" factors. The CLT roughly says that a suitably scaled average of many small factors behaves like a normal random variables. So, $u_i$ , collecting these factors, would be normally distributed. Personally, I do not find this logic to be too appealing, though. First, we do not need this normality assumption on the errors once we (as does Hayashi later on, see also the second quotation below) resort to asymptotic approximations (as $n\to\infty$ ), which is pretty much all we can do once we leave this fairly restrictive setup of the linear model anyhow. Second, I believe the error term $u_i$ is just the error associated with person/observation $i$ , and there is exactly one error for that observation. To me, it is quite a stretch of the imagination to interpret that single error as the average of infinitely many "sub-errors" that would justify a CLT. (Letting $n\to\infty$ is far more plausible to me, as we can conceivably collect more data, though.) Third (also see below), it is unclear why that logic should be applicable in the practically very relevant case of omitted variables (i.e., important factors being left in the error term). Indeed, in Chapter 2, Hayashi writes However, not very often in economics are the assumptions of the exact distribution satisfied. The finite-sample theory breaks down if one of the following three assumptions is violated: (1) the exogeneity of regressors, (2) the normality of the error term (my emphasis), and (3) the linearity of the regression equation.
