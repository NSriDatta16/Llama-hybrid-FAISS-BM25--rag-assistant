Such problem setting is called batch-mode active learning. Standard active learning setting which only samples single data point per iteration cannot be usually applied to deep-learning. This is mainly because 1) single data point hardly change the network weight 2) training the entire network per each active learning iteration take really long cost. Thus, batch-mode active learning have been studied primarily for image classification. The related paper can be found in Hoi, Steven CH, et al.
