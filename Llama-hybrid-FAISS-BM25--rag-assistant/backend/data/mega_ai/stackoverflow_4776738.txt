I've had an issue like this before, but it wasn't the browser nor the embedding, it was the example code for enabling the webcam (I think this code even came from the Adobe live docs ffs). The issue was that the camera polling already started, before the allow button was pushed. The polling (some augmented reality experiment) was so heavy, that the allow button only registered the click every 1 in 10 times or so. By putting of the camera polling till after the status-event returned with camera.muted == false, I solved my problem. Maybe it's worth a try. Cheers, EP Edit: Code example for the handler var youCam:Camera = Camera.getCamera(); youCam.addEventListener(StatusEvent.STATUS, handleCameraStatus); ... private function handleCameraStatus(e:StatusEvent):void { if (e.code == "Camera.Unmuted") { you_cam.attachCamera(youCam); } else if (e.code == "Camera.Muted") { // display message so the user might try again. } }
