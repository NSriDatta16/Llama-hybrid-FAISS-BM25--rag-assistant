OpenSSO and tomcat

I am new to opensso(openam). I want to protect my webapplications deployed in tomcat using SSO. I have basic questions to clarify. What are the basic software components required to get my work done like tomcat,opensso.war etc... How many policy agents i need to install and in which places. I have gone through the document and i am not able to understand it clearly. Thanks in advance. waiting for your replay.. James
