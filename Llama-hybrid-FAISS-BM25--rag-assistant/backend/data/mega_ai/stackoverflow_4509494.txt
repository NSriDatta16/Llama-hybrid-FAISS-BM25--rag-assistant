imho there are a very few cases when you need to write your on parser / compiler etc. I would do it in a different way. First option would be to run .Net from your C application. You can for instance use Mono for that. Here is a description: http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono The second option would be to use your c class library directly from C# applications. Check http://www.pinvoke.net/ for example on how to declare them.
