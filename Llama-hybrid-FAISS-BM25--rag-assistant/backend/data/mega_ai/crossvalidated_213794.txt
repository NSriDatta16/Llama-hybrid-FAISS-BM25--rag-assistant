Collinearity testing between predictors

I would like to test a collinearity between possible "predictors (risk factors)" for binary outcome (death). Possible "predictors" are categorical (always binary) and continuous... For two continuous (age, weighth, etc.), I can use a bivariate correlation, i.e. Pearson or Spearman, right? How to deal with categorical (binary) vs. categorical (binary)? Would be a Chi-Square-Test or Fischer´s exact test correct? With p-value over 0,05 meaning there is no difference? Or would it be totally incorrect? How to deal with categorical (binary) vs. continuous? E.g., as potential predictors premature birth (binary categorical) and birth weight (continuous) - it´s clear they are somehow correlated with each other (premature birth means almost always lower birth weight). I would like to use binary logistic regression as a final multivariate model ... I am using SPSS 22.0
