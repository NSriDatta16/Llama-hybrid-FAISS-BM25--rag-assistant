Others already answered most of the questions regarding F# in general and about developing usual object-oriented systems in F#. I'll add a few specific things about distributed server-side programming. In F#, you can use agents (aka MailboxProcessor ) to structure your programs. I had a talk about agents at F# user group in London, so you can find some useful resources there. Agents in F# do not automatically support communication via network, but you can implement that (as an agent). They are, however, a great way to structure concurrent applications and also separate concerns. F# supports asynchronous workflows already - this is essential for writing applications that handle large number of clients without blocking threads. If you don't want to wait for C# 5 (which is getting a feature inspired by F#), then F# is the only option for writing asynchronous code. F# has a lively community with large user groups in London, NY and elsewhere. There are quite a few finacnial companies using F# (as far as I know, some are using or thinking about using agents too). Host-tracker.com is a large server-side application written in F# (see their job-posting )
