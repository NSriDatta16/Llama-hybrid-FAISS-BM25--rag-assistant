Get timestamp from base64Binary in PHP

A webservice returns a timestamp field in base64Binary format. It looks like this in SOAP response: AAAAAAMpI9Q= PHP __soapCall, however, b64_decode()s that and I get a binary string looking like ')#â–’'. How do I get actual timestamp out of this? I tried to unpack('L') it but it gives me Array([1] => 0) as a result. Is there really zero i.e. 1970-01-01 or have I missed something?
