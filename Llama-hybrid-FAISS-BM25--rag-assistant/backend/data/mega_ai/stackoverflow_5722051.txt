If you consult the API , using the default constructor (i.e. new JFileChooser() ): Constructs a JFileChooser pointing to the user's default directory. This default depends on the operating system. It is typically the "My Documents" folder on Windows, and the user's home directory on Unix. This would seem to account for always opening to My Documents , but this isn't your problem. In fact, your problem lies with setting the current directory (i.e. setCurrentDirectory(theDirectory) ): Sets the current directory. Passing in null sets the file chooser to point to the user's default directory. This default depends on the operating system. It is typically the "My Documents" folder on Windows, and the user's home directory on Unix. If the file passed in as currentDirectory is not a directory, the parent of the file will be used as the currentDirectory. If the parent is not traversable, then it will walk up the parent tree until it finds a traversable directory, or hits the root of the file system. That being said, I'd pay attention to the highlighted text since it appears that you're setting a file as the current directory and not a directory .
