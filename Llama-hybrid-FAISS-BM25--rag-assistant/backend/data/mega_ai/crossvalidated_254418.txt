The last question is about $z$ scores: My 16 variables come from text mining and they are word counts that describe special topics, which could be aggregated to the bigger supertopic. Do I need to generate $z$ scores before doing PCA/CFA here? All variables are measured in the same way. You might want to check your software's PCA specifics, but I believe they are generally covariance based. If your variables have very different variances this may give the variables with higher variances an unintentional higher "weight" when calculating the component loadings. Calculating z-scores before conducting PCA will standardize that variances to ensure that each variable is weighted equally.
