Optimal language/database/webserver for serving data to mobile devices?

I'm looking for input on what to use for creating web services that my mobile application will consume. I have been programming in Microsoft shops for the past 15 years but I would really like to expand my horizons a little bit. I'm torn between leveraging my Microsoft experience, and picking up something new that all the kids are doing these days. If I'm going to learn something new and use it in a production environment, I would like to get input from coders and not marketing departments. So, can you give me your recommendation for the following technologies, and why you recommend them? Web server Language Database I realize this could be a contentious question, and is very subjective. But I think this is exactly the forum for this question, with its eclectic community. So, keep it professional and constructive.
