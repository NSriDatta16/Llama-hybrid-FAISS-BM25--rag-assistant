Krish, you must make sure your dependent variable is binary (only 0,1 responses) if you want a logistic regression. Moreover it should have an underlying continuous variable with logistic distribution. If your underlying continuous variable is normal, use probit model instead. If your dependent variable is nominal (having more than 2 categories) then use nominal logistic regression, which is just an extension of logistic regression. If your dependent variable is ordinal in nature, use ordinal regression. Remember with all these regressions your interpretation should be based on the reference category (the category compared to which you are interested to make comments). For further reading and interpretation I would suggest you to read 'An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models' (second edition) by Annette J. Dobson. If your goal is only to interpret in general which variables affect your dependent variable, that is, you don't want so many beta coefficients to interpret, you may try categorical regression with optimal scaling. This is available in SPSS (Analyze > Regression > Optimal scaling). It optimally quantifies the binary, nominal, ordinal variables. Then you can get only one beta coefficient for each variable. Additionally it accounts for the possible non-linearity in your data. But I would suggest you to first meet a statistician with your data and check these issues.
