The weights could be almost anything, depending on why someone wanted them added. However, the arithmetic mean of the percentages is not the best method for averaging growth rates. You have 1, 4.5, 5 in successive years and, as you noted, the growth in the first two years is 350% and in the second two years, only 11.1%; again as you noted, the arithmetic mean of these (expressed as proportions) is $\frac{3.5 + .111}{2} = 1.805$. Yet that is not the average growth: $1*1.805*1.805 = 3.205$ but your final value is 5. You could express these as ratios of 4.5 and 1.11, then the average is 2.8. But $2.8*2.8 = 7.84$, again, not 5. What you want is the geometric mean of the ratios: $(4.5*1.11)^{0.5} = 2.23$ and, indeed, $2.23*2.23 = 5$ (except for rounding error). Perhaps the weights were meant to reproduce this?
