In Oracle you can add empty columns to an existing populated table and essentially nothing will happen as a result other than the logical redefinition of the table structure. When you populate those columns though, which might hapen at the time the column is added of course, then the rows have to extend and you may hit a problem with some rows not having enough free space in the blocks that contain them, in which case they will be migrated to a different block with a pointer left in the original location (thus indexes are not affected as they continue to point to the original location). Because of this if you are adding populated columns to a table with rows in it then you might want to rename the original table and perform a "create table as select" to create and populate the new version. Indexes, triggers, privileges etc will of course also have to be migrated. If the table is not too large, however, you could add the populated columns, taking the performance hit due to the row migrations, and then perform a table move to reorganise it.
