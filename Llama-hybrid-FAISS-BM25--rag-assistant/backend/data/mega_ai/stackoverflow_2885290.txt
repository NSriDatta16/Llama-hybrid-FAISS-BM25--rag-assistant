What is the 'moreq' Filter Type an Alias for?

I'm looking in to Magento's filtering options (Ecommerce System and PHP Framekwork with an expansive ORM system). Specifically the addFieldToFilter method. In this method, you specify a SQLish filter by passing in a single element array, with the key indicating the type of filter. For example, array('eq'=>'bar') //eq means equal array('neq'=>'bar') //neq means not equal would each give you a where clause that looks like where field = 'bar'; where field != 'bar'; So, deep in the bowels of the source, I found a comparison type named 'moreq' that maps to a >= comparison operator array('moreq'=>'27') where field >= 27 The weird thing is, there's already a 'gteq' comparision type array('gteq'=>'27') where field >= 27 So, my question is, what does moreq stand for? Is is some special SQL concept that's supported in other databases that the Magento guys wants to map to MySQL, or is it just "more required" and an example what happens when you're doing rapid agile and trying to maintain backwards compatibility.
