Question regarding parameters and variable selection in Mahout algorithm for logistic regression

Below is the list of parameters in Mahout logistic regression. What does "passes" mean? In detail please --passes passes the number of times to pass over the input data What does "features" mean? Is it the number of variables I am taking as predictor? But I see people entering more or less at times for the number of variables. Is there any way of selecting variables with good predictive power in machine learning something like ginie coeffecient? How do we deal with multicollinearity in machine learning? Is it by regularisation? In statistics we remove the variable using variance inflation factor. Is it computed in machine learning? Command: mahout trainlogistic Flag Any argument to flag Description --help print this list --quiet be extra quiet --input input where to get training data --output output where to get training data --target target the name of the target variable --categories number the number of target categories to be considered --predictors p [p ...] a list of predictor variables --types t [t ...] a list of predictor variables types (numeric, word or text) --passes passes the number of times to pass over the input data --lambda lambda the amount of coeffiecient decay to use --rate learningRate the learning rate --noBias do not include a bias term --features numFeatures the number of internal hashed features to use
