Does this function help: // Allows customization of the target row for a particular row as it is being moved/reordered - (NSIndexPath *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView targetIndexPathForMoveFromRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)sourceIndexPath toProposedIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)proposedDestinationIndexPath; It doesn't seem to fire until the cell has been dragged about half way into another cell, though. It is the only indication I could find that a cell is moving.
