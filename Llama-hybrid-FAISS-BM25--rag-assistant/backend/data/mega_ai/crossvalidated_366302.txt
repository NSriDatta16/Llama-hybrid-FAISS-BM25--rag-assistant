You can use Bayesian Optimization (BO) to solve this problem. Since you know that your problem consists of a set of sub-problems, you may additionally exploit that by running individual BO solvers for each interval and allocate more objective function evaluations to the intervals with lower objective function values found so far. You can use Multi-Armed Bandits or approaches for algorithm racing to perform the allocation.
