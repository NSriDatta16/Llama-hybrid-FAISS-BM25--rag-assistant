Move html elements from container to container

I've to divide a text into portions. Text contains only paragraphs ( p tags ) inside . I wanted to insert some divs with id page1...pagen, and distribute the paragraphs inside them. Here is my code, but it is not working properly. Divs are generated before the paragraphs, and the paragraphs aren`t moved inside them. Except the error, is there any more efficient way to do this? var n = 1; $('article').prepend(' &nbsp '); $('#pagecnt').append(' '+n+' ').after(' '); var pargraph = $('p'); for (var i = 0; i '); } } EDIT : this should be the result (basically)
