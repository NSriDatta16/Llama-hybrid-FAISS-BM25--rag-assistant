How can I fit the model “Y(t) = αX + βY(t-1) - βY(t-2)" in R?

I have to make a one-step ahead forecast for a time series Y(t) using R. Theory suggests the ideal model should be: Y(t) = αX + βY$_{t-1}$ - βY$_{t-2}$ However, I don't know how to deal with the following issues: I have to take βY$_{t-1}$ minus βY$_{t-2}$ . There are both autoregressive ( Y$_{t-1}$ , Y$_{t-2}$ ) and exogenous variables ( X ). I have to test whether or not " βY$_{t-1}$ - βY$_{t-2}$ " is the best way to express the autoregression, instead of other ARIMA models. The time series Y(t) in question is: Y The exogenous variable X used is: X I am a beginner. If anything was not clear, let me know and I will give the necessary explanations. Thanks in advance. Edit: It seems that these particular Y and X are not much effective. Nevertheless I am interested in the solution, which can be applied to different values of Y and X .
