I've very often seen arrays used, with the values keyed to terrain/fill types. Here's a -great- tutorial from Tony Pa on flash tile-based game creation: Game Map storage Then the level creator scans through and creates the file. Look on Kongregate for games that allow user-level creation; they store a whole level that's submitted as POST variables when you link to the game. It's a transparent process that is not often encoded, so it's easy to learn from (and there are many game types that do this)
