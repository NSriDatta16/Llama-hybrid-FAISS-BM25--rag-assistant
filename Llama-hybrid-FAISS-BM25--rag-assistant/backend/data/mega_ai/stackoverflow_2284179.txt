Dual neural networks experiment (one logical, one emotional)?

Seeing that as as far as we know, one half of your brain is logical and the other half of your brain is emotional, and that the wants of the emotional side are fed to the logical side in order to fulfill those wants; has there been any research done in connecting two separate neural networks to one another (one trained to be emotional, and one trained to be logical) to see if it would result in almost a free-will sort of "brain"? I don't really know anything about neural networks except that they were modeled after the biological synapses in the human brain, which is why I ask. I'm not even sure if this would be possible considering that even a trained neural network sometimes doesn't act logically (a.k.a. do what you thought you trained it to do).
