"We would prefer to store the file outside of the database" Why ? What is your backup/recovery scenarios for this. For example, in the event of a disk failure, how would you recover the file ? Are the files purely transitory, so you don't actually need to preserve them ? Basically, the BFILE is a compromise between BLOB storage and simply storing a path in the database. You write to it in the same manner as you would a conventional file, then make it 'available' to the database for reading. If your web-app is running on a different physical server from the database, you'd need to have a storage location that is accessible to both boxes (and appropriate permissions for read/write).
