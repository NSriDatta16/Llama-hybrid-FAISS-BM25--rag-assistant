I found a few things that may help: TCP ioctl(2) TCP_NODELAY will cause the kernel to send an immediate PSH packet. It might unstick the connection. TCP ioctl(2) TCP_QUICKACK will do something funny with ACK packets. It might unstick the connection. If you use send(2) you can set the MSG_OOB flag, which might poke the XBox right in the eye, get its attention, and maybe things can start over. CISCO wrote a nice summary of how different platforms respond to TCP URG , and their advice is to avoid using URG, but it's crazy enough it just might work. TCP socket option TCP_CONGESTION lets you select different congestion-avoidance algorithms. Maybe you could find one that helps avoids the filled windows in the first place? (At least TCP Vegas is implemented as a module, it might not be possible to change away from the default congestion avoidance algorithm on the android platform.)
