But I do not understand in which case $E[X]=∑_ix_iP[x_i]$ can be $0$ when all $x$'s are not zero ($0$) You can construct any number of such distributions. e.g. let $Y\sim F_Y$ for some distribution function $F_Y$ with mean $\mu$, in which not all values lie at the mean -- then some will lie above it and some will lie below it. Let $X=Y-\mu$. Then $E(X)=0$. ($\text{Var}(X)$ and indeed all central moments will be unaffected by the shift.) The mass that was below the mean will now lie below 0, and the mass above it will lie above zero. After pondering the question more closely, I wonder if the question here: $E[X]=∑_ix_iP[x_i]$ can be $0$ when all $x$'s are not zero ($0$) is actually "how can the expectation be a value that's not observable"? The answer to that follows directly from the definition of expectation. It's analogous to asking "how can the center of mass of the Pluto-Charon system lie outside either body ?" (The same is true of the earth-moon system.) The center of mass can be in a place where there's no mass at all. It is no more astonishing for probability mass (or probability density) than it is for physical mass. Handwaving aside, the answer eventually falls back to "because it's defined that way". If I take a fair six-sided die, the average outcome is 3.5 even though you can never observe it in a single outcome (and most unfair (loaded) six-sided dice also have unobservable means). There's nothing magical about it - the long term average from many tosses can be a value you can't see in a single toss. Indeed, it's acceptable for it to be a value you can't observe in any finite number of tosses (the expectation can be irrational).
