Automatically pressing a "submit" button using python

The bus company I use runs an awful website ( Hebrew , English ) which making a simple "From A to B timetable today" query a nightmare. I suspect they are trying to encourage the usage of the costly SMS query system. I'm trying to harvest the entire timetable from the site, by submitting the query for every possible point to every possible point, which would sum to about 10k queries. The query result appears in a popup window. I'm quite new to web programming, but familiar with the basic aspects of python. What's the most elegant way to parse the page, select a value fro a drop-down menu, and press "submit" using a script? How do I give the program the contents of the new pop-up as input? Thanks!
