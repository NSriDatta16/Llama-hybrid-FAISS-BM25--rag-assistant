Well, tt looks like C++ doesn't let you use "extern" on anything but objects or functions: from http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc/language/ref/extsc.htm "C++ restricts the use of the extern storage class specifier to the names of objects or functions. Using the extern specifier with type declarations is illegal. An extern declaration cannot appear in class scope." Back to the drawing board...
