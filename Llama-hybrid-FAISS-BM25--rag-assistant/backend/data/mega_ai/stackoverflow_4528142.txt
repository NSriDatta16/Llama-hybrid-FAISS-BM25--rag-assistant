Dynamic Data Template Selecting in Silverlight for wp7?

I have a list of different types of elements. I would like to display a different data template for different list elements, based on what type it is. I have found a bunch of examples of how to do this online, but they look ridiculously complex and error prone. Is there a more elegant way? http://csharperimage.jeremylikness.com/2010/11/silverlight-data-template-selector.html http://dotnet-redzone.blogspot.com/2010/05/datatemplate-selector-with-silverlight.html http://blog.geeky.cc/post/2009/09/11/Silverlight-DataTemplateSelector.aspx I'm developing for Windows Phone 7.
