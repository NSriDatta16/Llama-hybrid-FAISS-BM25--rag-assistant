(?s:\s+as\s+(?!.{0,150}==\s*null\b)) I'm activating the SingleLine option with ?s: . You can put it in the options of your Regex if you want. I'll add that I'm putting \s around as because I think that only spaces are "legal" around the as . You can probably put the \b like (?s:\b+as\b(?!.{0,150}==\s*null\b)) Be aware that \s will probably catch spaces that aren't "valid spaces". It's defined as [\f\n\r\t\v\x85\p{Z}] where \p{Z} is Unicode Characters in the 'Separator, Space' Category plus Unicode Characters in the 'Separator, Line' Category plus Unicode Characters in the 'Separator, Paragraph' Category .
