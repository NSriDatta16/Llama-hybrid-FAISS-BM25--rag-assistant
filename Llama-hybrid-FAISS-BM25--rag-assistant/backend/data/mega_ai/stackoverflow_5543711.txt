You could use a HeaderedItemsControl and swap out the Panel to suit your needs; by default it uses a StackPanel however a WrapPanel may suit you better. The pop out and mouse over behavior do not exist by default and would need to be implemented. A more robust approach would be to leverage a custom Expander ; as it provides the pop out behavior you are after and the linked to walkthrough provides the mouse over behavior.
