Unless your data is known to have special properties, pure interpolation search has the risk of taking linear time. If you expect interpolation to help with most data but don't want it to hurt in the case of pathological data, I would use a (possibly weighted) average of the interpolated guess and the midpoint, ensuring a logarithmic bound on the run time.
