Running a background Java program in Tomcat

Can anyone advise here? I have a situation where users will submit data mining requests interactively via a Java JSP and servlet to an application of mine which will dynamically work out association rules on data and more. As such a job may take a while, I'm thinking of some sort of process on the server to run such a request in the background so it dosen't 'lock' the session and possibly use massive amounts of server memory to the detriment of the system. As the system is made up of a series of Java JSPs and servlets running in a Tomcat container over a MySQL database, can anyone advise a way forward? Thanks Mr Morgan
