The C++98 standard says in section 3.6.1 paragraph 2 An implementation shall not predefine the main function. This function shall not be overloaded. It shall have a return type of type int , but otherwise its type is implementation-defined. All implementations shall allow both the following definitions of main : int main() and int main(int argc, char* argv[]) So it's not mandated by the standard that the env accepting main is acceptable but it is permissible. Because this is referred to often, here is the previous paragraph exempting freestanding environments from anything but documenting their behavior: A program shall contain a global function called main, which is the designated start of the program. It is implementation defined whether a program in a freestanding environment is required to define a main function. [Note: in a freestanding environment, startup and termination is implementation defined; startup contains the execution of constructors for objects of namespace scope with static storage duration; termination contains the execution of destructors for objects with static storage duration. ]
