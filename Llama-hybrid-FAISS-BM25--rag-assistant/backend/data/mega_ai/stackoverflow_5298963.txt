ListBoxDragDropTarget set Target

I want to allow a target for a ListBoxDragDropTarget ListBox. The problem is that I have four ListBox but each pair can do a drop on another one, but no on the another one, I mean, 1 can drop on 2, 3 can drop on 4, but 3 can't drop on 2 or 1. How can I do this? help!
