In the paragraph starting with "In discrete survival one considers...," the $i$ values don't necessarily index individuals.* They index groups of individuals (also called "subpopulations") all of whom have the same set of covariate values; group $i$ has $n_i$ individuals sharing a set of covariate values $x_i$ (evidently constant over time in this situation) and there are $N$ such groups in total. What they call "responses" are perhaps more commonly called "events." So, of the $n_i$ individuals sharing covariate values $x_i$ , $T_{is}$ is the number having the event during time period $s$ . The probability model is fit by combining information across all groups and their associated covariate values. A $p_{it}$ value is the observed fraction of individuals in group/subpopulation $i$ who had the event during time period $t$ , while the corresponding $\hat\pi_{it}$ value is the proportion estimated by the model. *I think that the first sentence of Section 4.2.1 uses different symbol meanings than in what follows. I share your sense that $q$ in the first sentence is equivalent to $k$ later on. Furthermore, $T$ in that sentence represents time (versus event counts later on) and $i$ in that sentence is the index for times (versus for "groups/subpopulations" later on).
