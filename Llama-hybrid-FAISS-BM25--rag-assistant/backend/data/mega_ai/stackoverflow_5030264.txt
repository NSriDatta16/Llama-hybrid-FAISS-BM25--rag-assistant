I'm somewhat confused. You say you are using a Java EE application in Tomcat? I don't understand, Tomcat is just a web container, not a Java EE server? A compliant Java EE server will allow for weaving of managed JPA Entities during deployment, but Tomcat is not a Java EE server. I'm not sure starting Tomcat using -javaagent will work with the way that Tomcat loads classes. I think you must use static weaving with Tomcat, or perhaps use Spring. Not sure how you have some classes working? Are you sure they are being dynamically weaved? Probably is related to how Tomcat is loading the classes, are they deployed in the same way?
