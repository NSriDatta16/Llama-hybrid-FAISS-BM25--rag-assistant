Representing the architecture of a deep CNN

Suppose I am feeding a $60\times60$ RGB image as the input to deep CNN with the first layer created using the following Keras code model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), input_shape=(60, 60, 3))) . Will 64 filters be created for each channel (red, green and blue) of the image? Is the following representation of the network correct? If 64 filters are created for each channel, then should I write "3X64@58X58"?
