Ok well I figured it out. I am guessing its also a bug in Blend 4. In VS 2010 my Window visibility was initially hidden, this is because I have a custom splash screen which first loads, then sets the visibility to true. So design mode imo of Blend should not pay attention to the Windows visibility property, this is a run time property really. Setting the visibility to true of the form / window. and the results are better.
