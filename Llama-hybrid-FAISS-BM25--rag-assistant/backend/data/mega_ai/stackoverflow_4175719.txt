I've been learning rails and loving it. The pain point with it is the documentation - version 3 of rails has just come out, and not all of the documentation you will come across will be up to date. However, you can pretty easily get by. That said, I'm loving it. Ruby is a very elegant language. You can get a feel for rails by reading through this guide: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
