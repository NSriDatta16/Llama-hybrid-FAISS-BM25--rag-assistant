While XGBoost can give probabilities, watch out for saying that you want to use those probabilities over those of a logistic regression that has lower classification accuracy. Accuracy is calculated for just one threshold (typically $0.5$ , which might be wildly inappropriate for your task), while the predicted probabilities are independent of the threshold. The XGBoost might be worse than the logistic regression at estimating probabilities despite being better in terms of classification accuracy at one threshold. Most models return probabilities or some kind of score that is on a continuum (not just the category) that can be transformed into a probability. Explicitly addressing the models you mentioned: Support vector classifiers can be wrestled with to give probabilities. Platt scaling is a topic you might want to learn more about for this. K-nearest neighbors can be considered to give probabilities if you take the probability as the proportion of each class represented among the neighbors. Linear discriminant analysis seems to have a probabilistic flavor, as is discussed by Ioffe (2006). Watch out for the fact that models can give probabilities that might lead to accurate models at a particular threshold but might not reflect the true probability of event occurrence (e.g., probabilities estimated at $0.9$ , yet the event only happens $65\%$ fo the time). Such models can have their outputs calibrated, but it is not a given that this can be done. Even if it can be done, it is important to know that this might be a necessary step. The rms package in R software gives the ability to check for probability calibration. library(rms) set.seed(2023) N Ideally, the calibration curve will equal the line $y=x$ , since we want the probability of event occurrence to equal the predicted probability. Since the calibration curve is close to the $y=x$ line, the calibration seems to be pretty good. REFERENCE Ioffe, Sergey. "Probabilistic linear discriminant analysis."
