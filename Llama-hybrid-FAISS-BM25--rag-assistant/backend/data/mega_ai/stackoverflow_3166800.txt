You are right in the second case. In your first case I'm guessing you mean that if a user clicks multiple controls on your page then the event handlers are seeing that the dictionary is null (instead of having the result from the previous event handler). Remember that every request on a page (even from the same user) creates a new instance of your page class. That means that each time a request starts, your dictionary will be null. The only way for a variable to maintain its value between subsequent requests is to persist it server-side (for example, in user-specific session information on the server) or to push it to the client with the page content so that it can be part of the subsequent request data (so it's stored in ViewState or other storage at the client's browser between requests).
