How should I interpret the case where elasticnet gives zero features

I am using elasticnet for the purpose of determining feature importance. In case it is relevant, this is a high-dimensionality model with $n\ll p$ . I have seen cases before where Lasso, i.e. logistic regression with Lasso regularization, gives the best fit to the model with no features (intercept only). However, elasticnet with a suitable $0 does have some features in the optimized model. If I am not mistaken, this indicates a statistically significant linear correlation between the features and the outcome. Now I have model where elasticnet always has 0 features (except in the degenerate case of Ridge Regression). Does this mean there is no statistically significant linear relation between the features and the outcome?
