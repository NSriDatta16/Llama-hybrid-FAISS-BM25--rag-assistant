I would go for the distance and then use a linear model to describe this score. The other option would be a logistic regression approach, but if you have mostly "failures" as you point out in the comments, this will not be very informative. The only drawback with the distance is that it is not well behaved in terms of distribution. It is certainly not Gaussian, and probably the variance will change with the different conditions (example: right hand versus left hand). So you might already think of a transform to regularize it, perhaps the log of the inverse distance or something like this.
