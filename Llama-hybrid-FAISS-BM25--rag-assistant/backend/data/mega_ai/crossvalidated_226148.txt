How to interpret xtologit output?

so for my research project I am investigating effect a blood pressure diagnosis has on alcohol consumption frequency and physical activity. I have constructed 2 different models for both and I will be using xtologit command as I have panel data. Please see my output below. My DV is alcohol_freq which is an ordinal variable of 4, which measures days per week the individual drinks. (0-1 1-2- 2 3-5 -3 6-7 -4). My independent variables are gender (1 is female), net financial wealth, education level, waves( 3 4 5 6) (baseline wave is 2). . xtologit alcohol_freq ragender i.wave i.wealth_group i.raeduc_e if r2hibps==1, vce(robust) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Robust alcohol_freq | Coef.

However I am confused by the positive coefficients for wealth group, education. Does this mean having a higher net wealth would increase frequency of drinking per week over the study? Or I am interpreting this wrong? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
