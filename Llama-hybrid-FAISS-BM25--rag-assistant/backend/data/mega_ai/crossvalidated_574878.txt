Multinomial logistic regression can and often does consider out-of-sample performance. For instance, LeCun (1998) applied multinomial logistic regression to the pixels of the MNIST handwritten digits, achieving an accuracy of $88\%$ on the test set. As is discussed on the blog of our Demetri Pananos , biostatistics has a different take on model validation than out-of-sample performance, preferring to use bootstrap-based approaches, but that is not unique to models of discrete outcomes ("classification"), and there is an interesting debate about out-of-sample performance vs bootstrap (linked in the blog).
