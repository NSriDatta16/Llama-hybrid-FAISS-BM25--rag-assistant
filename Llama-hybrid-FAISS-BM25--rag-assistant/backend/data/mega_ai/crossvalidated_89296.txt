I agree with @PeterFlom that the example is odd, but setting that aside, I notice that the explanatory variable is categorical. If that is consistently true, it simplifies this greatly. I would use mosaic plots to present these effects. A mosaic plot displays conditional proportions vertically, but the width of each category is scaled relative to its marginal (i.e., unconditional) proportion in the sample. Here is an example with the data from the Titanic disaster, created using R: data(Titanic) sex.table = margin.table(Titanic, margin=c(2,4)) class.table = margin.table(Titanic, margin=c(1,4)) round(prop.table(t(sex.table), margin=2), digits=3) # Sex # Survived Male Female # No 0.788 0.268 # Yes 0.212 0.732 round(prop.table(t(class.table), margin=2), digits=3) # Class # Survived 1st 2nd 3rd Crew # No 0.375 0.586 0.748 0.760 # Yes 0.625 0.414 0.252 0.240 windows(height=3, width=6) par(mai=c(.5,.4,.1,0), mfrow=c(1,2)) mosaicplot(sex.table, main="") mosaicplot(class.table, main="") On the left, we see that women were much more likely to survive, but men accounted for perhaps about 80% of the people on board. So increasing the percentage of male survivors would have meant many more lives saved than even a larger increase in the percentage of female survivors. This is somewhat analogous to your example. There is another example on the right where the crew and steerage made up the largest proportion of people, but had the lowest probability of surviving. (For what it's worth, this isn't a full analysis of these data, because class and sex were also non-independent on the Titanic, but it is enough to illustrate the ideas for this question.)
