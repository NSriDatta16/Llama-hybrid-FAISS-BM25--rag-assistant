How can I tell when .Net System.Diagnostics.Process ran successfully or failed?

I'm writing a scheduler or sorts. It's basically a table with a list of exes (like "C:\a.exe") and a console app that looks at the records in the table every minute or so and runs the tasks that haven't been run yet. I run the tasks like this: System.Diagnostics.Process p = new System.Diagnostics.Process(); p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false; p.StartInfo.FileName = someExe; // like "a.exe" p.Start(); How can I tell if a particular task failed? For example what if a.exe throws an unhandled exception? I'd like the above code to know when this happens and update the tasks table with something like "the particular task failed" etc. How can I do this? I'm not using the Sql Agent or the Windows Scheduler because someone else told me not to. He has more "experience" so I'm basically just following orders. Feel free to suggest alternatives.
