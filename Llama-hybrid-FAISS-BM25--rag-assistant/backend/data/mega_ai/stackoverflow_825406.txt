Yes. Do throw unchecked exceptions, and subclass them. There is much talk about whether checked exceptions are really any good. In a nutshell, if I throw a checked exception, does my client really have anything to do with it? Unchecked exceptions are a good way to notify your clients about exceptional situations (including illegal pre-conditions), and yet not burdening them with the need to wrap calls to your API with try-catch blocks, which most of the time basically serve no purpose, other than debugging, tracing, etc. So why not throw a RuntimeException ? It's not elegant , and it's less readable . Make it your own exception which derives from it, even if it's for no reason other than being more specific when throwing the exception.
