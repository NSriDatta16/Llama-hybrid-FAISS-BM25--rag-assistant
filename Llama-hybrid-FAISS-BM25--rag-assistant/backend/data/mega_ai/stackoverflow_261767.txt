It sounds like you are looking for a complicated solution to a problem ehcache solves out-of-the-box. You only need one cache manager. Configure it to flush once a minute. If need be, do this by creating a thread that flushes the cache once a minute. When you try to retrieve something from the cache and it is not there load the data again. Put this cache retrieval bit in a synchronized method or block if you want to be sure that the populating the cache blocks progress.
