Tool or methods for automatically creating contextual links within a large corpus of content?

Here's the basic scenario - I have a corpus of say 100,000 newspaper-like articles. Minimally they will all have a well-defined title, and some amount of body content. What I want to do is find runs of text in articles that ought to link to other articles. So, if article Foo has a run of text like "Students in 8th grade are being encouraged to read works by John-Paul Sartre" and article Bar is titled (and about) "The important works of John-Paul Sartre", I'd like to automagically create that HTML link from Foo to Bar within the text of Foo.
