I would say it totally depends on the application and how you're working with it. If you are working on different branches, you could checkout the whole repository to easily commit to each of them. If you have only read access, you should only check out the branch you're interested in (otherwise it doesn't harm except some megabytes). You could ask other guys working with the same project, how they organize their environment. E.g. for TYPO3 CMS you can point symlinks to the source folder and thus easily check out the whole repository. With other applications, this is not possible, for sure.
