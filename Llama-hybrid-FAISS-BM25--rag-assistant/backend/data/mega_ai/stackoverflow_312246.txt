Is there a way for your database server to use UTF-8 as an encoding? You then get the benefits of low storage for mostly ASCII loads, and the ability to store anything in the range of Unicode so that expansion is possible. I would ask your database vendor to support UTF-8 as an encoding for the VARCHAR SQL type, as well. I don't know how other DB servers do it, but I do know that you can use UTF-8 in VARCHAR and TEXT fields in at least MySQL and PostgreSQL. All that having been said though, the only reason to not use a UTF-16 encoded field is if you have to interact with applications which will break on UTF-16 input. This would be most legacy applications which were designed to handle ASCII or ISO-8815 text encodings, which would be better off processing UTF-8.
