Exclude System.Diagnostics.Contracts When Using PartCover

I am trying out the .net Code Contracts fro .net 3.5 I have some unit test that I am running PartCover over to calculate the code coverage. PartCover keeps including the System.Diagnostics.Contracts in my report. Here are the rules I am using to include MyProject and exclude everything else. +[MyProject.DomainModel]* -[System]* -[System.Diagnostics]* -[System.Diagnostics.Contracts]* Any suggestions?
