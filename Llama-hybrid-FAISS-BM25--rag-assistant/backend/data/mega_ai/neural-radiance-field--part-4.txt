. Robotics and autonomy The unique ability of NeRFs to understand transparent and reflective objects makes them useful for robots interacting in such environments. The use of NeRF allowed a robot arm to precisely manipulate a transparent wine glass; a task where traditional computer vision would struggle. NeRFs can also generate photorealistic human faces, making them valuable tools for human-computer interaction. Traditionally rendered faces can be uncanny, while other neural methods are too slow to run in real-time. == References ==
