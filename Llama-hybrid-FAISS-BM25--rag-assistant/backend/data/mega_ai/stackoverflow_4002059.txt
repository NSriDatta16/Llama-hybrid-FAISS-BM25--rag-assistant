Get DOM elements inside a rectangle area of a page

Given two points on a webpage and a set of DOM elements, how to find out the subset of those DOM elements that sit inside the rectangle area defined by the two points? I am working on a web-based gallery, in which every photo is wrapped in a li tag. When a user drag out a rectangle area with mouse, all li elements inside the rectangle are marked as selected. Prefer a jQuery solution for less wordy and an efficient way.
