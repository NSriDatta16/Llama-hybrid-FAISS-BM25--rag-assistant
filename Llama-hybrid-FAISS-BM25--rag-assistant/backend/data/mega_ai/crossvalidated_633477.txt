When the number of variables is large, relative to the number of observations, lots of problems can happen. PCA reduces the number of variables, while losing as little information as possible. Why do this? One example is principal components regression. If you have (say) one dependent variable and 50 indpendent variables on 100 observations, attempts to fit a regression will be overfit. You can take the PCs of the 50 variables and use the first few. Another is for graphing. If we want to locate the observations in some sort of space, then visualizing a 2 or 3 dimensional space is much easier than one with many dimensions. Yet another might be finding multivariate outliers. This is a notoriously hard problem when there are a lot of dimensions. PCA might let you locate some potential outliers to look at more closely. See this thread . There are surely other uses as well.
