nginx + spawn-fcgi + fcgi application written in C + memcached + sqlite serves for similar task well, latency is about 20-30 ms for small data and fast connections from the same local network. As far as I know production server handles about 100-150 requests per second with no problem. On test server I peaked up to 20k requests per second, again with no problem, average latency were about 60 ms. Aggressive caching and UNIX domain sockets is the key. Do not know how that configuration will behave on frequent PUT requests, in our task they are very rare and typically batched.
