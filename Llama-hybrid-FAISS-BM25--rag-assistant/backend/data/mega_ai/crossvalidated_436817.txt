Sampling prior covariance matrices - nested sampling

I am trying to fit a multivariate Gaussian with a non-diagonal covariance matrix $\Sigma$ using nested sampling . Usually, in other Bayesian analyses, we would use a Inverse Wishart or LKJ prior on the covariance matrix and compute the posterior using the analytical form of the prior. However, in nested sampling , we cannot do this. We must specify the prior in terms of a transform from uniform uncorrelated samples. For instance, for a 1d normal prior, the prior transform would be the percent point function of the normal (the inverse of the CDF). norm.ppf(uniform_samples) gives you samples from the prior. Unless I am mistaken, there is no function to transform uniform samples into a Wishart or LKJ prior. Is there a better prior for covariance matrices that has a usable transform? Or is there a technqiue to estimate these transforms? Using a uniform prior on covariance matrix elements seems foolish. Thanks
