Lets restrict attention to $ARMA(1,1)$ processes for the moment. I.e., we consider a process \begin{align} y_t - ay_{t-1} = y_t(1-aL) = e_t(1-bL) = e_t - be_{t-1} \end{align} Where $e_t\overset{iid}{\sim}WN(0,\sigma^2)$ and $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$. Here, $WN$ means 'White noise', i.e. we leave the distribution unspecified, but the first two moments are assumed to exist. Consider first the invertibility of the lag polynomial $(1-aL)$. What does invertibility mean? Simply that there exists a lag polynomial - say $A(L,a)$ - such that $(1-aL)A(L,a)=1$. Define now $A(L,a) := \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}a^iL^i$. Observe that \begin{align} (1-aL)A(L,a) &= (1-aL)(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}a^iL^i) \\ (1-aL)A(L,a) &= (1-aL)(1+aL+a^2L^2 + \dots) \\ (1-aL)A(L,a) &= 1 + (aL-aL) + (a^2L^2 - a^2L^2) + \dots \\ (1-aL)A(L,a) &= 1 \end{align} from which it follows that $A(L,a) = (1-aL)^{-1}$ (i.e., the inverse of $(1-aL)$, implying invertibility). Similarly, one can show that $A(L,b) = (1-bL)^{-1}$. More generally, for a first order lag polynomial $(1-\delta L)$, $A(L, \delta)$ will always be the inverse. From this, you can infer that you may indeed write the above $ARMA(1,1)$ model either as $AR(\infty)$ representation ($y_t(1-aL)A(L,b) = e_t$) or as $MA(\infty)$ representation ($y_t = e_t(1-bL)A(L,a)$). Crucially, this was linked to the invertibility of any first order lag polynomial. for $ARMA(p,q)$, one cannot in general say that one could always write them in $AR(\infty)$ or $MA(\infty)$ representation. If you are interested in higher order $ARMA(p,q)$, Wold's Representation Theorem might be interesting for you: Roughly speaking, it says that any stationary process (which includes stationary $ARMA(p,q)$ processes) can be written in a $MA(\infty)$ form.
