An RBM is a graphical model with unobserved latent variables, making the marginal distribution intractable. A typical neural network is not a graphical model. It does not have any unobserved latent variables. Sometimes, a hidden layer in the network is referred to as the "latent space", but nonetheless it is a deterministic function of the input without any real probabilistic interpretation. Therefore, there are no unobserved variables which need to be integrated over, and no partition function. Whereas RBM is a generative model which directly models the distribution of the data $p(x)$, most neural networks are used in a discriminative fashion and model $p(y|x)$, so they are not really comparable. When neural networks are used for modeling $p(x)$, it is usually as a product of conditionals $p(\mathbf x) = p(x_0)\prod p(x_i|x_{
