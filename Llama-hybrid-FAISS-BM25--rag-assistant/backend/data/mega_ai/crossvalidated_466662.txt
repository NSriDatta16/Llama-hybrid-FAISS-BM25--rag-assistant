Yeo-Johnson does not increase normality

I have used Box-Cox Yeo-Johnson transformation to make my skewed data columns less skewed and more normal so that I can remove outliers. e.g. originally most of my columns have a 'skewness' of 400! After applying Box Cox they reduce to -36.965404. This is a huge difference and is still somewhat skewed. I then apply quantile based method to remove outliers (by column) and a lot of the data is removed (50%) so this method doesn't seem appropriate. def remove_outlier_by_Col(df,col,low_q,hi_q): low = low_q high = hi_q quant_df = df.quantile([low, high]) df = df[(df[col] > quant_df.loc[low, col]) & (df[col] I am doing this to minimize the effect the 'outliers' have on xgboost but I am having trouble deciding how to treat these outliers when my distribution is heavily skewed. I have thought about simply Winsorizing, but is this appropriate when data is skewed? Can somebody please advise what is best thing to do in this situation!
