Getting dynamically created tags (jQuery) from ASP.NET

I have web page in ASP.NET. I have created Tree View control with jQuery. I drag items from the tree and drop into the div element. I add items to that div using .append function from jQuery. $(".droppable").append(event.originalTarget.innerHTML); It works like I want. But now I want to get all dropped items from ASP.NET code. I use following code: protected void Button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { HtmlGenericControl control = (HtmlGenericControl)Page.FindControl("rows"); Label1.Text = control.InnerHtml; } But it doesn't work. I've also tried InnerText function, but still nothing. I've also put the button and label controls into UpdatePanel so the page doesn't refresh and my dropped item are still in div element. How can I get dynamically added items from ASP.NET code. Lukas
