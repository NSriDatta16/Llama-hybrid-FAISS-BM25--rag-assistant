Most of the Grid world examples given in RL books uses a reward of -1 for every step until it reaches the terminal state. This encourages the algorithm to reach the terminal state in as few steps as possible. So for every legal action you can give a reward of -1, and to avoid illegal actions in a state you give a reward of something like -10 or so. Since you said each episode might have around 25 steps, increase the win reward to more than 25, say 50 for the algorithm to understand that winning is more important since it gives more reward.
