This is Exploratary analysis: Feature selection and Training model: Applying Random forest classifier algorithm: Evaluating the best model on test data: Interpret the model results: ValueError: X has 54 features, but DecisionTreeClassifier is expecting 53 features as input. My Attempt: I tried to use from sklearn import * but it is not working. I also tried to drop columns from pred_set but not working. Can you please hint me what should fix here in order to Interpret the model results !?
