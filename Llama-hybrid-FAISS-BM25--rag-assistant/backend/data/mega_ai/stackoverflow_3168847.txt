C# versus Java?

So I'm a decent C# programmer and I love this language but ever since my only PC died on me all I have left is my Mac Book Pro and my dads PC which he uses for work. He allows me use it but since he needs it for work the times I can works on my projects are significantly cut down. So im considering learning Java since its almost the same as C# but is cross platform... Does Java have an IDE that has a winforms alternative (drag-n-drop GUI builder)? Should I just suck it up and stick with C# since its a supirior language? Does Java have the ability to program on something cool like how C# has XNA for xbox? What looks better on a resume? Ultimately what is a superior language? -Thanks all!
