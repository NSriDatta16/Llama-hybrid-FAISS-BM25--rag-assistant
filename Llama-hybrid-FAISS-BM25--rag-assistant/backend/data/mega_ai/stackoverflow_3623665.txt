Flex fails to pass parameters to httpservice php script

I am sending two parameters to a php script. The php script works fine if I use the browser to run the script and pass parameters to it like http://www.somewebsite.com/runScript.php?id=aaa&name=bbb . But when I use the Flex httpservice, the parameters are not passed to the script. {userId} {username} I checked the Network Monitor and the parameters are being sent: POST /runScript.php HTTP/1.1 Referer: app:/AIMTSJC.swf Accept: text/xml, application/xml, application/xhtml+xml, text/html;q=0.9, text/plain;q=0.8, text/css, image/png, image/jpeg, image/gif;q=0.8, application/x-shockwave-flash, video/mp4;q=0.9, flv-application/octet-stream;q=0.8, video/x-flv;q=0.7, audio/mp4, application/futuresplash, / ;q=0.5 x-flash-version: 10,1,53,64 Content-Type: application/xml Content-Length: 33 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; en-US) AppleWebKit/531.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) AdobeAIR/2.0.2 Host: www.somewebsite.com aaabbb Returned response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Thu, 02 Sep 2010 02:58:54 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.11 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.11 OpenSSL/0.9.7d PHP/5.2.8 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.10 Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=pa81b900ddff7c0b61c44c3380g3590fb; path=/ Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html id: name: My php script: // Get the id and name. $uid= $_GET["id"]; $uname= $_GET["name"]; echo "uid: ".$uid; echo "uname: ".$uname; I form a query and send to the database. The query is successful when I type the http://... as mentioned above on the browser URL. Both the uid and uname got the correct parameters. But when I run the httpservice, both uid and uname has no parameters, and the query fails. Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance, aobs
