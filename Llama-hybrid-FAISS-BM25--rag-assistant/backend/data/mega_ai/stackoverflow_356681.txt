I ran into a similar limitation with DataTriggers, and it would seem that you can only check for equality. The closest thing I've seen that might help you is a technique for doing other types of comparisons other than equality. This blog post describes how to do comparisons such as LT, GT, etc in a DataTrigger. This limitation of the DataTrigger can be worked around to some extent by using a Converter to massage the data into a special value you can then compare against, as suggested in Robert Macnee's answer.
