Yes it's possible and very extended, this kind of attacks are called Session fixation and in your system (as David said) anyone who sniff your traffic, or have access to the user's drive and steal his cookies, may supplant a logged user. The best protection is, of course, SSL, but if you can't use it in your website there are other things that can prevent (but not fully protect against) this attacks: Save info about the user in the server-side when he login, good candidates for this are the IP and the user agent , but any other data that don't change in the entire session can be valid. You can regenerate the session ID in every request, with this if the session ID is leaked the attacker must use it before the real user do any other request, but beware because every time the session ID is regenerated (in PHP at least) the user's session data is rewited , so this can be expensive if you have a lot of users or if you save many data of every user (this means that, if you're saving the session data in a file, the file will be deleted, created, and writed again). Well, right now I can only think in these two, it's not much but at least you will put an extra complication to the attackers. One more thing, don't trust the user's cookies, they can be changed by the user (or the attacker) at any time, treat it like any other user input. PD.: Sorry for my horrible english, I'm truly trying to improve it ^_^
