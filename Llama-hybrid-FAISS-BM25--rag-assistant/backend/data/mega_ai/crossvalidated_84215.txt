1) Regarding the question from letter (a), my understanding is that for either B1 or B2, they can be estimated by averaging the weights (for example, for B1 it would be adding the weights from y1, y3 and y4). Is this assumption valid? Rather than guess, you should work it out, exactly as suggested in the question. Then you'll know for sure. 2) Can I also assume that y3 is found by simply adding y1 and y2? No, because they have different errors; $e_3 \neq e_1+e_2$ I didn't think I could, because the readings would probably be different and thus have different residuals. Correct, except its that the errors differ, not the residuals, that's the main issue. 3) Does the 'y' in the formula correspond with the estimated column vector containing predicted B1 and B2? No. It is the vector of observed scale readings for the 4 set-ups
