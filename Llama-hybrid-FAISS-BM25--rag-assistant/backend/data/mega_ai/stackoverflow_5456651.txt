Arranging/Organizing my classes/interfaces into folders? Not changing namespace with folder (Resharper: Namespace Provider = false)

I currently have a project and its increasing in size everyday. Its a container for an api i am providing. I currently have in the root all my classes and all interfaces. I have separated my Enums, Contants, etc into their own folders but i don't inherit the folder as part of the namespace they are just containers to keep them tidy. I was wondering if anybody has any experience here? Should i separate my interfaces into their own folder too (not inheriting the folder as part of namespace) Should i separate my classes also? I also have classes that are children of other classes .. ie a class implements it as a property. Hence it would never be instantiated outside. So should I separate them even further and put (for example) a folder called "Products" and inside this folder i would have my Product class and then my item class and other classes that are specific to Product? Again, using the folder as a means of separating and not inheriting the folder name as part of the namespace. I would love to hear some feedback. Thanks
