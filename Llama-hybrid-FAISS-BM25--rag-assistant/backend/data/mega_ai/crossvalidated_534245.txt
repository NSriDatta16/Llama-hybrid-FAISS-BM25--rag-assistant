Skewness of the sum of dependent variables

I have two random variables $X$ and $Y$ which are both time series of observations. The two series are not independent. I want to find the skewness, kurtosis, hyper-skewness and hyper-kurtosis of $X+Y$ and $X-Y$ . I have no information about the distribution of $X$ and $Y$ , except that $X,Y > 0$ and it is reasonable to assume they have exponential tails and finite variance. Just to confirm this is not in relation to coursework or examination question!
