How to iterate the irregularly-named children of an Xml.XmlElement in Powershell?

I have an XML file of the following format: ... If I fetch that data in Powershell, I can see all the child elements of data with a Get-Memeber: > $xmlData = [xml](Get-Content myfile.xml) > $xmlData.data | Get-Member ... foo Property System.Xml.XmlElement ... bar Property System.Xml.XmlElement ... tribble Property System.Xml.XmlElement ... ... And I can access each child element individually. But how would I iterate over all the children, processing them with pipes? I'd love to be able to write something like this: > $xmlData.data.Children | ?{$_ -eq "foo"} ...But alas that's just wishful thinking. EDIT: Ok so I can reflect on the properties like this: > $xmlData.data | get-member -memberType Property | ?{$_.Name -eq "foo"} But I can't then go from the property (above I'm operating on a MemberDefinition) to the actual child element. Or can I?
