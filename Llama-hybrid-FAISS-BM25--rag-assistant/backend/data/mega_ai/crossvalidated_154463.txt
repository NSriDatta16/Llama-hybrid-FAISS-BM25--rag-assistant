What is the terminology for data aggregated via summed totals versus data aggregated via means?

The two types of data differ in that if you decide to decrease the temporal (time) resolution of the first type of data you take the mean of lower the resolutions. With the second you take the sum over the lower resolutions. Here is a concrete example Gas Used (kWh), Outside Air Temperature (C), Time Resolution (Minutes) 100, 20, 20 140, 22, 20 120, 21, 20 Here the hourly (60 Minute) resolution data is clearly 360, 21, 60 and is found by averaging the temperature and summing up the gas used. What I really wish to know is what the names for each of these types of data are called. I understand that this question is not the best but it is hard to ask a question about something whose names you do not know. If you have a better way of articulating the question then please go ahead and edit it.
