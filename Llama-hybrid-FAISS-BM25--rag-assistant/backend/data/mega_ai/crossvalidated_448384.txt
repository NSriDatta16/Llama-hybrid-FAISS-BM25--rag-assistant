I learned from the blog that if $P(X_i|Y_j)$ is a Gaussian distribution it can be written as a Gaussian function and hence the denominator and the numerator are all Gaussian functions, thereby the fraction $ \sum_i \log \frac{p(x_i \mid y = 1)}{p(x_i \mid y = 0)}$ can be transformed into a $WX$ form and log $\frac{p(y = 1)}{p(y = 0)}$ into a bias b, making the Gaussian Naive Bayes the same as logistic regression. And because the logistic regression doesn't assume that X's are independent logistic regression can perform better than Naive Bayes. Hope that I am right. If not please kindly help correct.
