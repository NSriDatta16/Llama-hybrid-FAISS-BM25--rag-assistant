Problem with JDICplus embedding IE in Java

I am building a Java Swing application that needs to support both an embedded browser and ActiveX. The easy way to do this seemed to be to use JDICplus , which just embeds IE in your application. That would have covered both requirements. I also need to overlay some buttons on top of this browser view so the user can navigate between views. To do that, I have a JLayeredPane to which I add views, and at a higher layer, buttons. This works in my pure Java views. However, on my Internet view, the Internet draws on top of the buttons. In other words, it doesn't seem to respect the JLayeredPane. I'm guessing this is because it is a native component and not a Java component. To be sure, I put the Internet pane into a JInternalFrame , and the buttons in the other, and put both of the internal frames into a JDesktopPane. When I drag the button frame on top of the Internet frame, the Internet frame jumps to the foreground and covers the other frame. It's as if the embedded IE steals the focus and puts itself in the forefront of my other windows. My question is this: is there any way to draw Java components on top of these Windows/IE components reliably? Or, am I not going to get anywhere mixing Java with IE? Are there other options to meeting my requirement of an embedded browser and ActiveX support (which technically, could be a different view--in other words, I could have an Internet view and another view that just supports ActiveX). I'm open to suggestions. I have looked at other free browser components for Java, and as everyone will tell you, it's discouraging.
