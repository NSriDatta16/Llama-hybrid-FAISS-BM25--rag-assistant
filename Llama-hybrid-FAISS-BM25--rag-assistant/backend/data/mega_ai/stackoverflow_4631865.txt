Caching query results in django

I'm trying to find a way to cache the results of a query that won't change with frequency. For example, categories of products from an e-commerce (cellphones, TV, etc). I'm thinking of using the template fragment caching, but in this fragment, I will iterate over a list of these categories. This list is avaliable in any part of the site, so it's in my base.html file. Do I have always to send the list of categories when rendering the templates? Or is there a more dynamic way to do this, making the list always available in the template?
