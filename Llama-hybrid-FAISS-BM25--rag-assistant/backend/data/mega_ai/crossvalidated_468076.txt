The average treatment effect (ATE) is a measure used to compare treatments (or interventions) in randomized experiments or observational studies. The ATE is the population mean of (hypothetical) outcomes should everyone receive treatment less the population mean of (hypothetical) outcomes should noone receive treatment: $$ \text{ATE}=\mathbb{E}(\delta_i)=\mathbb{E}(Y_i^1-Y_i^0)=\mathbb{E}(Y_i^1)-\mathbb{E}(Y_i^0) $$ where $\delta_i$ is the treatment effect for individual $i$ , $Y_i^1$ is the outcome for individual $i$ under treatment and $Y_i^0$ is the outcome for individual $i$ under no treatment. In a randomized trial (i.e., an experimental study), the ATE can be estimated from a sample using a comparison in mean outcomes for treated and untreated units. More complicated estimation is needed in observational studies where assignment to treatment vs. the control group may be confounded. (Based on Cunningham (2018) p. 87 and Wikipedia .)
