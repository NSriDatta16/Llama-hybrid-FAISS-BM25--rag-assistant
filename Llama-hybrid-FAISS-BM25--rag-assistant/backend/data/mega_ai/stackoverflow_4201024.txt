SimpleXML is a good example of black-boxed code that does magic under the covers to make it look simpler that it is. In other words, don't do a var_dump() of a SimpleXML object; you will get confused. A XML file loaded into SimpleXML can be used look like nested objects and arrays of objects. You can reference nested elements with $dom->element->subelement . Yes, it feels funny at first, but you will quickly get used to it. You do have to pay strict attention to your XML format, though, or you might be trying to access elements that don't exist. That's kind-of what your error is. Unfortunatey, SimpleXML pulls the whole XML file into memory and parses it. This gives you the advantage of random access, but at the cost of taking up a lot of memory, perhaps unnecessarily. That said, 12Mb isn't beyond what SimpleXML is capable of and the error message you gave is not an out-of-memory error.
