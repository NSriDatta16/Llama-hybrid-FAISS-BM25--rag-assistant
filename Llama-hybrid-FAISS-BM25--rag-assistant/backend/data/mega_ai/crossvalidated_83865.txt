JAGS burn-in phase takes ZERO time?

My breath was taken away by this. I tried to run my JAGS model with different number burn-in samples but it still takes the same amout of time!! n.iter n.burnin time saved iterations per chain 2000 1000 66s 1000 5000 4000 64s 1000 20000 19000 62s 1000 n.chains was 2 and n.thin was 1. So in each of the 3 model runs, I had different burn-in period, but the same second stage ( n.iter - n.burnin , i.e. 1000 iterations per chain). All 3 models run for the same period of time!!! Does this mean that the burn-in phase takes zero time? This is really a strange result, doesn't correspond to how I supposed the MCMC works. I thought that the burn-in phase is exactly the same computation process as the second stage, with the only difference that the samples are discarded. I have used R2jags::jags function to run JAGS.
