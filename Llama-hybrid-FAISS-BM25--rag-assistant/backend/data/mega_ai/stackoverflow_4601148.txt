How can I create a single log-in and profile for a network of three sites using Django?

How can I create a single log-in and profile for a network of three sites using Django? I have a network of three sites and instead of having the user create a profile at each of the three sites, I'd like the user to only need to register one time, and then be able to use all three. Is there an elegant solution to this problem?
