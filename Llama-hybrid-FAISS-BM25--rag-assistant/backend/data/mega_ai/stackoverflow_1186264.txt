I agree with Daniel, you need to be checking your return values and pointers. I also agree that you need to do a better job blocking and formatting your code. Supposing that you are the only one that ever reads it, in a couple of weeks even you will have forgotten enough that you won't be able to follow it. Towards Matthews point, you could try deleting everything starting with the line: printf ("here 5ai\n"); Of course, only bother with this after checking the file pointer. Another crazy idea would be stepping through it with a debugger. I know it's hard to use a debugger when you have such great debugging options as the printf statement, but sometimes a debugger can be a huge time saver (for example, when you keep getting segfault). Also, learning how to use the debugger for the platform you are developing on is one of the things that separates good coders from the pack of average hacks. (FYI, you could even try looking at your core in the debugger and maybe see exactly where the problem is. (Hint: if you don't have a core file try 'man ulimit'.)) If you are going to insist on using printf as your only means of debug, then call flush right after each use.
