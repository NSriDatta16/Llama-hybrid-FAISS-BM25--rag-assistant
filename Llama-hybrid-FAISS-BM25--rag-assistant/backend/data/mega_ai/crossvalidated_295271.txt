Random values in fixed interval - how to assign probability distribution?

Please excuse my lack of terminology. I am just a humble discrete optimizer Assume we have a kind of "coin toss" where the result is not binary, but a rational number between -1 and 1. There is nothing known a priori about the probability distribution underlying this "coin". What can I do to estimate the probability distribution through experiments? I read a bit about Bayesian and Maximum Entropy approaches, but I need somebody to guide me in the right direction.
