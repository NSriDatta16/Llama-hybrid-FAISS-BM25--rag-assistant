Generate images from CNN model built with transfer learning

I have trained an image classifier (for my own face) via the transfer learning method, in two ways (in order to compare efficiencies later on): 1- I created a docker image, built on top of tensorflow 's mobilenet network, and trained it with my own dataset. training was succesful and generated two files: /retrained_graph.pb retrained_labels.txt 2- using keras api, training my dataset on top of inception network, which generated the single file: /inceptionv3-ft.model if I did everything right, from both methods the top network layer was removed and repurposed with my data. my goal here is to generate googledream-like , images (or any other method for that matter) from (either one of) these newly created models. An example of what I want to achive (model trained for the face): that is, knowing the class (y) and knowing my custom parameters (W), solve the model for X, and generate the image, instead of classifying it: X . W = y could someone please point me in the right direction and tell me how I could use these models for that purpose?
