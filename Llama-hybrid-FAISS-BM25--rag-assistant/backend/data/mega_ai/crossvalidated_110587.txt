Probability of Achieving a Count Level in Time Series Data

I have some time-series data that displays a count value for every day: These count values begin at 1 or -1 and will continue to count up (or down) if conditions in the time series are met. If the conditions are not met consecutively, then the count value can return to -1, 0, or 1 (to initiate the next count series). 0 values do not represent the beginning of a count series, but rather an instance when none of the directional count conditions are met; functionally, an NA value. My question is, with this data, is it possible to determine the probability of a future count value being reached once a minimum threshold is met? For example, what is the confidence that I can have that a count of -3 [10/16/2006 in the above data] will then make it down to a count of -6 [10/19/2006]? I've plotted the distribution of these counts for a much longer data series. The chart below shows that a count of up to -20 was reached at least once between 01-01-2000 and 12-31-2006! With regards to my probability question, I was thinking that maybe I could sum the area between -3 and -6 to determine the probability that a -3 will reach a -6, but that doesn't feel right. I sincerely appreciate your help!
