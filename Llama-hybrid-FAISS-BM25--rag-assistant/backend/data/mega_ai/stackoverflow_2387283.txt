Calculate average date difference between records in MS Access

I have a list on when items have been handed out. The table has the following structure: primary key - autonumber itemname itemid - number datehandedout - date/time I want to calculate the average length of time between when one object is given out and the next one is given out. There will be a number of different items for which the average time between handouts needs to be listed for. So something like (pseudocode): average( [thisrecord]![datehandedout] - [lastrecord]![datehandedout] ) Any help will be much appreciated.
