Markov chains: how to validate a state-transition probability matrix on new data?

I have the state - transition data with multiple sequences of unequal lengths, each sequence corresponding to one subject/person: head(prob_tbl2) period1 period2 period3 period4 period5 period6 period7 period8 1 active active active active active active active 2 active active active active active active active active 3 active active active active active active active active 4 active lapsed1 active lapsed1 active lapsed1 5 active lapsed1 lapsed2 lapsed3 lapsed4 lapsed5 6 active lapsed1 lapsed2 lapsed3 lapsed4 lapsed5 lapsed6 Based on this data, I created a probability matrix (as suggested here ): trans.matrix What is the way I could validate those probabilities, e.g. receive stadard errors/confidence intervals and cross-validate them against a new/unseen dataset? Could I bootstrap my data or apply MLE to get the uncertainty levels, if so, how to do it in R? I tried to use library(markovchain) , with no much luck with my dataset, I described the problem here Clearly, I'm new to Markov chains so any hints will be helpful!
