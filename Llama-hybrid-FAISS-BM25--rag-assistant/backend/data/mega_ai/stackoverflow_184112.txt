What is the optimal length for user password salt?

Any salt at all will obviously help when salting and hashing a user's password. Are there any best practices for how long the salt should be? I'll be storing the salt in my user table, so I would like the best tradeoff between storage size and security. Is a random 10 character salt enough? Or do I need something longer?
