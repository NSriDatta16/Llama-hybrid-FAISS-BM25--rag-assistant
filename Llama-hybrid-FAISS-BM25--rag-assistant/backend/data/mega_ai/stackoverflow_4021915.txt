Drag'n'Drop sortable Listbox for Windows Phone 7

I got a ListBox containing a few items in a Windows Phone 7 application. I want the user to be able to sort the items in the ListBox by just touching and dragging them (on the left part of the ListBox template). How would I implement this? Is there a standard way or control to get this kind of drag and drop functionality (preferably even with animation) on Windows Phone 7? Or is there some other control / panel which is better to use than ListBox?
