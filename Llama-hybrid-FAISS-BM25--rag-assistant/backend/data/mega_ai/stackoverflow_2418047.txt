@karoberts answer is correct, although is different between version 4 and 5: In JBoss 4: {jboss.home}\bin\run.bat In JBoss 5: {jboss.home}\bin\run.conf.bat Which one are you using? The service.bat script of jboss native calls run.bat so you should put your JAVA_OPTS in there using the syntax set "JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dyoutoptionsgoeshere Note: you won't find the service.bat in the bin anymore since JBoss 5. It's in a different package.
