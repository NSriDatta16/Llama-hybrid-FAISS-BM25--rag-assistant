In VS2010, what environment setting applies to mouse-over on region/sub collapse/expand?

I'm tweaking my environment settings and I've got all my colors happy except this one. When you hover over the "+" or "-" the entire affected area gets highlighted in white-ish color. This is annoying when you have a dark background like I have using Ragnarok Blue (or ZenBurn) What Display Item is this so I can adjust?
