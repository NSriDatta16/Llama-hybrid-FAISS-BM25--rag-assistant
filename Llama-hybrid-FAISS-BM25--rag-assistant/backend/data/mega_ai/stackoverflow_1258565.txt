I think I know what you want to do. (making a specific area scrollable) You can do it this way: Create a form Drag a panel onto it. Set the panel docking...the way you want it Set AutoScroll = true for the panel(Eric has suggested this). Now drag any other control onto the the panel. The panel area is now scrollable. If you want to make the whole form scrollable then set AutoScroll = true for the form.
