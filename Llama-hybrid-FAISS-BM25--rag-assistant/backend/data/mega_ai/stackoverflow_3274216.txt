In Java there is no language specific way to have listeners on variables. What you will need to do is when your code changes the variable then have it also update the JLabel. You can have listeners on buttons and other UI widgets and they might update the JLabel. One way you might implement this is as follows. Do you know about getters and setters ? They are methods that do the getting and setting of instance variables. private int x; public int getX() { return x; } public void setX(int anX) { x = anX; updateLabel("This is x:" + anX) } public void process() { while(true) { int anX = getX(); setX(anX + 1); } } You should really try to minimize the use of statics as much as possible, They tend to encourage "Global Variables"
