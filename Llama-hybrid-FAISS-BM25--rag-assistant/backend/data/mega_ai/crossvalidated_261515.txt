What is one of the most successful applications using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for a time series dataset?

I start to study LSTM, but as usual, I am also pretty much interested in best results from LSTM for a Time-series dataset. Then we would have better understanding of the motivation on such a model. :)
