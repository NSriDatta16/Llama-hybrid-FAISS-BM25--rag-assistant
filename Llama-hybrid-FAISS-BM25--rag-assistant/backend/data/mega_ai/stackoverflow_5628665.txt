StarTeam -- How do I move files programmatically?

Any StarTeam users out there? I'm using StarTeam 2009, which comes with some client tools, including a command line tool, stcmd.exe. I'm reorganizing a somewhat large Java project containing thousands of .java files and resource files. I would like to know if there is a way using stcmd or some other scripting tool to move files from one folder in the StarTeam repository to another folder. Of course I can use the StarTeam client interface to drag and drop files, but I'm hoping to avoid that. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
