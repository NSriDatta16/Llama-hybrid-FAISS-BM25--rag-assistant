This is one of the most typical and central questions in statistics. For descriptive tables and plots (involving Standard Error/Deviation, Confidence Intervals, etc), the data ought to be aggregated to the level from which you want to generalize . That level is—in this case and very often— participants . As hinted by the previous contributors, trials do not normally serve for statistical generalization (they're good for experimental validity). This realization does come as a bummer if you have first seen the effect sizes in the un-aggregated data. The mirage is caused by an inflated N . Most descriptive and test statistics have to do with the sample size, which is specifically located in the dividend. The larger the sample (N), the smaller the Standard Deviation, Standard Error, Confidence Interval...—that is, the variation or noise. A large N in the statistics is great when it indeed correspond to the level from which we want to generalize statistically (in many fields, participants). However, when the N in the analyses is partly down to repetitive observations that have not been duly averaged, the famous assumption of independence of observations is violated. Any effects there may be bogus. Thus, Vasishth and Nicenboim (2016) warn, 'if we were to do a t-test on the unaggregated data, we would violate the independence assumption and the result of the t-test would be invalid' (p. 3). Incidentally, it could be worse yet. McCarthy, Whittaker, Boyle, and Eyal (2017) note: 'It has also been proposed that researchers aggregate the responses of participants within the same group and use the groups/clusters as the unit of analysis (Stevens, 2007). However, because this would result in losing sample size at the participant level, this approach is not optimal given the already small numbers of groups typically studied in group work research' (p. 10). Of course, in most fields, that extreme aggregation would leave us with a couple of observations only, so it's out of the question. Participant-level aggregation is only un-required if all repetitive measurements, such as trials, are reliably factored in—as often done in Linear Mixed Effects models.
