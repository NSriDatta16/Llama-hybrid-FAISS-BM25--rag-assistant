No. jQuery is for client-side interfaces. web2py and Django are for server-side. You need both. In fact web2py contains jQuery and has many plugins that combine client-side and server-side functionality and are based on jQuery ( http://web2py.com/plugins ). jQuery is agnostic on which server-side framework you use (web2py, Django or other) and server-side frameworks are also agnostic on which client library you use (jQuery, prototype, etc.). In the web2py world we tend to prefer jQuery. EDIT: you can move a lot (if not all) of the presentation from the server to the client but you still need centralized storage which requires the serverside part.
