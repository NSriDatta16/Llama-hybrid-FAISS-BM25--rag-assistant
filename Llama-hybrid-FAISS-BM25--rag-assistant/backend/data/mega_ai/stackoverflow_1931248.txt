As others have said, delete ptr; ptr = 0; is not going to cause demons to fly out of your nose. However, it does encourage the usage of ptr as a flag of sorts. The code becomes littered with delete and setting the pointer to NULL . The next step is to scatter if (arg == NULL) return; through your code to protect against the accidental usage of a NULL pointer. The problem occurs once the checks against NULL become your primary means of checking for the state of an object or program. I'm sure that there is a code smell about using a pointer as a flag somewhere but I haven't found one.
