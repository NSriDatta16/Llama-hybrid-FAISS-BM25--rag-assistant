Calculating predicted probabilities for ordinal logistic regression

I've run an ordered logistic regression model in R with Zelig and am looking to calculate predicted probabilities. Zelig has a series of simple one line commands to generate the information I want on first differences and so forth. Unfortunately, I keep getting an error when running the zelig function and was wondering if there was a quick alternative for generating predicted probabilities for a ordered logit in R. For what it's worth, here's the error from my Zelig code. > x.out I just need an alternative solution that I can use to generate the probabilities.
