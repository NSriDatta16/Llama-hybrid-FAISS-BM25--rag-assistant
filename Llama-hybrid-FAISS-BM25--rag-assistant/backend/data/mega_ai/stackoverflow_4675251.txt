When you try to attach file from internal storage, GMail writes an error to the log: ERROR/Gmail(...): file:// attachment paths must point to file:///mnt/sdcard. E-mail application would show you the attached file even if it didn't physically exist. As for an external storage, documentation says that: Every Android-compatible device supports a shared "external storage" that you can use to save files. This can be a removable storage media (such as an SD card) or an internal (non-removable) storage. That means you don't have to worry about device not having an external storage at all. Still, external storage can be unavailable at times. Refer to http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesExternal
