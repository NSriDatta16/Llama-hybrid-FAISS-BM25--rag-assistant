K-means can get stuck in local minima. Because of this, it is a best practise to run multiple times and keep the best result (best by SSQ). If you always choose the farthest point, you will get the same result every time. So you do want some randomness! The farthest point is not the best centroid candidate. It usually is too far out. The point has the highest probability of being chosen, but the average point chosen is much closer. If there are 10 points at distance^2 10, and one point at distance^2 11, then the algorithm is more likely to choose one of the cluster points than that last outlier.
