Can an inline table-valued UDF outperform the equivalent scalar UDF in a SELECT column list?

This question grew out of SQLServer: Why avoid Table-Valued User Defined Functions? . I began asking questions in some of the comments, and the replies to my comments moved off topic. So that you don't have to read the entire discussion: I had never heard it said that user defined functions (UDF) were slow, or to be avoided. Some links were posted in the question referenced above to illustrate that they were slow. I still didn't get it, and asked for an example. An example was posted, and the performance difference was huge. I can't be the only person who did not realize there could be such a large performance difference. I felt this fact should be separated into a new question and answer, to improve its chances of being found. This here is the "question". Please don't close yet, as I'd like to give the answerer time to post the answer. Of course, others should also post answers or examples, as well. I'd especially appreciate anything that would help me understand why the performance difference is so huge. Note also that I'm not talking about the use of a UDF in a WHERE clause. I'm aware of how this can prevent the optimizer from doing its job. I'm specifically interested in differences in performance when the original UDF was part of the SELECT column list.
