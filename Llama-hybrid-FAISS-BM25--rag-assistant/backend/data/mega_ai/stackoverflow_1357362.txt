How can i pass parameters to a web page using oracle forms?

I'm trying to send parameters to a web site, with no success. Can anyone please show me a way of how to do it? an example of one way of doing it in ASP for instance is like that: Response.Write(http://ads.hevre.co.il/External_Leads_insert_fullDetails.asp?afid=2512&Firstname="AAA"&Exfield1="BBB"&"&phone="321321321"&Exfield2="DDD"&zip="32121") any suggestions of how to implement it in oracle forms?? thanks in advance, Alon Kogan.
