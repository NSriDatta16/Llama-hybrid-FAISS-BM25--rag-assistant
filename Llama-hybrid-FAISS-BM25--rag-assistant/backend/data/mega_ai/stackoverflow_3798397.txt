high resolution screenshot / or pdf from uiwebview

I want to save a screenshot or generate a pdf from UIWebView text content. I know about how to make screenshots like described in: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa2010/qa1703.html The thing is I'd like to have the screenshot in 300dpi. It is a fixed requirement to generate the content in a UIWebView. I thought about generating touches for zooming into the UIWebView, make several screenshots at a high zoom and stitch them together. Does anyone have a more elegant solution? Thanks b00tsy
