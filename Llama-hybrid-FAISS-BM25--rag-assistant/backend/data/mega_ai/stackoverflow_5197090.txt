jQuery form deserialization for all inputs

I've been using a simple each function for deserializing a form: data = { key : val, ... }; form = $('#formId'); $.each(data, function(val,i) { form.find('*[name="' + val + '"]').val(data[val]); }); but I can't seem to get it to work for non-standard form elements (i.e. radio buttons/checkboxes). I've been playing with different examples for a few hours and can't get it to work. Anyone know an elegant solution for this?
