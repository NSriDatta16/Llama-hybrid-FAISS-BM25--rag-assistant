You may also want to take a look at SWIG , the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator. As one would guess, it generates much of the boiler plate code to interface your C/C++ code to the scripting engine (which can be quite cumbersome to do manually).

Extending and embedding, which is what you desire, takes a bit more effort.
