Conditional declaration in Apache httpd

We want to be able to set Cache-Control headers based on User-Agent in Apache For example, if a User-Agent contains substring foo we want to set Cache-Control to 10 minutes. But if not set it to 1 day. Searching around, I've found BrowserMatch , but that seems to only set environment variables: BrowserMatch foo short-live # Sets environment variable short-live But I would like to conditionally apply a directive like Header set ... or ExpiresDefault ... Is there a way to conditionally apply declarations? Something like: Header set Cache-control "max-age=86400" Header set Cache-control "max-age=600" Note, IfBrowser is fictional. Is there any real directive that could be used like this? Thanks!
