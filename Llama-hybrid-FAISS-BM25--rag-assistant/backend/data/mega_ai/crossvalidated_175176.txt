Combining prediction intervals

I'm using ML regressors (neural networks and random forests) to predict some numbers. I can put in my inputs and get out a value and its prediction interval. The inputs to my regressors are noisy, however, so I vary the inputs within their uncertainties in a monte carlo fashion and obtain a sample of prediction intervals. How can I combine them to get one big prediction interval?
