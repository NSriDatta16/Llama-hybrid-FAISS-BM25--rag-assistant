Calculating t-statistics in event studies

I am conducting an event study in STATA based on this description: http://dss.princeton.edu/online_help/stats_packages/stata/eventstudy.html I reached the point when I need to calculate t-statistics to be able to test whether cumulative abnormal return for event window is statistically significant from 0. And now follows the problem. By analyzing the code above, I see that authors calculated abnormal returns only for the event window (i.e. for 5 days). Based on this data they calculated standard deviation of AR (again, sample size 5 days). And later used sd to calculate t-statistics. But: If they have such a small sample size why they suggest to use Z-scores rather than t-table: " If the absolute value of test is greater than 1.96, then the average abnormal return for that stock is significantly different from zero at the 5% level". is it a mistake, or am I missing smth? What to do if I want to look at event window of only 1 day? In this case it is not possible to calculate sd at all, because we have sample size of 1. Why authors calculate sd only based on value of AR from event window, and not from estimation window for example?
