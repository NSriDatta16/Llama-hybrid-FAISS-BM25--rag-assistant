What's the point of (G)ARCH when you can square the residual and use ARMA?

I'm taught that $$ \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} X_t \sim \text{ARCH}(p) & \rightarrow X_t^2 \sim \text{AR}(p) \\ X_t \sim \text{GARCH}(p, q) & \rightarrow X_t^2 \sim \text{ARMA}(\max(p, q), p) \\ \end{aligned} \end{equation} $$ When I got a time series whose residual appears to be white noise, instead of fitting GARCH on it, I can simply Square the residual. Fit ARMA on the squared residual. Do some prediction, or inference, or whatever with ARMA. "Restore" the residual by taking the square root. Why do I need a (G)ARCH model then?
