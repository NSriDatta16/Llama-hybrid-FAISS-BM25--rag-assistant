The per-emotion percentages reported in the table all have different denominators so you need to compute the average percentage over all emotions as the sum of the numerators over the sum of the denominators, not as the mean of the seven emotion percentages. According to section 4.1 in the paper, the Berlin database has 127 anger speech files, 81 boredom, 46 disgust, 69 fear, 71 joy, 79 neutral, and 62 sadness. For the line that you've highlighted the number of "recognized" are deduced to be (respectively) 116, 70, 36, 49, 43, 66, and 55, which gives an average over all emotions as $$ \frac{116 + 70 + 36 + 49 + 43 + 66 + 55}{127 + 81 + 46 + 69 + 71 + 79 + 62}=.813. $$ In effect the overall percentage is a weighted average of the per-emotion percentages, as suggested in the comment by @Frans Rodenburg.
