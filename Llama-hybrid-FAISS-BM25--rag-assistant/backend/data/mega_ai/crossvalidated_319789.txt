You got the sample, and use an estimator to obtain a given property, such as the mean $\hat \mu$. The value of the estimator is a random value itself, and comes from some unknown distribution, called a sampling distribution . What your ">30" rule of thumb says is that this distribution could be approximated by the normal distribution if the sample size is larger than 30 observations. I'm not here to discuss the validity of this rule itself. So, we're not saying here that a "single sample is normally distributed." In fact I don't even understand what you mean when saying this. We're talking about the sampling distribution of the parameter estimator such as the average $\bar x=\frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^nx_i$. We're not saying anything about the distribution of $x_i$, because the sample size does not have anything to do with it. In your case with a proportion there's something else that is going on. The proportion comes from Binomial distribution, which can be approximated by Normal distribution when the sample size is large. I wouldn't apply your rule of thumb here, because it's obtuse in comparison to the estimator of the variance of the proportion that is based on Binomial distribution.
