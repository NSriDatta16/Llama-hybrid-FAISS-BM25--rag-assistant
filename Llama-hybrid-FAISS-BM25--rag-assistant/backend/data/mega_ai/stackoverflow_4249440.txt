How do I stop TeamCity from turning symbolic links into files when using server checkout mode with a Windows server and a Mac agent?

We're moving from a combination of CC/CC.NET to TeamCity. The core of our product is Windows but we have a Mac agent. We have our VCS checkout mode set to "Automatically on server". Meaning the source will be checked out on the (Windows) server and then copied to the agents (including the Mac agent) as needed. Our product uses the BWToolkit framework for a portion of its UI. This means that we store the framework in our source control. The issue is that the source copy from the TeamCity server screws up the symbolic links within the framework directory. This results in our product failing to build ( error: BWToolkitFramework/BWToolkitFramework.h: No such file or directory ). This is how an ls -l from inside the root framework directory looks on my machine: total 24 lrwxr-xr-x 1 myuser admin 35 Nov 22 10:45 BWToolkitFramework -> Versions/Current/BWToolkitFramework lrwxr-xr-x 1 myuser admin 24 Nov 22 10:45 Headers -> Versions/Current/Headers lrwxr-xr-x 1 myuser admin 26 Nov 22 10:45 Resources -> Versions/Current/Resources drwxr-xr-x 5 myuser admin 170 Nov 22 10:45 Versions And this is how it looks on the build machine: total 24 -rwxrwxr-- 1 root admin 40 Nov 19 16:21 BWToolkitFramework -rwxrwxr-- 1 root admin 29 Nov 19 16:21 Headers -rwxrwxr-- 1 root admin 31 Nov 19 16:21 Resources drwxrwxr-- 4 root admin 136 Nov 19 16:21 Versions In addition instead of appearing as links on the build machine (little arrow overlay on icon) they appear as files with the unix executable icon. If you open one of these files that should be a link you get something similar to the following (this from the BWToolkitFramework link): link Versions/Current/BWToolkitFramework This appears to be an issue with the server checkout option in TeamCity because CruiseControl is running on the same machine doing a direct SVN checkout and I've had no issues. Is there any way to fix this other than changing our TeamCity configuration to use the SVN checkout on client option?
