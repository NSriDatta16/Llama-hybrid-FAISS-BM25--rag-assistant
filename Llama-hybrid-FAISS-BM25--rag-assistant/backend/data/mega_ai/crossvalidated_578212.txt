XGBoost Regression on a normal distribution variable produces a one sided distribution (only positive values)

I'm running a scikit-learn XGBoostRegressor with an RMSE loss function, on a variable with a distribution that is close to symmetric around 0 (think normal distribution, with a positive mean that generates more positive than negative values, apprx. 2:1). The model consistently predicts mostly positive values. Only 1-3% of the predictions are negative, and with negligible values. For the life of me, I'm stumped on why this might happen - it feels like there's some parameter in XGBoost telling it not to predict negative values or something.
