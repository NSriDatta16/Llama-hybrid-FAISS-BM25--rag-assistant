The source files were getting encoded using "MacRoman" (found this from Project Properties -> Resource -> Text file encoding). I changed it to "UTF-8" and then tried embedding the actual non-english string to the program and tried printing. it worked. You were perhaps corrupting data either on save or during compilation. Source code doesn't carry any intrinsic encoding information, so it is easy to corrupt string literals that contain characters outside the basic "ASCII" range. Consider using Unicode escape sequences in your source files to avoid this problem. You either do that or you ensure that anyone who comes into contact with the source handles it appropriately at all times - the first way is easier. If this is for a commercial application, consider externalizing the strings to a resource file. Java: a rough guide to character encoding Java: character inspector application
