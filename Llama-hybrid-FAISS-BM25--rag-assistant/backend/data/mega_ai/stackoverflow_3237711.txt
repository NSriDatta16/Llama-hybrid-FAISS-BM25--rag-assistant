Check out dijit.initRobot(), that might take care of some things for you. One thing that was screwing up a lot of my tests is described in this blog post - basically the robot was not initializing because I was obscuring a special div that the robot clicks to initialize. However I have realized that there are still quite a few problems with the doh robot - it just seems very fragile. Often I will have a working test, then add 1 robot command and the test will break. When I remove the line and try it again...well the robot wont run even though it is the exact same code as before. I've found the best thing to do when writing robot code is to just clear the cache every time and cross your fingers. Good luck.
