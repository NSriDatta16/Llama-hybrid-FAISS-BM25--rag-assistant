Is it possible to create samples, that are not contained inside the data set?

I want to try machine learning and I am using a wine dataset from kaggle. I want to try predicting the points that wines will get. However, only point ratings from 80 to 100 are included in this data set. Is there some method, by which I could generate new samples with accurate point ratings from 0 to 80 or should I just take another data set?
