Converting from log-standardized units to ordinary units - challenge with interpreting correctly

I have a variable X that I first log (base e)-transformed say log_X and then standardized i.e., log_X_s = (log_X - mean(log_X))/sd(log_X). I'm trying to use log_X_s in a logistic regression model and have the following output: Wald chi2(1) = 7238.99 Log likelihood = -45419.208 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- retained_p_day1 | Coef. Std. Err. z P>|z| [95% Conf. Interval] ------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- log_X_s | .7569809 .008897 85.08 0.000 .739543 .7744188 _cons | .6084474 .0304769 19.96 0.000 .5487137 .668181 ------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- nwikiproject | var(_cons)| .9395261 .0492722 .8477517 1.041236 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LR test vs. logistic model: chibar2(01) = 9298.74 Prob >= chibar2 = 0.0000 The distribution of log_X is shown below Variable n Mean S.D. Min .25 Mdn .75 Max ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- log_X 91882 6.78 3.35 0.00 4.50 7.42 9.42 13.85 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'm trying to interpret the results back to the original scale and want to make sure I'm doing it correctly. Interpretation 1: A unit increase in log_X_s i.e., a 1 s.d. increase (i.e., 3.35 units) in log_X i.e., a 28.5 times (which is exp(3.35)) increase in X is associated with a exp(0.7569809) = 113% increase in the odds of retention. So, a one time increase in X (i.e., doubling the quantity of X) is associated with a 113/28.5 ~ 4% increase in the odds of retention. Interpretation 2: An increase by 3.35 units on the log scale is associated with a 113% increase in the odds of retention. Therefore, a 1 unit increase on log scale ~ 113/3.35 is associated with 34% increase in the odds of retention. So, e times increase on the linear scale is associated with 34% increase in the odds of retention. Therefore, a 1x increase on the linear scale is associated with a 12.6% increase in the odds of retention. Clearly, I'm getting confused with something somewhere and either one of these is wrong, or both. Could someone correct me where I'm going wrong with the interpretation? Any help is greatly appreciated!
