mysql select query - to match one field with the other field

I am trying to find records that has the following scenario. ID | name | email 1 Robert robert@gmail.com 2 William bill@gmail.com 3 Michael michael@gmail.com 4 Micahel mike@gmail.com Based on the above table, I want to find the records where the "name" is contained in the "email field", here record 1 and 3 should be the output and not 2 and 4. Is there any way I can do this comparison? I tried reading about regex but couldn't find anything. If it's comparison of same value, it will be straightforward, but I am not having any clue for this one. I thought of LIKE but looks like this cannot have field names.
