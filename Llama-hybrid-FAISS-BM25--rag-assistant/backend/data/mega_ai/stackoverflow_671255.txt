I've taken another approach to this problem. My models have 2 file fields, one uses the standard file storage backend and the other one uses the s3 file storage backend. When the user uploads a file it get's stored localy. I have a management command in my application that uploads all the localy stored files to s3 and updates the models. So when a request comes for the file I check to see if the model object uses the s3 storage field, if so I send a redirect to the correct url on s3, if not I send a redirect so that nginx can serve the file from disk. This management command can ofcourse be triggered by any event a cronjob or whatever.
