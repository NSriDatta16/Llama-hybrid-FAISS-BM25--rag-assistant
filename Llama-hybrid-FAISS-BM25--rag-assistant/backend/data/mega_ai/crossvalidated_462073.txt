One approach would be to create an a priori stratified sampling scheme or template for all hobbyists based on a set of preselected criteria. These criteria should be structural (e.g., demographics or geography which are not easily manipulated) and include the factors discussed in your first paragraph from published sources regarding 'how connected the hobbyists are to the wider hobby scene', assuming such information is available to you. It's likely that you will have only summary information (marginals) from these published sources, for example, the percent of a published sample who are members of a club (making some numbers up, 60% yes and 40% no ). These marginals can be worked with but it's a little tricky, statistically speaking. Iterative proportional fitting (IPF) also known as raking is a technique that's been around for decades. It's been used for adjusting the results from a survey to correct for the kinds of bias you've identified. It will enable you to create a weighting scheme to apply to the survey that you will eventually field and adjust for the bias you've identified based on a priori expectations. Cross-validated has 46 questions devoted to raking and 22 questions about IPF.
