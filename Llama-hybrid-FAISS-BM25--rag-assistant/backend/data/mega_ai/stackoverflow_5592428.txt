Argument assignment not working?

IF (@SP_ARGUMENT IS NULL ) SET @SP_ARGUMENT = (SELECT TOP(1) ID FROM TEST_TABLE ) SELECT @SP_ARGUMENT AS ARGUMENT_VAL The above is code fragment of my stored proc. But when I send sp_argument is null, I want it to use the 1st ID from the TEST_TABLE for the further queries below, but not working. What I am doing wrong here? Pls help.
