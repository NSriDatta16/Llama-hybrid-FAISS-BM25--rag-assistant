I understand this is your first time with ASP.NET and want to help you learn more about its potentials. First of all, I would replace the code you wrote with data binding , which is a way to easily build tables without having to write methods like your generateTable. ASP.NET takes care of building the table by itself. It will take me a while to illustrate you full code for achieving this, but I hope you can grab the documentation and start learning with my help. The key control is GridView . It can be populated using a two-lines code fragment protected override OnLoad(EventArgs e) { if (!IsPostback) DataBind(); } protected override void OnDataBind(EventArgs e) { gridView.DataSource = getTestData(); gridView.DataBind(); } You must first configure columns in layout. The articles about GridView deal with this, and you can add a button for each row. Now, you can set the buttons as command buttons, thus not only raising the Click event, but, more important, the Command event which takes a name and an argument. That's where you can inject your code. For example protected void myCommandHandler(object sender, CommandEventArgs e) { if (e.CommandName=="kill") { killProcess(e.CommandArgument); DataBind(); //MOST IMPORTANT } } Hope to have been of help. I wrote this code by hand, so please understand me if it will not work immediately
