DTW is an algorithm for measuring the distance between two time series. It's an alternative to the Euclidean distance (which is the mean squared distance between the time series at each time step), and is useful when the time series are or may be out of step, for example if one is phase shifted or stretched. DTW allows for this situation by "warping" or re-aligning the time series so the phase-shifted or stretched points are correctly matched. See A measure of distance between time series: Dynamic Time Warping by Jessica Leung and Robert James for a more complete explanation. DTW (or any algorithm for measuring the distance between two time series) can't tell you if two time series are related. What it can tell you is that if you have three time series A, B, and C, if the DTW distance between A and B is less than the DTW distance between A and C, then time series A is more like time series B than time series C. As DTW does nothing more than tell you the distance between two time series, it is paired with another algorithm to solve a time series task. For instance, it is often paired with the Nearest Neighbours (NN) classification algorithm for time series classification tasks. Until fairly recently (5 or so years ago) DTW-1NN was considered the go-to algorithm for time series classification. Similarly, when DTW is used for clustering it is combined with a standard clustering algorithm such as k-means, it is used to measure the distances between time series, while k-means does the actual clustering. See these answers by Alesandr Blekh and Hassan ISMAIL FAWAZ to "Dynamic Time Warping Clustering" for more on DTW and time series clustering.
