Which algorithm should be used for an accurate job recommendation system

I'm building a testing project to get an introduction to DS & ML. As a person part of the working force, sometimes finding a job is harder than it should be. I thought I could built a testing project to help workers find a job that best match their interests and their skills. I could use a classifier, but I do not know if regression if the best way to approach this as a first pass. I was thinking of a GA system that could find some way to find way to approach this over time in a X generation. Maybe this isn't the best way for recommending jobs. What I'm looking for isn't the code for the problem but more of algorithms ideas I should take a look at and implement in any given programming language. I'm looking to implement a system that can take a peak at job descriptions, interests and skills of an individual. I think this doesn't sound too crazy to be able to train an agent and then make it look at every jobs there is on LinkedIn for instance and take a look at 'Software Engineer' and give me 45% matching and here's the three skills that you have to work on or 98% match, please apply.
