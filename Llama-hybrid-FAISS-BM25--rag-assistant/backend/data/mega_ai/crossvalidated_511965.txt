Why are time series autocorrelated (rather than being dependent on time variables)?

Time series are generally autocorrelated. I've learned this means that the values of a time series are correlated with prior values of itself. I'm struggling to understand why this is. I would appreciate any insights from the folks here. One explanation I've seen is that in a time series, the value of the variable at one point in time is related to the value at a previous point in time. I think this makes sense -- snowfall in December is related to snowfall in January because its wintertime. Clearly snowfall would depend on the time of year. Or if there is a trend in more people ordering pizza, then pizza ordered at $t$ will be greater than pizza-ordered at $t-1$ in some sort of relationship. But why can't we just handle dependencies like this with a regular linear model? Why is a timeseries correlated with itself (necessitating using things like differencing and ARIMA), rather than just with time (in which case, we could run plain-ole linear models)? Is the idea that there are just so many reasons that a value at time $t$ is related to values at $t-1$ that we can't possibly control for them all with explicit parameters in a linear regression? Or is there something else going on?
