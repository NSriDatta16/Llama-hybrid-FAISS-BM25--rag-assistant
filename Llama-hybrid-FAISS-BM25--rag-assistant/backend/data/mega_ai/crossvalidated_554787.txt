In case of linear models, heteroscedasticity will not affect the point estimates, and you can use clustered standard errors. Whether you should do this or not is discussed, for example, here . This however does not translate for nonlinear models. Jeff Wooldridge writes for example here : ... The reason clustered standard errors are not allowed is that the FE logit estimator -- that is, the conditional MLE -- is inconsistent in the presence of serial correlation (and heteroskedasticity). A former student of mine [..] showed this in his dissertation via simulation a few years ago. And you should careful think about the (non-linear) model you are estimating. One pragmatic opportunity could be to use fixed-effects OLS for binary data as often been done in econometrics and suggested for example by Joshua Angrist and JÃ¶rn-Steffen Pischke : Hence, there is a lot to be said for sticking to a linear regression function as compared to a fairly arbitrary choice of a non-linear one! Nonlinearity per se is a red herring. PS: As commented by Frank Harrell , this approach is however controversial since you use by definition a model which is not suited for the (binary) data at hand (see for example the blogpost by Dave Giles here ).
