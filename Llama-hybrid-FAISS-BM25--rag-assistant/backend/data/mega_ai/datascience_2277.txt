I am more of an expert on data ETL and combining/aggregating than on the forumulas themselves. I work frequently with weather data. I like to give some suggestions on using weather data in analysis. Two types of data are reported in US/Canada: A. Measurements B. Weather Type As far as weather type (sunny, rainy, severe thunderstorm) they are either going to already be reflected in measurements (e.g., sunny, rainy) and are redundant or they are inclement weather conditions and are not necessarily reflected in the measurements. For inclement weather types, I would have separate formulae. For measurements, there are 7 standard daily measurements for Weather Station reporting in North America. Temp Min/Max Precipitation Average Wind Speed Average Cloudiness (percentage) Total sunlight (minutes) Snowfall Snow Depth Not all stations report all 7 daily measurements. Some report only Temp and Precipitation. So you may want to have one formula for Temp/Precipitation and an expanded formulae when all seven measurements are available. The two links below are NOAA/NWS weather terms used in their datasets: This document is the vocabulary for the annual summaries: http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/ANNUAL_documentation.pdf This document is the vocabulary for the daily summaries http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/GHCND_documentation.pdf
