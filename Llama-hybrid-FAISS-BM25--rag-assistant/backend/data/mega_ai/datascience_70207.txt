What is evaluation metric for two sets?

I've two sets one is ground truth and other is output of my machine learning models. Assume my groundtruth set is A={1,2,3,4,5} and output of machine learning model is B={3,4,5,6,7,8} . One way I can measure performance is IoU(Inersection over union) like object detection. So IoU will be A intersecton B/ A U B I'm not sure is it reasonable? Or any other better evaluation metric can I use to measure the performance?
