JavaEE Application Server or Lightweight Container?

Let me preface this by saying this is not an actual situation of mine but I'm asking this question more for my own knowledge and to get other people's inputs here. I've used both Spring and EJB3/JBoss, and for the smaller types of applications I've built, Spring (+Tomcat when needed) has been much simpler to use. However, when scaling up to larger applications that require things like load balancing and clustering, is Spring still a viable solution? Or is it time to turn to a solution like EJB3/JBoss when you start to get big enough to need that? I'm not sure if I've scoped the problem well enough to get a good answer, so please let me know. Thanks, Jeff
