Your approach doesn't have to be hierarchical or stepwise. Let's call your response variable (dependent variable or DV in your terms) $Y$, the apparently important predictor $X_1$ and the others $X_2$ and $X_3$. You can easily look at all the possible models, as there are at most 7 models of interest, namely $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$ alone, The three possible pairs, All three predictors. There is much need for caution, as A sample size of 24 is small for any exercise here, especially fitting a model with more than one predictor. Focusing on whether the coefficient for a particular predictor is or is not significant at some conventional level is not as important as understanding why that is so. A scatter plot matrix plotted as exploratory analysis before your regressions and residual and added variable plots after your regressions would help to signal whether the real problems are say nonlinearity, outliers, some other reason to transform, grouping of values, or whatever. Multicollinearity or other structure is not something to be guessed at from the value of some diagnostic, but something that can be explored directly by looking at the data with graphs. Paying attention to previous knowledge or theory is clearly sensible, but I wouldn't pay too much attention to it. Presumably you wouldn't use $X_2$ and $X_3$ if they were not of interest. It's common to find that the well-known predictor is not as crucial as theory implies, say because it doesn't vary enough in a particular dataset; because a theory hinging on dynamics is being tested with cross-sectional data; and so on. Can you post the data? Then guesses and prejudices could be checked against the facts. (I have to guess that you are some kind of economist. Economists are in my experience naturally very well informed about regression, but often most reluctant to draw graphs.)
