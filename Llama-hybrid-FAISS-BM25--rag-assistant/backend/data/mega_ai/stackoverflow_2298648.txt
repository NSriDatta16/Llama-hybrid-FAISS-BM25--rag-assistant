How to track my flash video player embed on other sites

Setup: an online tv channel with "youtube" like clips and categories our own flash video player which can be embeded into other remote sites as2 flash player Goal: To track who's embedding my videos, at least with basic statistics per domain. Since it's AS2, it's harder to do this. My idea is that I can create a PHP page which should be opened each time the player loads on any website; then the flash player can do a "geturl" of the PHP file which has Google Analytics code or some other decent tracker. The geturl command could contain a variable like the Video Title which already is included in the player; and this title would pass on with GET to the PHP file and setup a dynamic page title which can be tracked very well. Problem: how to I use the GETURL function without having user's browser open a new tab or window. Is there any hidden way to do it?
