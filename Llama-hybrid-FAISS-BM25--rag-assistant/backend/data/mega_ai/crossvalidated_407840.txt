Using robust regression to detect outliers

Rousseeuw and van Zomeren (1990) propose using robust regression to detect multivariate outliers, particularly in OLS regression. This approach seems to make sense (although I have not studied it in detail) but I don't recall seeing this method used. Is there some problem with it? Have better methods been found?
