Best image PPI for computer vision deep learning algorithms

For computer vision tasks using deep learning, should I worry about image size (e.g. 256 x 256) or PPI (pixels per inch)? I find that PPI is not discussed in the computer vision/deep learning literature. What's the best PPI for images of size 256 x 256?
