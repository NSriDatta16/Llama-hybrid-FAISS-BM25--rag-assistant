How to add files to project on google code?

I normally organize my project in multiple files. Now, for the first time I have created a project at code.google.com/hosting. How to add files to the project? The project has got directory structure and many files. I want them to be visible under trunk (like it is in other projects). NOTE: I am novice in this area (I have no clue about what to do). I am searching for an UPLOAD button.
