How can I not allow a user to go back after logout in PHP?

I just wrote a PHP login script, and what I'm trying to accomplish is that when the user click to the log out link, after they log out, regardless clicking the back button of the browser, they cannot access the page. Here is the logout function: //Start the Session session_start(); session_destroy(); header("location:login.php"); exit(); I did place the following code on all the pages, and this seems not do the job: header ("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); // Date in the past header ("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT"); header ("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate"); // HTTP/1.1 header ("Pragma: no-cache"); //Start the Session session_start(); Any suggestions?
