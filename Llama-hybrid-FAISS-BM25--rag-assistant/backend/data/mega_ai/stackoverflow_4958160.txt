Create a DataSet using Add New Item. Then, from Server Explorer, drag a stored procedure onto the design surface. This will create a few things: A DataSet , that you can ignore A Table Adapter named "QueriesTableAdapter". It will contain A protected array of commands, complete with full parameter lists A method with the name of the stored procedure, and which takes appropriate parameters, and which calls the stored procedure through an element of the array of commands. Now, since the command collection is protected, you have to do a little more work. On the design surface, press F7 (View Code). This will create a DataSet1.cs file. Delete the contents and add the following: using System.Data.SqlClient; namespace WebApplication.Data.DataSet1TableAdapters { public partial class QueriesTableAdapter { public SqlCommand aspnet_Membership_CreateUser_Command { get { return (SqlCommand) CommandCollection[0]; } } } } (I had a web application open, and it was using the standard ASP.NET database, so that's the stored procedure in the example) This will allow your code to access QueriesTableAdapter.aspnet_Membership_CreateUser_Command.Parameters .
