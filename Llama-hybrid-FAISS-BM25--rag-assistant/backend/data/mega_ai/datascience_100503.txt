What are the different estimators used by different loss functions in sklearn's SGDClassifier?

I am new to Data Science and was curious to learn about sklearn package. While digging up details on SGDClassifier I found in the documentation that SGDClassifier uses different estimators for different loss functions and have given a example stating when SGDClassifier(loss='log') then Logistic Regression is used. Can I ask what are the estimators for other loss functions like hinge, huber, etc...? Link of the documentation for quick reference: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/sgd.html#mathematical-formulation
