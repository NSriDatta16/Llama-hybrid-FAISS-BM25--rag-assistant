Well that's is the whole idea of Entity Framework that a conceptual model is how we portray or perceive the business looks like. However the data is stored usually in 2nd or 3rd normal form to make efficient use of disk space and also improve the efficiency of data retrieval.

If you business model is exactly similar to how you store your data in the database, then you do not need to remodel it.
