SELECT * FROM cars c INNER JOIN (SELECT MAX(id) AS j_id FROM jobs GROUP BY car_id) x ON x.j_id = c.id You forgot the jobs.car_id field, that specifies which car job belongs to More elegant way will be to create the field car.last_job_id and maintain it with trigger on jobs table. Since your question is not clear, this query also can be an answer: SELECT j.* FROM jobs j INNER JOIN (SELECT MAX(id) id FROM jobs GROUP BY car_id) x ON x.id = j.id
