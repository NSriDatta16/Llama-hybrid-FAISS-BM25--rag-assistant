You can't simply average means of subsets if these subsets have different numbers of elements . As a simple example, suppose one subset consists of the smallest element alone, and the other subset contains all other elements. If you then average these subsets' means, the smallest element will get the same weight as all other elements together . The solution is to take a weighted average of the subset means, where each subset's mean gets a weight that is proportional to the number of elements in the subset.
