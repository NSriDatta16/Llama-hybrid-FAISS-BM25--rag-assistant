Measuring variability in blood pressure in a repeated measures design with different time intervals between study visits

I have repeated measures on blood pressure for a lot of patients, measured at different intervals (table below). I want my standard deviation to reflect that a large deviation in blood pressure measured over 1 year weighs heavier than the same deviation measured with 3 years in between. Is there a way to do this? My data on blood pressure looks as follows: Study visit Years between last visit Systolic blood pressure X-mean (X-mean)^2 1 - 135 -11 121 2 1 145 -1 1 3 3 140 -6 36 4 1 145 -1 1 5 2 165 19 361 Average systolic blood pressure: 146 Variance: 130 Standard deviation: 11.4
