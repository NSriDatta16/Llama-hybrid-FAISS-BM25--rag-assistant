The second getter is fragile (it will crash if somebody access's the object's title and then releases the object), so the first is generally preferable even if marginally slower. The first setter is more efficient and will work even in situations where an autorelease pool doesn't exist, so it's preferable. The reason it's more efficient is not just because of autorelease vs. release â€” it doesn't do any work at all if you try to set the property to its existing value.
