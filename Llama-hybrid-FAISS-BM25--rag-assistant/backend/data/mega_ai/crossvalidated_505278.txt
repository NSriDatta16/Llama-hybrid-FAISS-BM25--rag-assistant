Total (stochastic) orders for univariate distributions on compact set

Let $[\underline{x},\bar{x}] = X \in\mathbb{R}_{+}$ be a compact set and $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of all CDFs $F$ on $X$ . What total stochastic orders can I define on $\mathcal{F}$ ? (see Wikipedia definitions for total order and stochastic ordering ) Notice I read on stochastic ordering wikipedia's page, intro paragraph, the following: These are usually partial orders, so that one random variable $A$ may be neither stochastically greater than, less than nor equal to another random variable $B$ . I tried to make a search for a total stochastic order relation by giving a quick look into the book by Shaked Moshe and Shanthikumar George " Stochastic Orders ". Unfortunately, without success. The only total stochastic orders I can come up with on $\mathcal{F}$ are the "trivial" ones like comparing means, standard deviations etc ... (supposing those moments actually exist). Is there anything richer than that? (like an alternative definition for stochastic dominance, which is however a partial order) I must also say I'm from another field (economics) so it's possible I'm missing something here.
