some verd problems in qt

I am very new to qt, So whatever I facing is either errors or problems. Here goes some of them, 1)Just try to install it in VisualStudio, you will got enough for the day. 2)After you installed it as a separate qt(without embedding it inside visual studio).Open a c++ file in qt, => then you won't get any option to compile it. 3)Create a empty qt4 project like below #include using namespace std; int main(int a,char * argv[]) { } Then build it, you will get a error like this C:\qt-greenhouse\Trolltech\Code_less_create_more\Trolltech\Code_less_create_more\Troll\4.6\qt\src\winmain/qtmain_win.cpp:131: undefined reference to `qMain(int, char**)' Can anybody clear any of these problems to me.
