Hotelling's $T^2$ test on one-sample population

I'm trying to get a grasp with Hotelling's $T^2$ test in the case of a one-sample population. This exercise is a part of a training set; it's not an homework, and I'm not looking for a complete solution, but for help to correct some mistakes. The Problem There's a population that can be supposed to follow a bivariate Normal law of mean $\mathbf{\mu}$ and covariance $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ . The sample's size is 101, the sample mean is $\mathbf{\bar{x}} = (55.24\quad 34.97)^T$ , and the sample covariance is: $$\mathbf{S} = \begin{pmatrix}210.54 & 126.99 \\\ 126.99 & 119.68\end{pmatrix}.$$ Let $\mathbf{\mu_0} = (60\quad 50)^T$ ; test at $\alpha=0.01$ level of confidence the following hypothesis: $$H_0 : \mathbf{\mu}=\mathbf{\mu_0} \longleftrightarrow H_1 : \mathbf{\mu}\neq\mathbf{\mu_0}.$$ Then, build a $0.99$ confidence ellipsoid for $\mu$ . What I did Hypothesis testing Since the true covariance matrix of the population is not known, I have to use the Hotelling's $T^2$ test. Recall that $$t^2 = (n-1)(\mu_0-\mathbf{\bar{x}})^T \mathbf{S}^{-1}(\mu_0-\mathbf{\bar{x}})$$ follows an Hotelling's $T^2_{p,m}$ distribution of dimension $p$ (with $p=2$ here) and $m$ degrees of liberty (with $m=101$ here). Thus, $$F = \frac{n-p}{(n-1)p}t^2$$ follows an $F(p, n-p)$ distribution of parameters $p, n-p$ . The test is thereby: if $$F_{obs} = \frac{n-p}{p} (\mu_0-\mathbf{\bar{x}})^T \mathbf{S}^{-1}(\mu_0-\mathbf{\bar{x}}) > F_{1-\alpha}(p,n-p)$$ then we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ . Doing the computations, I get $F_{obs} = 175.182$ (it's huge!) and $F_{0.99}(2,99) = 4.826189$ (computed via the R function qf(0.99, 2, 99) ). Obviously, with this value of $F_{obs}$ , I'm rejecting the null hypothesis. Confidence ellipsoid To compute the confidence ellipsoid, I know that it's given by: $$\mathscr{E} = \{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbf{R}^2 : (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{\bar{x}})^T \mathbf{S}^{-1} (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{\bar{x}}) = F_{0.99}(2,99)\}$$ and is described by the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{S}^{-1}$ ; more precisely, the axes are given by eigenvectors of $\mathbf{S}^{-1}$ , and the length of the axes are given by $\sqrt{\frac{\lambda_i}{2}F_{0.99}(2,99)}$ (with $\lambda_i$ being the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_i$ .) Here, the eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = 0.033, \lambda_2 = 0.003$ and the eigenvectors are $$\mathbf{v}_1 = (-0.576\quad 0.818)^T, \mathbf{v}_2 = (-0.818\quad -0.576)^T.$$ What's wrong I'm feeling like the $F$ -statistics is abnormally large compared to $F_{0.99}(2,99)$ . Moreover, the confidence ellipsoid should be pretty big (since the confidence level is $0.99$ ), while the one I computed is tiny. Can you help me to find where I'm wrong?
