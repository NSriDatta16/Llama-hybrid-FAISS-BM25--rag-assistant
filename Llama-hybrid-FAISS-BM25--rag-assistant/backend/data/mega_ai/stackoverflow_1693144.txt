I would throw Teamcity into the mix. It uses a grid of build agents which may be able to give you a little more horsepower as well as ability to perform simultaneous builds. With your sheer number of projects it might be tough to replicate your build three times within the same instance of any particular build server. That would be over 100 projects to keep track of on the same page. Option 2 is definitely viable although I might consider leveraging virtual machines, creating one build server image, and then hosting three instances of that which would result in three nice urls without using different ports as well as three identical setups to maintain. One other consideration; perhaps you could collapse your 37+ projects into fewer ccnet builds by grouping related components and using nant\msbuild\ruby\powershell scripting. If you can get down to 15 builds then running all three variations in the same server instance becomes more viable.
