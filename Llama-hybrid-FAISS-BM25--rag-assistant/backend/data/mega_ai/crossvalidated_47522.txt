In a multinomial logistic regression with 3 levels of the DV there ought to be two intercepts. How exactly these are defined depends on which is the reference level. These will be the value of the logit when the independent variables are 0, in your case, when risk is high. I wrote a presentation on multinomial and ordinal logistic regression ; it somewhat concentrated on SAS, but some may be useful even if you are using another package.
