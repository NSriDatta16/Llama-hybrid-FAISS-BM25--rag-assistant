How to change .ASPX automatic formatting settings (Visual Studio)

When typing code in a .aspx file (an MVC view in this case), Visual Studio applies two types of formatting, one to the regular html tag structure (which can be controlled from Tools->Options->Text Editors->Html) and another to content inside the tags. I've run into two annoyances with the second type of automatic formatting, the content formatting. First is how new lines are added to statement blocks: If I type this: ... It is autocorrected to this: ... While the correction is right if this was a .cs file, for the tag soup that is .aspx files I find the first far more readable. Is there a way to turn off this behavoir without affecting the formatting of .cs files? Second, whenever I write something like this: I can't find a way to make it automatically format into this (add spacing where appropriate): In code you normally need a ; or } to signal that you are done a line/section of code so that Visual Studio can format it. Is there a way to give this signal for a CLARIFICATION This question is about the formatting of code inside tags without affecting the formatting of regular C# source files . It says right in the first paragraph that I am completely aware of the Text Editors menu.
