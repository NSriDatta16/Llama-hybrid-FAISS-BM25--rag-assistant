Here's a sketch: Parse the paragraph into a token of words Maintain a map from hash codes to counters, being careful that collisions are possible For each word in the paragraph, hash the word to an integer Again, being careful that collisions are possible, increment the corresponding count Run through the hash table spitting out the words and the counts Beyond that, if you have a specific question about your own implementation of the above, let us know and we can try to help. We are not going to write your code for you, though.
