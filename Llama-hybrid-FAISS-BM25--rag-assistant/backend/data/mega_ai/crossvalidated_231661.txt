Asymptotic distribution of the average of $p$ sample-percentile

Here is a question which seems to be intuitively simple, yet I am not able to show it rigorously. Any help, whether it is carrying out my attempt or to suggest any other approach - would be greatly appreciated. Also, please, see the note on a similar question. The problem Let $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ iid samples drawn from uniform distribution $X_i \sim U[0,1]$. What is the asymptotic distribution of sum of the top $0 That is, what is the asymptotic distribution of $S_p(n)$, where $$ S_p(n) := \frac{1}{p\cdot n}\sum_{i = p \cdot n}^n X_{(i)}\,. $$ (with $X_{(i)}$ is the i -th order statistic. Additionally, to spare the clutter in the notation, I have ignored rounding to the integer in the summation over index $i= \lfloor p \cdot n \rfloor$) Intuitively, I would argue that when $n$ grows high the top $p$ percentile is uniformly distributed on the interval $[p ,1]$ therefor, the sum is asymptotically equivalent to the sum of uniform random samples drawn from $U[p, 1]$. Which leads to $$\sqrt{n}\left(\frac{S_p(n) - \mathbb{E}S_p(n)}{\sqrt{\text{var}(S_p(n))}}\right) = \sqrt{n}\left(\frac{S_p(n) - \frac{(p+1)}{2}}{\frac{(1-p)}{\sqrt{12}}}\right) \to N(0, 1)\,. $$ Note: There is a similar question asked here , I was not sure whether to post a comment there or ask a new question, eventually I did both and put a reference in both places. Additionally, since one can always go from general distribution to uniform one by inverse cdf transform $F^{-1}(x)$, what I ask is a in a more general setting. Outline of my Attempt to solve . (As already noted, this is in the spirit of the answer to this question ) $\mathbf{1)}$ Look at the random vector $$ (y, x_{m+1}, \ldots, x_{n}) := \left(\sum_{j=m}^n X_{(j)}, X_{(m+1)}, \ldots, X_{(n)}\right)\,. $$ $\mathbf{2)}$ Find the joint distribution of the vector from $\mathbf{1)}$. By change of variable for distribution of $$\left(X_{(m)}, X_{(m+1)}, \ldots, X_{(n)}\right)\,.$$ $\mathbf{3)}$ Integrate out $x_{m+1}, \ldots, x_n$ to get distribution for $\sum_{j=m}^n X_{(j)}$. (Stuck here) $\mathbf{4)}$ See if this helps to find the asymptotic distribution. ( Actually, not sure if the previous step really helps here ) Details In general, the joint probability density of order statistics of iid samples drawn form continuous distribution $F(x)$ (see here ): $$ f(x_m ,\ldots, x_n) = n! f(x_n) \cdots f(x_{m})\frac{F(x_m)^{m-1}}{(m-1)!} \mathbb{I}\{0 where $\mathbb{I}\{A\}$ is indicator of the set $A$. For the uniform distribution the above yields $$ f(x_m ,\ldots, x_n) = n! \frac{(x_m)^{m-1}}{(m-1)!} \mathbb{I}\{0 Let change of variables $$ \tau: \left(X_{(m)}, \ldots, X_{(n)}\right) \to \left(\underbrace{\sum_{j=m}^n X_{(j)}}_{Y}, X_{(m+1)}, \ldots, X_{(n)}\right)\,. $$ $$ \tau^{-1}(Y, X_{(m+1)}, \ldots, X_{(n)}) \to \left(Y - \sum_{j=m+1}^n X_{(j)}\,, X_{(m+1)}\,, \ldots\,, X_{(n)}\right). $$ The determinant of the Jacobian of the inverse $\tau^{-1}$ is one. The distribution after the change of variables is $$ f(y, x_{m+1}, \ldots, x_n) = n! \frac{(y - \sum_{j=m+1}^n x_{j})^{m-1}}{(m-1)!} \mathbb{I}\left\{0 Basically, at this point I want to be able to integrate $$ \int \cdots \int n! \frac{(y - \sum_{j=m+1}^n x_{j})^{m-1}}{(m-1)!} \mathbb{I}\left\{0 $$ = \int_{\frac{y}{2}}^y dx_{m+1} \int_{\frac{y-x_{m+1}}{2}}^y dx_{m+2} \cdots \int_{\frac{y- \sum_{j=1}^kx_j}{2}}^y d{x_{k+1}} \cdots \int_{\frac{y-\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}x_j}{2}}^y n! \frac{(y - \sum_{j=m+1}^n x_{j})^{n-m-1}}{(n-m-1)!} d{x_{n}} \,. $$ I am stuck, can't see an easy way to disentangle the resulting integral .
