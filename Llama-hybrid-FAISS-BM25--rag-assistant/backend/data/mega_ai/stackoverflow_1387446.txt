Can you break up your text and append it in chunks? Wrap portions of the text into div tags and then split them apart adding the smaller divs into the page. While this won't speed the overall process, the perceived performance likely will be better as the user sees the first elements more quickly while the rest loads later, presumably off the visible page. Additionally you probably should reconsider how much data you are sending down and embedding into the page. If the browser is slow chances are the amount of data is bound to be huge - does that really make sense to the user? Or would a paging interface (or other incremental load mechanism) make more sense?
