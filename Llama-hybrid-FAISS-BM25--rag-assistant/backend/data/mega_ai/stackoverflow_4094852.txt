I have the same problem, and here's what I am planning on doing... Set a persistent cookie. Check the cookie to decide whether a particular vote could be cast. Additionally store some data about the vote request in the form of a combination of IP address + User Agent. And then use this value to limit the no. of votes to, say, 10 per day. What is the best way of going about creating this hash (IP + UA String)?
