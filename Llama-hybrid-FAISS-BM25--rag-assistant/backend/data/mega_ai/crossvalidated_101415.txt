It seems to me that that a KPCA with linear kernel should be the same as the simple PCA. The covariance matrix that you are going to get the eigenvalues from is the same: $$ linearKPCA_{matrix} = \frac{1}{l} \sum_{j=1}^{l}K(x_{j},x_{j}) = \frac{1}{l} \sum_{j=1}^{l}x_{j}x_{j}^T = PCA_{matrix} $$ You can check with more details here .
