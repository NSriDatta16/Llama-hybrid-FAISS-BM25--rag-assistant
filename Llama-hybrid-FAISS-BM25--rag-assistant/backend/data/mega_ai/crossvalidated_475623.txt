Having given this some thought (and since no one has answered the question yet), I offer the following intuitive explanation (but I look forward to more answers and comments here): (i) Time-Series : it would appear that we use time series predominantly for phenomena that only ever offer us "one observation path": whether that be an earthquake, historical rain-falls, or annual milk-consumption in a specific region, etc. (ii) Brownian Motion : it would appear that we use Brownian motion (and other similar stochastic processes) to simulate predominantly processes that can be performed in a lab in a controlled experiment: and therefore we assume that these can be repeated many times with "the same" conditions. Therefore the auto-covariance and auto-correlation functions have a slightly different interpretation. In a time-series model, it would appear that the auto-covariance and auto-correlation tell us how "often" the various observations at different points in time lie on the same side of the series "mean" as other, previous observations with a specific lag. The full population in this case is a time-series stretching to infinity over time. In a Brownian-motion model, as alluded to in my question, the population is the same experiment or phenomena performed infinitely many times under the same conditions. The auto-covariance and auto-correlation then tell us how "often" we would expect the various observations at specific points in time to lie on the same side of the "mean" as other observations at other specific points in time. Ps: I do look forward to more comments, answers and general discussion that might appear here. For example, the fascinating thing is that we use both time-series as well as Brownian motion, to simulate stock-prices.
