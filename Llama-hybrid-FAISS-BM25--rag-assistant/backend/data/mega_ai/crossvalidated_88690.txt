Probably the most common way to look at this kind of thing, if you're only interested in the proportions, is to assume that at the $i$th location $A_i$ & $B_i$ are independent Poisson variables with rates $\lambda_i$ & $\mu_i$ respectively. (That doesn't seem unreasonable for two types of car crashes at the same location over a limited period of time.) The joint mass function is $$\newcommand{\e}{\mathrm{e}} f_{A_i,B_i}(a_i,b_i) = \frac{\lambda_i^{a_i} \e^{-\lambda_i}}{a_i!} \cdot \frac{\mu_i^{b_i} \e^{-\mu_i}}{b_i!}$$ Reparametrize with $$\pi_i = \frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_i+\mu_i}$$ $$\nu_i= \mu_i+\lambda_i$$ , let $$N_i = A_i+B_i$$ , & the joint density can be written as $$f_{A_i,N_i}(a_i,n_i)=\frac{1}{a_i!(n_i-a_i!)}\cdot\pi_i^{a_i} (1-\pi_i)^{n_i-a_i}\cdot \nu_i^{n_i} \e^{\nu_i}$$ Note that $\pi_i$, what you're interested in, & $\nu_i$, the nuisance parameter, separate cleanly; $N_i$ is sufficient for $\nu_i$, & $(A_i,N_i)$ sufficient for $\pi_i$. Sum over $a_i$ to get the marginal distribution of $N_i$, which is also Poisson, with rate $\nu_i$: $$f_{N_i}(n_i)= \frac{\nu_i^{n_i} \e^{-\nu_i}}{n_i!}$$ Conditioning on the observed value of the ancillary complement $N_i=n_i$ gives $$f_{A_i|N_i=n_i}(a_i;n_i)=\frac{n_i!}{a_i!(n_i-a_i!)}\cdot\pi_i^{a_i} (1-\pi_i)^{n_i-a_i}$$ , i.e. a binomial distribution for $A_i$ successes out of $n_i$ trials. I'm not sure what your concern is about locations where there are no eventsâ€”there's simply no data at these to estimate the proportion of type-A crashes because there weren't any crashes. That doesn't stop you estimating $\pi_i$ at other locations. If location is the only predictor you have a simple $2\times k$ contingency table for the $k$ locations with data. If there are continuous predictors you can use a logistic regression model. If you want to make estimates for the $n=0$ locations you need in some way to borrow information from other locations: e.g. with predictors whose coefficients are estimated from other locations, treating location as a random effect. A Bayesian multi-level model might be quite useful, as some locations will have small, though non-zero, event counts, & estimates for these will be pulled further in the direction of the global model.
