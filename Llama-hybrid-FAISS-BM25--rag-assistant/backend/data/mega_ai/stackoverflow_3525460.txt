There is some confusion by the, not unusual, way you have organised your code. As a general rule of Java, don't subclass where you have no reason to. It rarely makes sense to subclass JPanel or JFrame . It also rarely makes sense to assign components to fields in the class that creates them. In fact, do less in constructors. Also do less in anonymous inner classes. Detangle the event data and call a method that makes sense for the enclosing class to have as an operation.
