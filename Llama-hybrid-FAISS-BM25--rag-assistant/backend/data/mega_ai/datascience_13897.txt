Word vectors as input

I have a corpus on which I want to perform sentiment analysis using LSTM and word embeddings. I have converted the words in the documents to word vectors using Word2Vec. My question is how to input these word vectors as input to Keras? I don't want to use the embeddings provided by Keras.
