With structured data, like your example, both you and your co-worker are relatively "wrong". From the looks of things, you should have implemented an array of structures, assuming of course that the data you are presenting is truly unordered, which I would be willing to guess it probably isn't. Arrays are used too often, because they are amongst the first data structures we learn, but very often aren't the best choice. As to performance, that more often comes down to the data access code than the data type itself. Frankly too, unless you are dealing with gigantic datasets or literally real time applications, performance should be a non issue. As to the two examples you have posted, after the compiler is done with them, they will be virtually identical.
