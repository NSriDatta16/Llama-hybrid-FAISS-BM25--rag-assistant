Just as null hypothesis significance tests ("sig. or non-sig.?") have been widely criticized for answering a question that interests few people, the use of a cutoff in assessing reliability is not generally very helpful. It's better to treat reliability as something that's measured on a scale. And note that, yes, for some contexts 0.7 is highly satisfactory whereas for others (e.g., educational testing) even 0.9 might not be. Also important is the way reliability is established. I take it from your description that you've measured it in a single way (perhaps via Cronbach's alpha) when using multiple methods (test-retest? interrater? etc.) might shed additional light on the situation. Further, reliability can sometimes be at odds with validity. A measure that is largely unidimensional will have a high Cronbach's alpha but may capture a given construct less completely than a measure that has a lower alpha but wider coverage. So the dimensionality and construct validity of your measures is worth considering carefully.
