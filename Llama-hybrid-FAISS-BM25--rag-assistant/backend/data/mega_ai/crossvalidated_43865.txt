Is multilevel analysis with aggregation terms the best approach for this situation?

My research model has two levels of dependent variable, at the organizational level and a predictor variable at individual level. I have 500 answers from 5 middle managers (in each firm) in 100 firms at an individual level and 200 from 2 top managers (in each firm) from the same 100 firms. My question is whether aggregation of each data set and using mean score in regression is the best option? If yes, what are the aggregation terms? If not what other option or software is the best to fit this model?
