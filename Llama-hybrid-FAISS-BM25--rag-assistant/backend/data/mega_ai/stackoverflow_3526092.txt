Trying to AVOID an ASP.NET session using cURL

I'm using a web-service from a provider who is being a little too helpful in anticipating my needs. They have given me a HTML snippet to paste on my website, for users to click on to trigger their services. I'd prefer to script this process, so I've got a php script which posts a cURL request to the same url, as appropriate. However, this provider is keeping tabs on my session, and interprets each new request as an update of the first one, rather than each being a unique request. I've contacted the provider regarding my issue, and they've gone so far as to inform me that their system is working as intended, and that it's impossible for me to avoid using the same ASP.NET session for each subsequent cURL request. While my favored option would be to switch to a different vendor, that doesn't appear to be an option right now. Is there a reliable way to get a new ASP.NET session with each cURL request? I've tried the following set of CURLOPT 's, to no avail: //initialize curl $ch = curl_init($url); //build a string out of the post_vars $post_str = http_build_query($post_vars); //set the necessary curl options curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 30); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FAILONERROR, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $post_str); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FAILONERROR, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIESESSION, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "UZ_".uniqid()); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_REFERER, CURRENT_SITE_URL."index.php?newsession=".uniqid()); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array("Pragma: no-cache", "Cache-Control: no-cache")); //execute the call to the backend script, retrieve the results $xmlstr = curl_exec($ch);
