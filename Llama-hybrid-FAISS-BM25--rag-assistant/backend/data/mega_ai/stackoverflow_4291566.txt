How to organise the structure of a 3D game?

This is a bit of a vague question but bear with me. I am in the process of writing a game using Python/Pyglet and openGL. I currently have it structured so that there is an object called 'world', in this are other objects with other objects inside them etc. I did it this way because for instance one part of the game is a platform with other objects on it, and when I tilt the platform I want the objects on it to tilt with it. So I do platform.draw() which calls glRotate, glTranslate, then draw each of the objects saving the modelview matrix inbetween, this way all the objects on the platform move together. The first question is, is this a sensible way to organise things or should I be using some other method? I don't have a camera class, currently I am just translating the whole world or parts of it to give the illusion of movement. However, in the future I want to be able to switch viewpoints between objects, so for instance switch from looking down onto the world from above to a 1st person view from one of the objects in the world. So the second question is what is the best way to structure my program so that this will be achievable in the future?
