As for the difference between where, andwhere, and addwhere, i don't believe there is a significant difference from the last time i read the source. I would encourage you to read the Doctrine source, however. It's really simple, and helps fills in the holes in the documentation (there are many). As for complex where statements, I've wondered this myself but haven't had a need for it yet.
