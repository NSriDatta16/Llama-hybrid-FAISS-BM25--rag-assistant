How to evaluate neural network regression model

I have some data with 2963 observations and 7 variables. I want to use regression and train this data using neural network then evaluate the regression model. I've tried splitting the data into training 70% and testing 30% then train the data using neuralnetwork library in R. I've tried evaluating the model using MSE and SSE for MSE I got a value of 0.01026 for SSE I got a value of 4.56215 I don't understand the difference between these two measures and I can't tell if the values I got are good or not. Please help!
