What Relational Databases can Store XML as a Native Type?

I'm investigating approaches for CMS content storage that don't involve entity attribute value models or NoSQL. Some of the problems I'm trying to solve: No DDL for new types Specifying the datatype of a particular node's text() (DTD association?) Querying over JDBC with DDL (e.g. xquery + SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE) not an OO programming API so the client deals with record sets. Data import/export Any scaling/performance concerns As I've not found a comparable question, and if this is well received, I will curate and make a community wiki.
