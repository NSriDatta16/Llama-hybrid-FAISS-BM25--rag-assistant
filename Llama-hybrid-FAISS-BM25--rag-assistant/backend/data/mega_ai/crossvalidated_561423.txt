Is HEGY or CH test better in a small sample (40 monthly observations)?

I have a time series of monthly data that is 40 observations ( $3\frac{1}{3}$ seasonal cycles) long. HEGY test and CH test give contradicting results w.r.t. presence of a seasonal unit root. HEGY test gives that series have seasonal unit roots while CH test gives that all the series do not have seasonal unit roots. Since my sample size is small, which test has the highest power? Due to the relative short sample size, seasonal differencing would cause a significant fraction of observations to get removed. Can I go with CH test results?
