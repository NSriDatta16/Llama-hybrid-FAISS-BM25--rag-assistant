How to invoke $customer->save() on a given event

So I've been tasked with creating a module to login/register a customer in Magento based on existing authentication data from another system. My thought for now is to create a Widget that can be placed by the admin with links. That part I've figured out how to do. The next part is where I may need some assistance. I've read enough articles to understand how to create a custom URL structure in order to fire my Module's actions, so I assume I can link directly to my action, invoke a login or registration request and send the user back to the referral page (or their profile page, I haven't spec'd the project fully so details like this are TBD). Here's where I need some help. I've found the methods that capture the POST request by the login and registration pages -- should I simply extend the Mage_Customer_AccountController class and create my required methods loosely similar to the calls used in loginPostAction() and createPostAction() methods? For reference, I just started some initial project dev on a fresh install of the newly-released 1.5.0.0 The file I'm referring to is /magento/app/code/core/Mage/Customer/controllers/AccountController.php
