This is 4 questions rolled into one, so here are my 4 answers: 1) If your app's purpose is to share information, you shouldn't store anything on the iPhone. Create a simple HTTP server (could be PHP, Ruby, whatever), with a simple interface (GET/POST), with a backing database (could my MySQL, SQL Server, so noSQL, whatever). Make the iPhone send requests to that server, no local storage required. 2) If your database is distant, you'd use NSURLConnection/NSURLRequest (or a Mutable variant). If you use XML, there is a built-in XML facility, if you use JSON, you can use: JSON Framework . 3) You can, with an Enterprise account. Apple Enterprise Developer Program 4) I don't know about Exchange support. I think you should find something in the SDK though.
