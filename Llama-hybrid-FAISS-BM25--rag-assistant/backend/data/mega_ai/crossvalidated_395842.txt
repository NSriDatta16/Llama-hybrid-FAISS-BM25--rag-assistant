One way to think about the seasonality problem is this: Is seasonality of interest or is it just a nuisance? How you deal with seasonality depends on the answer to this question. As an example, if you are interested in describing the pattern of seasonality in a time series of monthly temperatures, then seasonality is of interest and you will not want to remove it - rather, you will want to directly model it (e.g., using sine and cosine terms). However, if you are interested in seeing the association between two time series (e.g., monthly temperatures and monthly relative humidity in the same area for a multi-year period), then you would want to remove the seasonality present in the two time series first and then correlate the residual series to get at the association of interest.
