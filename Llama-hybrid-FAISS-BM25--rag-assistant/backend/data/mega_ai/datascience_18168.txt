xgboost usually performs better after one-hot encoding. Otherwise, it will treat your categorical variables as numerical variables. But most other tree packages support categorical variables; in other words, they support rules such as: If(Car = Mercedes). Again, xgboost , unfortunately, does not. Therefore, you must convert your categorical variables to binary variables so that it can do: If(Car[Mercedes] >= 0.5).
