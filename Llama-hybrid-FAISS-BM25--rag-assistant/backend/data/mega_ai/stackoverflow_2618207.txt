Windows Azure: Creating a subdirectories inside the blob

I wanted to create some subdirectories inside my blob. But it is not working out well Here is my code protected void ButUpload_click(object sender, EventArgs e) { // store upladed file as a blob storage if (uplFileUpload.HasFile) { name = uplFileUpload.FileName; // get refernce to the cloud blob container CloudBlobContainer blobContainer = cloudBlobClient.GetContainerReference("documents"); if (textbox.Text != "") { name = textbox.Text + "/" + name; } // set the name for the uploading files string UploadDocName = name; // get the blob reference and set the metadata properties CloudBlockBlob blob = blobContainer.GetBlockBlobReference(UploadDocName); blob.Metadata["FILETYPE"] = "text"; blob.Properties.ContentType = uplFileUpload.PostedFile.ContentType; // upload the blob to the storage blob.UploadFromStream(uplFileUpload.FileContent); } } What I did is that, If I have to create a sub directory, I will enter the name of the sub directory in the textbox. for example, if I need to create a file named "test.txt" inside the sub directory "files" Then, my textbox.text = files and uplFileUpload.FileName = test.txt Now I will concatenate them and upload to the blob.. But it is not working well.. I am getting just https://test.core.windows.net/documents/files/ I am not getting the entire thing I was expecting https://test.core.windows.net/documents/files/test.txt What am I doing wrong... How to create sub directories inside the blob.
