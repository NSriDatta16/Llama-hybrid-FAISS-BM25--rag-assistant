Also, i recommend you use mod_wsgi instead of mod_python. See deprecation warning on top of this page: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/howto/deployment/modpython/ Support for mod_python will be deprecated in a future release of Django. If you are configuring a new deployment, you are strongly encouraged to consider using mod_wsgi or any of the other supported backends.
