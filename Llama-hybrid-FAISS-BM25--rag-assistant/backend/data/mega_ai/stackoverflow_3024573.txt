Adding an Include Path for a Module in a Simple Perl Tutorial

I'm trying to do a simple tutorial but I'm having trouble getting started. My problem seems to be installing and getting the correct path to the modules. **1. Here is the original code:***** #!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict; use LWP 5.64; my $browser = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $url = 'http://www.cspan.org/RECENT.html'; my $response = $browser->get($url); die "Can't get $url -- ", $response->status_line unless $response->is_success; my $html = $response->content; while( $html =~m/ 2. But in Host Gator they say this: Location of Your Perl Module(s) Path: /home/d********n/perl Using Your Perl Module(s) You will need to add /home/d********n/perl to the include path. You can do this by adding the following code to your script: BEGIN { my $base_module_dir = (-d '/home/d********n/perl' ? '/home/d********n/perl' : ( getpwuid($>) )[7] . '/perl/'); unshift @INC, map { $base_module_dir . $_ } @INC; } 3. So I added the code but have no idea if I added it in the correct spot. #!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict; use LWP 5.64; BEGIN { my $base_module_dir = (-d '/home/d********n/perl' ? '/home/d********n/perl' : ( getpwuid($>) )[7] . '/perl/'); unshift @INC, map { $base_module_dir . $_ } @INC; } my $browser = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $url = 'http://www.cspan.org/RECENT.html'; my $response = $browser->get($url); die "Can't get $url -- ", $response->status_line unless $response->is_success; my $html = $response->content; while( $html =~m/ Any help would be greatly appreciated. FYI, I already made sure the file has the needed permissions 755 Also the LWP::UserAgent has a number of 5.835 in Host Gator. Does that mean I have to change use LWP 5.64; to use LWP 5.835
