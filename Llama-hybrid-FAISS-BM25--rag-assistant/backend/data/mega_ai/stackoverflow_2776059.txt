I think many bots would be identifiable by user-agent, but surely not all of them. A list of known IPs - I wouldn't count on it either. A heuristic approach might work. Bots are usually much quicker at following links than people. Maybe you can track each client's IP and detect the average speed with which it following links. If it's a crawler it probably follows every link immediately (or at least much faster than humans).
