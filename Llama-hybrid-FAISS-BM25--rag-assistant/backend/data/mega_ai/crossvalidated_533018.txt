Calculating representative sample of pareto distribution

I have a Pareto-distributed population of size N. If I wish to be 99% confident, with 0.75% margin of error, and empirically 35% made a good sample - what will be the formula to derive the sufficient sample of N to be representative? Does it even matter that my population is Pareto distributed? For a long time I was certain I have a 1-sided normally distributed population, and recently I realized it's not the case. I used to calculate the sample needed in the following way (code from a script of mine): error_margin = 0.0075 confidence = 0.99 expected_sample = 0.35 alpha = 1-confidence n_sided = 1 # 1 or 2-sided test z_crit = stats.norm.ppf(1-alpha/n_sided) --- ideal_coverage = (((pow(z_crit, 2)*(expected_sample*(1-expected_sample)))/pow(error_margin, 2))/ (1+((pow(z_crit, 2)*(expected_sample*(1-expected_sample)))/(pow(error_margin, 2)*u_values))))/u_values How do I calculate z score for Pareto anyways?
