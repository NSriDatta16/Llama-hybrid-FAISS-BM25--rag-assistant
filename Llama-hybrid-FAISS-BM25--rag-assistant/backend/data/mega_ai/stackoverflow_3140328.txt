Your hosting service does not allow your scripts to do stuff outside the httpdocs directory of each virtual host and a shared /tmp directory. That seriously restricts the possibilities for information exchange between sites. Tricks I can think of: Store a temporary file in the /tmp directory from the source site and trigger a process in the target site to fetch the file. You can use the curl functions to do so. Store files in a common database. The storage does not need to be permanent if you think that will affect your site performance. Target site just needs to checke whether it has pending incoming files. Add files to a queue (perhaps a special directory inside httpdocs ) and write a command line script to push them to the target site. Run this command with cron (lets say, once every minutes). IMHO, #2 looks feasible and reliable.
