Discrete MCMC JAGS chains get stuck

I have been running a model where one of the parameters is discrete. I can't think of a simple way to represent this model, so I won't (unless necessary) post it here. My issue is, that when I look at the chains, I can see that chains tend to get stuck in local maxima in discrete space. This means that the chains do not mix, and I am left with ugly, bimodal or trimodal distributions. From an examination of likelihood space, I know that the actual distribution should be much smoother. Any idea what this might signify in the model? I suspect it is due to parameter covariance, but I am not sure how to test/remedy this. Any ideas would be most welcome! Edit: please see the model below. There are two discrete parameters $d$ and $Tp$, and two continuous ones, $lambda$ and $nBase$. Sorry for its complexity; I couldn't think of a simpler example that demonstrated its properties: model { for (i in 1:NTotal) { for (j in 1:30) { for (k in 1:36) { A[i,j,k] A indicative read out from plotting the samples for $d$ is shown below: Notice that there is no mixing of the chains for the first case. For the other ones, I can't even see the other chains. Best, Ben
