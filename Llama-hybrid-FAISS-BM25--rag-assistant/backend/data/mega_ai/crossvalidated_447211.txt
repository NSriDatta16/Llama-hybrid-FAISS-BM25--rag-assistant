Typical way to solve this: The ant will either take path a and finish or take path b or c and be back in it's starting position. Let $k$ be the number of times that the ant already has taken path b or c. Let $T_k$ be the expectation value for the time to finish for an ant that took already $k$ times the path. Then the expectation value for an ant with $k$ steps can be expressed in terms of an ant with $k+1$ steps. $$T_k = \underbrace{\frac{1}{3} 7}_{\substack{\frac{1}{3}th\text{ chance to finish with path} \\ \text{ a in 7 minutes }}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{3} (T_{k+1} + 8)}_{\substack{\frac{1}{3}th\text{ chance to finish with path b} \\ \text{ in 8 minutes} \\ \text{plus what ant $k+1$ needs on average }}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{3} (T_{k+1} +12)}_{\substack{\frac{1}{3}th\text{ chance to finish with path c} \\ \text{ in 12 minutes}\\ \text{ plus what ant $k+1$ needs on average }}}$$ Since the ants are in the same starting position independent from the history (number of steps $k$ ) the average time is (you have $T_k = T_{k+1}$ which you can use to solve the above equation) : $$T_k = \frac{1}{3}7+\frac{1}{3}(8+T_k)+\frac{1}{3}(12+T_k)$$ and after some rearrangments $$T_k = 7+8+12 = 27 $$ Using an average You can solve this with a mean, sort of. The ant finishes at least with path a which at least takes at least 7 minutes In addition, the ant has 2/3 probability to take paths b or c (each time) which take on average $\frac{8+12}{1+1} = 10$ minutes. The mean times that the ant takes paths b or c is: $$1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4 + .... = \sum_{k=1}^\infty k \cdot \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^k = 2$$ note that this is related to a geometric distribution and the average number of extra steps that the ant needs is 2 (and each step takes on average 10 minutes). So the ant will take (on average): $$ \text{ $7$ minutes $+$ 2 times $\times$ $10$ minutes $= 27$ minutes}$$ Interestingly: you could also say the mean time for a single step is $9$ minutes (what you computed), and the mean number of steps is $3$ , so the ant takes $3 \times 9 = 27$ minutes (you were not very far from the solution).
