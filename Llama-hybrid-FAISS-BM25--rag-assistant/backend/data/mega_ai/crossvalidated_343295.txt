Significant change between two time series

I have two time series from (A) 1981-2010 and (B) 2011-2017. I noticed some change in the Time B but I do not know how to perform a test to say the change is statistically significant. I have performed Mann-Kendall in the entire time series and results show there is a trend. What I want to know if the change in Time B compared to the rest is significant. This is the sample monthly data from 1981-2017. In the last seven years, there is a rise and I want to know if that is significant.
