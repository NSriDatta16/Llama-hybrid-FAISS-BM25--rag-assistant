Roberto, PHP is server-side technology and therefore runs on the server - so there is no way for it to determine what keys where pressed at the client (aka the user). That is, of course, unless you specifically code the client-side to include such information with the server requests (posting form data is a form of request too). One way to accomplish that is by using Javascript in your client code. See this page as a starting point regarding handling form submit events using Javascript. http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_onSubmit.asp You may also have to add a listener for key press events on your page in order to capture the user pressing the Enter key and then recording this information. http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/tutorials/javascript/domevents offers a discussion on the topic of adding/removing event listeners in Javascript but you have to be very careful when using events because improperly used they can be the source of memory leaks which are hard to debug and cause for unhappy users :)
