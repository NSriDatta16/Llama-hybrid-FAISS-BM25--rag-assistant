how to reference drageventArgs in xaml as command parameter with silverlight

on my silverlight 4 app I am trying to link up the drop event on a list box to my viewmodel. I am using expression blend 4's event trigger and invokecommandaction to hook up the drop event. Setting break points on my viewmodel, I can see the relevant function is fired when I drag a file onto the list box, however I cant seem to get access to the drageventArgs. I tried sending the entire listbox as a command parameter, and that doesn't work. Any ideas? Thanks
