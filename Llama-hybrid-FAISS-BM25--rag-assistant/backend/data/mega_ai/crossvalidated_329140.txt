Regarding the question how the non-identifiability can be addressed, I can recommend to have a look at Improving the Identifiability of Neural Networks for Bayesian Inference , which "eliminates" the (discrete) combinatorial non-identifiability problem through ordering of nodes (as one of the comments suspected). The paper also addresses a continuous non-identifiability problem (related to rescaling-invariance in RELUs) and tries to solve this, too. Very similar problems are encountered in Bayesian mixture models and can be "solved", c.f. the excellent tutorial Identifying Bayesian Mixture Models . Unfortunately, it appears that even after one considers the above, there remains the risk of multiple modes, as discussed here Why are Bayesian Neural Networks multi-modal? . I can also recommend to read section 3.7 of the paper “Issues in Bayesian Analysis of Neural Network Models” , which discusses mechanisms leading to multi-modal behaviour. Besides the ones already mentioned, they also discuss a problem they refer to as "node-duplication"!
