It is generally the case that any valid MCMC scheme for univariate distributions can be applied to a univariate conditional distribution as part of an MCMC scheme for sampling from a multivariate distribution. This fact is used extensively all over the literature on MCMC. Its proof is straightforward. There is no need to prove anything special in this regard for slice sampling in particular.
