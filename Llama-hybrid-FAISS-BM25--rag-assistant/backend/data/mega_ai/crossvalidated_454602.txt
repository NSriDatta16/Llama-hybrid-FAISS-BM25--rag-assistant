T-test with multiple measures per subject

Imagine to have 100 people who have been asked if they are happy 10 consecutive times (time here is not important). Each time we asked, we showed them a card of one color: sometimes green, sometimes of other colors. The same color could appear more than once, over the 10 times. We want to know if happiness is influenced by the green color. So the idea was to make a t-test comparing green vs not-green and see if the average of happiness was significantly different. Would that be ok? Probably not, because multiple measurements per subject are not independent. Which would be the correct approach? (We already have a HLM model, but here we are just interested in comparing means).
