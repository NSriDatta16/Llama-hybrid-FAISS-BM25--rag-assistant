The profiler trace puts it into perspective. Query A: 1.3 secs CPU, 1.4 secs duration Query B: 2.3 secs CPU, 1.2 secs duration Query B is using parallelism: CPU > duration eg the query uses 2 CPUs, average 1.15 secs each Query A is probably not: CPU This explains cost relative to batch: 17% of the for the simpler, non-parallel query plan. The optimiser works out that query B is more expensive and will benefit from parallelism, even though it takes extra effort to do so. Remember though, that query B uses 100% of 2 CPUS (so 50% for 4 CPUs) for one second or so. Query A uses 100% of a single CPU for 1.5 seconds. The peak for query A is lower, at the expense of increased duration. With one user, who cares? With 100, perhaps it makes a difference...
