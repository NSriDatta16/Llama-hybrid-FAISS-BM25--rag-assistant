Are you sure your delegate method is being called? I think the problem is the animation delegate method, which, according to Apple's documentation, must have this signature: [UIView setAnimationDidStopSelector:@selector(animationFinished:finished:context:)]; And then you have a method like this in your class: #pragma mark - #pragma mark UIView animation delegate method - (void)animationFinished:(NSString *)animationID finished:(BOOL)finished context:(void *)context { [self removeFromSuperview]; } Probably your animation delegate is not being called, thus, the object is not released. From the documentation: setAnimationDidStopSelector: Sets the message to send to the animation delegate when animation stops. (void)setAnimationDidStopSelector:(SEL)selector Parameters selector The message sent to the animation delegate after animations end. The default value is NULL. The selector should be of the form: - (void)animationDidStop:(NSString *)animationID finished:(NSNumber *)finished context:(void *)context. Your method must take the following arguments: animationID An NSString containing an optional application-supplied identifier. This is the identifier that is passed to the beginAnimations:context: method. This argument can be nil. finished An NSNumber object containing a Boolean value. The value is YES if the animation ran to completion before it stopped or NO if it did not. context An optional application-supplied context. This is the context data passed to the beginAnimations:context: method. This argument can be nil. Hope this helps!
