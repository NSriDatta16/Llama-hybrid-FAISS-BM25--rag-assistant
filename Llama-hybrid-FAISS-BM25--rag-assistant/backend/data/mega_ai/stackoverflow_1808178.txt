An image cropper: How to prevent the default drag n' drop action?

I am developing an image cropper and would like to ask you the following question: In order to prevent the default drag n' drop action when you press the left button on an image and keeping it pressed try to move the mouse, wouldn't it be cross-browser if to just use the picture as a background to a div box? Just like so: How do you think? Is it acceptable? Not too ugly? Or should be done with JS?
