Profiling ClickOnce *startup* time

I am trying to optimize startup time of one of an internal tool at my company. It however, is deployed via ClickOnce and utilized IsolatedStorage. I am using JetBrains dotTrace 3.1 to profile it but then it would not be able to start the application due to dependency on IsolatedStorage and ApplicationDeployment which requires that the application be run in ClickOnce context. I am aware that I can use manual StopWatch-ing to profile everything. But I thought that I'd ask here first since I am not a regular profiler nor a performance freak. If there's a tool or tips that'd save me time then I'd love to know. Is there a profiling tool that fully supports ClickOnce? Or any suggestions on profiling ClickOnce startup time with JetBrains dotTrace?
