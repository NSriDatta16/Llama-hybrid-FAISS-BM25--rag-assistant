Is there an Event after reordering the TreeGrid of smartclient?

I'm using isomophics smartclient. I have a DataBound TreeGird with drag and drop functionality. If I reorder my nodes the changes are send to the Server. Where do I have to hook into to do something after the server response? If the reorder was Ok I have to refresh some other views. Thanks
