Using Silverlight, and a Grid, You can produce something like this: To do it, define a regular UserControl containing a Grid. (This is the default when you build a silverlight app in VS2008 with the Silverlight 3.0 SDK). Then, add a call to the following in the constructor for the user control: private void SetupBracket(int n) { var black = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Gray); // number of levels, or rounds, in the single-elim tourney int levels = (int)Math.Log(n, 2) + 1; // number of columns in the Grid. There's a "connector" // column between round n and round n+1. int nColumns = levels * 2 - 1; // add the necessary columns to the grid var cdc = LayoutRoot.ColumnDefinitions; for (int i = 0; i slots = new List (); ImageBrush brush = new ImageBrush(); brush.ImageSource = new BitmapImage(new Uri("Bridge.png", UriKind.Relative)); // one loop for each level, or "round" in the tourney. for (int j = 0; j 0) { slots.Add(m); // Have we just inserted two rows? Then we need // a connector between these two and the next // round (the round previously added). if (slots.Count == 2) { string xamlTriangle = " "; Path path = (Path)System.Windows.Markup.XamlReader.Load(xamlTriangle); path.SetValue(Grid.ColumnProperty, 2 * (x - 1) + 1); path.SetValue(Grid.RowProperty, slots[0]); path.SetValue(Grid.RowSpanProperty, slots[1] - slots[0] + 1); this.LayoutRoot.Children.Add(path); slots.Clear(); } } } } } In the above, the connector is just an isosceles triangle, with the apex pointing to the right. It is generated by XamlReader.Load() on a string. You would also want to pretty it up, style it with different colors and fonts, I guess. You can insert this silverlight "user control" into any HTML web page, something like embedding a flash app into a page. There are silverlight plugins for IE, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Chrome. If you don't want to use Silverlight, you could use a similar approach to construct an HTML table.
