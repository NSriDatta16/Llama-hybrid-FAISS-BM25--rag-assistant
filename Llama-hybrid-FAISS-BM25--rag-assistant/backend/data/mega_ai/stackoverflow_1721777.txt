It's a bug in the IE6 onChange event where it doesn't fire until the checkbox loses focus (specifically, when the onBlur event fires). You can test it on your page by clicking one of the boxes, then clicking somewhere else. One fix would be to attach the entire event to the label instead (Most elegant solution). Alternatively, you could take it into your own hands and execute the onClick and onBlur events of the checkbox manually when a label is clicked. This is an unobstrusive solution and shouldn't require any changes to your existing code. $("label").click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $("#" + $(this).attr("for")).click().blur(); }); Not tested but you get the idea :)
