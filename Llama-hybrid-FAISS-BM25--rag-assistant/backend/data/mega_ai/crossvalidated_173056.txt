How exactly do Bayesians define (or interpret?) probability?

Part of a series of trying to understand Bayesian vs frequentist: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 I think I get the difference of how Bayesians and frequentists approach choosing between hypotheses , but I'm not quite sure if or how that is supposed to explain to me how they view probability. From what I understand, according to Wiki , a frequentist "defines" probability as follows: Given probability space $(\Omega, \mathscr{F}, \mathbb{P})$, $\forall A \in \mathscr{F}$, $\mathbb{P}(A) \approx \frac{n_A}{n_t}$, where $n_t$ is the number of trials conducted and $n_A$ is the number of times A has occurred in those trials. Furthermore, $\mathbb{P}(A) = \lim_{n_t \to \infty} \frac{n_A}{n_t}$. Okay, so how do Bayesians define probability? The above seems to be one approach to computing probability of an event in addition to defining a probability. Bayesians seems to assume a prior probability, conduct some trials and then update their probability, but that doesn't really seem to explain how they define what probability is. Wiki says 'Bayesian probability is a quantity that we assign for the purpose of representing a state of knowledge, or a state of belief.' What exactly does that mean? Is state synonymous to degree? For example, Walter's state of belief that a particular coin is fair is represented with the number 0.1 while Jesse's state of belief that the same coin is fair is represented with the number 0.2. Given new information, Walter's state of belief could become 0.96 while Jesse's state of belief could become 0.03. So, initially, Walter was less inclined to believe the coin is fair, but later on Jesse was more inclined to believe the coin is fair? I'm hoping for something in terms of symbols like the frequentist one above. Same Wiki page says 'The Bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of propositional logic that enables reasoning with hypotheses, i.e., the propositions whose truth or falsity is uncertain.', it seems like Bayesian and frequentist probability are analogous to fuzzy and Boolean logic, respectively.
