Flex 3: How do I remove a Component Using a Button in the Component

I'd like to use a button within a component to remove it. So, you click it and the component is gone. But, I haven't figured out how you reference the component from within the component. What should I put in click=""? My component: popCanvas In the main app: var popCanvas:PopCanvas= new PopCanvas; popCanvas.x = 20; popCanvas.y = 30; this.addChild(popCanvas); Any suggestions? Thank you. -Laxmidi
