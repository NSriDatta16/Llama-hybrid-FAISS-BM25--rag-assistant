So it turned out I was going about things the wrong way. I was trying to be efficient and organise my folder structure before doing anything with compass. I realised that I needed to set compass to watch the project first and then create a folder structure. That way the folder structure gets replicated in my stylesheets or CSS folder instead of just being in the source folder. Now everything is working as it should!
