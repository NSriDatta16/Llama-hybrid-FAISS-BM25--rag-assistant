ANOVA on IQ Study Involving Gender, Volume of Brain, and cross section of Corpus Callosum

I've got a study and I'm trying to use ANOVA to determine how the variables are related to each other. Here's what the format of the data is: SEX | IQ | CC_SA (cm^2) | TOT_VOL (cm^3) | M 102 7.99 1173 F 100 8.76 1079 . . . . . . . . . . . . Since the "units" of IQ are different from the Cross Section of the Corpus Callosum, and the overall Volume of the brain, what sort of analysis can I perform to show if there is any relation to IQ and/or gender? If the units don't matter, please explain why that is, when considering for example, that in an ANOVA/MANOVA, columns are summed and added to obtain y.. (overall average). How would the y.. result be acceptable considering that the columns are different units?
