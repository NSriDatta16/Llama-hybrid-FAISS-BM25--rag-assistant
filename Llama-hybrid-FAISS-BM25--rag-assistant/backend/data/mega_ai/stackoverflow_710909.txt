Are you saying that they want to do free-form text entry? If that's the case, they will ruin the ability to do meaningful reporting on the field, because I can guarantee that they will not consistently enter the strings. If they are going to be entering one of several preset strings (for example, grades of A, B, C, etc.) then make a lookup table for those strings which maps to numeric values for sorting, evaluating, averaging, etc. If they really want to be able to start entering in free-form text and you can't dissuade them from it, add another column along the lines of other_entry. Have a predefined value that means "other" to put in your value column. That way, when you're doing reporting you can either roll up all of those random "other" values or you can simply ignore them. Make sure that you add the "other" into your SystemCodes table so that you can keep a foreign key between that and the Results table. If you don't already have one, then you should definitely consider adding one. Good luck!
