The newer versions of P4V (starting with 2009.2, maybe 2009.1) have something called a Dashboard that contains several "Tasks". One of these is Changelists that have not yet been synced to your workspace. In the menu bar go to View -> DashBoard. There is a gear icon on the right of the DashBoard tab bar that allows you to configure your options. One of these is is "Files in my workspace are not at the latest revisions." The unsynced files are organized by changelist.
