Actually NOT THE CASE. Firefox sends an OPTION header like the following: Here is what is getting set by the client in Firefox: OPTIONS /MvcApplication/Json/Test1 HTTP/1.1 Host: acoheni580 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Origin: http://localhost Access-Control-Request-Method: POST Mvc doesnâ€™t know how to handle this because it is only looking for a POST header when using the attribute [HttpPost] To manually allow this: //[HttpPost] [AcceptVerbs(new string[] {"POST","OPTIONS"})]
