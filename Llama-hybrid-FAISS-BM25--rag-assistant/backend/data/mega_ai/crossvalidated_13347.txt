Distributing values according to a given continuous probability distribution

I have a series of continuous probability distributions and the intervals for each distribution of possible values. Now I want to use the distributions to distribute values of a random variable among agents. I have thought of one way to do this, and I'm curious if this is an acceptable method. This is how I would do it: Let P(A Assuming that this is an acceptable technique, I'm still curious as to what an acceptable amount of granularity for the 'chunks' would be. I hope this wan't too confusing and any feedback would be much appreciated. edit: All of my functions take the form of f(x) = a/(b*x)+c over some interval. They are all easily integrable.
