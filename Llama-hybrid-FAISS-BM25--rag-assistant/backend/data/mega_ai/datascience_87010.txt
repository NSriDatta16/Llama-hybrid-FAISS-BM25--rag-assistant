Hyperparameter tunning for Random Forest- choose the best max depth

I'm trying to choose the best parameters for random forest model. For that goal I hae run my model in loop with only one parameter and each time I have changed the number for the parameter max depth. I have created two charts: one for the model score and one for the MAE. this is how the charts look like: My question is what is the right number to take for that parameter? I fell likeI want to choose really low number when the training set and the test set are close to each other and high (the second point, when the accuracy is above 90) : But I see that it gets stabalize much after and i'm afrid that it might lead to overfitting. Is it true? should I choose bigger number from the stable zone or is ok to take low number as long as the training and test data are having the same accuracy and same error?
