You might want to have a look at the book Python for Probability, Statistics, and Machine Learning by Jos√© Unpingco. It provides a rather good mixture of in-depth theory and programming. In particular, he rigorously introduces the relevant theoretical concepts and then nicely complements them with illustrative Python code. Furthermore, he does not use tailor-made modules, but relies on the standard modules (scipy, statsmodels, etc.) in his code chunks.
