I have no problem doing this in 3.2 beta 2. Just make sure to drag it to the left or right side. A blue outline will appear where the button will be placed. Edit: I've managed to reproduce what you're talking about. When I did it successfully, I dragged the item to the "pretty picture", the graphical representation of the view. When I tried dragging it into the view hierarchy, I ran into your problem. Have you tried dragging the button to the actual Navigation Bar? I hope this is clear, I'm not really sure what to call this window.
