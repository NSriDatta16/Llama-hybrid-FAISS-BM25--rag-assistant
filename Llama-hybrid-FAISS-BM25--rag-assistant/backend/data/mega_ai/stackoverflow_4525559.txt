ActionScript - Should Event Dispatching/Listening Be Avoided Where Possible?

recently , i ran into a problem where i needed to access the List object from the List's custom cell renderer class. there were 2 options: listen for and dispatch a custom event to communicate between the 2 classes. reference the List from the cell renderer class with the parent property: List(parent.parent.parent) while it's much easier to choose the second option, i feel that dispatching and listening for a custom event would result in code that's more inline with the design of AVM2, offers greater control for communication and, as it's expected AS3, should be less difficult to debug or maintain within new hands. however, i also feel that using an event is more expensive, requires attention to resource management perhaps making it more difficult to debug and maintain and could be generally overkill. is this simply a matter of needs or taste? should dispatching/listening for custom events be avoided if they can be?
