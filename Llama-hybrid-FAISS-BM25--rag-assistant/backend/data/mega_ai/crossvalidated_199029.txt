Show that $Y_n$ converges to Y almost surely

Let $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of random variables on a probability space $(\Omega , F , P).$ Assume that there is a random variable $Y$ on the same probability space such that for any $\epsilon>0,$ $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty P\{\lvert Y_n-Y \lvert > \epsilon \} Show that $Y_n$ converges to Y almost surely. What I believe to be the definition of almost sure convergence is, $$ P(w: \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}Y_n = Y) = P( \bigcup_{\epsilon>0 \ rationals} \bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty} \bigcup_{n > m}^{\infty} \ \{ |Y_n - Y| Like the answer below suggested. We the apply the Borel-Cantelli Lemma which states $$ \ If \ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n) From our assumptions, since we know for any $\epsilon>0$ , $\sum_{n=1}^\infty P\{\lvert Y_n-Y \lvert > \epsilon \} . If we define $A_n= {|Y_n -Y|>\epsilon}$ , we can say $$P(\bigcup_{\epsilon>0 \ rationals \ } \bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty} \bigcup_{n = m}^{\infty} \{|Y_n-Y|> \epsilon \})=0.$$ Thus applying De-Morgans Law we can say, $$ P(\bigcap_{\epsilon>0 \ rationals \ } \bigcup_{m=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{n=m}^{\infty} \{ |Y_n-Y| This implies $$ P( \bigcup_{\epsilon > 0 \ rationals}\bigcup_{m=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{n=m}^{\infty} \{ |Y_n-Y| We can also note $$\bigcup_{m=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{n=m}^{\infty} \{ |Y_n-Y| \epsilon \}$$ . Is this enough to show it converges almost surely? I remember being told you also have to show the two sets on both the LHS and RHS have the same elements? If so how would you go about doing this?
