The settings is a flat organization with key/value pairs. For simple objects that's not a problem but if you have rich collections and don't want the overhead of deserializing a list just to get to an element, the settings can be problematic. They also require the element to be serializable, whereas using the isolated storage file system you can control the serialization and serialize anything. Furthermore, you can choose the serialization strategy such as binary, JSON, XML, or otherwise. Finally, there is a limit to how effectively settings will serialize objects. I'm not sure what it is because it's not published but more than one developer has told me larger objects or large amounts of objects start to behave erratically, throwing exceptions or not persisting correctly, in the settings. PS - also, since you mentioned Windows Phone 7, there are limits to settings whereas the file system does not have a quota.
