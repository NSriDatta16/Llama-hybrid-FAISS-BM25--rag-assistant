What you are describing here is a non-linearity. From a modeling perspective, most non-linearities can be accommodated by creating a clever set of derived variables. The model which only adjusts for $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$ as covariates is not correct . Therefore this is not so much a limitation of the GLM as it is one of specifying the right mean model. For this answer, a caveat: large is not well-defined. Is it 40? 80? I am assuming we know what large is, it is a clear break-point, and once we exceed it, linear effects in $X_1, X_2, X_3$ are otherwise acceptable. You can create the indicator variable: x3large as 0 if $X_3$ is small and 1 if $X_3$ is large. Take the product of this indicator variable with the other 3 $X_1, X_2, X_3$. The numerator degrees of freedom for the model now goes from 4 to 7. The interaction terms' coefficients represent a difference in coefficient slopes when $X_3$ is large. When the interaction term is of opposite sign but less than the original coefficient, it represents a decrease in effect. If they are of the same sign, the effect is larger in that large domain. Per your scientific description of the trend: if the data resemble the process you have described, maximizing the likelihood is all you need to do. The interaction with x3large and x1, x2 will be negative to attenuate their effect. The interaction with x3large and x3 will be positive to "ramp up" it's effect. Now I advise stopping here. If the optimal fit to the data is not as you describe, this is an interesting result. We assumed a trend and results were found otherwise. It is possible however to fit models which are constrained to achieve effects only as you describe. The first method is constrained optimization. You can add a lagrange multiplier to the likelihood to offset the cases when the interaction terms are not of the desired sign. Similarly, you can conduct a Bayesian analysis with 0 prior probability on those values. The predictions from the constrained models could be compared to the unrestricted, full model to make qualitative inference on the validity of either approach.
