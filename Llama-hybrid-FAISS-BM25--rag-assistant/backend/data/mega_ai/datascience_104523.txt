There is a nice overview of possible techniques/models for R-Packages: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html Especially have a look at the section "Multivariate Time Series Models" (e.g. Vector autoregressive (VAR) models). However, other approaches could be interesting for you as well. In case you have a sufficient amount of data, you could also look at neural nets, i.e. with LSTM layers. Find a instructive example here: https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_weather_forecasting/
