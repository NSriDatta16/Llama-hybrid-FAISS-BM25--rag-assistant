Well as others have already said, it depends on many factors. But from you question it seems the architects are proposing moving the stored procedures from inside DB to dynamic SQL inside the application. That sounds very dubious to me. SQL is a set oriented language and business logic that requires massaging of large amount of data records would be better in SQL. Think complicated search and reporting type function. On the other hand line item edits with corresponding business rule validation is much better being done in a programming language. Caching of slow changing data in app tier is another advantage. This is even better if you have dedicated middle tier service that acts as a gateway to all the data. If data is shared directly among disparate applications then stored proc may be a good idea. You also have to factor the availability/experience of SQL talent vs programming talent in the organisation. There is realy no general answer to this question.
