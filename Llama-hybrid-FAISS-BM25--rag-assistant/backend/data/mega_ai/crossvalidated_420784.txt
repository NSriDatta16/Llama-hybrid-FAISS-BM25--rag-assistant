This is called interval-censored data - the true (unobserved) value you are trying to estimate for each individual lies within an (observed) interval. There are a number of ways to deal with this. Knowing nothing else, you could take a multiple imputation approach in which the imputation model is simply a discrete uniform variable covering your interval. In other words, take your dataset, and for each individual, randomly generate a point in between 0 and that individual's total exposure time. Do this a number of times (say, ten times) and generate a KM curve. You can then "average" the ten Kaplan-Meier curves (i.e. take the average for each point) to get an estimate of the true KM curve. Standard errors (and a confidence band around your KM curve) can be computed too if you need those. This approach should be able to appropriately deal with the monotonicity issue you bring up.
