Penalized maximum likelihood estimation with a quadratic penalty function is often called ridge logistic regression. The penalty is not applied to the intercept. The higher the value of the penalty parameter (aka ridge parameter) the closer to zero are the penalized maximum likelihood estimates. The optimum penalty can often be chosen using "effective AIC" as shown in http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/FHHandouts/iscb98.pdf . Once the penalized log-likelihood is formed, maximizing the penalized log likelihood can be done quite easily using standard methods such as Newton-Raphson with step-halving.
