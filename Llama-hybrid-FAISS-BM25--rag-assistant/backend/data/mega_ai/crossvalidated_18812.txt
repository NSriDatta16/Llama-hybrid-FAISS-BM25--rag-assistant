It's historical, and pragmatic; Nelder and Wedderburn reverse-engineered GLMs, as the set of models where you can find the MLE using Fisher scoring (i.e. Iteratively ReWeighted Least Squares). The algorithm came before the models, at least in the general case. It's also worth remembering that IWLS was what they had available back in the early 70s, so GLMs were an important class of models to know about. The fact you can maximize GLM likelihoods reliably using Newton-type algorithms (they typically have unique MLEs) also meant that programs like GLIM could be used by those without skills in numerical optimization.
