How can I track issue from multiple different issue-trackers in a single place?

Like a lot of open-source developers I find myself interacting with maybe dozens of different projects' issue trackers - some for work, some as a hobbyist; some frequently, some more rarely; sometimes to report bugs, sometimes to contribute patches, sometimes to follow others' bug reports that affect me, sometimes to organize my own work on my own projects. The problem is, this activity is scattered across different web apps ( github, bitbucket, trac, bugzilla, mantis, jira , ...) on different projects all over the web and there's no one place to check status of issues I'm trying to stay on top of. I want one dashboard kind of app where I can browse, search, and sort (by updated date, priority, etc) everything assigned to me, or any bugs I've reported, or any bugs I'm watching for updates - across all projects - without having to manually re-enter all those issues into the dashboard: I want to just feed it a URL to an existing issue in some other tracker and it'll track that issue's status for me. You could almost get there with just an RSS feed reader, except to be really useful the app would need to know more about the relevant metadata so you can sort and filter as needed. Has anybody built anything like that ? Bonus if it provides write capabilities too, at least for common tasks like adding a comment, marking resolved. I've never heard of any such thing, and I'm constantly wishing for it. If it doesn't exist I might have to take a crack at it.
