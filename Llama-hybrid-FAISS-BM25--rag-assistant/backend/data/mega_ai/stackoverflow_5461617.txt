Using git and submodule, what's a good folder structure?

I use git with submodules, and I've hard time to figure out how to organize my files. I develop in PHP, and use unit testing. So right now, I use this organization for each module: src/ tests/ That seems like a brilliant idea, but the problem is that when I do a "git submodule add" to a project, I'll have that path: project/modules/News/src/index.php The src/ folder is really problematic. Should I simply put all my file in the module root, and have a tests/ folder mixed in the source ? To me that sound bad. What are you doing ? Edit: The src/ Folder is problematic because of the autoload. I should not have to put "src" in all my class name...
