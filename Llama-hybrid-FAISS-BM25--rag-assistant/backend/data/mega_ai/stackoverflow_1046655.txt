You need to add the path to the currently executing module to the sys.path variable. Since you called it on the command line, the path to the script will always be in sys.argv[0]. import sys import os sys.path.append(os.path.split(sys.argv[0])[0]) Now when import searches for the module, it will also look in the folder that hosts the agent.py file.
