The whole idea is that the residuals from a useful model are roughly normal. The distribution of the observed series is not an issue. Post an example of your time series data and I will try and help further, See stats.stackexchange.com/questions/18844/… for a discussion of time series data , outlier adjustment and power transforms – For example your first histogram might simply be reflecting day-of-the-week effects . After adjusting for day-of-the-week effects the conditional histogram ( i.e. the errors from the fixed effects model ) might be quite normal or nearly so. AFTER RECEIPT OF DATA: I submitted your data to AUTOBOX which has an automatic transfer function modelling option and obtained and . The residuals from this model are here and here . The forecasts are here for the next 12 periods The Actual/Fit and Forecast graph is here
