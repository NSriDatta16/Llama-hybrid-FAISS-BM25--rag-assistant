What is the conjugate of the noncentral hypergeometric distribution?

I want to find the conjugate prior distribution for the Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution ? Basically I want to integrate the parameters out of the distributions to arrive at the Bayesian Likelihood of observing some data with the noncentral hypergeometric distribution.
