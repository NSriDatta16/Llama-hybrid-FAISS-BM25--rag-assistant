JavaScript image popup library that allows you to open several images on the same time?

I'm looking for a JS library that will allow me to open several images by clicking on their thumbnails and be able move the opened windows (divs) by dragging them. It has to allow you to open more than one image at a time (so you could drag them and compare them).
