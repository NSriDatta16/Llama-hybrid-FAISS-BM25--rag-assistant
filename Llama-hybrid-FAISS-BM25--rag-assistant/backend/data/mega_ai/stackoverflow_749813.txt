you can have browser scroll to a position down the page by including a fragment part in the url that links to the page. e.g. http://example.com/index.html#section3 will scroll the page to the element with 'id' section3. you can use that id on a link, paragraph, etc. the browser will make sure the element is visible after the rendering.
