Unfortunately it looks like xtree is part of the underlying implementation of map in VC7, and as such there isn't much that can be done to mitigate it. It looks like it's a bug in the standard library. Is it a possibility to use a newer compiler? I'm fairly sure there are free downloads of more recent versions of the compiler you could use, and perhaps they've fixed this issue. If that's not an option, probably the best solution is to wrap the include of map into your own private header, complete with a comment and the #pragma + include lines you already discovered (in addition to an include of map . This way you hide the workaround from normal use.
