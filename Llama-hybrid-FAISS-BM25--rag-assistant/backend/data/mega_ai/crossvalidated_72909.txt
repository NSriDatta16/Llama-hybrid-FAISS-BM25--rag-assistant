It depends on which language you are more familiar with. randomForest package implements the original Fortran version of Breiman's random forest. You should try to modify the Fortran code then. party packages has everything implemented in C. So, you can try to modify the C code. WEKA RandomForest is implemented in Java and involves the classes Bagging and RandomTree . Honestly, I am more familiar with Java and I would use WEKA then. I actually implemented some ensemble pruning techniques in WEKA and it was pretty simple.
