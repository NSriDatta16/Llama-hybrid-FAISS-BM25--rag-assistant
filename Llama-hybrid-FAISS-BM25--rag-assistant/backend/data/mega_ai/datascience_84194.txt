Centering the data on zero and scaling to variance of one helps with a lot of classification problems but in this case it would remove information that's needed to solve your problem as I understand it. Another possible problem is the loss function, which you don't mention at all in your question. I would suggest something that stays fairly high when your neural network is only learning one of the two rules.
