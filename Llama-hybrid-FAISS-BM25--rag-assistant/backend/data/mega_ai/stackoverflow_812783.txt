This baffled me as well, several times. I'd installed VS2005 before and just had to go through this headache again as I'm rebuilding my notebook. The installer for VS2005Pro never asks me my organization, just a user name. Then it defaults to the notebook manufacturer. Since I do not work for the manufacturer of my notebook, I think it might be trouble for me later if I shipped stuff out with that manufacturer's name embedded on it. AND I'd already intuited that it ought to be tweakable from the registry, AND even gone so far as to export the whole registry and done a global search-and-replace from notepad, AND cleaned up those straggling keys that were locked when I reloaded my edited registry. No effect. Giovanni Galbo in his answer wrote to reference the article: http://bytes.com/forum/thread635503.html and also mentioned the key it borrows from if there isn't already a Registered Organization. But what if "RegisteredOrganization" isn't present? It still defaults to "". ADD the key. Set the value yourself. Fixed. I assume this works just as well with most other versions of VS, including VS2008.
