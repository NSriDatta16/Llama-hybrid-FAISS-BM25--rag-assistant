Using fixed effects predictors with same cluster structure as random intercept in multilevel model

Say, I have following data from different countries, with following variables: for_xs - should people, not being from that country, have access to publicly funded health care? (yes/no, my dependent variable) health_expend - expenditure in each country for health care forgo - do people not use health services because they cannot afford income , age - equivalent income and age of respondent country - country where respondent lives The variables health_expend and forgo have just one value within each country, because they represent the mean amount of money spend for health care (health_expend) and the proportion of people in that country that forgo care. So, these variables do not vary for observations within a country. First, here is the sample data: structure(list(country = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L), .Label = c("AU-Australia", "BE-Belgium", "BG-Bulgaria", "CL-Chile", "CN-China", "TW-Taiwan", "HR-Croatia", "CZ-Czech Republic", "DK-Denmark", "FI-Finland", "FR-France", "DE-Germany", "IL-Israel", "IT-Italy", "JP-Japan", "KR-Korea (South)", "LT-Lithuania", "NL-Netherlands", "NO-Norway", "PH-Philippines", "PL-Poland", "PT-Portugal", "RU-Russia", "SK-Slovak Republic", "SI-Slovenia", "ZA-South Africa", "ES-Spain", "SE-Sweden", "CH-Switzerland", "TR-Turkey", "GB-Great Britain", "US-United States"), class = "factor"), for_xs = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 1L), .Label = c("Disagree", "Agree" ), class = "factor"), health_expend = c(3970, 3970, 3970, 3970, 3970, 4079, 4079, 4079, 4079, 4079, 1080, 1080, 1080, 1080, 1080, 1478, 1478, 1478, 1478, 1478, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), forgo = c(9.2, 9.2, 9.2, 9.2, 9.2, 11.5, 11.5, 11.5, 11.5, 11.5, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 8.4, 17.7, 17.7, 17.7, 17.7, 17.7, 17.7, 17.7, 17.7, 17.7, 17.7), income = structure(c(NA, 1L, 2L, 2L, NA, 3L, 1L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, NA, 1L, 3L, 1L, 3L, 3L, NA, NA, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 3L, 3L ), .Label = c("low", "medium", "high"), class = "factor"), AGE = c(52, 66, 34, 69, 64, 91, 48, 33, 67, 26, 56, 19, 44, 18, 60, 70, 31, 48, 48, 44, 35, 62, 59, 70, 54)), .Names = c("country", "for_xs", "health_expend", "forgo", "income", "AGE"), row.names = c(NA, -25L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame")) This is how the data looks like: # A tibble: 25 Ã— 6 country for_xs health_expend forgo income AGE 1 AU-Australia Disagree 3970 9.2 NA 52 2 AU-Australia Disagree 3970 9.2 low 66 3 AU-Australia Disagree 3970 9.2 medium 34 4 AU-Australia Disagree 3970 9.2 medium 69 5 AU-Australia Disagree 3970 9.2 NA 64 6 BE-Belgium Agree 4079 11.5 high 91 7 BE-Belgium Disagree 4079 11.5 low 48 8 BE-Belgium Agree 4079 11.5 high 33 9 BE-Belgium Agree 4079 11.5 high 67 10 BE-Belgium Agree 4079 11.5 high 26 # ... with 15 more rows When I compute logistic regressions for each country subset, estimates for these variables can't be computed, of course: glm(for_xs ~ health_expend + forgo + income + AGE, data = filter(tmp, country == "BE-Belgium"), family = binomial) ## Call: glm(formula = for_xs ~ health_expend + forgo + income + AGE, ## family = binomial, data = filter(tmp, country == "BE-Belgium")) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) health_expend forgo incomehigh AGE ## -2.457e+01 NA NA 4.913e+01 -1.360e-11 ## ## Degrees of Freedom: 4 Total (i.e. Null); 2 Residual ## Null Deviance: 5.004 ## Residual Deviance: 2.143e-10 AIC: 6 However, I want to run a multilevel model, with country as random intercept: glmer(for_xs ~ health_expend + forgo + income + AGE + (1 | country), data = tmp, family = binomial) There are some warnings, but I have coefficients for all predictors. My question is: Does it make sense to include health_expend and forgo in the multilevel-model, because they virtually are just "copies" of the country -variable? They have no variance within each country. Why would I include health_expend and forgo in a multilevel-model anyway? My feeling is, I would not. However, some of my colleagues say, it's a useful information. This is true from a theoretical perspective, but from a statistical perspective I would argue that this only makes sense if these variables also vary within countries.
