I don't think these two things are analagous. FMDB is merely a wrapper around the native SQLite APIs, CoreData is an object persistence framework for which SQLite is one possible persistent storage type. Check out the CoreData Programming Guide from Apple: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/cdProgrammingGuide.html As well as this guide to developing with CoreData on the Mac: https://developer.apple.com/macosx/coredata.html CoreData does not offer primary key uniquing though, typically uniquing is handled by your application code. FMDB, or even the native SQLite API's might be better for you depending on your specific requirements.
