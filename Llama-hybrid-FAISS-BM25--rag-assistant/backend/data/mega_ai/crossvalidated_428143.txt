What does add Gauss Random Noise mean?

I'm reading a article about LSSVM and in numerical part they created an artificial example and it says: The two features of samples are uniformly distrubuted in $[0,1)$ and $(1,2]$ with 50% of Gauss random noise for positive and negative class respectively. In this way our data set will be almost separable. I was trying to reproduce this example in MATLAB, however, I don't know what "with 50% of Gauss random noise" mean, in order to understand it I google it and I discovered the commands awgn and wgn in Matlab but I can't understand what all arguments do. I continued looking for answers and I find that a possible interpretation is pos = rand(2,10) + 0.5randn(2,10) pos = 2*rand(2,10) + 0.5randn(2,10) is it right? Is there a reference to understand more about gauss radom noise? Thank you for any help.
