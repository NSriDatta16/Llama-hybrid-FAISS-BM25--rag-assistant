Running JWS remotely on 64-bit machine

The problem is that my JNLP file works locally on my 64-bit machine (running on my own machine), and locally and remotely on my 32-bit machine - but not remotely on the 64-bit machine (you see the Java 6... message for a looong time, and then it just terminates!). Any suggestions about how to trouble-shoot this? Should I specify different libraries for 64-bit and 32-bit? FWIW the jnlp file looks like this (maybe quite wrong!): DrawFBP J.P. Morrison Enterprises, Ltd. FBP Diagramming Tool and javahelp.jnlp is as follows: Java Help Sun Microsystems Java Help 2.0 TIA
