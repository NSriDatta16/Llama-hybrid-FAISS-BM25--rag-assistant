Using Poisson process model for prediction

Suppose some event $X$ occurs on average $10$ times per minute. The events are independent of each other. Now, if I have understood correctly, this can be modeled as a Poisson process, and I can ask questions such as: What is the probability that $X$ occurs more than 15 times per minute? Now, I have a certain classifier for detecting the events $X$ automatically. Knowing that the process is Poisson, could I help the classifier? I am thinking of something like when the time since the last event increases, the probability of the next event occurring also increases. This probability could be used as an additional parameter for the classifier. Does that make sense?
