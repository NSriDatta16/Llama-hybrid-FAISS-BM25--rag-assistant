Semantic representation of a chart

I'm recoding an old site that contains a chart similar to this: alt text http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/240752/rental-chart.gif How would this chart be represented with pure HTML? I'm loathed to just include it as an image. I'm thinking a table, just replaced with an image, or perhaps overlaid with absolutely positioned table rows, but I think that may be a bit fragile. Any suggestions welcomed.
