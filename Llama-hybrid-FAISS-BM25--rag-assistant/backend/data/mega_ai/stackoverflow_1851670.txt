If you want to make layout more "fluid," specifically the slogan in the header, try making the following changes to .top_text .top_text { float: right; font-family: "Lucida Grande",Verdana,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 60px; margin-right: 20px; padding-top: 24px; } You will still need to establish a minimum width for the page. Because IE6 doesn't support the min-width property, I often achieve this simply by placing an empty div with the desired minimum width at the top of whatever container I would otherwise use min-width on.
