Here's mine, although I must admit that sometimes I just start typing without using the template. I set it up as a modulino so it's easy to add testing to it later: #!perl package App::XXX; use utf8; use 5.010; use strict; use warnings; use vars qw($VERSION); $VERSION = '0.01_01'; __PACKAGE__->run( @ARGV ) unless caller; sub run { my( $class, @args ) = @_; } 1; If you want to set all of your filehandles to some encoding automatically, you could add the open pragma: use open IO => ':utf8'; I have another template for documentation that I add later. Also, some people have editor sequences that they add as comments at the top or the bottom of the script. Perhaps: # -*- Mode: cperl; coding: utf-8; cperl-indent-level: 4 -*- # vim: ts=4 sts=4 sw=4: Since I put my scripts into distributions, the installation process automatically fixes up the shebang line so it doesn't matter what I put there.
