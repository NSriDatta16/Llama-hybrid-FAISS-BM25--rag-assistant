As someone with no formal training, you might have an easier time getting started with Lua . The main advantages are that Lua was originally designed in part for petroleum geologists, so the syntax is readily accessible to people without formal training in computer science. The system is small enough and simple enough that you can understand everything . This will enable you to spend more time coming up to speed on new concepts and new ideas. There is an excellent book: Roberto Ierusalimschy's Programming in Lua ; you can get the previous edition free online . I've compared Python and Lua elsewhere .
