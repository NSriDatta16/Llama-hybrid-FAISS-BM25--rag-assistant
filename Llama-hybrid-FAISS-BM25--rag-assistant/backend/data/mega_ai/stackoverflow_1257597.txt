Jquery Webapplications

I read now a few days here and i learn a lot of things. Now i want to ask you, if you know web based applications, which uses jQuery. At the Moment i have only one example: http://gantter.com/ My special interests are webapplications not websites. I know the technologies are the same - but the view is totally diffrent. I hope to start a intresting Linklist with this question.
