Any forecasting method that outputs predictive densities (also known as density forecasts , i.e., density functions giving the predicted distribution of the next observation) would address your needs. (Note that these are related to a prediction-interval , which in turn is not the same as a confidence-interval , a common confusion.) Suppose the last observation was $y$, and the predictive density for the next observation is $\hat{F}$. Then the probability that the next value will be 25% lower is $\hat{F}(0.75y)$, the probability that it will be 25% higher will be $1-\hat{F}(1.25y)$, and the probability for "none of the above" will be $\hat{F}(1.25y)-\hat{F}(0.75y)$. You don't say what kind of time series you have (continuous, discrete, intermittent-time-series , lumpy), but of course you should use a forecasting method that is appropriate for your series. For instance, here is an illustration using ets() in the forecast package. This is not a use case that forecast.ets() was built for, so the output is a little painful to parse. # library(forecast) # model The last observation was 432. Taking somewhat narrower intervals (because the forecasts simply don't envisage sudden declines or increases by 25%), and looking at the output, we see that $0.95\times 432=410.4$ corresponds roughly to the "Lo 95" entry, while $1.05\times 432=453.6$ corresponds roughly to the "Hi 55" entry. Thus, there seems to be a roughly 5% chance of a decline by 5% or more, and a 45% chance of an increase by 5% or more. The asymmetry is not surprising, given the trend and seasonality.
