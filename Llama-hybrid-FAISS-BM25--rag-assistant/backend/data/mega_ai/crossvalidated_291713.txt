What are monte carlo optimization techniques used in machine learning?

Normally in machine learning we use derivatives in-order to optimize a cost function . But I saw monte carlo optimization method which uses integrals in-order to optimize specially in reinforcement learning problems and some sampling problems ? What is the difference of these two types ?
