Making Visual Studio TFS plugin store your credentials?

Every time I open Visual Studio 2008, I get a pop-up dialog prompting for my username and password ('Connecting to Team Foundation Server'). Presumably this is because I have my TFS server stored in the Team Explorer tab, in Servers, so it wants to connect to it on startup. In addition, this happens when I open a solution file whose solution is associated with TFS source control, for obvious reasons. My problem is identical to that described in various places on the web, such as: http://kevinsmi.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/getting-visual-studio-to-remember-your-tfs-credentials-on-windows-7/ http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/tfsgeneral/thread/186a469c-bc58-48c4-9db9-ffc2e0fedb11 http://hastobe.net/blogs/stevemorgan/archive/2008/08/25/stop-visual-studio-prompting-for-tfs-credentials.aspx In all cases I can see, the suggested solution is to add the TFS server credentials to Windows' stored credentials. I'm using Windows 7, so I think the way you do that is in the Credential Manager. Well, I've added the TFS server with my credentials to the 'Windows Credentials' list, and I still get the prompt for my username and password when I open Visual Studio 2008. Anyone have any ideas as to how I can get it to login with my credentials automatically? UPDATE: I added my TFS server's computer name, along with my username and password, into the Credential Manager (before I just had its IP address). Now, VS2008 does load without prompting me for credentials... but VS2005 still prompts me for them, even though it has the exact same server registered in Team Explorer! Whatsmore, the server registered in Team Explorer is the server's IP, which was already stored in Windows Credentials, rather than the server's name. So this is still a mystery. Could this be some registry setting peculiar to the VS2005 version of the Team Explorer source control plugin? Where in the registry could I find this potential setting(s)?
