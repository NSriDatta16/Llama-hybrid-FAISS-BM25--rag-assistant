What is the correct definition of the Cesàro summation of autocovariances?

I'm a little confused regarding a mathematical definition (Cesàro summation) and its application to stationary time series. First, consider the definition given by Wikipedia, adapting to autovariances. According to this definition, the Cesàro sum of the autocovariances would be given by: let $(\gamma_\ell)_{\ell=1}^{\infty}$ be the sequence of autocovariances, and let: $$s_k = \sum_{\ell=1}^{k} \gamma_\ell$$ be its k-th partial sum. The value of the limit $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n s_k = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{\ell=1}^{k} \gamma_\ell = A, \quad A \in \mathbb R $$ is called the Cesàro sum of the series $\sum_{\ell=1}^{\infty} \gamma_\ell$ and we say that the sequence $(\gamma_\ell)_{\ell=1}^{\infty}$ is Cesàro summable. On the other hand, Hansen in his book Econometrics (see Ergodicity section) states the following: Furthermore, see how in this answer , the author of the answer also seems to use the same definition as Hansen. Well, for me the two definitions are not the same and this is a little confusing for those looking for mathematically well-established definitions. Perhaps due to my lack of experience, I may be missing something obvious. Could anyone help me better understand this impasse?
