Neural network using MATLAB

I have a training set that has input and outputs in this way: Input: 0.832 64.643 0.818 78.843 1.776 45.049 0.597 88.302 1.412 63.458 1.468 49.535 1.985 33.387 2.073 30.279 1.431 55.231 1.116 68.521 1.617 44.362 2.159 66.512 Output: 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 I need to implement one linear layer neural network that can represent the data set best in MATLAB . What would be the algorithm to do it in MATLAB? The target output is "1 for a particular class that the corresponding input belongs to and "0 for the remaining 2 outputs.
