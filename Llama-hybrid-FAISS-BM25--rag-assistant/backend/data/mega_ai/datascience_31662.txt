Why can't I choose my hyper-parameter in the training set?

Say I've divided the data into 3 parts: training, validation and test. I know for example, that in Neural Networks, the number of hidden layers is a hyper parameter. Why can't I train numerous NN architectures in the training set and then test their accuracy in the test set; thereby allowing me to choose one final model? What is the purpose of the validation set in this instance?
