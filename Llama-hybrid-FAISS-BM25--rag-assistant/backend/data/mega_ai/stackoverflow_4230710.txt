NSURL with a custom scheme?

I'm making a document-based application, backed by an abstract file storage system. Sometimes the files come from the local system ( file:// ), sometimes they come from FTP, sometimes they come from SFTP, or theoretically even some non-standard scheme. For all the local files I've been initializing NSData from the URL of the file. Ideally I'd like this to work for URLs like sftp://server.tld:22/... too, but I'm unsure if NSURL provides support for providing custom I/O operations for shemes it doesn't handle out of the box. Does anyone know if you can register I/O handlers for non-standard URL schemes?
