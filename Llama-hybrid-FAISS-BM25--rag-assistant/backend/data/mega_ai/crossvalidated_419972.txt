I (kinda) figured out what nlme and/or lme4 are doing when runing such a study. By entering the raw data (i.e. all the trials for each participant, without any pre-processing, e.g., sums, or means), the final results show that it is indeed calculating the scores for each factor and sub-factor by calculating averages. Namely, it is taking into account the unequal trials when analyzing the results. (yey).
