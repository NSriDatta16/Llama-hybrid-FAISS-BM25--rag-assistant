No! Each header/implementation file pair should represent a single class. Placing a large project in one file is a surefire way to disaster: the project become unmaintainable and compiling will take ages. Break up your code in to appropriately sized pieces. The main function should not declare the classes, rather, the file it contains (often named something like main.cpp, driver.cpp, projectname .cpp) should use #include directives to make the compiler read the declarations in header files. Read up on C++'s separate compilation model for more info. Some newcomers to C++ find the compilation model - as well as error codes generated when you screw it up - incomprehensible or intimidating and give up thinking it's not worth it. Don't let this be you. Learn how to properly organize your code.
