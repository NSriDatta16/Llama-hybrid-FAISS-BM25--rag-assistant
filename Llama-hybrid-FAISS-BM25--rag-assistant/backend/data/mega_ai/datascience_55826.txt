Low prediction/classification accuracy due to imbalance in data feeding

I am building the neural network for image analysis to do Chest Xray classification (Abnormal/Pass). The classification accuracy for abnormal Xray is low, I guess it is due to the lack of abnormal samples to train. Attached image is the schema I built. Is there any ways to improve the classification accuracy for abnormal Xray?
