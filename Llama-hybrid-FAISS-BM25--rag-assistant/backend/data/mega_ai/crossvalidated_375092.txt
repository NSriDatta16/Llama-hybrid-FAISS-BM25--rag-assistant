What does an edge mean during a variable split in Random Forest?

I am currently writing a blog where I plan to do a regression model using Random Forest. Random Forest averages the estimated prediction from many decision trees that are fitted on to a bootstrap from the dataset while choosing K variables randomly from all the M dependent variables. However, I recently came across this presentation . One of the slides says something like this: Here, the author is building a regression model using Random Forest with Residual Sum of Squares as the splitting criterion. During the splitting process, it is stated that a split is "too close to the edge." My question is, what does an "edge" mean in this case? And why not choose a split if it is too close to the "edge" ? Thanks in advance.
