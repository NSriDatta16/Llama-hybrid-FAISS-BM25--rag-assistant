Your problem is that you're using a raw type of ComplexObject1 . It's easy to fix: just use ComplexObject1 instead, and your code compiles fine. There's really nothing unexpected about this behavior at all. From the tutorial : Type erasure exists so that new code may continue to interface with legacy code. Using a raw type for any other reason is considered bad programming practice and should be avoided whenever possible. From JLS 4.8 Raw Types (emphasis theirs): The use of raw types is allowed only as a concession to compatibility of legacy code. The use of raw types in code written after the introduction of genericity into the Java programming language is strongly discouraged. It is possible that future versions of the Java programming language will disallow the use of raw types. See also Effective Java 2nd Edition , Item 23: Don't use raw type in new code.
