Facebook Connect, jQuery UI, and jQuery.noConflict()

I'm trying to build a page on my personal website that both used jQuery and implements Facebook Connect . Unfortunately, the Facebook client API uses the $ token , which means I have to call jQuery.noConflict() Double-unfortunately, I've found out that for some crazy reason and as Rick Strahl points out, jQuery UI doesn't respect noConlict(). At all. In fact, if you look at the source code, there are $ s all over it. I really want to be able to use jQuery UI - specifically, the dialog() component, and draggable would be really nice as well - but I even moreso, I don't want to have to hand-edit - and test, and maintain - my own copy of any part of jQuery UI. This is the most recent in a series of yaks I've had to shave which has me at my wits' end. Any suggestions? Help!
