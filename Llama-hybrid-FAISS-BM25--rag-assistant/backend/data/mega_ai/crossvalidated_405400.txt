You could perform pruning on your tree which essentially removes branches that do not make a significant impact on your error rate. Your other option is to use your same data to build a random forest model. From a random forest model, you should then be able to obtain values of "variable importance". You may want to take a look at An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R . It has a chapter titled "Tree Based Methods" which I think would be very applicable to you. If I am not mistaken, there should be a free version of this textbook floating around on the web.
