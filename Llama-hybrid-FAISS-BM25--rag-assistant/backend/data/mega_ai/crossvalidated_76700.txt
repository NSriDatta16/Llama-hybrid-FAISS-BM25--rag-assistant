Most of the kernels (assuming you mean kernel trick as in SVM) used are of an infinite dimension, you will have trouble storing them in our puny not-really-a-turning-machine-no-infinite-memory computers. You will need to use an approximate version of the feature vectors, such as those obtained using Nystrome's method or Random Fourier Features.
