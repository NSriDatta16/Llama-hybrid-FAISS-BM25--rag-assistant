Best practice on exposing webservices

I am new to a development team that is adding a layer of webservices between domain and gui. The approach has a lot of potential but I wonder how to manage the webmethods. At the moment there is just a handful or so webmethods but there will be a lot of them when we get through to the other side. I am sure there must be some very clever thoughts on this out there but I can't seem to find any. Do you have any tips? (Since the website is still in .net 1.1 they are using asmx - not sure it is relevant) update: What I am looking for is ideas on how to organize the interface : naming standards? one service per domain object or some other clever way? how do you do it in a clever, easy to read and understand way?
