Can I stop SQL*Plus from displaying "connected" when I have a "connect" in a script?

I have a few sql scripts that I need to run via SQL*Plus. These scripts connect several times as different users with a connect user_01/pass_01@db_01 . Now, each time the script does such a connect, it confirms the successful connection with a connected . This is distracting and I want to turn it off. I can achieve what I want with a set termout off connect user_01/pass_01@db_01 set termout on Is there a more elegant solution to my problem? Note, it doesn't help to permanently set termout off at the start of the script since I need to know if a command didn't run successfully.
