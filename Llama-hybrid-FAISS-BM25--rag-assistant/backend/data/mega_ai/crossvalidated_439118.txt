1. I am not sure why using weekly data (around 2500 data points) is giving very high error but using monthly data points (only 31 data points) was giving decent result (although not very good). What am I doing wrong here ? @IrishStat is likely right. The 53rd week issue is rough. It is usually easier to get clear seasonality with monthly data or daily data. If you want to forecast at the monthly level one option is to take monthly values then divide the monthly forecast into weekly forecasts using proportions from last years data. This is very adhoc, if there is a large trend this method would likely not work. If possible I prefer to work with daily data and aggregate up. Daily data usually has weekly seasonality and yearly seasonality. You asked about prophet . I have seen good results on daily data with prophet . 2. Given the result with TBATS was very poor, how can I check if TBATS is the appropriate model to use? In general comparing AIC or having a hold-out test set is the way forecasters determine what to use. I am not sure why TBATs is giving poor results. You can always try using ARIMA with fourier regressors if you want something analogous to TBATS. 3. When should I consider going for additive time series models such as those of prophet library? Daily data with multiple seasonalities. 4. What could be some of the ways I can look at to improve the prediction accuracy? Always use a benchmark! Combine forecasts from multiple methods If I assume that your data has seasonality of 4, thinking that week 1 of month 12 is like week 1 of month 11, then these are the results I get. tbats ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Theil's U Training set 303940.9 992404.8 660849.8 -3.715019 33.47303 1.0359822 -0.2295624 NA Test set 127521.3 663545.9 491123.4 -8.246457 32.40637 0.7699103 -0.4565056 0.2511831 arima ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Theil's U Training set 176783.7 914286.5 557117.1 -0.8916543 24.60861 0.8733655 -0.1641036 NA Test set -169576.8 395043.5 304737.5 -8.7959001 16.77696 0.4777222 0.1541620 0.1634051 arima with fourier ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Theil's U Training set -26492.66 854052.9 684739.0 -17.12327 38.64117 1.073432 0.1110644 NA Test set -290873.37 735399.4 642696.9 -36.66567 49.56333 1.007525 -0.3913094 0.6469734 seasonal naive ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Theil's U Training set -19057.05 949002.6 637896.8 -6.941991 28.86181 1.000000 -0.4136366 NA Test set -155011.50 167192.4 155011.5 -10.319070 10.31907 0.243004 0.2955041 0.1352975 You will see that using seasonal naive on a hold out of 4 weeks with the assumption of seasonality of 4 give the best results on the test set!
