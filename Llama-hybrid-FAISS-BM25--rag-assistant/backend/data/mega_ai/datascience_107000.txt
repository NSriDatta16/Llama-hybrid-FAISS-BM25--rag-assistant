A sigmoid function is a function with specific properties , most notably it maps values to the interval $[0,1]$ . Often "sigmoid" is used to describe "some" s-shaped function which maps values to the interval $[0,1]$ . If you take the logistic function $$ f(x) = \frac{L}{ 1 + e^{-k(x-x_0)} },$$ with $k=1, x_0=0, L=1$ ( $x_0$ midpoint, $L$ curve max. value, $k$ logistic growth rate), you arrive at: $$ f(x) = \frac{e^x}{1+e^x}.$$ With (binomial) logistic regression you aim at predicting a probability for some outcome $y$ based on some real valued inputs $x$ , so you can employ the logistic function. You can write (omitting indexes $i$ ): $$p(y=1) = \frac{exp(x' \beta)}{1+exp(x'\beta)},$$ where $x'\beta = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n$ . Now when you look at the odds $\frac{p(y=1)}{1-p(y=1)}$ , you can plug in the equation above. $$ \frac{p}{1-p}=\frac{\frac{exp(\beta_0+x_{1}\beta_1+...+x_{n}\beta_n)}{1+exp(\beta_0+x_{1}\beta_1+...+x_{n}\beta_n)}}{1-\frac{exp(\beta_0+x_{1}\beta_1+...+x_{n}\beta_n)}{1+exp(\beta_0+x_{1}\beta_1+...+x_{n}\beta_n)}}=exp(\beta_0+x_{1}\beta_1+...+x_{n}\beta_n).$$ Now in order to have a linear function (or model) on the right hand side you can take $log$ s. $$\ln\left(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\right)=\beta_0+x_{1}\beta_1+...+x_{n}\beta_n.$$ The log-odds (left hand side) are also called logit . The logit serves as a link function between the linear model and the probability. The R code below looks at a logistic function, odds, and log-odds. # Logistic function x = seq(-10,10,1) res1 = exp(x) / (exp(x)+1) # Maps some values x to interval [0,1] plot(x,res1) p = seq(0,1,0.01) # Probablility that event occurs # Odds odds = p/(1-p) plot(odds,p) # Logit logodds = log((p/(1-p))) # Logit maps probabilities to real numbers plot(logodds,p)
