Can I configure VisualStudio 2008 to always build the startup project?

I have a solution with several projects, where the startup project has a post-build event that does all the copying of "plugin" projects and other organizing tasks. After upgrading the solution from VS 2005 to VS 2008, it appears as though the post-build event only fires if I modify the startup project, which means my updated plugins don't get plugged in to the current debugging session. This makes sense, but it seems like a change in behavior. Is anyone else noticing a change in behavior with regard to which projects get built? Does anyone know of a workaround that I can use to force the startup project to rebuild whenever I hit F5? Perhaps I configured VS 2005 to work this way so long ago that I've forgotten all about it ...
