It is difficult to judge a plot with such few data points. You could try a formal test of heteroscedasticity such as the Breusch-Pagan test , implemented in the ncvTest function of the car package. Given how small your data set is, I would be surprised if significant heteroscedasticity is found. The size of your data set is a more fundamental issue. A good rule of thumb is you should have 10-20 observations per parameter in your model, so your data set is borderline too small to fit a linear model with even one predictor.
