Approximation in hierarchical model

Consider a simple Bayesian hierarchical model: $y | \theta \sim P(y | \theta)$ $\theta | \phi \sim P(\theta | \phi)$ $\phi \sim P(\phi)$ I'm interested in drawing from the posterior distribution of $\phi$ using Metropolis-Hastings. Given a candidate value of $\phi$ , is it acceptable to draw $\theta$ from its specified distribution and then to use this value of $\theta$ to compute $P(y | \theta)$ ? I understand that this is an approximation to marginalizing $\theta$ , but I wanted to know if this approach is commonly used in practice (or if it has a name)?
