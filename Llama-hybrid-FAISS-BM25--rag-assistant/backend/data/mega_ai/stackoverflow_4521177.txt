Configuration Storage

I want to store a lot of configuration data pertaining to cluster, process, IP addresses etc. I have worked on one such product earlier where LDAP was used for this purpose. Although it was PITA to configure it the first time, I liked the transactional LDAP part which helps in dynamic reloading of the configuration when there is a change. It can be done with a flat file using inotify , but that is not as good as transactional LDAP. But, as I said, the configuration was a real pain, and also I don't want to borrow the same idea of LDAP in this product. So can anyone give me an idea about which will be the next best replacement, which makes entering configuration easy and also that can help in dynamic configuration and notify my process whenever there is a change in the configuration file and exactly what changed (directly or indirectly)? I am planning to develop my product in C++ and C. The configuration can be edited by an Admin, or if he is too lazy he can automate it using some script. Also through cli, but not by a running process, that will land me up in concurrency and locking issues. My program is a daemon, some sort of cluster manager running on multiple nodes. There is no wrapper provided for user to edit configuration. I am only looking for Linux/Solaris platform.
