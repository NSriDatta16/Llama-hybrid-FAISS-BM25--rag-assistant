All of the recommendations so far rely on the standard moment-based approaches to time series analysis and all are a type of HAC model. The question, though, specifically queried the patterning or shape in the data. Andreas Brandmaier at the Max Planck Institute has developed an non-moment-based, information and complexity theoretic pattern analysis time series model that he calls permutation distribution analysis . He's written an R module to test the similarities in shape. PDC has a long history in biostatistics as an approach to two group similarities. Brandmaier's dissertation was on PDC and structural equation modeling trees. pdc: An R Package for Complexity-Based Clustering of Time Series , J Stat Software, Andreas Brandmaier Permutation Distribution Clustering and Structural Equation Model Trees , Brandmaier dissertation PDF In addition, there is Eamon Keogh's machine learning, iSax method for this. http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/
