Can you impute (predict) missing continuous data using categorical data as the predictor?

I just read that to use MICE Imputation, variables with missing values need to have a relationship to other variables. In my case, I will anonymize the variable just for convenience purposes: Numerical Continuous Variables: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' Categorical Variables (Nominal): 'X', 'Y' 'A' has missing values of around 20%, while the other variables are complete. Now I read that it's better to impute the values instead of dropping them using techniques such as MICE, Random Forests, kNN, Bootstrapping, etc. I checked into MICE first, considering it's flexible for all kinds of variables and gives less biased imputations if the model is appropriate. One of the requirements to use MICE is that the variable that will be imputed needs to have a relationship with other variables. Hence, I analyzed 'A' with other numerical variables and only found a weak relationship between them (around 0.2) But when I tried to analyze 'A' with other categorical variables using ANOVA, it showed a strong relationship with 'X' and 'Y', plus it's statistically significant (***). Can I use 'X' and 'Y' (categorical variables) as the predictor in imputing the missing values in 'A' through MICE Imputation?
