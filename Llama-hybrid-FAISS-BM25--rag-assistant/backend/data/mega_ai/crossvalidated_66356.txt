Interpreting a simple linear regression coefficient scaled by the mean of y?

I have come across an industry example of a simple linear regression ($y=a+bx+\epsilon$) where the slope coefficient has been adjusted by the mean of $y$ ($b/\text{mean}(y)$) and described as a "slope impact". The exact interpretation that they use is that this slope impact represents "the percentage change in $y$ for every unit above the average value of $x$". I am not sure this interpretation is correct but would appreciate any feedback you could give on this calculation.
