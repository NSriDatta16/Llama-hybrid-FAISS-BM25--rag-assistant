Clustering spherical-shaped data

I have a data set that consists of census data (5 attributes). Performing PCA, I found that the original data looks like a big chunk (please look at the first picture), and therefore, I decided to use spectral clustering, and the picture below is the representation of the data (the picture is obtained by plotting the highest three eigenvectors of the Laplacian). The shape looks interesting to me and it looks like these data form sort of a function in the new domain (I really would like to hear a better interpretation from experts). I now have 2 questions: (1) what can we say about the data in the new domain? (2) What is the best clustering technique you suggest to perform the clustering Thanks
