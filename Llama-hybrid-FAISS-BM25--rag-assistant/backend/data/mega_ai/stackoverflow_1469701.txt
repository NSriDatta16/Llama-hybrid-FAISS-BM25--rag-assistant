If you are doing any kind of volume, GUIDs are extremely bad as a PK bad unless you use sequential GUIDs , for the exact reasons you describe. Page fragmentation is severe : Average Average Fragmentation Fragment Fragment Page Average Type in Percent Count Size Count Space Used id 4.35 7 16.43 115 99.89 newidguid 98.77 162 1 162 70.90 newsequentualid 4.35 7 16.43 115 99.89 And as this comparison between GUIDs and integers shows: Test1 caused a tremendous amount of page splits, and had a scan density around 12% when I ran a DBCC SHOWCONTIG after the inserts had completed. The Test2 table had a scan density around 98% If your volume is very low, however, it just doesn't matter that much. If you do really need a globally unique ID but have high volume (and can't use sequential IDs), just put the GUIDs in an indexed column.
