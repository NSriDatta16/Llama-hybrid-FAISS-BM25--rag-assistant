Trend variable in time series linear regression

tslm(Life_expectancy ~ Age + Gender + Race + trend, data=ts_df) Can I do something like this? I actually tried using this as a model and I got a different outcome but the p-value of trend variable was insignificant. Does that mean that there is no trend in my data? I did the vif test.
