I would recommend a great book by Christoph Molnar: Interpretable Machine Learning - A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable . It touches upon both Interpretable Models , e.g. Linear/Logistic Regression, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Generative Additive Models (GAMs), Decision Trees and Model-Agnostic Methods , e.g. LIME , SHAP . Awesome Interpretable Machine Learning links to many interesting publications in the field.
