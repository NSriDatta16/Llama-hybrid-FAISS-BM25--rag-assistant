Long term time series forecasts with small dataset

I have a small dataset which has timestamp and temperature values for 6 months(I.e. one temperature value per day). I would like to forecast 2-3 months of temperature. I would like to know, what kind of models would be suitable for such purpose. I have used LSTM but the forecasts degrades as I go further and the data size is pretty small for LSTM to be trained.
