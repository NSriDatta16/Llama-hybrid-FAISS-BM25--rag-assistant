I think a great resource for learning Git is Pro Git . It's a book, but you can read it online. The first chapters teach you the basics on Version Control and git basics. Also, check this question , where some git tutorials are listed. Even if you are looking for a quick start guide, I encourage you to take the time to read at least the first three chapters of Pro Git. This will give you a good general understanding of how to use a version control system, some git basics, and the power of branching and merging. Then check out the tutorials on the second link I posted. Regarding egit, there's some documentation on its official site. Once you get the hand on git, it will be easier to learn how to use egit.
