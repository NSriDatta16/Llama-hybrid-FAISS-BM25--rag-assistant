It will be repeated measures because each subject has 3 observations (you’ve randomized blocks to control for order effects, so I assume you’ll average over them). That’s true for the behavioral data and also for the eye tracking data, but it’s not clear how you’re dealing with that (good luck - it’s not trivial!)
