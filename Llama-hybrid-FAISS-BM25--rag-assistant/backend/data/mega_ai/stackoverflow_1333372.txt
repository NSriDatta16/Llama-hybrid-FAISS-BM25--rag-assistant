Determine next hop MAC address in C#

I'm writing an application that injects packets using SharpPcap . However, since I'm constructing the packets on my own and only know the destination's IP address, I have to determine the physical address of the next hop. I can always send a ping to the remote IP address , sniff it, and get the MAC address from the sniffed packet. However, I was hoping there's a less convoluted way to do so in C# . Obviously, getting the next hop's IP address will also be very helpful, as I can then use SendArp to determine its MAC address. Getting the routing table will do. How would I obtain that using code?
