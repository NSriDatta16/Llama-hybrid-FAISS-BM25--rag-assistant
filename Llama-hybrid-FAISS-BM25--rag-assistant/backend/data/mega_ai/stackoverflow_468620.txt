I would favour using the RoutedCommands and RoutedUICommands when building controls. For example TextBox implements the UndoCommand for you and the Input guseture is already bound to Ctrl + Z . When building View Models, however, my preference is for a custom ICommand with internal implementations of Execute and CanExecute. The DelegateCommand provides this in Prism. This allows the view/xaml designer to only worry about the command and not the correct Execute/CanExecute handlers to use. This would allow for a more expressive view model. ps. Delegate Commands dont yet work (elegantly) with InputBindings. Can some one at Microsoft fix this please!
