Playing YouTube embedded videos consecutively on one page

I'm embedding YouTube videos onto my webpage with something like this If I have say 3 YouTube videos on the same webpage, I was wondering if it was possible (maybe with YouTube's API?) to play each video consecutively? That is, the first video starts to autoplay. When that video finishes, the second video on the webpage will play and then the third? Thanks for your time.
