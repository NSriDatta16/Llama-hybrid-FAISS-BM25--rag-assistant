I just executed a demo application I presented here and it uses ~22% CPU, according to Activity Monitor . I ran the program on a Macbook Pro 13", with OpenCV 2.1 ( 32bits ). If you pay attention to that code you'll notice that the loop is a little bit different from yours: IplImage* frame = NULL; char key = 0; while (key != 27) // ESC { frame = cvQueryFrame(capture); if(!frame) { fprintf( stderr, "!!! cvQueryFrame failed!\n" ); break; } cvShowImage("Live Cam", frame ); key = cvWaitKey(10); }
