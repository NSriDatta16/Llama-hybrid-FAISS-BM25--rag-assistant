This is certainly possible. A view can render any template that an inclusion tag can. The advantage of this approach is that you can leverage the full strength of Django's templates. On the other hand AJAX responses typically do not contain HTML so much as XML/JSON. If you are using Django's template features you are better off with returning HTML. If not, XML/JSON might make more sense. Just my two cents.
