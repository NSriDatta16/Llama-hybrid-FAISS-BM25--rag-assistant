You probably don't want to bring the min and max of the two distributions close to one or the other. It'd be modifying the distributions themselves and therefore throwing away the pattern or insights in the data. If your question is how do I show them on a time series plot, there are a few options. Use two y axes (y1 on the left and y2 on the right) and show both the distributions Find the least common multiple of (min and max) of each distribution and scale(as you say) the distributions separately to that value.
