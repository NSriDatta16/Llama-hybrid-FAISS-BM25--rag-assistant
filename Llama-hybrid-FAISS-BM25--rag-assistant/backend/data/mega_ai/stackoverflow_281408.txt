Pattern for progress status reporting

I am implementing long running processes that require to a process bar - or progress percentage - to be displayed. The overall logic of the long running process is complex (various paged data retrieval), and as a result, I end up hardcoding lots of percentages in various places within the code. What are considered as the best design patterns when it comes to update a completion percentage?
