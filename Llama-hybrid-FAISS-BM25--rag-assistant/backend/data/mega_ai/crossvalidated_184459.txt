You should remember that everything is related to pairs of points. So in your example at 50m it is more likely to observe pairs of species 1 separated by 50m than pairs of species 2 separated by 50m. For species 1 you could say that observing pairs separated by 50m is 1.5 times more likely for the process generating species 1 than complete spatial randomness with the same average density of points. You can read more about the pair correlation function in chapter 7 of the book Spatial Point Patterns: Methodology and Applications with R I have recently co-authored with Adrian Baddeley and Rolf Turner.
