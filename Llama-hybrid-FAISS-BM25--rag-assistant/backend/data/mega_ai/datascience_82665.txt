Can I tune a model after training it? (Convolutional Neural Network & Classification)

I am relatively new to Data Science and I've recently embarked on a project. Long story short, I've trained a CNN model to distinguish between Male and Female genders. However, I wish to tune my model . I've saved the weights and bias of the existing model . Can I use the current model with weights and bias to retrain on augmented data (from the same initial dataset)? I am guessing there are 2 possible outcomes, it tunes the model or it "resets" the weights and bias. Can I perform hyperparameter tuning with RandomSearchCV or GridSearchCV using on my existing model? I believe this will tune the model. My aim is to reduce overfitting.
