Design language or artifact for data science model

Inspired from this question , given that there is no standard definition of a data-science model, is there a way to standardize the communication about any data-science model ? Just like material design is a design language to communicate a UI design , is there a similar design language to talk about data-science models as well? Or any other alternative or industry standard artifacts that communicates intent, purpose, approach and design of data-science model ?
