Probabilities are ratios; the probability of A given B is how often A happens within the space of B. For instance, $P(\text{rain|March})$ is the number of rainy days in March divided by the number of total days in March. When dealing with fractions, it makes sense to split up numerators. For instance, \begin{align} P(\text{rain or snow|March}) &= \frac{(\text{number of rainy or snowy days in March})}{(\text{total number of days in March})} \\[7pt] &= \frac{(\text{number of rainy days in March})}{(\text{total number of days in March)}} + \\[4pt] &\qquad \frac{\text{(number of snowy days in March)}}{(\text{total number of days in March)}} \\[7pt] &= P(\text{rain|March})+P(\text{snow|March}) \end{align} This of course assumes that "snow" and "rain" are mutually exclusive. It does not, however, make sense to split up denominators. So if you have $P(\text{rain|February or March})$, that is equal to $$\frac{(\text{number of rainy days in February and March})}{(\text{total number of days in February and March})}.$$ But that is not equal to $$\frac{(\text{number of rainy days in February})}{(\text{total number of days in February})} + \frac{(\text{number of rainy days in March)}}{(\text{total number of days in March)}}.$$ If you're having trouble seeing that, you can try out some numbers. Suppose there are 10 rainy days in February and 8 in March. Then we have $$\frac{(\text{number of rainy days in February and March})}{(\text{total number of days in February and March)}} = (10+8)/(28+31) = 29.5\% $$ and \begin{align} \frac{(\text{number of rainy days in February})}{(\text{total number of days in February)}} + \frac{(\text{number of rainy days in March)}}{(\text{total number of days in March)}} &= (10/28)+(8/31) \\ &= 35.7\% + 25.8\% \\ &= 61.5\% \end{align} The first number, 29.5%, is the average of 35.7% and 25.8% (with the second number weighted slightly more because there is are more days in March). When you say $P(A|B)=P(A|B,C)+P(A|B,Â¬C)$ you're saying that $\frac{x_1+x_2}{y_1+y_2} = \frac{x_1}{y_1}+\frac{x_2}{y_2}$, which is false.
