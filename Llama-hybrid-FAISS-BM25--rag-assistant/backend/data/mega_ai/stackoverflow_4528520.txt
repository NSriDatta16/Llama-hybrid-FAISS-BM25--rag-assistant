Does number of columns affect MYSQL speed?

I have a table. I only need to run one type of query: to find a given unique in column 1, then get say, the first 3 columns out. now, how much would it affect speed if I added an extra few columns to the table for basically "data storage". I know I should use a saparate table, but lets assume I am constrained to having just 1 table, so the only way is to add on some columns at the end. So, if I add on some columns, say 10 at the end, 30 varchar each, will this slow down any query given in the first sentence? If so, by how much of a factor do you think compared to without the extra reduntant yet present columns?
