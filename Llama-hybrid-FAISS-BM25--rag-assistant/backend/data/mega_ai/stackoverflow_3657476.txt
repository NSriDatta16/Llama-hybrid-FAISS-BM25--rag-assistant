#pragma directives are always compiler-dependent. The tutorial you're reading is specifically about the OnBoard C compiler. IIRC, the Garnet OS (nee Palm OS) Development Suite (do they now refer to it as GODS instead of PODS now?) is based on prc-tools. You can check the prc-tools documentation about using multiple segments . If you're using Eclipse, I think it's supposed to let you create multi-segmented applications. (I've never personally used that, however. I did find a page with some notes about the process .) The old Palm OS Programming FAQ also describes some general ways to deal with the 32K limit .
