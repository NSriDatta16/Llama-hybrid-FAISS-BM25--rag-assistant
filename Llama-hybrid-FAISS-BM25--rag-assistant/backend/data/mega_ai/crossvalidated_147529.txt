What are the best R packages for a classification problem with use of Neural networks

Surfing on the internet shows me that there are a lot of different packages and functions which can be used to train neural networks via R. packages such as 'RSNNS', 'nnet','neuralnet', etc. I'm trying to solve a classification problem and want to try different neural network techniques like, MLP, RBF and SVM. Does anyone knows which packages or functions best can be used to classify the data. Thanks!!
