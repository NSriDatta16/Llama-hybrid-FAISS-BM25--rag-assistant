Getting a random element in Django

I just finished the Django tutorial and started work on my own project, however, I seem to have missed something completely. I wanted to get a random slogan from this model: from django.db import models class Slogan(models.Model): slogan = models.CharField(max_length=200) And return it in this view: from django.http import HttpResponse from swarm.sloganrotator.models import Slogan def index(request): return HttpResponse(Slogan.objects.order_by('?')[:1]) However, the view just returns 'Slogan object'. Then I thought, maybe I can access the slogan string itself by simply appending .slogan to the slice, but that gives me an error indicating that the object I have is actually a QuerySet and has no attribute slogan. I've obviously misunderstood something about Django here, but it just doesn't fall into place for me. Any help?
