You are wrong. RandomForestClassifier does not try any hyperparameters. You need to give it the specific value for each of its hyperparameters. Given such hyperparameter values, it can then train a random forest classifier. They are called "hyperparameters" because they are not trained, they are "outside" of the specific algorithm. You need something/someone to decide what values to use. The approach to decide which hyperparameter values to use can be anything: a person doing trial and error, a loop exploring all possible hyperparameter value combinations within some reasonable limits (i.e. grid search), a black-box optimization (e.g. skopt ), etc. Also, there is not an absolute criterion to decide which model is "best". In some cases, we might want to get the greatest accuracy, others, we might want to pay attention to the AUC, others to the F1, etc. The variable name rf_grid in your question suggests that you have a piece of code using grid search , which loops over all possible hyperparameter configurations within some sensible limits, which in your case are defined by the rf_grid dictionary.
