"Average" line over irregular log series data

I have simulation data from 1000 runs, plotting some measurable (in this case convergence of the algorithm) as a function of simulation time. Each run produces a discrete set of points (t, f(t)) and the superimposed image of all the runs looks like: Clearly there is some structure here. How can I generate a curve that somehow captures the average value of f(t) for a given t? In addition I'd like to be able to estimate the spread as well, though I'm not sure what the underlying distribution is. Let's say that this plot was generated from simulation parameters A . The goal of this project is to show that another set of simulation parameters B , produces a different set of curves, and have a nice way to visualize this.
