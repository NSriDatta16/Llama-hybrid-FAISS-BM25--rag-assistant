You could probably build a decision tree after giving labels to the two classes. Then you could view how each example is going down the decision tree, and see how subgroups are formed after each feature division.[Check if you could get the information gain of splitting along each feature for the first node.Using this also you can judge what features are useful]. Ideally if you don't want to see how subgroups are being formed you could use Feature ranking output by Random Forest.
