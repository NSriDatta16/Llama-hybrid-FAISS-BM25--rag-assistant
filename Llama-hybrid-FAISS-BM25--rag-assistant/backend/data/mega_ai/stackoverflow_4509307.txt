Are you just asking how to compare dates in VB .NET? (I assume so, since the act of "charging the user" is kind of beyond the scope of what we can help you with.) Try something like this (this was free-hand, I don't have a VB compiler handy, so it may not be completely perfect): Dim currentDate As Date = DateTime.Parse(textbox1.Text) Dim bookingDate As Date = DateTime.Parse(textbox2.Text) Dim difference As Integer = bookingDate.Subtract(currentDate).Days You can then check how many days difference is to apply your logic. Keep in mind a few things: This is fragile code. Look into using DateTime.TryParse if you're not already familiar with it. What I have above is open to exceptions. Please DO NOT rely on the values of the text boxes from the form for your date calculations. You can get the current date on the server, and you should have the booking date in a database or something on the server. Use those. The client can post any dates he or she feels like posting to avoid charges. User-submitted data is NEVER to be implicitly trusted.
