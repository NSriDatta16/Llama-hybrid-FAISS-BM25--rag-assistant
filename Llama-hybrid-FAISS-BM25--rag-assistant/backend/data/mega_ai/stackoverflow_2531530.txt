Using resource values as layout attributes (config.xml)

Looking in the android sdk folders, I've found a file called values/config.xml . This seems to be somewhere that you can define values for later use in layouts and animations. Given the config.xml: 50dip How would I reference this to use as the layout_height in a layout xml file? @string/config_somePadding is actually the only one I've found that doesn't throw an error in Eclipse (even though there isn't a config_somePadding in values/strings.xml ), but it appears to just put an empty string. In the sdk, they use an integer for animation duration. They reference it like this: android:duration="@android:integer/config_longAnimTime" . Is there a way to use values that aren't integers in the layout_height attribute?
