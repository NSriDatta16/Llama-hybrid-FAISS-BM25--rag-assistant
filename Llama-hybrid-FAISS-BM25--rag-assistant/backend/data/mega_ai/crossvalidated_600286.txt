Is the variance of the maximum of a set of variables higher than the variance of the other variables?

Does the maximum of a set of random variables have high variance compared to the other variables in the set? If so, can someone give an intuitive explanation of why? Some details about the motivation: I am using a random hash to hash a large set of random integers (large domain) to a much smaller range of integers. I am interested in the maximum number of hash collisions. When I do this multiple times with different random integers and different random seeds in the hash I see there is a very high variance in the maximum number of hash collisions (between 1/2 and 1 times the average maximum number of collisions). I am trying to get an intuition for why this is the case.
