There is a 'composite-id' property you can use in your class mapping instead of the 'id' property. However, you should know that the nHibernate team strongly discourages the use of it. It sounds like you are dealing with a legacy database, in which you have no control over the schema. So, the 'composite-id' is specifically for your situation. Check out the NH docs for more info: http://nhibernate.info/doc/nh/en/index.html
