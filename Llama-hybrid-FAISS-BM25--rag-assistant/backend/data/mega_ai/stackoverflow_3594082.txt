I would suggest more 'direct' drawing approach. If you can draw gradient pixel-by-pixel, then you need just to remember that for circle gradient color is proportional to r ellipse (oval) gradient color is proportional to r1+r2 Here: r - distance to circle center r1,r2 - distances to two foci of ellipse EDIT: Consider this Pixel Shader code: uniform sampler2D tex; void main() { vec2 center = vec2(0.5,0.5); float len = 1.3*(distance(gl_TexCoord[0].xy,center)); vec2 foc1 = vec2(len,0.); vec2 foc2 = vec2(-len,0.); float r = distance(center+foc1,gl_TexCoord[0].xy) + distance(center+foc2,gl_TexCoord[0].xy); float k = pow(r*0.9,1.3); vec4 color = vec4(k,k,k,1.); gl_FragColor = color; } You will get oval something like that: good luck
