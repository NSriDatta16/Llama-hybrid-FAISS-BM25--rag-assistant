Adding and updating a record programmatically using .NETCF

OK - I have worded this search 40 different ways and I seem to be lost here. Every example I find seems so happy that you can easily drag and drop a datagrid and let the user fill it in -- then they stop! I know how to do everything I am asking through LINQ. That obviously won't translate here. I really should have learned ADO.NET first, then LINQ, but NOoooo... I need to know how to do the following in .NETCF (Windows Mobile 5) using a SQL CE database on the device. Add a new record and populate some or all of the fields with data I supply. I don't need to add a record to a datagrid - sometimes the user will not even see the record. How do I add a new record -- put data into it and save it? For example: Create a new delivery record, say, and have the program store the date in one field and a number in another field. Search for a record, then update data in it. Again, using LINQ I can do this easily -- I cannot for the life of me find any examples of doing it without it. I can find lots of examples of populating a grid of databound fields, letting the user make changes then saving it out. I don't need to do that. Say I need to search for the one record that meets a criteria (customerID=10 and orderID=1234), then when (if) that record is found, update a field in it. Please let me know if you need any more info. I have done a lot of reading and just seem to be missing something! Thanks in advance...
