A feasibility study often keeps company with business value analysis, and in your case the study entails the following steps: ML problem definition and desired outcome Firstly, define your problem from the ML perspective, that is, what are the features and what is the output. Secondly, make sure that the task should be complex enough, otherwise just try heuristic rules. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) Talk with domain experts and do some correlation analysis among features and between features and labels. Data pre-processing See if there are some noises and if they can be handled. Hypothesis testing Begin with some simplest baselines and see if the delta business impact is worthy of the time you spent by communicating frequently with a business team. If the business impact is high, spend more time on more complex models; otherwise just try some newer algorithms quickly.
