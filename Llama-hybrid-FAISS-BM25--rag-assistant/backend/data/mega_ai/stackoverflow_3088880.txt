I would take a practical approach to this problem for 2D position matching: They are probably going to be bitmaps... Scan each line in the larger bitmap from 0 to Larger.height - Smaller.Height and from 0 to Larger.Width - Smaller.Width to find Smaller.TopLeft matching Pixels. When found: IF Smaller.TopRight and smaller.bottomLeft and smaller.bottomRight are all equal to the corresponding pixels in the Larger bitmap (all the corners match) then initiate a full compare of that section. Make sure that all comparisons fail early (do not continue comparing after any mismatch). On average you will only need to scan less that 50% of the larger bitmap and will not start many full comparisons that fail.
