Additionally: Think of it as an abstraction layer. Keras gives nice and intuitive way to build and think about neural network, but you have to understand thats not how computer takes orders. Hiding this complexity behind Tensorflow allows us to think naturally about building a neural network and not all the details behind implementation. (On a general note thats why python is so popular, cause it abstracts the complexity away, and allows you to think and write down solution more naturally and intuitively)
