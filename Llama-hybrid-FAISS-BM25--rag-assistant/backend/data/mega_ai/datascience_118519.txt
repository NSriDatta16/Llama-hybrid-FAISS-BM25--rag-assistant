I'm also asking myself the same question to figure out whether it's worth migrating for increased availability or is Azure simply wrapping the original API. This is the only info I was able to find on the matter: Azure OpenAI Service gives customers advanced language AI with OpenAI GPT-3, Codex, and DALL-E models with the security and enterprise promise of Azure. Azure OpenAI co-develops the APIs with OpenAI, ensuring compatibility and a smooth transition from one to the other. With Azure OpenAI, customers get the security capabilities of Microsoft Azure while running the same models as OpenAI. Azure OpenAI offers private networking, regional availability, and responsible AI content filtering. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview#comparing-azure-openai-and-openai
