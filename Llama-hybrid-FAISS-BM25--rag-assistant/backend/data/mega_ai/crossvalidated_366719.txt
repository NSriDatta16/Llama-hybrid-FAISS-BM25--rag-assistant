No, it does not make sense to overfit your data. The term overfitting actually refers to a comparison between models: If model_a performance better on the given training data but worse out-of-sample than model_b , model_a is overfitting. Or in other words: " there exists a better alternative ". If the traffic status "will not vary at all with respect to the training data", then you will achieve the best possible results by simply memorizing the training data (again, that's not "overfitting"). But "data will not vary much with respect to the training data" simply equates to having a reasonable representation of the underlying pattern. This is where machine learning works best ( stationary environment as Ferdi explained ).
