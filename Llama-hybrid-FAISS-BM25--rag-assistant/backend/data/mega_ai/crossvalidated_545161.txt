Can stochastic gradient descent for Bayesian Inference?

I was looking at the Bayesian MAP estimate formula which is the "argmax(likelihood * prior)". Can this be calculated using stochastic gradient descent? Gradient descent requires knowing the derivative. The derivative of the likelihood function is routinely calculated and I am guessing it should be possible to calculate the derivative of most prior distributions? Thus, can stochastic gradient descent be used to calculate the argmax(prior * likelihood)? Thanks!
