How to shorten blockquote to wrap around floated div?

I'm stumped on a css problem. I've put up a test page here: http://georgecrawford.com/test/ for you to check. I have a left-floated sidebar div, and a main content div which follows it (and which should wrap around it). If the content is just paragraphs, there's no problem, as the text wraps nicely around the float. However, I have some blockquote s in the content, and I'd like these to have a background-color and/or a border. The text in these is no problem, it wraps nicely around the sidebar of course. However, the blockquote itself spans the entire width of the content div, which means a border around it would run over the top of the sidebar . How can I ensure that blockquote s in the content div are shortened horizontally to be the same width as the text lines (the 'line boxes') within them? Paragraphs have the same behaviour, but I don't need a border around my paragraphs! Thanks for any help!
