GET is for data retrieval only. You can refine what you are getting but it is a read only setup and yes, as you mentioned anything used for refinement are part of the URL. POST is meant for sending data, but is generally a way to 'break' the simple workings of HTML because you are neither guaranteed of anything that is happening, it can just fetch data, send data or delete data. There are also PUT and DELETE in the HTML standards, but its all about finding web servers that support these actions as well. As the names imply PUT sends data for either the creation or updating while DELETE is for removal of data. Enjoy! :)
