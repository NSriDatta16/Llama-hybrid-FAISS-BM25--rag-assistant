Best way of reading & processing a text file

Was wondering if anyone had any favourite methods/ useful libraries for processing a tab-delimited text file? This file is going to have on average 30,000 - 50,000 rows in it. Just need to read through each row and throw it into a database. However, i'd need to temporarily store all the data, the reason being that if the table holding the data gets to more than 1,000,00 rows, i'll need to create a new table and put the data in there. The code will be run in a windows service so i'm not worried about processing time. Was thinking about just doing a standard while(sr.ReadLine()) ... any suggestions? Cheers, Sean.
