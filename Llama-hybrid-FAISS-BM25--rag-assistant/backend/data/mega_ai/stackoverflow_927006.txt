LINQ to SQL -- Can't modify return type of stored procedure

When I drag a particular stored procedure into the VS 2008 dbml designer, it shows up with Return Type set to "none", and it's read only so I can't change it. The designer code shows it as returning an int, and if I change that manually, it just gets undone on the next build. But with another (nearly identical) stored procedure, I can change the return type just fine (from "Auto Generated Type" to what I want.) I've run into this problem on two separate machines. Any idea what's going on? Here's the stored procedure that works: USE [studio] GO /****** Object: StoredProcedure [dbo].[GetCourseAnnouncements] Script Date: 05/29/2009 09:44:51 ******/ SET ANSI_NULLS ON GO SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF GO CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetCourseAnnouncements] @course int AS SELECT * FROM Announcements WHERE Announcements.course = @course RETURN And this one doesn't: USE [studio] GO /****** Object: StoredProcedure [dbo].[GetCourseAssignments] Script Date: 05/29/2009 09:45:32 ******/ SET ANSI_NULLS ON GO SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF GO CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetCourseAssignments] @course int AS SELECT * FROM Assignments WHERE Assignments.course = @course ORDER BY date_due ASC RETURN
