I would suggest you a basic road-map about how to go about it: You can brush up basic math and stats at Khan Academy, and/or take the Intro to Statistics course by Udacity . Then, you can take these two nice courses of Udacity. Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics Then, you can dive into some Bayesian stats. And one of the best-related resource on the web which I have found is the Think Bayes free e-book Then, dive into the basics of Machine Learning. Coursera's Andrew Ng's course is the perfect start. And this resource: Machine Learning for developers is also very useful for skimming through the concepts quickly. Then, you are on your own. You have enough resources and blogs on the internet for building up on these concepts. Bonus: A wonderful site for such road maps is Metacademy , which I personally would vouch as one of the best Data Science resources on the web. Gitxiv is another beautiful site, which connects the Arxiv research papers on Data Science with the relevant open source implementations/libraries.
