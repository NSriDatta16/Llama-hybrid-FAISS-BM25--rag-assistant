How to adjust line size in geom_line without obtaining another (useless) legend?

iÂ´d like to adjust the size of my lines (both of them), because i feel they're too skinny. The following code does so, but creates a legend for size, which is useless since size has no variable that can be mapped to it. qplot(date,value,data=graph1,geom="line",colour=variable,xlab="",ylab="",size=1) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-0.3,0.3)) + opts(aspect.ratio = 2/(1+sqrt(5))) + scale_colour_manual("Variable",c(Line1="red",Line2="blue")) + opts(legend.size="none") My plot consists of two lines representing a time series of two different variables over the same time span. The variable is mapped to color. If I try to influence the size of the line, qplot always tries to map "size" to another parameter and display another legend. I also followed this discussion, that ended with Hadley telling the others that removing a part of the legend is not implemented yet. I understand that adding another paramater to the mix implies the need of a legend for this parameter. Maybe I am using the wrong command to influence line size just for visual reasons. Thx for any suggestions!
