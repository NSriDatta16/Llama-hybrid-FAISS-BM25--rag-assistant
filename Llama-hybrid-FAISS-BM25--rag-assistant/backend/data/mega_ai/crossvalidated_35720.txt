Your analysis reports "19710 degrees of freedom ". Are you trying to use simple OLS to deal with time series data? If yes the answer to your question #3 is "0" as polynomial regressions in time are incorrect. Use fixed effects such as hour of the day , day of the week , holiday effects etc . Detect significant level shifts and/or local time trends and incorporate them as predictors. Detect anomalies and incorporate pulse indicators. Test for constancy of parametrs and constancy of variance (error) over time. In summary your r-sq suggests that you have incorrectly specified the model and are just finding significance due to your false sample size.
