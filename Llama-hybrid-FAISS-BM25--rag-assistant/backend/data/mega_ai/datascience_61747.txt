Which scoring for GridSearchCV is best, when imbalanced multiclass dataset?

I have an unbalanced multiclass dataset (GTSRB) and want to optimize the hyperparameters of an SVM through GridSearchCV. I know that accuracy is not suitable for scoring in this case. Which evaluation method for scoring would be most appropriate in this case? At the moment I tend between the following: - f1_score (average='macro') - cohen_kappa_score What are your experiences in such cases?
