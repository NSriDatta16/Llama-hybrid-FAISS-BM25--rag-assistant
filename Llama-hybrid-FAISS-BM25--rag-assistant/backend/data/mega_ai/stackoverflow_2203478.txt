Some questions, How is ArticleTag different from Tag? Or is that the M2M mapping table? Can you sketch out how you've implemented the cosine matching algorithm? Why don't you store your document tags in an in memory data structure of some sort, using it only to retrieve document IDs? This way, you only hit the database during retrieval time. Depending on the freq of document addition, this structure can be designed for fast/slow updates. Initial intuition towards an answer - I'd say, an online clustering algorithm (perhaps do a Principal Components Analysis on the co-occurrence matrix, which will approximate a K-means cluster?). Better refined once you answer some of those questions above. Cheers.
