"Select All That Apply" -- How To Generate a Predictive Model with this Type of Question

For a particular question in a survey, respondents have been asked to select all that apply (i.e. say from a list of books they have read). I'm wondering if anyone knows how I would be able to build a model that predicts which book they have read based on demographic variables obtained in the survey? I know it would be possible to construct a model like this using Multinomial Logistic Regression if they were asked to select a single book (i.e. perhaps selecting the last book from the list they have read, if any). Any suggestions/help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
