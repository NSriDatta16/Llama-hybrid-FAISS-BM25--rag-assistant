What is the correct number of observations to report for an ARIMA/ARIMAX model?

This might be due to my relative inexperience with time series modelling, but I am confused about the correct number of observations to report for an ARIMA/ARIMAX model. I couldn't find any post that directly gets at this (though Number of observations used for ARIMA modeling comes close). Say I run the following model: fit1 And then check the number of “used” observations (wording from the documentation): fit1$nobs length(lh) The number of observations is one less than the total length of the time series, because we difference it once (ARIMA(0,1,0)). Fair enough. But if I then add a lag: fit2 The number of “used” observations is the same, which is confusing to me, since I would have expected to lose an additional observation in the beginning of the series. How can we have a value for the lag at the first observation? Same thing goes for MA terms: fit3 How can we have a value for the lag of the error at the first observation? Clearly I’m missing something. It gets even a little bit more confusing if I want to incorporate transfer functions with the arimax function from the TSA package, since arimax doesn’t return a nobs object nor does it have a nobs method. I would greatly appreciate some help on this! Best, Bertel
