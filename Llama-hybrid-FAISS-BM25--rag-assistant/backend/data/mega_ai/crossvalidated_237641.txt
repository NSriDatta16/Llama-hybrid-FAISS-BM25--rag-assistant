A typical classifier will probably fail miserably. However, the type of problem you refer to is know as one-class classification. You can see a great description of one-class SVM here or go to this wiki page . Conceptually, think of a simple 2 feature linear SVM. You are trying to draw a line that best separates the 2 groups, but with only 1 group where would you draw that line? However, you could imagine a one-class SVM where instead you draw a circle encompassing all of the training samples.
