Try this experiment. Double the size of your data set by exactly duplicating every case. Then rerun your logistic regression. You should find that for every predictor term the estimates of coefficient and odds ratio turn out the same as before. What will change are the p -values and the standard errors on which they depend. These standard errors will all be smaller than before by a factor of the square root of 2. So the procedure adjusts standard errors in light of sample size; it does not change estimates of the relationships of interest. And when I say "sample size" that includes the sample sizes for the subgroups defined by your predictor variables. Each comparison of one subgroup to another will have its standard error affected by those subgroups' sizes. If your study's group of Hispanic patients had numbered 160 instead of 1,623, you would have seen dramatically larger standard errors and p -values for the corresponding comparisons. There are some statistical procedures for which differently sized subgroups typically require special design considerations. Logistic regression is not one of them.
