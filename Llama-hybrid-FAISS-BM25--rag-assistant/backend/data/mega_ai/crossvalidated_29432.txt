The binomial still applies here if you want to just forget about Bayesian priors. I assume we know that C is one of the colors of the balls in the urn. Then it doesn't matter that there could be forty other colors represented. Define X as the random variable that is 1 if the ball is C and 0 for any other color. Then since there is replacement and random draws each time the number of balls colored C is binomial with some unknown proportion p and S is still binomial with parameters N and p. S/N is the maximum likelihood estimate for p and it is unbiased.
