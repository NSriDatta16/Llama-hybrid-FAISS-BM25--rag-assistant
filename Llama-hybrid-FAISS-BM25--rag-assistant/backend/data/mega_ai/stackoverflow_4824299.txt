If by repeated regions you mean areas such as the footer , which is generally the same in each web page, then you would normally create a file (e.g. footer.html) and then include that in each of your web pages. For example as I use PHP, i would use the following wherever I wanted my footer to appear. This way, when you want to change the footer, you only have to do it in one place. Good practice is to identify the parts (or regions) of your site which will be the same in all your web pages and then use the process above to organise your code. For more visual control, you should make sure that all your web pages link to the CSS file of your choice. I hope I understood your question.
