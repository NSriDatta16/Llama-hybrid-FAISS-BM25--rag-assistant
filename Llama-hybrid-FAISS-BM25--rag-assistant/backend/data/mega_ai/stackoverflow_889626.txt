To get a bounding box with a certain angle, rotate the polygon the other way round by that angle. Then you can use the min/max x/y coordinates to get a simple bounding box and rotate that by the angle to get your final result. From your comment it seems you have problems with getting the center point of the polygon. The center of a polygon should be the average of the coordinate sums of each point. So for points P1,...,PN, calculate: xsum = p1.x + ... + pn.x; ysum = p1.y + ... + pn.y; xcenter = xsum / n; ycenter = ysum / n; To make this complete, I also add some formulas for the rotation involved. To rotate a point (x,y) around a center point (cx, cy), do the following: // Translate center to (0,0) xt = x - cx; yt = y - cy; // Rotate by angle alpha (make sure to convert alpha to radians if needed) xr = xt * cos(alpha) - yt * sin(alpha); yr = xt * sin(alpha) + yt * cos(alpha); // Translate back to (cx, cy) result.x = xr + cx; result.y = yr + cx;
