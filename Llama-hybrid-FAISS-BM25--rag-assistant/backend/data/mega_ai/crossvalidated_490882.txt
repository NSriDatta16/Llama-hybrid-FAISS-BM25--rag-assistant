Why is BART so good?

It seems that BART (bayesian additive regresssion trees) is a very widely and successfully used method for causal inference. However this method was designed as a predictive method and does not explicitly account for any problems encountered in causal inference. Are you familiar with any theoretical explanation or theorems proving why is BART such a successful method?
