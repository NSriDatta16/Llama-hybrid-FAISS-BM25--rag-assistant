This is to prevent fitting high-order polynomials for the time series in levels (not differenced), something that is only rarely plausible. According to the function's documentation , if there is more than one difference taken, no constant is included regardless of the value of this argument. This is deliberate as otherwise quadratic and higher order polynomial trends would be induced . {Emphasis is mine.)
