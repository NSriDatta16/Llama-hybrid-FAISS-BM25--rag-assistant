As a researcher dealing with randomized trial, should I use GEE or a GLMM?

I'm sorry, I searched all topics on StackExchange and cannot still get the difference between marginal and conditional model. All answers tell me the same by showing averaged non-linear curves, which agrees in the general linear model (one averaged straight line is a literally average of random intercepts), but doesn't in the GLM (attenuation of the coefficients). But still - what does it mean to me, a physician? If I have a randomized longitudinal (repeated-measure) study comparing two drugs, where I measure some binary clinical outcome 5 times and want to compare the % of successes at the last timepoint, but using all the data, I fit a longitudinal model, right? I can run GLMM or GEE. The regulator asks me to use unstructured covariance with GEE. GLMM with random slopes and intercepts might the concurrent model. But then I hear that each tells me something different. The overall model coefficients differ between the two. People tell me, that for the randomized study I need the population-average results that simplify things and force me to think about complicated random effects, introduce any additional assumptions and ensure easier convergence, and is not that much dependent from the chosen covariance. Others tell me, that mixed model needs additional assumptions about the random effects, I know they hardly converge for random slopes + intercepts, depend on this structure (correlation of the two) and are also conditional to the random effects. So what does it mean for having just 2 fixed terms - Treatment*Time? I want to check the Treatment : Time, or simpler Treatment at time N. How do I interpret the result of the 2 methods? Now I add biological sex and race to the model. This cannot be changed for a patient, it's fixed. I was told that GEE will treat this as a comparison between sub-populations of men and women, and different races. THIS IS what I want. At the same time I was told that GLMM will treat a patient as one changes their sex or race(!). This is totally twisted to me. But most of the people I know tell me GLMM is better. HOW come!? Statisticians tell me that "you should choose the model". How can I if I don't get it? My research question is: to compare 2 drugs. I want to make it adjusted for sex and race. Do I need a conditional or population-average model in this case? I understand, that for inference about comparing I should use GEE, and if I wanted to predict the success, should I then use GLMM?
