Repeating random forest models to get highest prediction accuracy

I am using a random forest code to run one random forest model and distinguish which variables are important for classification and then to run a second random forest model using only these variables to reduce noise. The problem is that different variables are added to the model on different iterations of this process. I decided to repeat this process 10 times and use the model that produces the highest prediction accuracy (repeated measures sub-sampling from withheld data) as the model I report in my results. Is this a valid method?
