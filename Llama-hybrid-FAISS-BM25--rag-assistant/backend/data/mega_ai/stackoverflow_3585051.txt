Sounds like you can set the property selectedRange to put the cursor where you want. You'll need to translate from points (in your touchesBegan method) to an NSRange value, however. Another option might be to always have your TextView editable, and use the UITextViewDelegate 's textViewShouldBeginEditing method. I've never done any of this, however, so take these suggestions with a grain of salt.
