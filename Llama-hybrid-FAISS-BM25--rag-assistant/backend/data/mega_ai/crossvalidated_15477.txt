Why the Breusch-Pagan test fails if I set the intercept to zero?

I'm using bptest function of lmtest package to use Breusch-Pagan test. I get a strange result, doing the follow: > m bptest(formula(mod)) studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: formula(mod) BP = 0.458, df = 0, p-value m bptest(formula(m)) studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: formula(m) BP = 0.0503, df = 1, p-value = 0.8225 as you can see if I set the intercept to zero ( + 0 ) i get a very low p-value, then if I do the test again WITH the intercept I get a good p-value. Setting the intercept to zero also returns df = 0 so, something went wrong. Could someone explain me the reason? Thank you!
