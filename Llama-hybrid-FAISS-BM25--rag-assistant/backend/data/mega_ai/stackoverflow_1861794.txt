Haven't tried this, but \b should be the character group you're looking for. From the PHP manual : \b word boundary Your code would then look something like this: $pattern_array = array("preheat", "minutes", "stir", "heat", "put", "beat", "bowl", "pan"); foreach ($pattern_array as $pattern) { if (preg_match('/\b'.$pattern.'\b/i', $paragraph)) { // also removed the ')' $stopwords = 1; break; // to exit the loop } } Edit: seems people are better off using \b, so changed this accordingly
