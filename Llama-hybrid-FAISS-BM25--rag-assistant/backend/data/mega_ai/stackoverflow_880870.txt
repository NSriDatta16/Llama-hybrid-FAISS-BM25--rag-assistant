Another SharePoint Admin here (means NO experience w/ Lotus products) but as the admin of another platform before SharePoint, I can give you some thoughts on why we switched, and what we've seen as some advantages of the SP platform. May or may not apply to your situation. Integration w/ other MS products. I work in a MS centric environment, and we had just upgraded to Exchange 2007 as well as Office 2007. The degree of integration between those 3 platforms has been very helpful in driving user adoption. Specifically the ability to create and check in documents from Word - straight to an SP doc library etc. If you are using an older version of Office, the integration still exists, but it's not quite as clean. MS has a paper on their site which outlines the differences in functionality w/ SP 2007 and the different versions of Office. In your post you mentioned IM / Video etc - just to clarify - SharePoint does not provide this functionality - but it does integrate well w/ the MS product that does - Office Communication Server. This is a very powerful tool which provides chat, shared desktop, IP based video and audio conferencing - and for SP - presence awareness. What this means is, if you drill into a document library - and see a white paper that I wrote, or just updated - by my name will be a small dot, which will show green (available) yellow (idle) red (busy) as well as give you options to email me, text, set an appt etc. The amount of collaboration this has facilitated has really helped our teams. I have a question about your white paper, proposal etc, I see you are online, and I can ping you immediately. Very cool. Connectivity to other platforms. Our previous document management system was very niche - and the idea of connecting a multi-function printer / scanner to is and scan documents directly into the system was non-existant. With SP, however, its such a standard, that you can connect to pretty much any system out there. Extendability. On our old platform, we had to train developers specifically on that system. In most cases we ended up hiring outside consultants to develop and maintain the platform which was not cheap. With SP, 85% of what we want to do is available out of the box, or with no coding available. For the small percentage of true customization that is requested, our .Net developers can handle it (since the code base is the same) This means we can manage resources much more effectively and do all out development in house. Those are a few things that come to mind. In terms of the documentation you ask for - MS does have some pretty good whitepapers on their site which document company's experiences with migration from other systems, cost savings etc. Some propaganda there - but also some good information. My understanding is that SharePoint is MS's fastest growing application - and they have put a lot of money into making it a robust platform. Its on version 3 now - with 4 due out before the end of the year - so it's turning into a very mature platform as well. That at least gives you one side of the coin. Hope you can get some insight on Lotus.
