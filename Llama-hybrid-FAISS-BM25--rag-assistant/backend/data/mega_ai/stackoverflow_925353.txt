HTML 4 does not make it explicit. HTML 5 specifies that the first submit button must be the default : 4.10.21.2 Implicit submission A form element's default button is the first submit button in tree order whose form owner is that form element. If the user agent supports letting the user submit a form implicitly (for example, on some platforms hitting the "enter" key while a text control is focused implicitly submits the form), then doing so for a form, whose default button has activation behavior and is not disabled , must cause the user agent to fire a click event at that default button . If you want to influence which one is "first" while maintaining the visual order then there are a couple of approaches you could take. An off-screen, unfocusable button. .hidden-default { position: absolute; left: -9999px; } Not the default Looks like the default Flexbox order: .ordering { display: inline-flex; } .ordering button { order: 2; } .ordering button + button { order: 1; } First in document order Second in document order
