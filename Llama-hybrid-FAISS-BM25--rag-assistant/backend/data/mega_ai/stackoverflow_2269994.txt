Error handling in Lua using longjmp

I'm embedding a Lua interpreter in my current project (written in C ) and I am looking for an example of how to handle errors. This is what I have so far... if(0 != setjmp(jmpbuffer)) /* Where does this buffer come from ? */ { printf("Aargh an error!\n"); return; } lua_getfield(L, LUA_GLOBALSINDEX, "myfunction"); lua_call(L, 0, 0); printf("Lua code ran OK.\n"); The manual just says that errors are thrown using the longjmp function but longjmp needs a buffer. Do I have to supply that or does Lua allocate a buffer? The manual is a bit vague on this.
