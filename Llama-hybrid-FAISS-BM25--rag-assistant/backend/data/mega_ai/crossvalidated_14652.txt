I'm assuming your dependent variable is some sort of discrete Likert-style score. If so, I'd just make sure the R-squared wasn't near either extreme and put more attention on your regression coefficients. By the way, what kind of regression model did you use? Ordinary least squares can be frowned upon for presenting final results, but can provide a good first indicator of a relationship. For a final paper I'd go with an ordered probit or logit. You want to be very clear about the distribution you're imposing on the dependent variable -- for example, using least squares assumes that the numbers on the scale are equidistant, when in reality people are pretty inconsistent when providing subjective scores.
