It would be nice to see the full example to answer with more precision, but I'm thinking that there is too much stress on the permutation part. For example, you are correct in noting that ${55,57}$ and ${57,55}$ give us the same average, but is it true that you will always retrieve these two instances of the population during random sampling? The interesting question for me trying to understand CLT is how the number of samples impacts the statistic under consideration, e.g., i might like to know how 'off' the mean of the first sample is from the actual mean (since in this case we know the entire population) and how many more samples are needed to approach the true mean. I'd also wonder how many instances should make up a sample...
