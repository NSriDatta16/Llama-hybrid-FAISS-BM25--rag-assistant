How could I change window's location without reloading and # hack?

At first I thought that hash hack is a requirement, however judging from the recent updates from facebook, I am thinking otherwise. The original hash hack (I am not sure if this is the correct term) is that by changing location.hash, one may save a state in the URL without refreshing the page. That is extensively used by Google's apps, and Facebook, and lately #NewTwitter. However today I noticed that Facebook no longer have this "#" if you use a "modern" browser - like chrome or firefox. I double checked that they are not reloading by using developer tools and firebug respectively. With a minimal search in stackoverflow, the closest one to the solution is using Flash - however I disabled Flash and facebook.com still works like a charm. Judging from the coverage in chrome 8 dev and firefox 4 beta, I wonder that could be related to HTML5-era APIs, but the code in Facebook is not of my capacity to debug to find out what they did. Since this is like the first question I ask here, I wonder if any of you may have already solved this problem. Thanks guys. P.S. Doesn't work on IE8, haven't tested on IE9 beta.
