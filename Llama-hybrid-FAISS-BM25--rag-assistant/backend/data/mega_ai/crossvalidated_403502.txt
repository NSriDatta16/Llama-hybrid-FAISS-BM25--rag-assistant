Is it a good idea to use CNN to classify 1D signal?

I am working on the sleep stage classification. I read some research articles about this topic many of them used SVM or ensemble method. Is it a good idea to use convolutional neural network to classify one-dimensional EEG signal? I am new to this kind of work. Pardon me if I ask anything wrong?
