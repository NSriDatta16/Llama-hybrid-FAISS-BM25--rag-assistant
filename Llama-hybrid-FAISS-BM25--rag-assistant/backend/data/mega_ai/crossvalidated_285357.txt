How to limit interaction terms in logistic regression in R

I am running a logistic regression model with 5 predictor variables. I would like to include an interaction term in this model. However, when I use the formula: glm(Indroad~A+B+C+D+E + (A*B*C*D*), family=binomial(link="logit"), data=sub.data) or the formula: glm(Indroad ~ A*B*C*D*E, family=binomial(link="logit"), data=sub.data) I am given an output that includes all possible combinations for the interaction term (e.g., A:B, A:C). I am really only interested in the terms A:B:C and A:B:C:D:E . Is there anyway to limit the interactions that R runs? I have tried without success to use the update command, and have tried to run the same formula with - unwanted interaction terms (both without success).
