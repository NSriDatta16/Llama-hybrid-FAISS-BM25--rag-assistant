Take a look at the lrm() function from the Design package. It features everything you need for fitting GLM. The Hosmer and Lemeshow test has limited power and depends on arbitrary discretization; it is discussed in Harrell, Regression Modeling Strategies (p. 231) and on the R-help mailing-list. There is also a comparison of GoF tests for logistic regression in A comparison of goodness-of-fit tests for the logistic regression model , Stat. Med. 1997 16(9):965. Here is an example of use: library(Design) # depends on Hmisc x1 which yields something like Sum of squared errors Expected value|H0 SD 100.33517914 100.37281429 0.37641975 Z P -0.09998187 0.92035872 but see help(residuals.lrm) for additional help. The following thread contains critical discussions that might also be helpful: Logistic Regression: Which pseudo R-squared measure is the one to report (Cox & Snell or Nagelkerke)?
