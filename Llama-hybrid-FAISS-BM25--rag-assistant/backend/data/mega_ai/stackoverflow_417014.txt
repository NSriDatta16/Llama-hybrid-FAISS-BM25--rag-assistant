How do I notify TFS of build stats?

I am told TFS can accept data on build/test metrics from 3rd party continuous integration tools. Does anyone know how this works or have any good links for me? My google-fu seems weak today and I cannot find any info on this. We would like to have a short powershell script or app run at the end of the build and send all known metrics up to TFS so it could show up in certain reports. I actually would like things that (I think) should already have space for in the data warehouse for TFS BUild Server, but I will be using CC.NET. I am thinking build name, result (Pass/Fail), Number of Warnings, Number of Errors, Time, UnitTests Run, UnitTests Passed, Code Coverage, FxCop resultsThanks.
