Can you read pragma statements on command line startup in SQLite

I use the command line sqlite3 executable to check queries I make from my code. Is there a way to read in pragma statements or other session setup (".mode csv" for example) when the executable starts up? I know I can do a ".read " once I'm in, but that's tedious.
