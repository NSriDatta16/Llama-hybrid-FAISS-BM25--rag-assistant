You are on the wrong track - you won't use the sqlDataSource control at all. You'll go for a more direct interaction with the database from code. For example: SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString); SqlCommand cmnd = new SqlCommand("Insert Into Table (P1, P2) Values (@P1, @P2)", conn); cmnd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@P1", P1Value); cmnd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@P2", P2Value); cmnd.ExecuteNonQuery(); conn.Close(); Now, with that all being said, you'll want to learn the SqlCommand and SqlDataReader in some detail (they are pretty straightforward) and then turn your attention to building a Data Access Layer that makes sense to you. You'll be glad that you did.
