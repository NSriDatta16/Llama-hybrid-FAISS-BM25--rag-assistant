accessing movieclips within a movieclip from the main timeline

Ok i have a mc called dracoplay and inside is another mc called Drakep and inside that there is another mc called wing and head as you may have guessed they make up a dragon. So dracoplay is the character that gets coded, it moves, breathes fire, etc. etc. Drakp is the body and the head and wing have animations. I have one problem i have no clue whatsoever how to make access Drakep /*head*/ wing from the main timeline.
