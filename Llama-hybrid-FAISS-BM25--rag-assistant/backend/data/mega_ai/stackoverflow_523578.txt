in response to the 2nd paragraph: yes, i'd suggest developing the app without any ajax/js of any sort. make sure the actions work and function correctly. then add the ajax (for UX) later. this approach may also lend itself to inspiring you about how to have the app fall back to the non-ajax method for non-js-enabled users (like mobile phones)
