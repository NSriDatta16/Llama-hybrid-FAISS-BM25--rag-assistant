The slides are about Perceptron algorithm not SVM (although it's quoted maybe mistakenly). First equation is about normal perceptron, and the second is about the kernel version of it. They're equivalent. However, perceptron algorithm only give you a solution, not necessarily the max-margin solution. For having max-margin solution, you need to look at the SVM slides, and solve it using the Lagrangian and KKT conditions (slides after 15).
