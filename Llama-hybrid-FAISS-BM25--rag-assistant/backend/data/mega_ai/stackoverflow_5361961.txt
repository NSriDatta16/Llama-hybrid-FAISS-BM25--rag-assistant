If it's the scheduling which is the hard part for you, you can either use either a scheduled job with the SQL Agent to do your nightly work in a stored procedure, or you can write a console application which does the same which you execute via Windows built-in scheduled tasks. The code itself shouldn't be that hard from browsing your requirements. Good luck :)
