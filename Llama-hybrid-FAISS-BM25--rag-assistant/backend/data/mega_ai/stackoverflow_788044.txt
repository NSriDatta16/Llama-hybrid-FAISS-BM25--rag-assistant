The user agent switching is not a "mode" all it does is makes Safari report the IE/Firefox/etc user agent -- so navigator.userAgent will report the UA of a different browser. This is only really useful when you're looking at supporting safari (or webkit in general) and want to rule out user agent checks as the cause of "incompatibilities"
