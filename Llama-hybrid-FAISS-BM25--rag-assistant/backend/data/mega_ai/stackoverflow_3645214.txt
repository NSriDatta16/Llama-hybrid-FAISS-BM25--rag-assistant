Simple and general Client-side Persistence solution?

Have to say I wish I could implement server-side persistence (i.e., session-based and/or database-based user state persistence), but unfortunately my uni's server has limited resources provided and it is really hard to implemented a Perl based session solution (CGI::Session and Apache::Session not installed, dated Perl version, dated Perl environment, etc). So I guess my last resort would be with some client-side persistence approach, most preferably Javascript-based, should be not a solution only for Flash or HTML5. I just did a little bit research online for this unfamiliar topic and found these: Pablotron: PersistJS Dojox.storage YUI 2 Storage Utility I wonder which would give me the simplest way of managing user session, basically, I reckon I only need to manage the user session Id, and maybe several other important keys; for the rest of data, I will just put them in database. This is purely for uni work so I am not considering of having a really thorough solution. I know there must be certain drawbacks for this, such as security risks, but... please just confirm me whether this is a feasible and practical way. Thanks for any suggestion in advance!
