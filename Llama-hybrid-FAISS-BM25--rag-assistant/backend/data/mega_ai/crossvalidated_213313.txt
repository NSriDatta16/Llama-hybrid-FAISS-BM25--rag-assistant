Calculate Probability of Membership from kmeans in R

How can I calculate the probability of membership with R's kmeans output? The output of kmeans is as follows: k Is this enough information to copy what we get from Mclust ? library(mclust) m Obvious question is "Why not use mclust ?". My data is too large to computationally do hierarchical clustering. I have tried with Mclust , NbClust , vegan , and many others. The call to dist that all of the functions use max out after a few hundred thousand rows. I have seen some talk about probabilistic-D, and "soft" clustering, but I do not know how to implement it without changing the output of the original clusters from kmeans . Edit I know that SAS is able to export probabilities with PROC FASTCLUS , but from what I hear it is taking a sample of the data to get the probabilities. That might be one route to take if I could figure out how it's doing the subsetting.
