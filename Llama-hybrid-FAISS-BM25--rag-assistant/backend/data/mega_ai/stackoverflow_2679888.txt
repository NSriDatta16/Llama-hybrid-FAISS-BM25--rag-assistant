Dividing sections inside an omp parallel for : OpenMP

I have a situation like: #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, k, val, p, l) for (i = 0; i Thanks for reading, phew! Well I am noticing a very minor difference in the results (0.999967[omp] against 1[serial]), when I use the above (which is 3 times faster) against the serial implementation. Now I know I am doing a mistake here...especially the connection between loops is evident. Is it possible to parallelize this using omp sections? I tried some options like making shared(p) {doing this, I got correct values, as in the serial form}, but there was no speedup then. Any general advice on handling openmp pragmas over a slew of for loops would also be great for me!
