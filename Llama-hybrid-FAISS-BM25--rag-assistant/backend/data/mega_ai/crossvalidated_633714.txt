First, using PCR or PLS does not remove any of the usual assumptions of regression that you list. There are lots of posts on when and why these assumptions are needed (not all are needed for all uses of regression). I'm not going to repeat those here. PCR and PLS also require that the underlying analysis be met. Both of those are based on covariance matrices, so those matrices have to make sense. Laird Statistics has a detailed list, but, briefly (and this is my paraphrase of Laird): The variables should be measured at the interval level, although ordinal is possible with modifications. The relationships between the pairs of variables should be linear. Sample size large enough to assure a reliable result. The relations among the variables should be strong enough that variable reduction makes sense. No outliers. For PLS, the matrix include the dependent variable. For PCA it only includes the independent variables.
