Winforms -> Visualize dragged item for Drag & Drop

I'd like to achieve the following and was looking for a sample/tutorial but couldn't really find anything: I have C# Winforms application, which has multiple Forms within the same process. I'd like to be able to drag & drop items within and between forms and would like to provide some custom painted visualization of the item being dragged. For example, my IM app shows the effect that I'd like to achieve: Thanks, Tom
