I think HTC Desire/Motorola Milestone [HDPI screen],HTC wildfire [LDPI screen] and one phone having mdpi screen size may be some LG/Samsung Phone can be good for testing. All this devices are available in India. I'm suggesting HTC phones because this devices readily gets latest Android updates. Also Its nice to have devices from different vendors as it will be helpful to test device specific behaviours/issues.
