Usually it is easy to differentiate between additive and multiplicative seasonality by using the plots. A time series with multiplicative seasonality will generate a plot with increasing amplitude. The following link will provide a few extra details. http://www.forsoc.net/2014/11/11/can-you-identify-additive-and-multiplicative-seasonality/ In my opinion, it is better to transform the data (e.g. Box-Cox transformation). This way you do not have to worry about multiplicative seasonality and fitting can be performed using an additive model.
