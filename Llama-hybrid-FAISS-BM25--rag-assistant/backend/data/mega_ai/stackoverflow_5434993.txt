Gettext is not thread-safe . Before deciding to implement your own I suggest you take a look at Zend_Translate . It has native support for a gettext adapter, as well as TMX, CSV, INI, Array and more formats. It should also be easy enough to write your own adapter if your preferred format isn't supported, such as database storage.
