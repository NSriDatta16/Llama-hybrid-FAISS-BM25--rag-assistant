Bayesian absolute loss function

I came across a paper related to Bayesian decision theory where the absolute loss function is introduced somewhat straightforwardly. This is part of the result. $\frac{\partial}{\partial a}\int_{-\infty}^a (a-\theta)\! f(\theta|y) \, \mathrm{d}\theta$ = $\int_{-\infty}^a \! f(\theta|y) \, \mathrm{d}\theta$ = $Pr(\theta\leq a|y)$ Since the upper limit of the integral depends on "a", differentiation under the integral sign can not be applied directly. I have been trying to adequate the leibniz rule to reach this result but I think the solution might be much more simpler.
