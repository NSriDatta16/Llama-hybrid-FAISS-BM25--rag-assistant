As suggested by kjetil b halvorsen there is always a Bayesian approach to the problem. This however requires the selection of a prior distribution on the pair $(\alpha,\beta)$ that must reflect prior or expert knowledge on the parameter $(\alpha,\beta)$ as the posterior will reflect as much the prior as it does the information contained in the single sample. Or only the prior if there is no data. Given such a prior $p(\alpha,\beta)$ the posterior is (a) the prior for no data and (b) the distribution proportional to $$p(\alpha,\beta)\, \alpha^x\,\beta^{1-x}\, \Gamma(\alpha)\,\Gamma(\beta)\big/ \Gamma(\alpha+\beta)$$ which is not a standard distribution unless $p(\alpha,\beta)$ cancels the terms $\Gamma(\alpha)\,\Gamma(\beta)\big/ \Gamma(\alpha+\beta)$ as for instance $$p(\alpha,\beta)\propto e^{-\lambda\alpha-\mu\beta}\, \Gamma(\alpha+\beta)\big/\Gamma(\alpha)\,\Gamma(\beta)$$which is particularly delicate to caliber (and justify).
