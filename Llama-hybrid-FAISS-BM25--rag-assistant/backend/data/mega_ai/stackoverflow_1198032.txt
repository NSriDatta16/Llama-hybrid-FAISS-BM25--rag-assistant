I've run into the same kind of trouble, at work, with a colleague : one day, we started having a segfault, with apparently no reason, as the same code was running fine on another machine :-( We ended up removing code coverage (as it was not that useful to us ; was too low anyway) Couple of things you could try : try with the latest version of Xdebug (sometimes, those are supposed to correct stuff like that) try with an older version Xdebug (why not ? ) think about splitting your test suite in two executions on PHPUnit : one execution with code coverage, for unit-tests one execution without code coverage (as you don't use it anyway), for functional-tests Another thng might be to try with a CVS version of Xdebug 2.1, instead of the the stable 2.0.x ; but not sure that'll help (see http://www.phpunit.de/ticket/513 for instance) There are a couple of bug reports related to segfaults on Xdebug's Mantis BT ; some of those are not solved. For instance : http://bugs.xdebug.org/view.php?id=402 http://bugs.xdebug.org/view.php?id=321 http://bugs.xdebug.org/view.php?id=176 Anyway, good luck...
