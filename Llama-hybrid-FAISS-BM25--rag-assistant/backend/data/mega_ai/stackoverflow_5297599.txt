No. TCP is a stream-oriented protocol - this is how it should work. If you want to see the fragmented packets introduced by the various hops in between you and the peer, you'll need a packet capture library. You could just as well receive the packets 1 byte at a time, the concept of "chunks" of data is gone as soon as the client delivers its payload to the IP stack. Using TCP_NODELAY simply ensures that the sender will transmit data immediately - not that all hops up to and including the recipient will avoid combining packets.
