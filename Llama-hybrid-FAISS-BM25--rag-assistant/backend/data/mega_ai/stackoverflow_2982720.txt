The is semantically incorrect for this usage. is a semantic tag used to indicate the title of an article or primary section of content. In this case you are attempting to use the tag to alter the presentation of the text rather than the purpose of it. For this, you would be better served by using the span tag and assigning a class style: Welcome! blah blah blahbitty blah Different idea: Add a line-height to the first line of your paragraph tag to be equal to your Welcome line's expected height: p:first-line { line-height: 1.5em; } This might cause an odd space in some browsers I think (I haven't tried it out yet). Another idea: You could add a style with top-padding to the block element you're using for your primary content area. This would prevent text from starting until it is ready to start. Keep in mind this approach adds this padding to the overall size of the block element, so a block element with a height of 100px and a top padding of 20px will actually be 120px.
