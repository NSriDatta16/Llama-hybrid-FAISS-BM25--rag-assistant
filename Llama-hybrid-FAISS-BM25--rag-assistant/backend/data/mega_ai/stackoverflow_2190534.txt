I have done a very similar thing to Tony. Its kind of a user generated content type thing let me explain. The database contains a table with a list of the form names and then the path of a help file (word doc) that corresponds with that form. Certain users have access to a form that allows them to say what help file corresponds to each form Each form then has a help button so when the user clicks on it they open up the correct help file. This way it is totally flexible, if they just want one big help file then all the links point to that but if the users want to put the effort in then they can make a file for each one. As they help files are separate from the DB storage is not a problem and also help files can be changed without having to recompile the application. You could merge this idea with Tonyâ€™s and have the help files online if you wanted. I just find this a nice design pattern
