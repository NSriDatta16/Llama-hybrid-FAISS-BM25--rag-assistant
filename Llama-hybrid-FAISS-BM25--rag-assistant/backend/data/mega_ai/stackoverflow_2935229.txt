PHP Multiple form tokens

I am considering generating a unique form token and storing it in a session, and embedding it as a hidden input in my forms. Could I make this work for pages containing multiple forms, is it still safe to use the same token for each form? I'm looking to detect bot requests on my website, can these form tokens really safely replace CAPTCHAs?
