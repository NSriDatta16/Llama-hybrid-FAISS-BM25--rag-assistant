Why don't all feature selection methods in sklearn allow specifying desired variance explained?

Why don't all feature selection methods in sklearn allow specifying desired variance explained? sklearn.decomposition.PCA does allow inputting a percentage of variance that one wants to be explained in place of n_components . However other methods such as SparsePCA expect the user to "know" how many n_components he/she wants to take.
