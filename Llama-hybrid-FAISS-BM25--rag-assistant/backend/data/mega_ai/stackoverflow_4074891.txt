Wrong Merchant Type From Magento

I have set up payment processing through Authorize.net (actually through a reseller) and I am able to successfully perform Test transactions. However, when I perform real transactions, I get a Rejected transaction. When I check the transaction in the authorize.net account I see "General Error (Request rejected by FDC Omaha - Wrong Merchant Type). I assume this is some sort of configuration problem between First Data and authorize.net or me. However, I have no way of telling exactly what the problem is. Authorize.net told me to contact my MSP and the reseller is saying there is nothing they can do to fix the problem (I find it hard to believe.) Is this a setting on my side that I can fix? Help!
