You are decribing " categorical variables " (represented in R a factors). These can be incorporated into almost any statistical model by being assigned levels. You would need to give more detail about your particular problem in order to be advised on a particular method. Edit If the response variable has two possible outcomes, you might consider binomial or logistic regression. Note: If you're not familiar with the different kinds of variables in statistics, I suggest reading the first few chapters of Andrew Gelman's " Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models " which covers this in a very understandable manner.
