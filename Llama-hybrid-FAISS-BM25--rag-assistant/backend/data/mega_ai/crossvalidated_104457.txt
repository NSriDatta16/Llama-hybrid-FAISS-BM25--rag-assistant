Qualitative Response models, logistic regression being the most widely known, could in principle provide you with a way to arrive at a conclusion on these matters, in a regression framework. The usual logistic regression model is specified as $$P(Y=1\mid X=1) = \frac 1{1+\exp\{-\alpha-\beta X\}}$$ where both $Y$ and $X$ should be binary, to fit our purpose of checking sufficiency and /or necessity. One can easily see that $$\frac {\partial P(Y=1\mid X=1)}{\partial \beta} >0$$ So if the estimated $\hat b$ is found to be "very large", the estimated probability will tend to $1$. But $P(Y=1\mid X=1) = 1$ essentially says "the appearance/existence of $X$ is a sufficient condition for the appearance/existence of $Y$". For necessity of $X$ for $Y$, swap the variables' roles and estimate $$P(X=1\mid Y=1) = \frac 1{1+\exp\{-\gamma-\delta Y\}}$$ If this probability tends to $1$, it conceptually approaches the statement "$X$ is necessary for $Y$". But see the comments below for why you should not try this at home.
