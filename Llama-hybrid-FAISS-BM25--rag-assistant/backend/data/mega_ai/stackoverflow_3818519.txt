I encountered this problem, and my solution was to create a .bat file to set the maven opts, and then start jetty. call set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8484,server=y,suspend=n %MAVEN_OPTS% call mvn jetty:run-war -DskipTests=true My IDE of choice is Eclipse, so I use the run button with the tool box to call the .bat files.
