sqlite3: read-only main database and ATTACH

I am looking to understand the implications of using ATTACH with databases with different read-write permissions. I have a scenario where I need to access a large database (approx. 512MB) that resides in a read-only filesystem. There is also a small read-write database with the same schema that resides in a read-write filesystem. The read-only database provides the base data used in my scenario, with infrequent data updates stored in the read-write database. Currently I open these two databases in separate connections and the code that maintains the connections is responsible for presenting a unified view of the data to its clients. For example, this means that the code has to merge query results from the read-only and read-write databases, etc. I realize that this setup is inelegant (and likely suboptimal) and have been looking to use the ATTACH command to create a unified view of the data in SQL rather than C++. I am wondering then whether there are any particular gotchas related to attaching read-only and read-write databases that I should be aware of. I am looking at one of the following ATTACH scenarios: Open the read-only database as main and ATTACH the read-write database. This is my preferred solution. Open the read-write database as main and ATTACH the read-only database. A third alternative? A few google queries pointed to messages suggesting problems in scenario (1). Because I did not find a definitive answer and because my own testing using sqlite 3.6.13 did not reveal any problems, I am posting this question. Thank you for any insights.
