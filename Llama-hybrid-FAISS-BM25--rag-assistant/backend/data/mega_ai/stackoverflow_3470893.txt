Magento Community (CE) and Enterprise (EE) are separately maintained codebases with different code repositories and everything. So, even though some code is promoted from (tested on, more accurately) CE, they are not "based" on each other. This is an ongoing issue as some improvements (such as non-EAV caching tables and PCI compliance related code in EE) are drawing the two codebases apart. With more information on the error, some here may be able to help solve the problem. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
