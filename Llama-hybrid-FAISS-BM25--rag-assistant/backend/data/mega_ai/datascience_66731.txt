Training Machine Learning in Production

Is there a way to train your machine learning model in the cloud? Or does it really have to be batch training? i.e. (Pull some data on SQL, then feed that to the model) What i was thinking is implementing my own model from scratch, use Stochastic Gradient Descent to update the parameters for every row from the database.
