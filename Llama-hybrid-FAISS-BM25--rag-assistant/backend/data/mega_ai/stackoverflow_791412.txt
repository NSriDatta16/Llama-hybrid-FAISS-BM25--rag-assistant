offline data storage & access using jQuery

does anybody have any experience writing up a offline data storage & access app on jquery. my server side app would be an ASP.Net app. basically, i would be providing a trimmed down version of my web app so that users could access some of the data while they are offline and can sync the data when they connect again. I have heard of google gears but wanted to hear from people who have used it or who know more on this subject.
