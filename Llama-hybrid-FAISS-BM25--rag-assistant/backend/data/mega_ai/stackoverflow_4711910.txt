Copy and re-name a file on android

I have a file which I am using as a temporary file until the user selects to save this file, How do I go about making a copy of this file but at the same time re-naming it. Example below: File 1: /sdcard/Folder/file1.wav File 2: Copy of file 1, renamed to file2.wav in /sdcard/Folder/file2.wav I understand using Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath() gets me the path to the external storage so i'm not asking how I get to the sdcard or whatever. just to make a copy of a file and re-name it.
