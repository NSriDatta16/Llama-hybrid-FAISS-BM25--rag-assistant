Creating graphs of CNN models: cannot use plot_model from keras.utils.vis_utils

I am using keras w/ PyCharm on windows 10. I am trying to print my tensorflow.keras.Model using from keras.utils.vis_utils import plot_model ... res_net_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs,outputs=outputs) ... plot_model(res_net_model) #, to_file='cnn_resnet_model.bmp') #, show_shapes=True, show_layer_names=True) I am for some reason getting File "C:\Users\Zack's 2016 Tower\.conda\envs\tensorz\lib\site-packages\keras\utils\vis_utils.py", line 240, in plot_model expand_nested, dpi) File "C:\Users\Zack's 2016 Tower\.conda\envs\tensorz\lib\site-packages\keras\utils\vis_utils.py", line 79, in model_to_dot _check_pydot() File "C:\Users\Zack's 2016 Tower\.conda\envs\tensorz\lib\site-packages\keras\utils\vis_utils.py", line 28, in _check_pydot pydot.Dot.create(pydot.Dot()) File "C:\Users\Zack's 2016 Tower\.conda\envs\tensorz\lib\site-packages\pydotplus\graphviz.py", line 2032, in create status, stderr_output)) pydotplus.graphviz.InvocationException: Program terminated with status: 1. stderr follows: Format: "ps" not recognized. Use one of: Process finished with exit code 1 I have confirmed that graphviz & pydotplus has been installed by conda. I've also tried to installing graphviz as an executable that's within my path. I've looked through similar postings such as this and this with no luck: nothing matches my error. It doesn't even tell me what formats I should use (although this may have the answer). It shouldn't matter because atm I'm not asking it to generate an image. I have no idea where it is getting 'ps' from.
