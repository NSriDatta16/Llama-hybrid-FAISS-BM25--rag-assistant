Skip it. All will be just fine. I'm sure you have a deadline to meet. (/sarcasm) Next month, we can go back and optimize the queries based on user feedback. And break things that we didn't know we weren't supposed to break. If you think the project will last 2 weeks and then never be reopened, automated testing probably is a waste of time. Otherwise, if you have a vested interest in "owning" this code for a few months, and its active, build some tests. Use your judgement as to where the most risk is. Worse, if you plan on being with the company for a few years, and have other teammates who take turns whacking on various pieces of a system, and it may be your turn again a year from now, build some tests. Don't over do it, but do "stick a few pins in it", so that if things start to "move around", you have some alarms to call attention to things. Most of my testing has been JUnit or batch "diff" type tests, and a rudimentaryy screen scraper type tool I wrote a few years ago (scripting some regex + wget/curl type stuff). I hear Selenium is supposed to be a good tool for web app UI testing, but have not tried it. Anybody have available tools for local GUI apps???
