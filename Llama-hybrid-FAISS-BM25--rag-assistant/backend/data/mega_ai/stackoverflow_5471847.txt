If you are using jQuery, I would first of all use $("#options").bind("change",function(){ //your code here }); rather than setting the .onchange property directly - setting event handlers in this way is generally discouraged, for a number of reasons. However, your main problem seems to be that you are trying to bind this event handler before your "options" input is even created. If you use what I have suggested above, but use "live" instead, it will work even if the "options" input does not yet exist //i've attached keyup in this example, but you could try modifying it to "change" $("#options").live("keyup",function(e){ var optionValue = parseInt(e.target.value); $('#container').empty(); //note optionValue, not optionValue //note " ').appendTo('#container'); } }); Also be aware that javascript is case-sensitive. I've corrected optionvalue to optionValue Note: I'm not intending to "answer" your "question" here, but trying to help a bit. It seems to me that your "question" involves fixing your code, so that means that you really need a lot of answers to a lot of different questions. This is just one of those answers.
