What is causing Thread Contentions with my Azure Queue code?

I just ran the Visual Studio 2010 Thread Profiler against my Azure code and noticed I'm getting a LOT of contentions. My code is blocked more often than it is running! My worker has no custom threading logic in it at all. It is a simple While loop which asks various queues if they have work. I make an instance of the QueueRepositoryClass and then invoke the GetQueueMessage function. It looks like that for some reason multiple threads are hitting my GetQueueMessage method and are using the same queueClient instance. Perhaps its a result of me rusing the CloudStorageAccount object? Or is it the CreateCloudQueueClient extension method?
