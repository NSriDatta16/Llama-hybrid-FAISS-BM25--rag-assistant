Where are the Resource bundles: There is a directory under grails-app called i18n where all the generated resource files are placed, start looking there and see how they are used in the app. You may be able to just place multiple message files for your controllers in there for organization, just be careful of reusing keys as I'm not sure how that will be handled off hand. How to access them: Maybe this will help I hope: http://www.nabble.com/Organizing-message-bundles-tt16169280.html#a16169280
