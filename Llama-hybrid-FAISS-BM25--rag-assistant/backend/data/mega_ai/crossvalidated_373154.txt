One source I found was An Approach for Determining the Number of Clusters in a Model-Based Cluster Analysis . They used an Analytic Hierarchy Process that treated the various Information Criterion as the Criteria and the number of clusters as Alternatives. I found it extremly interesting, because it removes the issue of stating to use one criteron method over another. For those that do not want to read it, here is the conclusion: This paper has proposed to combine the AHP and some information criteria, namely AIC, AWE, BIC,CLC, and KIC,in determining the number of clusters of a data set in model-based clustering. It has been concluded that the proposed approach has been seen to be more accurate than the corresponding information criteria. The approach has thus been realized to be capable of application to a widespread number of clustering algorithms. To carry out this study, the decision matrix has been created by using the information criteria values for each case. To increase the successes of the information criteria, a pairwise comparison matrix has been suggested in this study. Note that the proposed method is strongly expected to be very effective in analyzing data come out in various of Ô¨Åelds science such as economics, biology, engineering etc. For further studies, researchers can pay their attention to produce different decision and pairwise comparison matrices to deal with their problems.
