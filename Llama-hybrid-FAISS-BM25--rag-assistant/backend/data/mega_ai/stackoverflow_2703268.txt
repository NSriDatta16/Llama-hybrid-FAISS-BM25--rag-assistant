I'm not sure if this will solve your problem or not, but check out the Any+Time(TM) JavaScript Library . Skip over the parts about the Date/Time widget and look for information about AnyTime.Converter, which is an object that converts strings to Date objects and back. It now includes format specifiers for UTC Offsets/TimeZones, as well as options for overriding the local time (check out the docs section on UTC Offsets , which includes options for utcFormatOffsetImposed and utcParseOffsetAssumed). There's also an example in the next section that explains how to take a local time and display it in GMT. If you have any questions or problems with it, submit them via the contact page for quick attention. I hope this helps!
