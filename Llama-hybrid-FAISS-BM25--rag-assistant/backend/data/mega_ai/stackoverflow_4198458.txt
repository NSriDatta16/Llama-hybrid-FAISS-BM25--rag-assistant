How do I mark code to be excluded from code coverage analysis in VSTS

NCover has an attribute IgnoreFromCoverage that allows for code to be marked for exclusion during code coverage analysis. Is there a way to do this with the VSTS Code Coverage Tools? Obvious uses for this would be auto property getters and setters, non obvious uses may be code generated by R# equals implementation or ORM generated code.
