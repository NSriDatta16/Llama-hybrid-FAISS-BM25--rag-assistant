Bayesian inference with sampling and mixture models

I'm having some trouble doing Bayesian inference on an experience I have in hands. I apologize in advance if it is too complex, but I couldn't find a trivial way to split it in several parts. Let there be $N$ bags, each of them containing some balls. They do not have the same number of balls, but the number of balls they have follows a known distribution. Moreover, we know the total number of balls, $M$. We know that a random subset of the $M$ balls are marked differently from the others. It is not necessarily a proper subset - the size of the subset can be anything from 0 to $M$, inclusive. Consider that there is no correlation between the "marked status" of a ball and the bag it is in. Finally, we are allowed to look at a random sample of the $N$ bags (consider a simple random sample with a known probability $p$). The objective is to guess the total number of marked balls inside all bags. This experiment will be done a large number of times and the accuracy of the guesses will be measured by taking the mean absolute error of each experiment and calculating the average of those errors in the end. We do not control most of the parameters above, and therefore I'd prefer not to rely on strategies such as the CLT, that assume certain conditions for the parameters. My high-level strategy so far was: Model, using numerical means, the distribution of the number of marked balls the sample of bags would have, given the total number of marked balls; Start with a prior of believing that all possible numbers of marked balls are equally probable and update my belief using Bayesian inference after I know how many marked balls my sample has; Give the median of the posterior distribution as the guess that minimizes the mean absolute error. Is there anything fundamentally wrong with that approach? Is there any simpler solution? If the approach is correct, can you guide me in the process of modelling the distribution in step 1?
