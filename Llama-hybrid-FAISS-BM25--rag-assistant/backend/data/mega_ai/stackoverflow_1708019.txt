You'll probably find that re-architecting the whole app to only allow access to data identified by the organization column a lot more development work with the possibility of leaking data from one organization to another if it all isn't thoroughly tested. Also you'll probably find that having lots of databases on a single server might help with scaling things up at a later date, as you can move some databases off to another server. For backups, a single maintenance plan can backup all databases on the SQL server. In the longer term I think this is probably the best solution without knowing much more about how the database and app execution details and planned growth over time.
