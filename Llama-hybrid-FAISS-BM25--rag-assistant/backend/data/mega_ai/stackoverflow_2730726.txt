If you want to do this with OpengGL, you'd normally do it by supplying the current data as a texture, and writing a fragment shader that processes that data, and set it up to render to a texture. Once the output texture is fully rendered, you can retrieve it back to the CPU and write it out as a file. I'm afraid it's hard to do much more than a very general sketch of the overall flow without knowing more about what you're doing -- but if (as you said) you've already done this with CUDA, you apparently already have a pretty fair idea of most of the details.
