Which version of IE & Firefox are you using. You will need IE 8 and Firefox 3.5 for getting the support for Local Storage. Here is how you can access them: Saving form data to local storage - $("#save").click(function() { localStorage.setItem("tsk",$("#task").val()); }); And retrieve them through: $("#load").click(function(){ $("#tasks").val(localStorage.getItem("tsk")); }); I am using jQuery for selecting my DOM, but you can use access the local storage even without that.
