Model loss stays the same for hours before dropping

I'm training a CNN to colorize images. The model I have is not incredibly deep, and should work fine on the card I'm training on (2080 TI). Initially, I suspected the model was flawed in some way because the loss would drop a little bit, and then would stay in the exact place, fluctuating randomly. However, I tried letting it run overnight, and found that my loss would stay the same for a couple hours and then slowly move downward, before reaching another plateau and repeating the whole process over again. Why is this happening? Is there any way to combat it, so I don't have to wait an absurdly long time for the network to train?
