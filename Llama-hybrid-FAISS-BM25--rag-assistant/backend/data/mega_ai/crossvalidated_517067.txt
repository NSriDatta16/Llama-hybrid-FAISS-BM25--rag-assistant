The question is, what do you expect for a c parameter if its boundaries start at e-20: c_space = np.logspace(-20, 1, 50) param_grid = {'C': c_space} scikit learn already tells you that the c parameter can be definetely higher than 1 or 10 https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_rbf_parameters.html Look at your gamma then you may be able to also get a grasp at why your c is so low (look at the plots of in the link). If gamma and c are e.g. very low, it could be that your data seems linearly seperable.
