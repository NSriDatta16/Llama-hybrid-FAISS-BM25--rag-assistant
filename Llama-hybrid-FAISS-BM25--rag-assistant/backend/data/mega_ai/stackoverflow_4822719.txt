Simple Jquery Hover Issue

I have some very simple jquery as listed below: $(".block").hover(function(){ $(".drag").stop().fadeIn(1000); }, function(){ $(".drag").stop().fadeOut(1000); }); I have a series of divs, each having a class of block . When I hover over .block , .drag fades in ALL of the divs with a class of block. I just want the .drag to be faded in on the element that the mouse is hovering over, not all of them. Thanks!
