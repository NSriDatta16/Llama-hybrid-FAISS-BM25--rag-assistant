I would guess that choosing the right data storage method will have more effect than whether you read from disk all at once or as needed. Most database tables have regular offsets for fields in each row. For example, a customer record may be 50 bytes long and have a pants_size column start at the 12th byte. Selecting all pants sizes is as easy as getting values at offsets 12, 62, 112, 162, ad nauseum . XML, however, is a lousy format for fast data access. You'll need to slog through a bunch of variable-length tags and attributes in order to get your data, and you won't be able to jump instantly from one record to the next. Unless you parse the file into a data structure like the one mentioned above. In which case you'd have something very much like an RDMS, so there you go.
