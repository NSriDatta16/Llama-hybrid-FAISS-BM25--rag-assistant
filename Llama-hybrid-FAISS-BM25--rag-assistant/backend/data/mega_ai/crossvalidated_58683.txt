First of all, your data is too extreme, and not at all realistic. There are 100 variables Each variables is equal to 1 with probability 0.01 This means that most vectors will have a single 1 . Many will be 0. Some will have more than one. Try more complex patterns, and more complex data. Try to estimate the parameters from real data, for example. Or just use real data right away. In general you should try to use algorithms that were actually designed for sparse data. Don't use plain PCA - it scales badly with dimensionality. Use Sparse PCA. Don't use plain k-means. It really is not meant for binary sparse vectors. The mean does not make sense here. You should be using modes or medoids instead, or a kernel method.
