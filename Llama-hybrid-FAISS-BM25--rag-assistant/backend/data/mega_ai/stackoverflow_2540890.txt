You should use a Timer. Enable it when you detect the item getting dragged near the top or bottom of the client area. Simply avoiding scrolling when the timer is busy. The Interval property of the timer determines how fast the scrolling takes place. A bonus effect is that the user can speed up the scrolling by waving the dragged item up-and-down. I wrote some sample VB.NET code that uses this approach, you'll find it in this thread .
