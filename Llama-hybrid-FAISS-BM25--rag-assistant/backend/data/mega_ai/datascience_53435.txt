What is the standard terminology for the output matrix of a hidden layer in a CNN?

The output of a hidden layer $h_i$ in a convolutional neural network is (generally) a 3D grid of values. These values are the outputs of the neurons of layer $h_i$ . Is there a standard way to refer to this matrix of values?
