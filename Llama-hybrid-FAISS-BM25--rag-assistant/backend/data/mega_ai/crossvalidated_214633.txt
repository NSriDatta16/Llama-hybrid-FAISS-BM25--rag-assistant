The issue of what to do with zeroes in binary data has received extensive attention in the literature. As you say the odds ratios for the individual studies will be zero or infinite but that can be overcome. @article{bradburn07, author = {Bradburn, M J and Deeks, J J and Berlin, J A and Localio, A R}, title = {Much ado about nothing: a comparison of the performance of meta--analytical methods with rare events}, journal = {Statistics in Medicine}, year = {2007}, volume = {26}, pages = {53--77}, keywords = {meta-analysis, fixed effects, random effects, sparse data} } provides an overview of a number of methods for dealing with sparse data. One solution has been to add a small continuity correction to the cells and @article{sweeting04, author = {Sweeting, M J and Sutton, A J and Lambert, P C}, title = {What to add to nothing? {Use} and avoidance of continuity corrections in meta--analysis of sparse data}, journal = {Statistics in Medicine}, year = {2004}, volume = {23}, pages = {1351--1375}, keywords = {meta-analysis, trials, sparse data} } discuss this in some detail. @article{rucker09, author = {R\"ucker, G and Schwarzer, G and Carpenter, J and Olkin, I}, title = {Why add anything to nothing? {The} arcsine difference as a measure of treatment effect in meta--analysis with zero cells}, journal = {Statistics in Medicine}, year = {2009}, volume = {28}, pages = {721--738}, keywords = {meta-analysis, trials, sparse data} } suggest we should avoid the whole problem. I would suggest starting with the Bradburn reference as it provides advice tailored to different situations and without a bit more knowledge of your precise dataset and scientific question it might be misleading to give you a best buy.
