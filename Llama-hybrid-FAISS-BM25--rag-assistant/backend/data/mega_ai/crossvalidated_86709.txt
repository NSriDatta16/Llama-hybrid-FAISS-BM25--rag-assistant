The question has a lack of clarity in its explanation - that much is beyond doubt. Consider the question of 'how many men and how many women are present?'. We are told there are "22 separate dates". Is that 22 of each sex? Well, I don't think it can be. My understanding of speed dating is that each person spends time with every potential partner*. * (speed dating for gays or lesbians might involve some kind of round-robin scheduling in place of the straight cycling around of heterosexual speed dating, I guess. Edit: In fact, I think I've just realized how to set up the tables and everything, even with an odd number. ) Let's assume there are equal numbers of males and females. If there were 3 of each sex, how many dates would there be? Labelling females with letters (A,B,C) and males with numbers (1,2,3) we get: A1 A2 A3 B3 B1 B2 C2 C3 C1 (you can read the columns as rounds, and in this schedule the males are cycling around the tables while the females stay in place) That's 9 dates from 3 pairs of each sex, 3 pairs in each of three rounds. And indeed, similarly, $n^2$ separate dates for $n$ daters of each sex. With my keen eye and ( to the BBC at least ) uncanny ability with arithmetic, I have spotted that 22 isn't a square, so "22 separate dates" doesn't work at all. Since it seems there's some mistake in that description, we're left to try to guess how many men and women were actually present. If they had 10 of each sex, and made some other (possibly dubious) assumptions, then the rest of the description works - a woman likes two of the ten men, and each of those two want to see 5 women, which means (this is where the assumptions come in) there's a 50-50 chance each one will include her on their list, and so forth through the rest of it. If the assumptions hold, the numbers seem to work. If, instead, it were the case that there's 11 men and 11 women instead of ten, those numbers would be 'roughly right' instead of right... and this is what I think they mean, because it leads to 'roughly 50-50' not '50-50', and it seems much more likely they'd think 11 men and 11 women would have '22 separate dates' than 10 men and 10 women could. So that's my guess. 11 people of each sex, 121 separate dates, on average women want to see 2 (of 11) men again and men on average want to see 5 of 11 women again. Dubiously assuming this all happens randomly, then two men chosen by one woman each have a 5/11 chance of also choosing her, while the five women chosen by one man each have a 2/11 chance of choosing him.
