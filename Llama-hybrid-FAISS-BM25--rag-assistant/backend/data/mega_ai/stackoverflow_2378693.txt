ASP.NET loading page timer

How could I implement loading timer that are automatically appended to the each displayed page in ASP.NET and MVC? I was thinking to implement it in Global.asax. To log the start of the request and and the end calculate a time and then smartly append it to output stream somehow. It could also be implemented in HTTP handler ... I would like to know how to implement it in the most elegant way and to do the proper display of the result on the each page.
