Stock Price Data Manipulation for LSTM

I am trying to construct a machine learning model that predicts the difference in price from tomorrow to the day after tomorrow, using yesterday's OHLCV (open, high, low, close, volume). My models (LSTM and DNNs), however, give me very poor outputs. I think it is because the data needs to be reformatted in some way, shape, or form (i.e. normalized, log-pct change, etc.) What is the best way to manipulate the input? Should I use a sci-kit 'scaler', or any other method to normalize the data? If so, what range should the scaler be within? What about the output? If I want the output to be linear (continuous, non-softmax value), should I manipulate the output data as well to be scaled, and then unscale the predicted output to match the original labels? Does it matter?
