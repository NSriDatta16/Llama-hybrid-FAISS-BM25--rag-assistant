Multiple iPhone OS devices attached to one Mac -- how to select for build

I have an iPod touch with OS 2.2.1 and an iPhone 3GS with OS 3.0 both attached to my Mac. They both show up in Xcode Organizer. I now would like to be able to select which one of them an application gets installed on when running it from Xcode during testing. Is there any way at all to do this (except unplugging one of the devices, of course)?
