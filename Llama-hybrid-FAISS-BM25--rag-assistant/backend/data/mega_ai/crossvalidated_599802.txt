GAM model parameter estimation problems

I have been trying to develop a GAM to predict future subsidence from previous subsidence data. I am new to GAM and have based my code on [this]. 1 The data looks like this: Longitude Latitude Time Subsidence YEAR month 81 76.29542 10.05154 2015-10-12 0.02640557 2015 10 82 76.29615 10.05154 2015-10-12 0.02955222 2015 10 83 76.29688 10.05154 2015-10-12 0.02672001 2015 10 84 76.29761 10.05154 2015-10-12 0.02426790 2015 10 221 76.29396 10.05081 2015-10-12 0.02521223 2015 10 222 76.29469 10.05081 2015-10-12 0.02637761 2015 10 These have been extracted from rasters if that is relevant. Also, the time series is not regular. Measurements have been taken at unequal periods. I used the following code: library(mgcv) knots The results were significant: Parametric coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -44.800334 1.817401 -24.65 However the gam.check() plots showed this: The predictions are also way off. I have changed the k values multiple times and removed outliers, but this has remained the same. This is my first time doing a GAM and I don't know how to proceed.
