I think you are looking for Variational inference. Shortly, Variational inference is trying to find a function $q(y)$ approximating (intractable) $p(y|x)$. It relies on optimization of the (exclusive) $\mathrm{KL}(q||p)$ that you mentioned, so in multimodal case it will converge to a single mode. As Variational inference texts never forget to mention, you reduce an intractable inference problem to optimization (tuning parameters of $q$). There are good introductory chapters on VI in K. Murphy: Machine Learning, A Probabilistic Perspective , Chap. 21, and in C. Bishop: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning , Chap. 10. For more in-depth overview, see for example Blei et al.: Variational Inference: A Review for Statisticians . There are more great tutorials by David Blei around the internet.
