Copying winforms between projects in Visual Studio

What is the best way to copy or cut/paste a form from one project to another project within a Solution in Visual Studio? Whenever I try it, using the solution explorer (drag and drop or right clicking cut and paste), it only copies the underlying C# code and not the necessary 'bits and pieces' that help you visualise the form via the form designer.
