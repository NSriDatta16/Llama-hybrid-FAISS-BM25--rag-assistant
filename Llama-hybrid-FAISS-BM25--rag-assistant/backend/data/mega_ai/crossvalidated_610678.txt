Equivalence of Logistic regression to Gaussian naive bayes

I was revisiting the differences between logistic regression and Naive Bayes, and had a conceptual question. A logistic regression classifier makes intuitive sense to me as a classifier that directly estimates $P(y \mid x)$ without making any assumptions about how the data is distributed (except that the conditional distribution $P(y \mid x)$ is Bernoulli). To my understanding, however, logistic regression is exactly equal to a Naive Bayes classifier with an assumed Gaussian distribution and constant variance. So, I was wondering, why is it equal if Naive Bayes is making the explicit assumption of a Gaussian distribution? Thanks.
