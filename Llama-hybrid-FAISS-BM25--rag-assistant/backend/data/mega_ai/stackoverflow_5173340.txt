The os.environ['CURRENT_VERSION_ID'] value will be different to your two versions, so you will have separate caches for each one (the live one, and the dev/testing one). So, I assume your problem is that when you "deploy" a version, you do not want the cache from development/testing to be used? (otherwise, like Nick and systempuntoout, I'm confused). One way of achieving this would be to use the domain/host header in the cache - since this is different for your dev/live versions. You can extract the host by doing something like this: scheme, netloc, path, query, fragment = urlparse.urlsplit(self.request.url) # Discard any port number from the hostname domain = netloc.split(':', 1)[0] This won't give particularly nice keys, but it'll probably do what you want (assuming I understood correctly).
