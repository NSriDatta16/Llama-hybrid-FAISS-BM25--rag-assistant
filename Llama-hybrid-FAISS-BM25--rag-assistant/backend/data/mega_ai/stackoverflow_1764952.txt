Implementing it yourself is the only safe option. Even if you find a way to find out if a thread is sleeping, you will still have a race condition if you try to kill it (because it potentially starts processing after you check and before you kill it). Instead of Thread.Sleep you could e.g. sleep 500ms and check if the abort flag is still false, sleep another 500ms etc. before 30mins passes, then do the job, etc. (this would be a pragmatic approach). If you want something more elegant, you could use a ManualResetEvent with a timeout to wait for the main thread signalling that its time to abort.
