What is your definition about "good"? I assume you want to say the bias of sample mean is zero, it is consistent, if so, in 1947, Hsu and Robbins proved that the arithmetic mean converges completely to the population mean provided the second moment is finite. That means, for any distribution, no matter skewed or symmetry, the arithematic mean is a consistent estimator, just assuming a regularity condition. If you want to say variance, or the overall error (often, bias+variance+contamination), the sample mean is often not the optimal choice in a skewed distribution. The Hodges-Lehmann estimator or median of means are often better choices, as proven by Bickel that the Hodges-Lehmann estimator is the best choice among all current nonparametric robust location estimators for a symmetric distribution. Peter J. Bickel. "On Some Robust Estimates of Location." Ann. Math. Statist. 36 (3) 847 - 858, June, 1965. On Some Robust Estimates of Location (On Some Robust Estimates of Location ( https://doi.org/10.1214/aoms/1177700058 )) and median of means nears the optimal of nonparametric mean estimation when the distribution has a heavy tail, proven by Luc Devroye. Matthieu Lerasle. Gabor Lugosi. Roberto I. Oliveira. "Sub-Gaussian mean estimators." Ann. Statist. 44 (6) 2695 - 2725, December 2016. Sub-Gaussian mean estimators ( https://doi.org/10.1214/16-AOS1440 ) ). If you are confident that the percentage of outliers is smaller than the breakdown point of Hodges-Lehmann estimator (29%), then, you can use median Hodges-Lehmann mean, as proposed in my papers.

J. (1984). Generalized L-, M-, and R-Statistics. The Annals of Statistics, 12(1), 76â€“86. http://www.jstor.org/stable/2241035 ). In my paper, I further proposed a solution for $k\notin\mathbb{N}$ case, so the breakdown point of the median Hodges-Lehmann mean can be any value from 0 to 29%. I also attached a picture here to compare the asymptotic biases of all current robust location estimators and new estimators proposed in my papers for four unimodal distributions with different kurtosis (linear dependent on the skewness).
