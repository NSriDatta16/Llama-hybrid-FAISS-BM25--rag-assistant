How to assess effect of intervention in one state versus another using annual death rate data?

I am a beginner in statistics. I have these unpublished data (cases and deaths) of a disease for 7 years (2004-2010) from 2 neighbouring states. The study was started in 2004. State 1 and State 2 received different treatments. The death rate is high in one State. I want to prove that treatment given in State 1 is superior compared to that given in State 2. Time series was not accepted because of many possible confounding variables. I have SPSS and Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. Please guide me. What is the best design? Prospective cohort study or Case-control study? What is the best effect measure (Odds ratio, risk ratio, any other)? What is the best statistical test (?Chi square etc) Can I use meta-analysis in this case? Any other information you think that would be of use.
