ANOVA RBF kernel returns very poor results

I was curious about the ANOVA RBF kernel provided by kernlab package available in R. I tested it with a numeric dataSet of 34 input variables and one output variable. For each variable I have 700 different values. Comparing with other kernels, I got very bad results with this kernel. For example using the simple RBF kernel I could predict with 0,88 R2 however with the anova RBF I could only get 0,33 R2. I thought that ANOVA RBF would be a very good kernel. Any thoughts? Thanks The code is as follows: set.seed(100) #use the same seed to train different models svrFitanovaacv define custom model in caret package: library(caret) #RBF ANOVA KERNEL SVManova load data: dataA2 link to data: wuala.com/jpcgandre/Documents/Data%20SVR/?key=BOD9NTINzRHG
