I would say that you can do almost everything that matters in git and even more than subversion enables you to do. That should not be your worry. However both are popular and deserve your attention especially if you are in opensource programming. I would however consider git to be harder to learn but once you got the hang of it people are usually addicted and find other SCMs inferior. The distributed support for git is excellent (there are others as well, but git is probably the most widespread) which happens to be useful for a bunch of other tasks than managing source code alone. git can be considered a ZIP-utility on steroids and can be quickly deployed to track general filesystem changes and to replicate changes between hosts in an efficient manner. On windows there are some issues with git: Unicode filename support is buggy in many implementations. This gets better all the time, but still it is a problem. Explorer plugins are not that good on Windows. I find it easier to use the command line version instead. But I would consider things that git has and SVN does not. Not having excplicit support for branches in SVN is a major issue - the git implementation is very nice and lets you branch without even thinking of branches. Being able to work offline is a major treat as well.
