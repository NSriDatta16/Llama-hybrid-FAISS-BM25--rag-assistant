In D3D10, all the device resources are virtualized so you won't run out of them. Of course, you can still exhaust the physical resources on the card and cause lots of thrashing if you don't pay attention to what you're doing. In addition, they've changed the device state significantly to reduce the cost of switching state, including shaders. But what you're really asking is "is method X faster than method Y for my application?" and although D3D10 simplifies state management to make switching state faster, the only way to answer the question above is to do a performance measurement with your application and your data. The realtimecollectiondetection.net blog post is just talking about sorting your draw calls. This is going to lead to less state switching. It doesn't matter how fast state switching is, doing less of it is always faster. So that's good general advice.
