Multivariate values to acf() in R

I am trying to understand the concept of auto correlation and I am looking for some help to clear some doubts regarding my data. I have a time series data and it has repeated experiments. Each sample has 4 time points and corresponding values for the genes under study. I have used ind to represent each sample in my data. So ind 1 means rat which is studied over 4 time points and the samples are in rows. I have 400 genes and corresponding values for each sample and each time point. The genes are in columns. my dataset: M1 No ind tme gene_1 gene_2 gene_3 gene_4 gene_5 gene_7 A1T1:2 1 -64 0.0307 0.0022 0.0010 0.0001 0.0007 0.0035 A1T2:2 1 8 0.0365 0.0031 0.0003 0.0002 0.0009 0.0043 A1T3:1 1 48 0.0182 0.0014 0.0001 0.0001 0.0005 0.0018 A1T4:1 1 96 0.0134 0.0010 0.0001 0.0001 0.0003 0.0015 A2T1:1 2 -64 0.0387 0.0032 0.0003 0.0002 0.0010 0.0051 A2T2:1 2 8 0.0264 0.0022 0.0010 0.0001 0.0007 0.0032 A2T3:1 2 48 0.0205 0.0017 0.0002 0.0001 0.0005 0.0022 A2T4:1 2 96 0.0161 0.0012 0.0001 0.0001 0.0004 0.0018 What I want to do is identify is simple: if there is autocorrelation in my data? my code: s1 I get a plot with 4 sub plots. I do not understand how to interpret the result. Also Can I give all the genes as input (for sample 1) to identify autocorrelation? I am new to these concepts hence my understanding is basic. Thanking you for all the help.
