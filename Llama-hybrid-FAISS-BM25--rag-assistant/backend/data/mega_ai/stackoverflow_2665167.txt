Parsing a CSV File to a Rails Database

G'day guys, I'm using fasterCSV and a rake script to parse a csv with about 30 columns into my rails db for a 'Trade' item. The script works fine when all of the values are set to strings, but when I change it to a decimal, int or other value, everything goes to hell. Wondering if fasterCSV has built in int etc parsing or whether I'll have to manage these within my model. Basically, I'm given a giant amount of trades data, need to import it, and then need to provide feedback with say the average trade volume, the times, etc. I understand I can do that all with the wonderful records provided to me by activeRecord but wondered if there was an easier way to populate a rather large Database with a given CSV? Several of the fields don't have values for certain rows, fasterCSV seems to work perfectly when they're all strings, but not when I try to get decimal or other.
