How do I interpret a Cox hazard model survival curve?

How do you interpret a survival curve from cox proportional hazard model? In this toy example, suppose we have a cox proportional hazard model on age variable in kidney data, and generate the survival curve. library(survival) fit For example, at time $200$, which statement is true? or both are wrong? Statement 1: we will have 20% subjects left (e.g., if we have $1000$ people, by day $200$, we should have approximately $200$ left), Statement 2: For one given person, he/she has a $20\%$ chance to survive at day $200$. My attempt: I do not think the two statements are the same (correct me if I am wrong), since we do not have the i.i.d. assumption (survival time for all people is NOT drawing from one distribution independently). It is similar to logistic regression in my question here , each person's hazard rate depends on $\beta^Tx$ for that person.
