creating a registration form

Alright let me explain my situation first: I am part of an organization that "hosts" events. For example, we have an annual camp, skating, hocket/soccer tournaments, dinners, and the like. Now they want me to design their website. My habit is usually to put it on paper first so I am trying to do that. But the problem is here: They need a registration form. But for every event/activity the questions asked are different. For example for the annual camp, theres a question "What allergies do you have?". For the hockey tournament theres a question "Whats your favourite jersey color" and "Name the 5 other people in your team". * *note: there are generic questions like name/age/location/phone/email. Also please keep in mind that these people dont know a thing about web development and how to use it. I know this because I've already made them a website with an admin panel but they still find it too confusing (and also the part where I have to create teh "custom" registration form). I am now thinking of how to incorporate this. Ideally I'd like all this information to go to a database. My options 1) Using online registration form to capture generic information. Pass a PDF link but open the PDF in the BROWSER with the ability to write on it. Upon submitting, the newly saved PDF can go to an email. 2) .. well thats all I have right now lol. Anyone have suggestions/solutions? thanks a lot! tech used: c#/vb.net ASP.NET!
