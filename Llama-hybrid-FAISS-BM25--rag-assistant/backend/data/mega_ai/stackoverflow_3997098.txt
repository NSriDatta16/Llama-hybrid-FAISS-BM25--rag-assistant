Summary/reference documentation on Scala standard library types

Details on the packages/types is in the Scala API documentation on scala-lang.org. But that's organised by class and I (as a Scala neophyte) find it difficult to locate the exact data type I need and work out what operation are supported on what (especially in the huge and powerful scala.collections.* tree). Is there an online or dead-tree resource that either presents this reference information more usably, or guides the reader through the library? Alternatively, maybe I just need to be informed how to use the existing Scala API doc website more effectively. Any advice on effective use of the standard Scala library gratefully received!
