Where are you reading the data? You'll need to read it in and then split the String into numbers with something like str.split() . Here is a more pythonic way: inFile3 = open("data2.txt","r") grade_list = inFile3.readline() inFile3.close() num_list = [int(g) for g in grade_list.split(',')] average = sum(num_list) / len(num_list) print average
