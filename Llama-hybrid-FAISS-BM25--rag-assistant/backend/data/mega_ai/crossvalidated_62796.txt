As for your second question -- there are plenty of ways of clustering and determining the optimal number of clusters. You are using hierarchical clustering and cut the tree to get at the clusters; why not look into kmeans clustering? I was recently also pointed to self organizing maps (SOMs). Spend some time on selecting the best clustering before starting the enrichment analysis; do not choose the clusters based on how well they are enriched. In the case of your approach I have a problem with calculating enrichment after applying the cutting on different levels. In lay terms, if you look long enough, you will always find something. More formally, you are running tests on not independent samples; at least correct the results for multiple testing with the Bonferroni method (which does not assume the independence of the tests). As for the enrichment test itself, I would go with Federico's suggestion and try a logistic regression approach.
