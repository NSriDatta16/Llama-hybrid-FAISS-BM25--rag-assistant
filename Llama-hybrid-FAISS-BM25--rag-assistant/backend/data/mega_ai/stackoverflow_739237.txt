To improve performance of the operation, if you're always going to want to look up objects by some unique identifier, then you might consider using a Map . This will provide constant-time lookup by key. You can still iterate over the objects themselves using the map values() . A quick code fragment to get you started: // Populate the map Map dogs = new HashMap (); for( Dog dog : /* dog source */ ) { dogs.put( dog.getId(), dog ); } // Perform a lookup Dog dog = dogs.get( id ); This will help speed things up a bit if you're performing multiple lookups of the same nature on the list. If you're just doing the one lookup, then you're going to incur the same loop overhead regardless.
