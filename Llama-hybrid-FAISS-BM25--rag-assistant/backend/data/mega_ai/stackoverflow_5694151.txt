Maybe you could leverage that Core Data does not store the Entity to the Store when you insert, this only happens when you save the context. So in the method where you save the context, you can build a fetchRequest and get the number of entities already in the store: - (NSUInteger)countForFetchRequest:(NSFetchRequest *)request error:(NSError **)error If this is three or more, simply get the objects not yet saved using: - (NSSet *)insertedObjects which is a set containing the objects inserted but not yet persisted to the store, and delete these. (warn the user, ask them to buy the full version etc.)
