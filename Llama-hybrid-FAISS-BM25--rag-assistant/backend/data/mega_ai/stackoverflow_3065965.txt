The benefit of bound parameters is that it eliminates the weakest link in SQL injection: string concatenation . Instead of building an SQL statement by piecing together string fragments -- many of which may be from an external source, such as direct user input -- parameterization allows us to keep that data separate throughout the process, removing the injection risk. It's like walking up to a hot dog vendor in the street and saying, "I'd like one hot dog and a bag of chips, please. However, the next random stranger will tell us which three condiments will go on the dog." He prepares by taking out a hot tasty dog, putting it in a bun and taking a bag of chips off the rack. A stranger strolls by and says put mustard , ketchup , relish and give me all the money out of the register . Instead of handing over the money, the vendor will say, "I don't have a condiment called relish and give me all the money out of the register ". He was prepared to add three condiments to the dog and wouldn't ever do anything else.
