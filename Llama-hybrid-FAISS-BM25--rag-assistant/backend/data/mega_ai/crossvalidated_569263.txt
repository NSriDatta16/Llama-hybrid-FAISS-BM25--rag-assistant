If you write down the formula for calculating the test statistic, youâ€™ll see that sample size is a factor. If you have a small correlation value but a large sample size, you can wind up with a small p-value, indicating that there is strong evidence that the correlation is not zero. Even if the true correlation is trivially different from zero, such as $0.01$ , that number is not zero. If you have a small sample size, then you might need a very gigantic correlation value to get the hypothesis test to return a small p-value. Like all hypothesis testing, sample size plays a huge role in testing correlation. For further reading, you might want to look into the difference between practical and statistical significance, and you might be interested in equivalence testing.
