This is probably an issue with the residual covariance structure specification. rcov = ~us(trait):units Additionally, since you are measuring several traits on the same individual it might be interesting to look at the covariance of the different variables using random = ~us(trait):individual Having a look at the model m5a.2, p91 in MCMCglmm Course notes from Hadfield would probably help.
