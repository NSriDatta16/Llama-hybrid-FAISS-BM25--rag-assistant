I would say that ASP.NET MVC and the adoption of jQuery is a response to criticism levelled at the ASP.NET webforms + MSAJAX stack. Webforms was conceived to try bring drag drop control development to the web in the same way applications were built using Visual Basic, ActiveX and COM. Its created a terribly complex and inefficient way of creating web applications. Although webforms will be around for a while, MVC + jQuery is the way to go, or even dropping ASP.NET on the server side altogether and just using something like extjs/jqueryUI and WCF web services.
