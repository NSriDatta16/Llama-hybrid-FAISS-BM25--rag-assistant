Optimization Suggestions for Javascript

Given this code: var minX = minY = maxX = maxY = 0; for(var i=0; i maxX){ maxX = objArray[i].x; } if(objArray[i].y maxY){ maxY = objArray[i].y; } } It works, but I don't think it is very elegant. It is simple logic, but it uses 10 lines of code. Can it be improved?
