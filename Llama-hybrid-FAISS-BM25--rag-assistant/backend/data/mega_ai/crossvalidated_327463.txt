$\bar{V_n}^{-1}$ is a positive-semidefinite average of covariance matrix, then by Spectral theorem we can decompose it as $\bar{V_n}^{-1} = Q \Lambda Q^T$ and $\bar{V_n}^{-1/2} = Q \Lambda^{1/2} Q^T$, where $Q$ is orthonormal and $\Lambda$ is the diagonal matrix containing eigenvalues of $\bar{V_n}^{-1}$.
