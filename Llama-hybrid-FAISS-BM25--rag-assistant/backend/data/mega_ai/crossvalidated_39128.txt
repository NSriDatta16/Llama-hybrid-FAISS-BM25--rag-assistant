Confusion related to prediction

I was referring to this video lecture http://videolectures.net/mlss09uk_murray_mcmc/ where the speaker had something like this $$ p(x|D) = \int P(x|\theta,D)P(\theta,D)d\theta $$ equivalent to $$ \frac{1}{S}\sum_{s=1}^S P(x|\theta^{(s)},D), \theta^{(s)} \sim P(\theta|D) $$ I didn't get how the average was derived and why is $\theta^{(s)} \sim P(\theta|D) $ Can anyone explain?
