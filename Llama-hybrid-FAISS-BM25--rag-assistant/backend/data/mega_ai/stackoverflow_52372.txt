I see you've accepted the noscript answer, but how will you use this to fight spam? noscript will allow you to add special content for users without JS, but unless you're generating the rest of your site in JS, it will still be available to user agents without JS. A captcha of some sort is still likely the best bet. Ultimately, you're trying to get the user agent to prove that it's being controlled by a human, so do your best to make it prove that actual fact, instead of something else. Screen readers for the visually impaired typically go without Javascript, too, and many people browsing from mobile devices have Javascript disabled to speed things up.
