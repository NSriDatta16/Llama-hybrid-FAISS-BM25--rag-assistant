I might be missing something here, but it looks like what you want to use as your backing store is a Dictionary object instead of Arrays. The time to index into a dictionary is O(1). You can't beat constant time. :) Well, you can if your constant time is REALLY long, but it's not for dictionary retrieval. Just make sure your GetHashCode method produces a good hash and you should be golden.
