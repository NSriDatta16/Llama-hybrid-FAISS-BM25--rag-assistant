Dealing with data with no classes

I am new for data science subject and I am trying to learn on my own. Please bear with me if this is a stupid question. I have a dataset that has no classes. The data set comprises people's activity on Office 365 and my goal is to predict whether the person is experiencing pressure or not using machine learning algorithms, but the dataset does not have classes as you all would expect. Can you please help me how I can solve this problem? Is there any possible way to create classes prior to applying ML models on the data? Thanks in advance.
