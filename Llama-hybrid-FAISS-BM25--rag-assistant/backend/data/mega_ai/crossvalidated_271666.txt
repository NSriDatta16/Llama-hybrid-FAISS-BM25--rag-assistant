The statistic/characterization/summary that you are looking for is "there has been a downward trend for the last 7 periods and the first 3 period were inconsistent with that trend' The TSOUTLIERS packages may be useful to generate this statement along with other commercial offerings that might even be more useful for short series like this one..

The preferred method for dealing with causal time series data is called Transfer Function or simply ARMAX .
