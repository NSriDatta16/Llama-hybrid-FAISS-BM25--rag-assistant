Two-sided KS-Test for Evaluating Prediction Model?

In the article https://ginimachine.com/blog/machine-learning-model-evaluation/ there is a proposal of using Two-Sided KS-Tests for evaluating the accuracy of predictions from Machine Learning (ML) models. How suitable is KS-test for this purpose? Would it be possible to analyze other kinds of predictions with ks-test, not just ML models? Is there an accredited bibliographic source which would, eventually, support such claims?
