If you had use warnings; you would have seen: "Reference found where even-sized list expected". Instead of %count = {}; you should have said my %count; What you wrote was equivalent to this: %count = ({} => undef); That is, you initialized your hash with an empty hashref as a key with no associated value. The hashref stringified to "HASH(0x8ae2158)" (the number may change). To clear out a hash, you use parens () not braces {} . Braces construct a hash reference. Even short programs like this should start with: use strict; use warnings; The bugs you catch will be your own. :-) The warnings pragma is preferred to the -w switch because it acts lexically. See What's wrong with -w and $^W in perllexwarn .
