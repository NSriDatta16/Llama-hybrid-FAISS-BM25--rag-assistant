Training a deep neural network using a changing (increasing) dataset

I am trying to train a deep autoencoder (applies also for other architectures) in the following way: Step 1) I start with a fix dataset of e.g. 10k samples. Step 2) A training "loop" consists of 1000 epochs going through the whole dataset with mini-batches of size e.g. 64. Step 3) After one "loop" the trained AE is used to generate more data, which (after some processing) is added to the dataset. After, steps 2-3 are repeated for a predefined number of loops. Question: What would be the best way to choose the number of iterations for one epoch? a) Calculate it as: num_iter = len(dataset)/batch_size , which increases everytime new data is added. b) Keep it constant e.g. num_iter = 200
