False dichotomy. There are plenty of options other than increasing or decreasing, one of which is that each function call performs the equivalent of malloc to obtain memory for the callee's automatic storage, calls the callee, and performs the equivalent of free after it returns. A more sophisticated version of this would allocate large runs of "stack" at a time and only allocate more when it's about to be exhausted. I would call both of those very bad designs on modern machines with virtual memory, but they might make sense when implementing a multiprocess operating system on MMU-less microprocessors where reserving a range of memory for the stack in each process would waste a lot of address space.
