If you're confident that your table and column names are ok, then you can do some safety checks in the database before building your dynamic SQL. This is just for illustration - for real life, obviously you'd need to make it a lot cleaner: declare @TABLE_NAME nvarchar(128) set @TABLE_NAME = 'Robert'');DROP TABLE Students;--' -- This line will raise an error set @TABLE_NAME = 'BOOK' -- This line will go through properly declare @sql varchar(max) set @sql = 'SELECT * FROM ' if exists (select 1 from sys.objects where type = 'U' and name = @TABLE_NAME) begin set @sql = @sql + @TABLE_NAME exec (@sql) end else begin raiserror ('ERROR ERROR ERROR', 0, 0) return end
