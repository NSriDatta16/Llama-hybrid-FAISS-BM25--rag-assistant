I don't know the output of your XSL transformation: I will assume it's the xml format for Excel. Trying to reverse the process I wrote three numbers (007) in an Excel sheet: once as number, once as text and once as number but formatted to show 3 digits padded with zeros. Then I saved it as xml and looked at it. Here is the fragment: 7 007 7 I'm not copying the style but you can easily do it. Edit: as always Google Is Your Friend (and mine, too ;-) ): http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/Articles/CSV/CSV01.htm#CSVAndExcel . Edit (2): I thought the link was enough. The article is saying that (if you are sure the target is only Excel) you can use an Excel-specific CSV syntax. So in your case and looking at your code I think you should insert the missing commas and change the opening writer.WriteString("\""); into writer.WriteString("=\""); Beware that I didn't try. Just one question out of curiosity: wouldn't it be simpler to just output what you need working on the DataSet instead of transforming it in XML generating an ad-hoc XSL performing the XSL transformation copying the result to the Response stream ?
