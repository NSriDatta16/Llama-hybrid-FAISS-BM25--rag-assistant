Logistic regression and unbalanced sample

I am running a logistic regression in SAS where the outcome variable is a binary on sale success (IVs are: location of the customer, Vendor, handling time, experience level of sales person etc.). Either an offer was applied (sale) or it wasn't (no sale). However, the cases with the event of a sale amount to 500 and the one with no sale amount to 10k. Is that a problem? And if it is, how does site affect my estimates/odd ratios and what are possible solutions?
