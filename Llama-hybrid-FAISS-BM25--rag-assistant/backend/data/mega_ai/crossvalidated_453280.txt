GridSearch Cv will calculate the average of out of fold recall for each combination of parameters, the set of parameters with best score, will be chosen by Grid search CV. It is fine to use the entire dataset, as you are using Cv method, which will check the score on out of fold set, hence you are not evaluating performance on Training data (on which model is trained) for parameter selection. for example: we want to tune max depth of tree, let's say maximum depth parameter we want to test are 5,10,15. Grid Search Cv will calculate recall score on out of fold set for all three value. The max depth value corresponding to best score on out of fold set will be chosen. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html
