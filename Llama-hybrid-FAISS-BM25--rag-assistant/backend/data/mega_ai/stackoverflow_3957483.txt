Uploading and Storing videos online using PHP and ffmpeg

I have a website that allows users to upload videos to it, After they upload videos, I would like to be able to display them using a flash player. One flash player i know is flowplayer, althrough if anyone knows a better one I will be happy to know. In any case, as I understood from a brief google search, there are no players that can play .avi/.mpeg files, but they can only play .flv files. I began searching for ways to convert my user's avi's/mpeg's and found that I can use ffmpeg to convert the video to .flv using system(). Is this the best solution for me? I feel like ffmpeg takes a lot of CPU and once I have enough users the server will crash.. Thanks!
