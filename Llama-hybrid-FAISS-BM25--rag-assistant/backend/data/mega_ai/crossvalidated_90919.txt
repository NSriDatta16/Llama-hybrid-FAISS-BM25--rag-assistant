Confusion matrix calculation in random forest classifier in R

After training using random forests on the iris dataset, I get an OOB error and a confusion matrix. data(iris) (model The help mentions that the confusion matrix is based off the OOB data. But I see the confusion matrix reports values using the same number of samples as used in the training input. Can anyone explain as to how exactly the confusion matrix reports its error values? Does it use the OOB error value and scale it to the training data-set size, or does it pick samples of OOB data and run the RF again?
