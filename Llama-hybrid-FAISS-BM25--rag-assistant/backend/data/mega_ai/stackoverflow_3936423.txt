Is it possible that you've failed to request the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission in your app? This would cause deletions to fail. (The camera would be able to write regardless, since it is a separate app with its own permissions.) It's also possible (but not likely) that the media folder is only writable by the camera app, in which case you'd want to specify a different desired destination in the EXTRA_OUTPUT extra of the intent which invokes the camera so that the file will be written into your app's directory. In fact, you probably want to do that anyway to avoid cluttering up the global space with private resources, even if you are going to delete them immediately.
