How to read a delimited line of strings and ints and extract them for processing in VB

I have the following text file (ExamMarks.txt) John, 85, 95, 90 Micheal, 60, 75, 75 I want to extract a line and take the Name and separately and the ints separately. Then I want to print the name and the average of the numbers like this in a label: John's average is 90 Micheal's average is 70 So far I can only display what is in the text file in a label (see below): Dim FILE_NAME As String = "C:\ExamMarks.txt" Dim TextLine As String If System.IO.File.Exists(FILE_NAME) = True Then Dim objReader As New System.IO.StreamReader(FILE_NAME) Do While objReader.Peek() <> -1 TextLine = TextLine & objReader.ReadLine & vbNewLine Loop lblResults.Text = TextLine Else MsgBox("File Does Not Exist") End If Any help is appreciated.
