Do you call setlocale at all? If not, I would suggest either embedding the locale used to generate the file in the settings file or force all settings file I/O to use the C locale, via the previous suggestion of setlocale(LC_ALL, "C") . One other option is to use the locale specific formatting functions (suffixed with _l in MSVC) and create the C locale explicitly, via _create_locale(LC_ALL, "C") .
