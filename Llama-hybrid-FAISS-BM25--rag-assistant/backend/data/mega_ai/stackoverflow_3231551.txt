No , it does not. You have to implement this yourself. If you want to have it all-serverside, look into phpjs, j4p5 or better yet the spidermonkey pecl extension. http://pecl.php.net/package/spidermonkey A better alternative might be to script a real browser yourself via an XPI plugin / XPCOM bridge. There once was an extension called "JSSh", and another "SD connector", http://www.activestate.com/blog/2008/05/jssh-replacement-sd-connector Neither of these options is simple. That's why nobody has done it, and why such extravagant features are specifically not in the HTTP class.
