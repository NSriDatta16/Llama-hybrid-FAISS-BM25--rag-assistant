Getting list of products by category in Magento using SOAP-based API

I need to get all products belonging to a specific category in Magento using the web services API. I tried this method: $product_filter = array( 'category_ids' => array('eq' => '41') ); $product_templates = $magento_client -> call($magento_session, 'product.list'); But it returns an error. I can only assume it's because category_ids is an array, so it won't really ever equal one specific value. I did some research and found another method called category.assignedProducts and tried: $product_templates = $magento_client -> call($magento_session, 'catalog_category.assignedProducts', array('41')); But this returned an 'Access Denied' error. I went and looked at my sandbox of Magneto and saw that 'Assigned Products' has 3 options: 'Remove', 'Update', 'Assign', and I know that the admin for the system I'm linking to has set my access to 'Read-Only'. So I'm guessing that we'd have to check off 'assign' in that list, which would give me more access than they want to give. I could retrieve all of the data and do the filtering on my end, but I wanted to check if anyone knew of a better way. Thanks.
