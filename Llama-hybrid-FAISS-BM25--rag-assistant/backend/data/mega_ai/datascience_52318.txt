Manually creating plants images dataset for machine learning plant type classification and leaf segmentation

A group I work with wants to create its own plants data set that will be used for multiple projects like plant type classification and leaf segmentation for starters. They are willing to provide all the means necessary for the creation of this data set. A partner agriculture company is willing to assist with planting what ever is needed and have someone monitor and capture images every X duration as per requirements. Different growth stages are desired as well. I was asked to write the requirements for how the images should be acquired, however I'm not quite sure of that myself. What are some key points one should know for such a task and are there any known guidelines or tutorials available for data sets creation? Note that currently for this task only 1 plant will be captured in each image as the non-learning methods that will be used to label and segment the images support only 1 plant per image. I was thinking that based on the time it takes a specific plant to fully grow (which is known, approximately), N images should be captured every X days covering 360Â° of the plant. Also, images are to be captured from different angles and distances. Some questions I have in mind that I cant seem to answer yet, Number of images, the more the merrier as long as there are differences? What about the location of the (single) plant in the image? Is it crucial or could it be augmented after the data set has been acquired? What about camera resolution? is any decent camera sufficient for the task or should it be high end? I'm still researching what other considerations there are and would appreciate any information in that matter
