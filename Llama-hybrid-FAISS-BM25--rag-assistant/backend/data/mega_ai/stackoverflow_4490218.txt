I will be interested in seeing what the other answers are. I have not found an elegant solution. Here is what I have done in the past. Have the reader try to open the file exclusively. This will fail if the file is open elsewhere. Have a retry loop....sleep X milliseconds...retry Y times. Usually, I pull X & Y out into a configuration file. Hope this helps. Bob
