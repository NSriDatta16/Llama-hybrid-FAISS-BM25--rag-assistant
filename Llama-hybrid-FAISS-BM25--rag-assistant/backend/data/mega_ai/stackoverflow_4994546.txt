You could use the same method as an old fashioned analog meter. Rectify the sample vector, pass the absolute value result though a low pass filter (FIR, IIR, moving average, etc.), than compare against some threshold. For a more accurate event time, you will have to subtract the group delay time of the low pass filter. Added: You might also need to remove DC beforehand (say with a high-pass filter or other DC blocker equivalent to capacitive coupling).
