Can anyone recommend a good backup "system" for a developer?

I'm known around the office as "the backup guy". As a developer, I often jump back and forth between projects, and as a result I don't always remember exactly what changes were present in each when I return to them. I usually have to compare my local changes versus those in our source control system, and then I'll eventually remember it all. Thing is, I don't always have the luxury of doing this. Sometimes I have to build something for a client quickly, and so I make a backup of the working directory, and that way I can get the latest files from source control, and build the DLL quickly - all while knowing that the other (in-progress) changes are safe. The problem is that I've now accumulated a bunch of backup folders in each project directory, which makes it harder to find the specific change I was looking for. while my practices have evolved to the point that I always take the time to give each backup folder an informative name, I'm starting to think I'd be better off writing my own tool. For example: If I select a few folders in windows explorer, I'd like to have my own context menu item that triggers my own backup application. This application would prompt me for a backup name, and description. It would then move the selected folders to a specific, centralized backup directory - where it would also generate a 'readme.txt' file, outlining the backup details. Also, the backups would also be organized by date/time. I feel this would refine my backup procedure, and facilitate future lookups. But yet, I can't help but wonder if such tools already exist . Surely, someone must be as obsessive as me when it comes to backups. Do you know of any tools that could help me improve my backups? I'm aware of this post , but isn't exactly aligned with what I want. I'd prefer to keep the backups on the same machine - I'll handle moving them over to other machines myself. Update To clarify: If I'm working on Task A, and suddenly I need build something for a client (Task B), I have to backup what I have so far for Task A, and get the latest from source control into the working directory. I then start and finish Task B, and then restore Task A. This is an ideal, neat scenario. But sometimes, I only get back to Task A a week down the line, or further - because I get hit with Task C, Task D, etc - all of which affect the same project. Now, if these changes are scheduled to be checked in, then I would probably benefit from checking them in as I progress (but to be honest, we usually wait until it is complete before we check it in, at this company - that means less checkins of unfinished code). So I'm not sure if each of my backups should equal a branch - because I'm sometimes excessive with my backups.
