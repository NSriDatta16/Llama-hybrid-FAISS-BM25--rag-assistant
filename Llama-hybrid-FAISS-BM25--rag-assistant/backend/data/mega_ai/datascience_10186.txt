Instead of using a random forest classifier, you could instead use a random forrest regression analysis. Use the mean value of the bin as the value (which will take into account the relative values as you suggest). This has the added benefit that if you get a dataset that has actual ages, you don't need to change the training, and you'll be used to translating the scores (ages) provided by the analytic to your bins.
