There are a couple of things you could try to improve performance. Enable GZIP Enable 'Retail' attribute in machine.config Enable Page Caching I've listed the techniques we have used at our organisation to improve the performance of our web applications. With the exception of GZIP the other two probably won't have a direct effect on the JS and CSS files but will save you valuable loading time in other areas making your web site much faster. We always see huge increases in speed and performance when the retail attribute is set to 'True' - all forms of debugging are disabled in this mode which makes the site more responsive. Obviously you only want this setting on your live server.
