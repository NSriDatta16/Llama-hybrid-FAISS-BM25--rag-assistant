How to Find out if an items is not in an array

Ok i just want to know if value x is not in my array Heres what i have been trying Im using VB.net and just need to know when x isnt in the array so i can take an action. thankx Dim L, Path(0) As Integer Open = cleara(Open) sealed = cleara(sealed) Open(0) = Agent sealed(0) = Agent Finds adjacent nodes L = Agent Do Until sealed(sealed.GetLength(0) - 1) = Targ Or Open.GetLength(0) = 0 'Agents(0) = L H = Find_H(L, Targ, Open) 'T = Find_T(L, Targ, Open) ReDim F(T.GetLength(0) - 1) For lp As Integer = 0 To F.GetLength(0) - 1 F(lp) = H(lp) '+ H(lp) Next L = Find_lowest(F, Open) Open = Remove_from(Open, L) sealed = Add_to(sealed, L) Ad = Find_adjacent(L, Targ) For lp As Integer = 0 To Ad.GetLength(0) - 1 Ok here is where my problems is What i need to do is find out if ad is in seal if yes ignore it If ad isnt in sealed the if it is in open compare T values if ad isn in sealed or open then add it to open and set L as parent of ad The below was a way to test and see if the values were loading into the arrays right If Walk(Ad(lp)) <> -1 Then Parents(Ad(lp)) = L Open = Add_to(Open, Ad(lp)) For lp2 As Integer = 0 To sealed.GetLength(0) - 1 For lp3 As Integer = 0 To Open.GetLength(0) - 1 If lp3 This is suppost to be an a* program but i have been having trouble main with my heuistics if you can tell me what im doing wrong it would also be a great help Here is how this work so far Add my location to open Create H,G,F for items in open list Find lowest F Find adjacent nodes Loop through nodes If node is not walkable then ignore If in sealed ignore ( this is where im stuck at ) If not in sealed and is walkable then if in open compare G scores else add to open
