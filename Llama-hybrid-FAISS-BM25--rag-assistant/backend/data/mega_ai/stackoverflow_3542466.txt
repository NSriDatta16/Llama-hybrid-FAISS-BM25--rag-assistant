You can inline recursive functions. The compiler normally unrolls them to a certain depth- in VS you can even have a pragma for this, and the compiler can also do partial inlining. It essentially converts it into loops. Also, as @Evan Teran said, the compiler is not forced to inline a function that you suggest at all. It might totally ignore you and that's perfectly valid. The problem with the code is not in that inline function. The constantness or not of the argument is pretty irrelevant, I'm sure. Also, seriously, get a new compiler. There's modern free compilers for whatever OS your laptop runs.
