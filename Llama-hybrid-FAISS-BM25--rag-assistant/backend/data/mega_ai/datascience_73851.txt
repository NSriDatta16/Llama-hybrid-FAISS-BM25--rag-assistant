Gender Prediction from Offline Handwriting Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Starting from the fact that handwritten documents style are gender-dependent (male and female have different writing styles), I'm trying to predict writer's gender from its handwritten scripts using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). I choose the IAM and KHATT datasets for English and Arabic respectively. After I read research articles related to this problem, I realized that few of them used deep learning (with handwritten word and/or sentence as input to CNN) and the majority used classic methods like (LBP, HOG, GLCM, SFTA), the state of the art accuracy is 80.79% and 85% (for CNN and classic methods respectively), I also read this Article about identifying/verifying writer from its handwritten scripts which uses texture blocks from the written documents that give good results. As data preprocessing I used the method of texture blocks, after line and word segmentation, i constructed texture image from handwriting words, and segment the texture image to texture blocks of size 100*100px. I used 60 writers per gender for training (which give 42,000 texture blocks), and 7 writers per gender for validation (which give 4,000 texture blocks) and 7 writers per gender for testing (which give 4,000 texture blocks). I'm using TensorFlow and Keras as framework, I started with simple (LeNet-like architectures) for base line, I got 60% test accuracy. As a second approach, I used different state of the art architecture in image classification like (VGG16, VGG19, RESNET34, RESNET50) and I got 64% test accuracy. So, my questions are: How to reduce overfitting though I tried regularization methods (Dropout, L1, L2, Batch Norm) to reduce overfitting ? I observed high variance in accuracy, if I re-shuffle the data (e.g from 64% to 50%) ? How to modify CNN architectures to (multi-input CNN) to make the decision on multiple texture blocks, instead of one? texture blocks of females: texture blocks of males: Please point me in the right direction.
