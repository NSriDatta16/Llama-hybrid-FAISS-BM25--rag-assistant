Razor vs Webforms view engine for new ASP.NET MVC 3 site

Razor is prettier (and is new therefore cool). Webforms is something I am already familiar with. Naturally I would unquestionably go for the new thing to learn - Razor. But I have heard of two disadvantages that worry me: can't easily reuse existing web forms controls - in the rare instance I may need to drag something across... I'll reiterate - 'RARE' I hear it is less efficient at rendering (takes longer than web forms) So what are the advantages of Razor over Webforms view engines when using ASP.NET MVC 3?
