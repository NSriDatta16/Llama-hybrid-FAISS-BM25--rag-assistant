We have a similar problem with many of our products: the clients want the data, but they don't want the SQL involved. Our cheap and easy solution was to make a button within the application that returns a gigantic CSV of the live database. They can then take it to their favorite program (Excel, SASS, ...) and utilize the data. This probably isn't what you asked for, at all, but it is a cozy and comfortable alternative for both clients and programmers.
