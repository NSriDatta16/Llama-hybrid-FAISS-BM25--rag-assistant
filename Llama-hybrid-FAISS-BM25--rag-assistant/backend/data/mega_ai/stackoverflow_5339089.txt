With the first approach you mention, instead of creating a 'facade', why not just extend that service? In that sort of situation you'd be able to reuse code from the super / original class. I think if one organizes their package structure in a readable fashion, then having a number of smaller classes is certainly preferable in any case to have large classes that take on a lot of functionality and as such are more at risk for changes. In the end I think both approaches are pretty similar, with either you can end up with a high degree of code reuse, and if you need to update something structure-wise, then its pretty easy to make global change (relatively speaking), and also easy to make specific implementation changes.
