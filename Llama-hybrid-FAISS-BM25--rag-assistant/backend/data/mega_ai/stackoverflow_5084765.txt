get height of nodeList load via ajax with javascript

I am loading in some html using YUI3, that looks like this: This is all of my content, neat neat neat!!!! I've tried using .get('offsetHeight') and .getComputedStyle('height') , but both only return the height of the div and paragraph tag and don't take into account the height of the image. So, even though the image is 150px tall, I am getting 73px returned. Whats the best way to get the width and height of a nodeList when the elements haven't had it set via CSS? Thanks for the help.
