asp.net textbox to html page data

Hi I'm a bit rusty with this again, I have a user profile web page and I'm working on making a wall posting system, I can do it the crappy n easiest way: textbox to listbox and then save the listbox as a text document for retrieval when the client logs in again. But id like to write it to the HTML code or something of that nature. Like those div containers so my style sheet is applied to the data being posted. Could anyone give me a head start to this?
