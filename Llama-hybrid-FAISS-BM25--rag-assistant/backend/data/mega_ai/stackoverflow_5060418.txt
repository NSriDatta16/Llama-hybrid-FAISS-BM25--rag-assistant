You can use the CSS3 pointer-events:none property to turn of interaction for a layered element that would otherwise obscure the page. See: http://robertnyman.com/2010/03/22/css-pointer-events-to-allow-clicks-on-underlying-elements/ This is not well-supported by a large portion of browsers (i.e. IE), however. See also this question: CSS pointer-events property alternative for IE .
