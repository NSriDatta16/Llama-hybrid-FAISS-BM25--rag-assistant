C always allowed for the declaration of x inside the for block. so there is no difference at all, and you should have done that before. The difference is in fact in the declaration of i . This in C89 you would have to have declare before the for loop. OMP then "knows" by itself that the loop variable must be local for each thread. int i; #pragma omp parallel for for (i=0; i Here C99 really eases your life and clarifies your code.
