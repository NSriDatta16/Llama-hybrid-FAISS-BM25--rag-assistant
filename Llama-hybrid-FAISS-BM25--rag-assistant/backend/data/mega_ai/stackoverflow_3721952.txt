How do I get the coordinates of a div?

I have used jQuery UI library to drag divs within a web page. While dragging, the div changes it's position and modifies CSS postion,top and left properties. My questions are: 1) Is their a way in javascript to get the values of CSS properties and save on a variable(so that I can submit it to XML)? Those CSS properties are created on real time when dragging the divs. 2) Can I at least read the new coordinates of the div on the webpage? My goal is to record those values so that when users logs in next time, their modified version of the web page is preserved.
