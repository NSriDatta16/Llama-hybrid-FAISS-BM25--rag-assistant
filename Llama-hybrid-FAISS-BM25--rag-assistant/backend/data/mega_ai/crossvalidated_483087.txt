It is a machine learning algorithm , it doesn't have to belong to either of those categories. Frequentist and Bayesian statistics is the distinction based on how probabilities are interpreted. Machine Learning algorithms are about finding patterns in the data and making predictions based on the learned patterns. Frequentist vs Bayesian is about inference about probabilities, while in machine learning you care only about making predictions, not about correctly estimating the probabilities (indeed, probabilities returned by machine learning algorithms are often not well callibrated ). For being able to make such distinction for machine learning model, you would need to define it in probabilistic terms, and for a Bayesian model, you would need to be able to provide priors for the parameters, as noticed in the answer to the thread you linked.
