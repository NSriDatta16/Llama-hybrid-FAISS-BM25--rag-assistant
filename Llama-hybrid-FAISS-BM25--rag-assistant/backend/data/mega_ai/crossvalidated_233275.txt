Multilabel classification metrics on scikit

I am trying to build a multi-label classifier so as to assign topics to existing documents using scikit I am processing my documents passing them through the TfidfVectorizer the labels through the MultiLabelBinarizer and created a OneVsRestClassifier with an SGDClassifier as the estimator. However when testing my classifier I only get scores up to .29 which from what I've read is pretty low for similar problems. I tried multiple options on the TfidfVectorizer such as stopwords, unigrams, stemming and nothing seems to change the result that much. I've also used GridSearchCV to get the best parameters for my estimator and currently I am out of ideas on what to try next. At the same time, from what I understand I cannot use scikit.metrics with OneVsRestClassifier so how can I get some metrics (F1,Precision,Recall etc) so as to figure out what is wrong? Could it be a problem with my data corpus? Update: I've also tried using CountVectorizer and HashingVectorizer and pipelining them to TfidfTransformer but the results are similar. So I am guessing that the bag-of-words approach is doing it's best in the tokenisation domain and the rest is up to the classifier...
