Quite simply, given the lack of defined process, there's not much chance of successfully implementing a solid release schedule. This isn't just pessimism, although I'l readily admit that it is. Much like success being based largely upon hard work and a little luck, solid, repeatable release schedules are based upon process; having things such as functional specifications and design specifications are really critical to being able to release on a consistent, solid schedule. (You know there's a reason why people have such specification things, right?) And that's not to say that you can't hit your schedule and release expectations without such things; you very possibly can. But what having such process in place massively increases your chances of being able to meet expectations, at least partially because it assures that expectations don't drift into "unreasonable" territory while you're still implementing. Again, this doesn't mean you can't achieve what you need to doing what you described above; to be honest, if you're in an environment that is actively hostile to having such process as described in place, you're probably working in the best way to achieve what you need to. And I don't mean to be completely pessimistic; it sounds like you've got a good grasp on how to attempt to get this stuff done; for what you've got to work with, it sounds like you've got a reasonable process in place. But I can virtually guarantee that you'll end up being better off if you can just get two things; 1) a functional specification from management that describes what they want the software to do, and 2) a design specification from engineering describing to management how you're going to make the software do what they want in the functional specification. I'd think you could possibly even fit this into your process; functional specifications don't need to be complicated; the key thing about them is that they are written down , which prevents bickering about what management asked for; it's right there. And design specifications don't need to take a lot of time either; a quick one-pager to let management know how (at a high level) you're going to implement what they need provides them with reassurance that you've heard them, and can help them understand the complexity involved (but don't go too deep into it, otherwise you run the risk of boring them and losing their attention).
