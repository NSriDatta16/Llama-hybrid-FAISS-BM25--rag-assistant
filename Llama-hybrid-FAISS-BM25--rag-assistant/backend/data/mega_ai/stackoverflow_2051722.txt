Filter Magento Product Collection for Products with Images

I have a product collection that I am getting from a configurable product, and I want to filter that collection to only include products that have images attached to them. How do I go about this? Code looks something like this: $configurableProduct = $this->getConfigurableProduct(); $childProducts = $configurableProduct->getTypeInstance()->getUsedProductCollection(); // add some filter here to get only products with images $childProducts->addAttributeToFilter( /* what goes here? */ ); foreach( $childProducts as $product ) { ... } Any help is appreciated. Thanks! Joe
