A mantra on here is that class imbalance is not a problem for proper statistical methods, and I agree with this mantra (and have posted variations of it many times). However, class imbalance can result in small amounts of data for the minority class, which is the subject of King and Zeng (2001), discussed here . Their feeling is that, when it is hard to acquire data, it is possible to be smart about undersampling the majority class and then account for that undersampling later. This way, you keep down the cost of data acquisition without sacrificing the count of minority-class members. You are not at the data-collection stage, but you do face a similar problem in that you need to use discretion about what data to feed into the model because of hardware limitations. Philosophically, I do not see marked differences between these settings, and the ideas from King and Zeng (2001), which are aligned with the idea behind your plan, apply. If you really are hardware-constrained and cannot work with the entire set of data, your plan seems as reasonable as any. One change might be to downsample only as much as you need to, rather than targeting balanced classes, since the constraint is the data size and not the balance per se. King and Zeng (2001) might be worth a read, too. (The ideal scenario would be to use better hardware or buy some time on hardware that can handle it (e.g., AWS), but these need not be realistic for all applications, making it necessary to get clever.)
