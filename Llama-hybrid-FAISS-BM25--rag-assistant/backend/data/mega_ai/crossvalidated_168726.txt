Need help double checking results of Binary Logistic Regression in SPSS

I'm working on some of my analysis section for my Master's Thesis in MPA, and while I have consulted my professors, I'd just like to double check with some external eyes (As obviously they are on my committee, so they can't over-input into my writing, and not all of them use SPSS) While I realize interpreting results is more involved than a brief glance, I'd thought I'd put it out there. I'm running a Binary Logistic Regression in SPSS on the 2012 National Financial Capability Survey (NFCS) from FINRA. The model is running on a sample of 16768 cases. My research question regards home ownership and student loan debt, which for this dataset is specifically whether the presence of student loan debt amongst respondents with some college education negatively impacts the likelihood of owning a home. This output is from the model after all variables have been added. For background: The DV is a binary (Yes/No) question "Do you or your spouse/partner currently own a home?" with 1 being yes and 2 being no. The IV in question (Highlighted in Red below) is a similar binary question "Do you have student loans" with again 1 being yes and 2 being no. Variables are set to reference(Last), therefore "No" would be the reference case for the IV in question. Based upon this, I'm leaning towards the conclusion that holding other factors constant, having student loan debt makes a respondent 1.650 times more likely to not own a home (I'm aware of the problems of confusing phrasing), thus concluding that while significant, it is perhaps not as significant a factor as income (Variable A8) (Which had odd-ratios that were much higher) Based on this, can my evidence support this conclusion, in your opinions? Am I missing anything? I've not had much experience working with Logistic regression, so I'm keen to get this right (And not embarrass myself in front of my committee). Thanks for your time, and let me know if you need more information. Note: Just to clarify, I realize its a big ask, but keep in mind I'm not asking for completely definitive judgements. You don't have to critique it to the degree of my thesis committee. I would just like some extra (yet still critical) eyes on what I might be doing wrong, missing, or need to drill down on, and if this seems like a professionally (Which is subjective) defensible conclusion to reach. If you saw this data and conclusion in a paper, what would jump into your mind?
