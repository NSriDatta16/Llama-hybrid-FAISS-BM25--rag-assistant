Predicting change of shapes/coordinates

I'm trying to find a way to predict/calculate how a shape (e.g. outline of a glacier) will change in the future—based on its history (previous shape) and additional factors (e.g. Δtemperature). In my example: I have the shape/coordinates of a glacier and an average temperature at 1970, 1985, 2000, 2015. How can I give an estimate on how that shape will look like in 2030, based on the previous shapes and a predicted temperature? The shapes would ideally come in a format similar to this: [ [ [-113.74926783355818, 48.32440832757374], [-113.74926767330584, 48.32440813255405], [-113.74926748239692, 48.32440458296232], [-113.74926717549286, 48.32439887665663], [-113.74926686858888, 48.32439317035087], ... ], [ [-113.75763099733634, 48.32877681033601], [-113.75763955455557, 48.32877660502744], [-113.75764546550784, 48.32878027200765], [-113.75765402272751, 48.32878006669797], [-113.75766003497893, 48.32878563609638], ... ] ] But I imagine it could be necessary to convert this to coordinate offsets ( Δx , Δy ) similar to what sketch_rnn is doing. Any pointers would help. Even that this is too ambitious. Thanks! Disclaimer: I'm a beginner with this and hope the question isn't too naïve :)
