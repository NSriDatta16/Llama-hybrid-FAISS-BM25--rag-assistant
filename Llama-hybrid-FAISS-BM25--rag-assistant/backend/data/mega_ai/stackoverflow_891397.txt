I usually go something like this: JPanel panel = new JPanel(); panel.add(new JButton(new AbstractAction("name of button") { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { //do stuff here } })); AbstractAction implements ActionListener so this should satisfy the task. It can be bad practice to squish so many lines of code together, but if you're used to reading it then it can be quite elegant.
