Neural network recommendations if only few features

Can there be some general recommendations for architecture of neural network if there are only a few features, say 2-5 features? What should be the number of hidden fully connected layers here? How many neurons may be there in each layer? Do number neurons in different layers need to stay constant (e.g. 16,16,16) or rise (e.g. 8,16,32) or fall (32,16,8) or rise and fall (e.g. 16,32,16) or fall and rise (e.g. 32,16,32)?
