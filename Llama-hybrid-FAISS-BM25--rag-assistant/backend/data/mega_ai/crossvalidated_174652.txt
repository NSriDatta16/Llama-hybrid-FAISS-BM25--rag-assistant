Comparing three groups, one dependent variable (binary)

I have a sample consisting of patients from 3 different nationalities (A, B and C). One of my variables is dichotomous, and I want to compare proportions for this variable between nationalities. The hypothesis is that nationality is associated with (and could (partially) explain) this outcome. Based on recent research I would expect there to be a difference in outcome between nationalities A and B. However, I also would like to know whether this difference exists between B and C (and possibly A and C, although hypothetically less likely). My (made-up) data: Nationality A B C Total Outcome Yes 50 20 17 87 No 18 23 7 48 Total 68 43 24 135 Just looking at the data I would expect there to be a significant difference in outcome between groups A and B (and possibly B and C). Based on what I have found from different sources I could use a Chi square / Likelihood Ratio, but this wouldn't help me to determine which groups are significantly different from each other (or would it?). Alternatively, would it be correct to use a logistic regression? I did a logistic regression with dummies for nationalities B and C (nationality A as baseline group (0) as it is the biggest group and as there seems to be a difference between A and B). Does it make sense to do another regression (dummies for nationalities A and B) to see whether there is also a difference between B and C? Or just make dummies for A and C so I can do the comparisons I am most interested in (B vs. A, B vs. C) in one analysis? I understand that regression and Chi square tests essentially work in different ways, and I am wondering which one would be most appropriate.
