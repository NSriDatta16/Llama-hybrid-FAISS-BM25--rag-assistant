Simple Javascript Slider

Im trying to find a very very simple javascript slider. One that is the bare minimum, no fancy jquery, or other libraries involved. The simplest possible slider. With the minimum amount of code possible. Thanks for the attention! @ Roger Walsh: Below the HTML code: The .js and the .css are identical to the example in the tutorial you send me. I guess I have to add some more info in the body section, but I dont understand what exactly. Slider -->
