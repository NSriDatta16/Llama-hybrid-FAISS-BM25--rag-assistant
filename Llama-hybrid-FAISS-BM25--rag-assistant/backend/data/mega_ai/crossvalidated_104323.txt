Chi Square Analysis Percentages

I've used chi-square analysis in school, but was absent for the lesson, and I never quite got the hang of it. I've been successful with it in the past, but now I'm trying to use percentage values, and I'm not getting the answers I'm expecting. I'm doing a survey and comparing my findings with national averages, but when I use percentages (such as the percent of participants between the ages of 21 and 29) I get understandably tiny numbers (2.3% is 0.023). If I'm using percentages for the expected value, should it matter? Ex: Chi² for 21–29 age group is $(.084 - 0.1642)^2 / 0.1642 = .039187$ The total chi-square value is 0.1368, which is much smaller than the 0.5% chi squared table value for 8 degrees of freedom, 17.535, but the numbers seem way off. Do I have to find the whole numbers?
