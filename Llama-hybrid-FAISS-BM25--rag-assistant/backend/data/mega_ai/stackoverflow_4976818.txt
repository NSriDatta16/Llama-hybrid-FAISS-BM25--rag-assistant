Simply because you don't reset i before you start the inner loop (or after you end it.) Therefore, in the second, and subsequent iterations of the outer loop, you get to the inner while statement, but the condition i != 7 is still false and you don't execute the inner loop body. A simple fix would be to add i = 0 immediately before the inner while . A more elegant fix would be to change the inner while into a do ... while .
