Table adapters datetime null value

My SQL database has a a column in a table that has the datatype of datetime and allows nulls (because I need it to either be a datetime value or blank) and I need to be able to read this value and then display it in a textbox. The problem is that on inserting and updating, the autogenerated tableadapter (when dragged from the server explorer to the dataset designer) sets all columns that are datetimes to automatically throw exceptions if a null is attempted to be input and it is not possible to change this property. Though this column is able to take nulls in the database.
