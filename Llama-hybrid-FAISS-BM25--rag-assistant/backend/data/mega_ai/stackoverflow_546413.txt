I would only use runtime packages if you actually had two binaries that were supposed to run on the same physical machine and that shared some code. Keep in mind that runtime packages are mostly an all-or-nothing approach. Once you decide to use them you will also no longer be able to link the RTL and VCL units straight into your projects and will instead have to deploy those separately as well. However, packages might still be a good solution to your problem when combined with project groups which is exactly what I'm doing. I hate having shared units included in multiple projects. Including the shared units in a package (but not compiling your actual projects with runtime packages) allows you to add that package to your project group so you (and the IDE!) will always have them easily accessible yet nicely separated from the project-specific code. Strictly speaking you don't even ever have to compile those packages. They can merely serve as an organisational unit in the project manager. Note that for the Find in Files, you can also specify "in all files in project group"
