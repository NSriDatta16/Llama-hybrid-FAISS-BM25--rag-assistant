1) You are not seeing a background since you have a typo: backround instead of background 2) In HTML there is no significance for more than one whitespace. You need to use &nbsp; if you want to insert a non-breaking whitespace between words in a paragraph. Reference (W3 spec) : Note that a sequence of white spaces between words in the source document may result in an entirely different rendered inter-word spacing (except in the case of the PRE element). In particular, user agents should collapse input white space sequences when producing output inter-word space . This can and should be done even in the absence of language information (from the lang attribute, the HTTP "Content-Language" header field (see [RFC2616], section 14.12), user agent settings, etc.). The PRE element is used for preformatted text, where white space is significant.
