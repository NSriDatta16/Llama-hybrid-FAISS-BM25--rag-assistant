How to install Firebug lite IE8?

So we have reached that stage in a web dev project where we need to see how things look in IE. Sigh. So the fabulous Firebug is not available for IE. But a lite version is - as a bookmarklet, and is apparently compatible with IE6+. But how the how the hell do I add a bookmarklet to IE8? I am unable to drag and drop to the Favourites bar (is this the same as bookmarks?). I can't add it through the Favourites add option as it contains "illegal" characters. So how do I do this? All I want to do is inspect the DOM. Thanks
