Interactions between windows

what's the best/proper way of interacting between several windows in C# app? Recently, I've run into a problem where one of program windows has to call method modifying main window. My solution was to create factory-like class, that would arrange all underlying model-data and organize the communication between various windows (through delegates). However, as passing one or two delegates was not a problem, I started thinking what if my other windows would need 10 delegates to interact properly with main window? Are delegates good solution? How to pass them in good way - through constructor, properties? Or maybe the need of using that many delegates is some serious design flaw itself?
