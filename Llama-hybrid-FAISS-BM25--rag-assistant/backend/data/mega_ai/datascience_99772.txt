These are some of the things you could try to reduce the dimensionality of your dataset:- 1.) The first thing to do is feature engineering. Try to combine 2 or more features into 1 without losing sense of that variable. For example if you have a dataset of price prediction of used cars, and you have month_of_registration and year_of_registration as 2 of the features. You could combine them to form age variable and then drop the month and year variable. This is the most effective and non invasive way to reduce dimensionality. 2.) Second thing to do is feature selection. This can include any of the 4 techniques namely filter based , wrapper based , embedded and hybrid . This step also includes PCA if you want to use it. 3.) Even after doing above steps you get a large no of features, you can drop some less frequent categories from a feature. For example, if in a feature you have 2 categories and 1 one them is occurring only 1-2% of the time. You can drop that category to reduce the dimensionality.
