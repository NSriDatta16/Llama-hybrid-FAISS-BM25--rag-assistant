Magento custom payment method

i'm going to explain the flow of what i need: the checkout process is the same, now, in the last step, i'm doing POST to an external URL, where all the data is processed, i wait to the response of the external server, after process it, i make the correspondient step, 1- Save the order in the db or 2- Give an error message. it depend on the response, then, to save the order i need to have all the card details, if i don't have it, magento give me an error, the external server doesn't return the card details for security reason, and they said the won't, so, i need to keep alive all this information until i can save it or refuse it, my question: What can i do here? Save the card details in a cookie? or a session variable?? or do i have another opcion?? thanks
