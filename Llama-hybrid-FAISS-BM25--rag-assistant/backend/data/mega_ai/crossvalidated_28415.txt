You could start by removing the outliers from your design matrix (for this step you can only use whichever of those 10 variables that are continuous). You can do this rather easily using the $\verb+CovMcd()+$ function in the $\verb+rrcov()+$ library. $\verb+CovMcd()+$ will basically give you the index of the 50 percent most concentrated observations. Use only those to build your SVM classification model (but this time including all the variables in your model, even the discrete ones). Compare the performances of this model with that of the one you have now. Let us know if it improves the fit on the test set. It'll give good information on what type of outliers you have.
