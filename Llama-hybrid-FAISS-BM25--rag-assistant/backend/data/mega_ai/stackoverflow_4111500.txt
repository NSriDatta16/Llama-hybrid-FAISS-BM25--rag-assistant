Per http://rails.nuvvo.com/lesson/6372-action-controller-session Your application has a session for each user in which you can store small amounts of data that will be persisted between requests. The session is only available in the controller and can use one of a number of different storage mechanisms: CookieStore - Stores everything on the client. DRBStore - Stores the data on a DRb client. MemCacheStore - Stores the data in MemCache. ActiveRecordStore - Stores the data in a database using Active Record. All session stores store the session id in a cookie - there is no other way of passing it to the server. Most stores also use this key to locate the session data on the server. I guess you could inject the encrypted session id into the page HTML and then use javascript to pass that information with every internal link or form that the user submits, thus recreating the cookie functionality. But if your users intentionally turned off cookies, they probably wouldn't like you doing this...
