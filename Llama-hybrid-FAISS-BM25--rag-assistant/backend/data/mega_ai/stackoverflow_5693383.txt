jqGrid for jquery has a large number of features. Perhaps you can find it useful. I don't know about azure tablestorage model . In my application , I use asp.net mvc with JQuery . I have some web services that read from my mvc model layer , transform the data and then return it as JSON . I use jquery $.ajax to retrieve the JSON data , and then past it to jqGrid http://www.trirand.com/blog/
