Tricky. Couple of ideas. You could pull the fetch_rss call up into your controller. The cache is actually just a hash that is available to your app. So this requires a little bit of extra legwork, but is probably the most straight forward approach. Explicitly check the cache, and either call fetch_rss if the cache is stale or pull the rss value from the cache and pass into the view to render as normal. Alternatively, you might be able to get your fetch to throw an error, and then wrap in an exception handler. If there is an exception, you would catch and call expire_fragment .
