Redirect page to root but keep the parameters in URL

I have a rather complex problem (for me), which is why i need to turn to you guys :) Always heave been a great and fast ressource for help. Background: I have a website where the homepage is one big draggable screen (www.example.com/) where all the subpages are teasered. If you click on a Teaser (www.example.com/pages/page1) a jquery lightbox with iframe will open and present that page. That works great. Problem: Problem is, as always have been with iframes, if someone goes to the subpage directly (www.example.com/pages/page1), maybe via an indexed google search, he will not see the iframe and the big draggable screen behind it. Question: i'd need a script which, before anything happens, redirects an URL with more parts then root to the root page and append the parts as a different query, so i could read them out via javascript or something and trigger the iframelightbox per hand. Approach: so www.example.com/pages/page1 needs to become www.example.com?vars=/pages/page1 or something appropriate. i think this is possible using mod_rewrite in my htaccess but i dont know how. I hope this it understandable in some way :) i tried my best.
