Safety stock calculation for Intermittent demand components

I'm trying to solve this supply chain problem where I have to determine safety stock calculation for the components/raw materials that we procure... First I analysed the demand or consumption pattern of components and classified them into smooth, Intermittent, erratic and lumpy based on coefficient of variation and average demand interval.. Could you please suggest on how to setup safety stock for Intermittent,erratic and lumpy demand pattern components...Could you please explain this with an example Thank you
