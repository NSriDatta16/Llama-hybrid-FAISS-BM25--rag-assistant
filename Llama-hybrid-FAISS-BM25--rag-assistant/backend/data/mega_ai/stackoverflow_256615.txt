I'd go for Haskell. HackageDB is a great collection of libraries that are written specifically for the language. In the case of F# you'd have to use mostly libraries that are not written with a functional language in mind so they will not be as 'elegant' to use. But, of course it depends largely on how much functional programming you want to do and constraints of the project you want to use it for. Even 'general purpose' does not mean it should be used in all cases ;)
