Axis2 problem in setting SOAPAction HTTP header

I am trying co connect to a 3'rd party SOAP web service. It seems that the service can work when the HTTP SOAPAction header is an empty String (""). This is the snippet of the wsdl: Where you see the soapAction="" I generated a stubusing the Axis2 (1.5) wsdl2java. I was hoping to get the following (the successful output when running with SoapUI ): POST /details HTTP/1.1 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8 SOAPAction: "" User-Agent: Jakarta Commons-HttpClient/3.1 Host: some.host Content-Length: 323 But instead I am getting: POST /details HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8 SOAPAction: "http://some.url/wsussd/ussdtypes/UssdPortType/detailsRequest" User-Agent: Axis2 Host: some.host Content-Length: 300 Does anyone has any idea what is the problem or how do I set the soapAction in the program. Thanks, Ronen
