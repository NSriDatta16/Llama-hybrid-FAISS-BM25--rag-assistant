What is a decent open-source list/task management software

I really like the application Things but I need something web-based. Ideally something I can host on my server. So simply, PHP/MySQl based task-management software, which is open-source. What would be ideal would be something where I can drag and drop to reorder the tasks. Any suggestions?
