Serialization is the process of turning a data set into binary data for transmission or storage. On the iPhone for example, we do this: NSString *myStringToSerialize = @"I'm going to be bits!"; NSData *data = [myStringToSerialize dataUsingEncoding: NSUnicodeStringEncoding]; The data object is now a binary representation of myStringToSerialize , that we can do something with it (POST it to a web server, save it to a file, email it, etc...). Graph Serialization is when you take the graph structure and write it to bits so that you can send it somewhere and read it again. We normally serialize for two reasons: 1) Serialization provides: A method of persisting objects which is more convenient than writing their properties to a text file on disk, and re-assembling them by reading this back in. A method of issuing remote procedure calls, e.g., as in SOAP A method for distributing objects, especially in software componentry such as COM, CORBA, etc. A method for detecting changes in time-varying data. 2) Serialization allows us to transfer objects between programming languages and various systems that would not be interoperable without serialization.
