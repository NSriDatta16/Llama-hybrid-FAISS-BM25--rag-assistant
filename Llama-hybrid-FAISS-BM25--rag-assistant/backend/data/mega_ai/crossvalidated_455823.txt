Trouble interpreting cointegration test results

I'm struggling with testing the cointegration of 2 time series (or rather interpreting the test results properly). So I got 2 time series x and y each containing 36 monthly data points (oil prices). From looking at those time series, I'd say they are cointegrated . However when applying different cointegration tests, they don't seem to be: 1) Augmented Dickey-Fuller from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller from statsmodels.api import OLS ols_result = OLS(y, x).fit() result = adfuller(ols_result.resid) returns (0.6614451366946532, 0.9890361840444819, 10, 25, {'1%': -3.7238633119999998, '5%': -2.98648896, '10%': -2.6328004}, 84.12263429255607) i.e. a p-value of 0.98 ; null hypothesis cannot be rejected, time series are not cointegrated. 2) Engle-Granger coint_t, p_value, _ = coint(y, x) p_value 0.06910078732250052 returns a p-value of 0.069 i.e. not cointegrated. What am I doing wrong here? Thanks in advance! PS: there seems to be Granger-Causality between the 2 time series (tested using statsmodels.tsa.stattools.grangercausalitytests )
