Do you have the option to create an external table? I.e., CREATE TABLE zip5 (zip5 varchar2(5)) ORGANIZATION EXTERNAL ( TYPE ORACLE_LOADER DEFAULT DIRECTORY LOCATION ( :'zip5 filename.txt' ) Place your zip5 text file in the OS directory specified by your Oracle directory object, then execute: SELECT * FROM zipcode JOIN zip5 ON (zipcode.zip5 = zip5.zip5); This is a more generic solution than rebuilding your query each time your ZIP5 list changes.
