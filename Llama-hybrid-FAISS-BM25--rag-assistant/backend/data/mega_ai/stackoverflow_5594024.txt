I see that in IB you are using the EAGLView as the view of the view controller, and in the code snippet you add the preview view as a subview of that view. In other words, your view hierarchy looks something like this: *- EAGLView +- Preview view Thus, Preview view is always on top of the EAGLView because it is a subview of the EAGLView. If you want to be able to display either one on top of the other, you will instead have to lay things out like this: *- some generic UIView +- EAGLView +- Preview view In other words, in IB you should have a generic UIView bound to the view property, and then drag the EAGLView so it is inside that generic UIView. Then your code for adding the preview view should work right. BTW, this does not do what you seem to think: fafa= [[UIView alloc]initWithFrame:self.view.bounds]; //returns a UIView with the cameraview as a layer of that view. It works well (checked) fafa = [CameraImageHelper previewWithBounds:self.view.bounds]; The first line creates a generic UIView. Then the second throws it away (leaking the memory!), replacing it with the preview view. You should just delete the first line.
