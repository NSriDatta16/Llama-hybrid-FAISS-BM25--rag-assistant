Why is isolated storage not persisting in my WP7 application?

I am using IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings for my application. All code associated with Isolated storage occurs in my Application_Launching, Application_Activated, Application_Closing, and Application_Deactivated methods as follows: public IsolatedStorageSettings settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; private void Application_Launching(object sender, LaunchingEventArgs e) { if (settings.Contains("myObjList")) { App.ObjList = (ObservableCollection )settings["myObjList"]; } else { settings.Add("myObjList", App.ObjList); } } private void Application_Activated(object sender, ActivatedEventArgs e) { if (settings.Contains("myObjList")) { App.ObjList = (ObservableCollection )settings["myObjList"]; } else { settings.Add("myObjList", App.ObjList); } } private void Application_Deactivated(object sender, DeactivatedEventArgs e) { settings["myObjList"] = App.ObjList; settings.Save(); } private void Application_Closing(object sender, ClosingEventArgs e) { settings["myObjList"] = App.ObjList; settings.Save(); } All of this is occurring in the App.xaml.cs file that is created by default with every new application. I have tried exiting the application using the back button as well as by using the windows button. Leaving the emulator running, I tried reopening the application using the back button, and navigating to the application list and opening. The issue I am having is that on load or activation the settings.Contains["myObjList"] is returning false and proceeding to add the key to settings all over again. Does anyone see why my settings key (and value) is not persisting?
