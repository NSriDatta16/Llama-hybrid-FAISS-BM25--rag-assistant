Lachlan Roche has an excellent answer. I would just add that you might think about outputting the newsletter to Adobe Acrobat, or an image file, or html. Most people targeted by the newsletter probably will not have Publisher installed. so sending them the .pub file might not have the desired effect. I presume your client wishes to be able to envoke a Macro or Office App inside of Publisher to send the newsletter they have composed as an email to list of people. Lachlans code will let you send the email, I am suggesting adding a step to export the newsletter to a more universal format. I am sure you can leverage built in functions in Publisher from your code for the export.
