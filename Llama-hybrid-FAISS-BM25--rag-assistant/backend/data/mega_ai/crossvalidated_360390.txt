Gaussian Process Hyperparameter Tuning

I'm planning to use Gaussian Process (GP) to model my case. However, while learning the GP I found out that we have to tuning the hyperparameters to give us the best solution. I have checked several methods that could be use to get the optimal hyperparameters value. There are: Grid search Random search Bayesian optimization I'm interested to apply the Bayesian optimization, however when I checked it the Bayesian optimization use Gaussian Process to approximate the function. My questions are: Can we use Bayesian optimization to get the optimal hyperparameters value for Gaussian process? If yes, then how about the Gaussian process inside the Bayesian optimization? Which kernels and what hyperparameters will be used?
