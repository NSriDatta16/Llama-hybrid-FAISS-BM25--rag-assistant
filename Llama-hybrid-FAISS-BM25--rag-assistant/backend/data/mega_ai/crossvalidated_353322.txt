H2o interpretability - LIME

I have trained a model to predict heart attacks using random forest algorithm using H2O. I have good performance in cross validation. Now, I want to give more interpretation to the predictions in a test set, I used Lime and I followed this tutorial: https://kkulma.github.io/2017-11-07-automated_machine_learning_in_cancer_detection/ Everything works fine, now the issue is that I want to understand each explanation for each case, which means: What means Support? What means Contradicts? Interpret each rule given by the explanation example (2800 What means explanation fit? Attached the plot of 2 cases (those that have) more probability.
