calculation of variance

Hi I have a question regarding calculation of variance of survey results. Consider the following example. If 5 (x) people answered a survey which consists of 3 (y) yes (1) or no (2) questions. You would have something like: Y1 y2 y3 X1 1. 0. 0 X2 0. 1. 1 X3. 1. 1. 1 X4. 0. 1. 1 X5. 0. 0. 1 If I calculate a total score by calculating the proportion of yes (1) for each respondent and then average this across all respondent. In this case I will calculate the proportion for respondent x1, x2,...,x5. Then take the sum of all and divide by 5. If I calculate a variance for this total, I am wondering if I have to take into consideration the within respondent variance? Or can I just calculate the across respondent variance as the total variance?? If anyone can help that would be great. Thank you.
