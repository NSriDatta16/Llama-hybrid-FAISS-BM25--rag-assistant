What to do when the intersection of some time series doesn't contain enough data point?

I have to do some studies on time series, which involve computing the covariance matrix. However, my time series span on different time intervals and their intersection is too short to provide me a good estimator. I guess I have to remove some time series but I don't know how to select the ones to keep. I can come up with my own methodology (it could be something like keeping the data that have the most recent points) but I would like to know first if there is a standard procedure for this kind of things.
