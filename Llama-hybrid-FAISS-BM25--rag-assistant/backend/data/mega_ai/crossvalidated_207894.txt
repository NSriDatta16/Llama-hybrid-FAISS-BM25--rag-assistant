They are both ensemble methods. But rf treats each tree equally. You can train multiple trees in parallel. And the final result is just the average. But in boosting trees, trees are trained sequentially, that is new tree is trained on the residuals left by former predictor. In general, boosting has better performance but is easier to overfit and takes more time to train.
