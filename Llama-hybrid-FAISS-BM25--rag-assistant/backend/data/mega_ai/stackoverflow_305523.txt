embedding an application (in this case a terminal) within a QT application

I am writing a QT application and I need to embed a terminal (we say,xterm) within a QDialog, like some KDE application (see kdevelop/kate/...). I've been trying with: - QX11EmbedContainer placed into the QLayout of my QDialog - QProcess for the program I want to excecute I expect the QProcess running within the QX11EmbedContainer, but it does not work. The problem is that I can't put the xterm into the QX11EmbedContainer, the only thing I obtain is an xterm window (unfortunately separated from my QDialog). Does anybody got the same problem?
