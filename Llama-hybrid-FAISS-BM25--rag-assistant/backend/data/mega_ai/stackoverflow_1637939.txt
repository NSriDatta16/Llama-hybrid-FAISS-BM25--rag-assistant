So I figured out the answer. I had to add a property to the Type A and B controls that recursively checks down to see if there are any ComboBoxes open. When any of the selection events occur inside the drag and drop functions, I check the property before processing the drag and drop. If there are any ComboBoxes open, I just call Exit Sub and it processes the click event correctly.
