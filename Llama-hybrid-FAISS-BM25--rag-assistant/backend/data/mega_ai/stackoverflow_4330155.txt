Android: calling a method from a Service to an Activity

I have a simple question to solve, but I am not sure how to do it. I have a class that extends Service that runs a thread looking for a TCP connection. If one comes in, it read an input message. If the input message is "START", I start an activity, in this fashion: Intent dialogIntent = new Intent(getBaseContext(), VoIPCall.class); dialogIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK); dialogIntent.putExtra("inetAddress", clientSocket.getInetAddress()); getApplication().startActivity(dialogIntent); While this activity is running, the Service keeps running. At some point I may reserve a "STOP". I would like to call a method in the previously created Activity but I am not sure how to interact with it. I do not want to use a static method. How can I please do that? Thank you very much, EDIT: I changed my code to this: Intent dialogIntent = new Intent("com.voip.rudy.START_CALL"); dialogIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK); dialogIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP); dialogIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT); dialogIntent.putExtra("inetAddress", clientSocket.getInetAddress()); getApplication().startActivity(dialogIntent); And in the manifest: was required to avoid having it crash. EDIT: The solution given has fixed my issue but I wanted to actually act on member variables on that class, that are previously initialized. Say I call the constructor, then I would like to go back into this activity and act on the member variables. The member variables are not initialized when I call one action after another, it seems to create a new activity somehow. Would there be anyway to act on the same activity, and keep the objects intact please? James
