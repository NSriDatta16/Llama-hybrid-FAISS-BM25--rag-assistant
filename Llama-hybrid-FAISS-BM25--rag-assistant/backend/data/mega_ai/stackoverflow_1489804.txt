This answer is from the UML 2.2 Superstructure Specification : More class answer: "For instance, the «create» keyword can appear next to an operation name to indicate that it is a constructor operation, and it can also be used to label a Usage dependency between two Classes to indicate that one Class creates instances of the other." (Pg 690[706-AdobeReader], Appendix B, Unnumbered 4th paragraph, 1st on the page) I think this would apply to meta-classes. Stereotype answer: This is kind of an answer, but does not infer "create" which is the word you used in your post, but might have just been an ambiguous word choice. The notation is an normal line with a filled triangle. I have also seen the keyword of > used in tools like Rational Software Modeler. (Pg 657[673-AdobeReader] Figure 18.3 and 659 Figure 18.5, Profile Section) You might also want to clarify if you mean meta-class in the MOF/Model definition sense or in some language or other context. Let me know if you refine your question.
