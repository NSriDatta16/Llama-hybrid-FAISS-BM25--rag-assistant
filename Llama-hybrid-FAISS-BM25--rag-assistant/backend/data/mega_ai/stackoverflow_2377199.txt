Qt Dropsite Example

In QtDemo there is an example called Dropsite in which an image can be dragged and dropped into the field to be displayed. This example used to work in an older version of Qt and works initially in 4.6 if you run it from qt\examples\draganddrop\dropsite\release folder. But if you load the project file into Qt Creator and recompile it, it no longer displays the image correctly and gives a generic image in the box. I cannot figure out how to fix this and I need to use drag and drop in a project I am working on. Please help. Thank you.
