Since i was mentioned by @jpstrikesback, i'll post an answer here :) I recently built 2 applications on top of the whole Express/Connect stack ( node-blog and node-chat ). node-chat is the more recent project, i just updated it to work with the most recent Express 2 Beta (express@2.0.0beta2) and Connect 1.0 (connect@1.0.3). node-blog may follow later this day ;) node-chat also contains some socket.io awesomeness and is the more tidy project in general. If you have any questions concerning one of those projects, just get at me at SO. NOTE : since connect-mongodb is broken for the latest release of Connect, i'm using the in-memory session storage for now (until the connect-mongodb middleware is fixed). Update : there is a new session storage middleware for connect, seems to be working : connect-mongo
