The Cng versions are supposed to be a little faster, but I just wrote up a little program that compares the speeds of each. (I had a client that was asking about the performance characteristics of MD5 vs. SHA1) I was surprised to find out there is little to no difference between MD5 and SHA1, but was also surprised that there is a slight difference in Cng and the CryptoServiceProvider. The source is pretty straight forward, I added reps to do the same iteration multiple times so I could average in case there was any weirdness going on, on my machine during one of the runs. call the following with a call like this: CalculateHash(1, 1024, new SHA1CryptoServiceProvider()); static long CalculateHash(UInt64 repetitions, UInt64 size, HashAlgorithm engine) { RandomNumberGenerator rng = RandomNumberGenerator.Create(); byte[][] goo = new byte[repetitions][]; for (UInt64 i = 0; i I ran this in a loop of increasing size to figure out if one fell over when using large or small inputs. Here is the loop, and the data follows (my computer ran out of ram at 2^28): int loops = 32; UInt64 reps = 1; int width = 20; Console.WriteLine("Loop#".PadRight(6) + "MD5".PadRight(width) + "SHA1".PadRight(width) + "SHA1Cng".PadRight(width) + "SHA256".PadRight(width) + "SHA256Cng".PadRight(width)); for (int i = 0; i
