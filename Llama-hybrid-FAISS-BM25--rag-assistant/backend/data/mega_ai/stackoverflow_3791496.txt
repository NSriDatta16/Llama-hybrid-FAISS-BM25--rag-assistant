CSS drop down menu - stack order not right?

Our test server is here: http://208.43.52.30/event/list See on the top right the box that says "Organizers" .. For some reason I can't get the drop down to come on the top layer ... I've tried changing positioning, I've tried changing z-index, but no luck .. Any ideas?
