It depends on the protocol you're using. If you're using SVN + SSH, the SVN client can't save your password because it never touches it - the SSH client prompts you for it directly. In this case, you can use an SSH key and ssh-agent to avoid the constant prompts. If you're using the svnserve protocol or HTTP(S), then the SSH client is handling your password and can save it.
