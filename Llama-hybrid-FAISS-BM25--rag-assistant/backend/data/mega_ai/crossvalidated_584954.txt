Average Sample Size For Curtailed Double Sampling Plan

I am currently implementing double sampling. The goal is to accept or reject a lot by only sampling a few instances from it. In a two-stage testing procedure (double sampling) one first draws a sample of size $n_1$ and compares the number $K_1$ of items “of interest” (e.g., “non compliant”) with two integers: $c_1$ , $c_2$ . If $K_1 \le c_1$ , we accept the null hypotheses ( $H_0$ ) that the batch is of acceptable quality; and if $X > c_2$ , we accept the alternative hypotheses ( $H_1$ ) that the batch quality is unacceptable. However, if $c_1 , we draw a second sample of size $n_2$ . We stop in case we find more than $c_2$ . You can play with some plans in here . My problem is now finding the average sample size (ASN) with partial curtailment, that is we look at the first sample as a whole and then stop looking at the first sample once it is clear that we reject it. I found this paper that computes it as $ASN = n_1 + \sum_{i=c_1 + 1}^{c2} P(n_1, i) [ n_2 [ P_1(n_2, c_2 - i) + \frac{c_2 - i + 1}{p} P_2(n + 1, c_2 - i + 2) ]]$ where $P(n_1, i)$ is the probability of observing exactly $j$ defectives in a sample of size $n_1$ , $P_1(n_2, c_2 − i)$ is the probability of observing $c_2 − i$ or fewer defectives in a sample of size $n_2$ , and $P_2(n_2 + 1, c_2 − i + 2)$ is the probability of observing $c_2 − i + 2$ defectives in a sample of size $n_2 + 1$ . From when I read it, then I would think $P$ , $P_1$ and $P_2$ are all PMFs, e.g. of Bernoulli $p$ , but when I implement it, then I get very different curves for most of the plans compared to here . I also had a look at The Average Sample Number for Truncated Single and Double Attributes Acceptance Sampling Plans Author(s): C. C. Craig Source: Technometrics, Vol. 10, No. 4 (Nov., 1968), pp. 685-692 and at the end it looks like $P_1$ and $P_2$ are CDFs, but I do not manage to get the same results as their tables. Can you help me understand what I need to put in as $P$ , $P_1$ and $P_2$ ?
