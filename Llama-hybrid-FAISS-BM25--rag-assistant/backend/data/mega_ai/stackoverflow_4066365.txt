asking for advice for code coverage and unit test

I am using VS2010 + C# + .Net 4.0. I want to do code coverage for unit tests. I have two choices after investigating, my question is, I want to know the pros and cons of such two tools/choices. Using non-VS built-in tools, like ncover; Using VSTS built-in tool, for example, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd299398%28VS.90%29.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms379625%28VS.80%29.aspx#vstsunittesting_topic7
