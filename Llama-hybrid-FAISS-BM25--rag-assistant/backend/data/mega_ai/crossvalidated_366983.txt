How to validate the association rules or results obtained from Market Basket Analysis? Train-test methodology

If I have a large set of transactions where in each has a set of goods and I want to do market basket analysis (affinity analysis) using Apriori. However, compared to traditional supervised machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boost, etc there does not appear to be a corresponding methodology where you split into a train and test set, train on the train dataset and check for cross validation on the test set for algorithms such as Apriori. How do you know that your model is truly good? Are there some other metrics that can be used to ensure you are not overfitting your model and that it has no bias?
