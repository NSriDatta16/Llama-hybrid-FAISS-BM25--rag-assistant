When to switch from Spreadsheet to RDBMS?

I've volunteered with a Non-Governmental Organization to help with their record-keeping at their community centre. At present, there is only one community centre where all their data is stored. However, this is expected to change by the end of the year. Presently their data is maintained using a workbook with two sheets. Each record in the main sheet may have upto 100 follow-ups in the follow-up sheet. Data is loosely structured, and there are no explicit constraints. Moving all existing data from a spreadsheet to an RDBMS would require effort, but I'm willing to do that; particularly since there is talk of making said data shareable with other NGO in the field. One alternative would be to use, say, Google Docs, and merge each set of records manually. With more than one point of data entry, and retrieval, does it make sense to recommend moving away from a spread-sheet database to an RDBMS? EDIT Just posted a follow-up on strategy to follow here
