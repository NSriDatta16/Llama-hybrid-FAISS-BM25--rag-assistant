If you need hierarchical queries against databases that don't support Recursive Subquery Factoring (see APC's answer ), one very low-tech alternative is to encode the hierarchy into a separate key. Of course this will only work if you can control the table update process and rewrite the key following parent updates. For example: FLAT_HIER_ID NODE_ID PARENT_NODE_ID ~N1 N1 ~N1~N2 N2 N1 ~N1~N2~N3 N3 N2 ~N1~N2~N4 N4 N2 Not very elegant, but it gives you a route for querying. Another (probably better) option is to use the " Nested Set Model " method. This is the method used in Fogbugz for handling subcase querying in MSSQL, MySQL, and MS Access. The model is explained at: http://www.developersdex.com/gurus/articles/112.asp The use of the method in Fogbugz is described at: http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/blog/post/Subcases-and-Hierarchy.aspx
