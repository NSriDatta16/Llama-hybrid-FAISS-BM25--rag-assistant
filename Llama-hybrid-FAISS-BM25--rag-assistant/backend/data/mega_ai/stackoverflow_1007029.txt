The property EnableSortingAndPagingCallbacks tells the control to do a client side sort of the data, so that the control appears to automatically sort without a page postback. TemplateFields are not supported with this method. In order to use TemplateFields and perform sorting, you need to wire up the GridView.Sorting event, and set the AllowSorting property to true. Once that is done, the event should fire when the column header is clicked and the sorting logic can be handled from there.
