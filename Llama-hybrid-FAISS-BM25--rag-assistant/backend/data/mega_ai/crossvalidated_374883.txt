Think about this geometrically: we've got $(X,Y)$ uniformly distributed over the right triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$ , $(2,0)$ , and $(0,6)$ . If we imagine sampling over and over from this region uniformly, we can picture $E(X\mid Y=5)$ as the average $x$ coordinate of the points that end up on the horizontal line $y=5$ . All of these points will necessarily have $0 , since if $x \geq 1/3$ then $y = 5$ can't happen, and since the points are uniform over this line, this image suggests $E(X\mid Y=5) \stackrel {\text{?}}= 1/6$ (this is the midpoint of the range of $x$ points that can end up on this line). Checking this with calculus, the issue with what you did is the limits of integration for $x$ also depend on $y$ . If $y = 5$ is observed then the biggest that $x$ can be is $1/3$ , so really $$ E(X\mid Y=5) = \int_0^{1/3}x \frac{3}{6-y}\,\text dx = 3 \cdot \frac 12 x^2\bigg|_{x=0}^{x=1/3} = \frac 16. $$ Another quick sanity check is that $E(X\mid Y)$ has to be within the range of $X$ , so $E(X\mid Y=5)\neq 6$ can be recognized as incorrect before the negative variance shows up.
