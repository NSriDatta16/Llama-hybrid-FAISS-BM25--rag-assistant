How do I decide which family of variance/link functions to use in a generalized linear model?

I'm about to use the glm() function in R, and I know that I have to specify which family of variance/link functions I want to use (either gaussian, binomial, poisson, Gamma, inverse.gaussian, or quasi-which I take to mean user-defined). I understand that binomial is to be used for things like logistic regression, but it's unclear to me under what scenarios the others should be used. Does anybody have useful advice?
