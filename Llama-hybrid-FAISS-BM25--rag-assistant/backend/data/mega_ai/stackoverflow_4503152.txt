php array data in mysql

I am very new to mysql and php. I need to put an array from php into a data table: The array looks like this: $memberdata Key value apple 5 banana 8 salmon 3 candle 4 .......... and 100 more... My mysql table looks like this: MemberTable ID(INT11)=PK MemID(INT11) stuff(varchar) value(INT2) 1 23 apple 5 2 23 banana 8 3 23 salmon 3 4 23 candle 4 5 45 banana 1 6 45 apple 9 So each member; here member 23 and 45 can have the same stuff but with other values, so for every member i have one php array of data. (mysql ID is auto increment). My question: is there a possibility to store an array directly into a mysql table...? In a book that i read they make a foreach loop and in the loop they open a connection to the database... so i thought that is maybe to time consuming: book example: $cxn = mysqli_connect($host,$user,$pass,$dbname); $MemID = "23"; $query_pre = "INSERT INTO MemberTable ('MemID','stuff','value') VALUES ("; Foreach ($memberdata as $stuff => $value) { $query = $query_pre . "$MemID,$stuff,$value)"; $result = mysqli_query($cxn, $query) or die ("Couldn't execute query"); } Regards, Thijs
