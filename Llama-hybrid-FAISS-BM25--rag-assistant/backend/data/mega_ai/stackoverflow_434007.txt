Gorm main window does not accept drag-and-drop

When I try to add any widget (label, button ...) to main application Window in Gorm, the Window does not accept the widget. I try to drag and drop but nothing wants to 'stick'. When I select and left click on button widget in palette window the curson changes to '2 green squares'. When I start dragging it changes to '2 black squares'. Another problem is that the 'Document' window opens really long window (stretches about 5 times the width of my screen) but apart from NSOwner, NSFirst, My Window and NSMenu icons it is empty. Any ideas what is wrong? I'm running linux with fluxbox-1.1.1 I've compiled gorm-1.2.8 and gnustep-startup-0.22.0 that contains: ffcall-1.10 gnustep-back-0.16.0 gnustep-base-1.18.0 gnustep-gui-0.16.0 gnustep-make-2.0.7 gnustep-objc-1.6.0 libffi-3.0.1 Any help is appreciated. Thanks
