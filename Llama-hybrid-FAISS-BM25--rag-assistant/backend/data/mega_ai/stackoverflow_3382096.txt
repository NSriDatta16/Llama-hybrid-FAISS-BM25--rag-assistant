+ is the adjacent sibling combinator . That means the selector h2 + p only selects the p that comes immediately after an h2 . An illustration: Headline! The first paragraph. The second paragraph. Another headline! A quotation. What's selected and what's not: Selected This p comes right after the first h2 . Not selected This p occurs after the first p as opposed to the h2 . Since it doesn't immediately follow the h2 , it's not selected. However, since it still follows the h2 element, just not immediately, the selector h2 + p won't match this element, but h2 ~ p will, using the general sibling combinator instead. Not selected This p is located within a blockquote , and there's no h2 before it inside the quote to satisfy its selector.
