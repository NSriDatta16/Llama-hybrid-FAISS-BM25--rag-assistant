Does this make sense: To me, mostly yes... although I think you might be doing something I don't expect (see below). What is this method called and where can I find more about it: You are building up an empirical reference distribution through permutation of your genome labels. There may be fancier terms. I don't know what a good citation might be, consider: Good, P. (2005) Permutation, Parametric, and Bootstrap Tests of Hypotheses, Springer-Verlag, NY, 3rd edition. How should I scan the CDFs to find the right x? Sometimes for low x's CDF_simulations(x) > CDF_realdata(x): This is the part that makes less sense to me. I'm not sure what you are doing here exactly. Maybe the thing to do is to find the 90th percentile for the CDF_simulations and use that as your cutoff for saying there might be something interesting going on in CDF_realdata? Where does the number of simulations come into play? Does it make sense to simply build an averaged CDF as I did?: The number of simulations you run will produce a larger and more reliable reference distribution. Your averaged CDF approach seems a little odd to me.
