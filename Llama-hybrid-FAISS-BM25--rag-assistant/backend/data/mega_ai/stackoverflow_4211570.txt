Short answer: yes and no. REXML uses different formatters based on the value you specify for indent . If you leave the default -1, it uses REXML::Formatters::Default . If you give it a value like 4, it uses REXML::Formatters::Pretty . The pretty formatter does have logic in it to wrap lines (though it looks like it wraps at 80, not 166), when dealing with text (not tags or attributes). For example, the contents of a paragraph tag would be wrapped at 80 characters, but would not be wrapped. Anyway the 80 is hard-coded in rexml/formatters/pretty.rb and not configurable. And if you use the default formatter with no indent, then it's mostly just a raw dump without added line breaks. You could try the transitive formatter (see docs for Document.write ), but it's broken in some version of ruby and might require a code hack. It probably isn't what you want anyway. You might try taking a look at Builder::XmlMarkup from the builder gem.
