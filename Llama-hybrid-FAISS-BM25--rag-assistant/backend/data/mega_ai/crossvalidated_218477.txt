Something better than logistic regression for this?

I have a database which contains 100k records. It includes 2 continuous and 6 categorical variables. The output is categorical as well and it can take one of 8 different values (e.g. 1, 2, 3...8). My goal is: Investigate which of the variables are the most significant ones to determine my output. After the analysis, to be able to calculate the probability for any of those outputs to happen if I only know what are the values for (e.g.) two variables? For example, to have some coefficients for every possible categorical value in order to calculate the probability... I tried this with the logistic regression but somehow I have big deviation from manually calculated probability (e.g. when I use the number of positive outputs and the total number of the records contained within my database). Anybody has a better idea how I could analyse this? Sth better than logistic regression? Thanks in advance!
