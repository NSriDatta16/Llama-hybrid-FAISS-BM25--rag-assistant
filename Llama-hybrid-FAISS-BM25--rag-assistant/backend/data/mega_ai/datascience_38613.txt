Cross validation for convolutional neural network

I am using Keras to create a CNN model, and I would to use K-fold cross-validation to train the dataset. The dataset contains images and I am using flow_from_directory function. Do you have any idea how to use K-fold cross-validation in Keras to create a CNN model??
