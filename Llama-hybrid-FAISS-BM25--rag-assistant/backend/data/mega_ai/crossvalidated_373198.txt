Your first model is a random-intercept model; it assumes individuals vary only in their intercepts (test result at time 0/beginning of measurement). m1 Your second model is a random-slopes model; it allows for random variation in the individual-level slopes ( and in the intercept, and a correlation between slopes and intercepts) m2 I'd suggest the random-slopes model is more appropriate (see e.g. Schielzeth and Forstmeier 2009). Some other considerations: might there be an overall difference in time trends across treatments? Perhaps, so I'd suggest including an interaction between Group and minutes ( Group*minutes == 1 + Group + minutes + Group:minutes there might be an order effect you might want to allow for/check for temporal autocorrelation (e.g. correlation=corAR1(form = ~ minutes | ID) , although things might get complicated if you have missing data, see ?nlme::corCAR1 ) BTW there's no such thing as nlme4 : there's an nlme package, which you'r using (it includes the lme function), and an lme4 package, which includes the lmer function ...
