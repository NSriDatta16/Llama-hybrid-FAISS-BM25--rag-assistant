Query on Azure Table Storage's partition key

I am aware that records in azure table storage is organized by PartitionKey and indexed by RowKey. My application requires that I query the records in table storage based on the date range of the TimeStamp. I have couple of thousands records in the table storage and naturally the performance is extremely slow. The reason being, TimeStamp is not indexed. As I understand, PartitionKey is essentially a conversion of the TimeStamp in Ticks. Correct me if I am wrong. If this is true, how can I query the table storage on PartitionKey instead of TimeStamp field and improve the performance.
