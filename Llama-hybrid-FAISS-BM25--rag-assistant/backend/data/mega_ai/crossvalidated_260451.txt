From what I see, you have different variables: food type, different animals, several days. Usually, you fix one or more variables and you try to understand something about the variability of other variables. Example, I could fix a animal kind (horse), fix food eaten (bananas) and ask the question. What is the average of bananas did the horses eat from day1 to day10? Then the answer would be to average over the number of days, taking only data related to bananas eaten by horses.
