I'm basing my answer on this custom code for getting the average as described by Tom VdP here . This gets the average as calculated by SSRS. However, you can calculate your own "average" because Average = Sum / Count For your purposes, the count is always 13. The custom code method gets you the sum, so you can ignore using SSRS to calculate the average and simply substitute the average (avgValue in the Tom's code) with sumValue / 13
