Is there a proper way to combine two beta prior distributions?

I'm working on a research project which involves the assessment of NHL goalie performance (save percentage) using empirical Bayes. I found that the goalie distribution for career games played was peculiar. Nearly 50% of goalies play less than 10 games, whereas the others play on average 500 games. I could fit just one prior to this, however, I feel I'm giving too much weight to the goalies who barely play. Could I instead fit two priors, one for goalies playing less than 10 games, another for goalies playing more than 10, and then use a simple model to determine the probability of a goalie belonging to each prior based on their career thus far? I would then just multiply both posteriors by the corresponding predicted group probability.
