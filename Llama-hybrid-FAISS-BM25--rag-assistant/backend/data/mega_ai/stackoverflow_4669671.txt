Can you clarify a little bit more? In your SurfaceView do you have a background assigned? If not, you could probably also use AbsoluteView if your intention is to simply drag pieces around. If there is no background, you should be able to place the entire view above the RelativeView that you have and only have the various Buttons and such drawn on the view on top, which would be draggable and remain above everything else.
