Subreport source in Crystal Reports for .Net

I am using several sub-reports in a Crystal Reports solution in .Net. I created a stand-alone report, then imported that report into several other reports as a sub-report. Changes to the stand-alone version are not incorporated into any of the reports leveraging it. Will I need to continually re-import the report in this manner, or is there a way to have Crystal Reports for .Net reference another ".rpt" file so that changes are automatically applied? EDIT: Now I see that right-clicking and choosing "re-import" actually has a problem associated with it. Namely, all of the subreport fields disappeared. Text headers and lines remained, but all of the fields disappeared. I even traced the SQL to make sure the linking was working as advertised, and then I tested the SQL to ensure that there was a result set being returned. The report simply "broke". I have to remove them and re-add them. What a pain. Any ideas?
