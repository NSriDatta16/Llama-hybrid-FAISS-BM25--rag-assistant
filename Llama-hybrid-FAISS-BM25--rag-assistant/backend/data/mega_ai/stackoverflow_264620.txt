What you will be hitting here is virtual address range limit, which with 32b Windows gives you at most 2 GB. You should be also aware that using a graphical API like DirectX or OpenGL will use extensive portions of those 2 GB for frame buffer, textures and similar data. 1.5-2 GB for a 32b application is quite hard to achieve. The most elegant way to do this is to use 64b OS and 64b application. Even with 64b OS and 32b application this may be somewhat viable, as long as you use LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE . However, as you need to store image data, you may also be able to work around this by using File Mapping as a memory store - this can be done in such a way that you have a memory committed and accessible, but not using any virtual addresses at all.
