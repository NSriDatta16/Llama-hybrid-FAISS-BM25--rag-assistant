Feature Selection for Regression Models in R

I’m trying to find a feature selection package in R that can be used for regression. Most of the packages implement their methods for classification using a factor or class for the response variable. In particular I’m interested if there’s something using random forest for that purpose. Also if someone knows some good paper in this field would be welcome.
