What is the difference between Transfer learning and Trained/Supervised machine learning?

I am trying to understand the difference between the supervised / labelled machine learning and the trasnfer learning. From my reading and understanding they are similar. Because in both cases we use an input data (A) and build a model and try it on test data (B) to see whether the model sucessed to diagnose, report or whatever depending on the goal. So, what is the difference?
