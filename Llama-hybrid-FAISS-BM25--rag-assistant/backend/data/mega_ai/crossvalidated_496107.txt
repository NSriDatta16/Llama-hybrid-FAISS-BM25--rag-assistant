Zero BLUPs / zero variance components with mmer R package sommer

When I fit a mixed model in the GNU R sommer package, I receive a zero variance components for a main effect (SP2) but high values for the interaction of this main effect (SP2:year). mod2mmer This seems to be a similar problem as in another thread . However, my scenario is not comparable to a genetic study where I want to investigate epistasis and I also wouldn't know how to apply the solution there to a more complex model as I am using. I receive the following output, where e.g. the variance component for SP2 is 0.00 and the interaction SP2:year is 9.09. Looking at the averages of my SP2 effects accross locations and years (in excel) there is clearly variation due to SP2. How can I code that in a correct, yet straigtforward way, so that the main effect is not somehow "absorbed" by the interaction? ====================================================================================== Multivariate Linear Mixed Model fit by REML *********************************** sommer 4.0 *********************************** ====================================================================================== logLik AIC BIC Method Converge Value -34.37105 84.7421 117.964 NR TRUE ====================================================================================== Variance-Covariance components: VarComp VarCompSE Zratio Constraint SP1.yield-yield 0.8341 1.0864 0.76769 Positive SP1:location.yield-yield 0.0000 1.0353 0.00000 Positive SP1:year.yield-yield 0.0000 1.0911 0.00000 Positive SP1:location:year.yield-yield 1.6378 1.4485 1.13072 Positive SP2.yield-yield 0.0000 2.4557 0.00000 Positive SP2:location.yield-yield 0.5784 1.3973 0.41395 Positive SP2:year.yield-yield 9.0936 3.3565 2.70922 Positive SP2:location:year.yield-yield 2.7536 1.8332 1.50209 Positive SP1:SP2.yield-yield 0.0700 0.8982 0.07793 Positive SP1:SP2:location.yield-yield 0.0000 1.2401 0.00000 Positive SP1:SP2:year.yield-yield 0.0000 1.2517 0.00000 Positive SP1:SP2:year:location.yield-yield -1.4621 1.8861 -0.77519 Positive units.yield-yield 14.9121 1.3974 10.67147 Positive ====================================================================================== Fixed effects: Trait Effect Estimate Std.Error t.value 1 yield (Intercept) 22.876 0.9832 23.267 2 yield year2019 1.724 1.2919 1.335 3 yield locationUst -8.444 1.0580 -7.982 4 yield env.blockFis-2018-2 3.019 0.7244 4.167 5 yield env.blockFis-2019-1 -5.264 1.4570 -3.613 6 yield env.blockFis-2019-2 -6.931 1.4570 -4.757 7 yield env.blockUst-2018-1 -2.788 0.7217 -3.863 8 yield env.blockUst-2019-1 -2.470 0.7050 -3.504 ====================================================================================== Groups and observations: yield SP1 8 SP1:location 16 SP1:year 16 SP1:location:year 32 SP2 30 SP2:location 60 SP2:year 60 SP2:location:year 120 SP1:SP2 240 SP1:SP2:location 480 SP1:SP2:year 480 SP1:SP2:year:location 960 ====================================================================================== xxxxx Edit xxxxx I did a model selection approach with the step() function in R and effectively many of the interaction terms are irrelevant. Ending up with a model that looks like this mod2mmer After simplifying the model, the main effects of SP2 are now not zero but still extremely small (e.g. -0.1, 0.2, 0.15). In the raw data, the mean values of SP2 scatter around the grand mean (17.5) with much higher differences with a standard deviation of 2.7 (e.g. 5.1, -2.8 etc.*). If I do a linear fixed effects model with the same model parameters (all fixed then obviously) I receive emmeans that come much closer to these means. The BLUPs that I estimate with the mixed model still don't make sense to me, should they not be at least in the range of these values? *values are means of different levels of SP2 over years and locations xxxxx Edit2 xxxxx My output of a model without any interactions in the random term mod2mmer looks like this ================================================================ Multivariate Linear Mixed Model fit by REML ************************ sommer 4.0 ************************ ================================================================ logLik AIC BIC Method Converge Value -77.44084 170.8817 204.1035 NR TRUE ================================================================ Variance-Covariance components: VarComp VarCompSE Zratio Constraint SP1.yield-yield 1.055 0.8749 1.206 Positive SP2.yield-yield 5.057 1.7382 2.909 Positive units.yield-yield 21.900 1.4989 14.611 Positive ================================================================ Fixed effects: Trait Effect Estimate Std.Error t.value 1 yield (Intercept) 22.783 0.8286 27.495 2 yield year2019 1.880 0.8704 2.160 3 yield locationUst -8.506 0.8825 -9.639 4 yield env.blockFis-2018-2 3.088 0.8743 3.533 5 yield env.blockFis-2019-1 -5.336 1.2283 -4.344 6 yield env.blockFis-2019-2 -7.002 1.2283 -5.701 7 yield env.blockUst-2018-1 -2.733 0.8739 -3.128 8 yield env.blockUst-2019-1 -2.470 0.8544 -2.891 ================================================================ Groups and observations: yield SP1 8 SP2 30 ================================================================
