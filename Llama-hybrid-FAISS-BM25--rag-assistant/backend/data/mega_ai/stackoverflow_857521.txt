Pros and Cons regarding extended use of branches

I want to be able to choose the right branching strategy for most thinkable situations and organizations. So I'm looking for a extensive list of positive and negative effects of extending the use of code repository branches in a development organization. Please only post one pro or one con in each post, so that the voting system can help rank the feedback somewhat.
