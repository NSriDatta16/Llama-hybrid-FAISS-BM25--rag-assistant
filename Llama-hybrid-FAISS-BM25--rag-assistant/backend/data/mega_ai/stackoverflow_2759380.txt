As you've already decided to use HTML 5's localStorage, you'll be using JavaScript anyway. In that case, I think you should use XMLHttpRequest s to retrieve from and send data back to the server. There exist several nice introductions to this on the net, like the W3C Working Draft and on Apple's site , on MDC and on MSDN . Please search for questions containing the AJAX tag . BTW, if you merely want to store data during page sessions (so, you don't have to store data locally in between several page visits), you can also store your data in JavaScript arrays/objects. They are very easy to access and manipulate. This approach also has the benefit of better browser support (contrary to HTML 5's localStorage and proprietary solutions).
