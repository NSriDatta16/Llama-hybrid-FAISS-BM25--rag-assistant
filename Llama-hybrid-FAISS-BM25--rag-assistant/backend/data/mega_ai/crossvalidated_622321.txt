How do I know these segments will be useful to the business? You don't. What clustering does, is split the data into groups based on a similarity metric. Cluster analysis is unsupervised, so the algorithms "decide by themselves" what kind of patterns to extract from the data, unlike supervised algorithms that are "guided" by the labels. What groups would be extracted depends on the algorithm and the data, but nothing guarantees that the algorithm would come up with the same definition of "groups of similar items" as you would. For example, if you run clustering analysis on medical X-ray images, the algorithm could come up with clusters of images that are "dark", "greyish", and "light", rather than clusters of any medical relevance. Moreover, most of the clustering algorithms will do whatever is necessary to do what you asked, so if you asked for five clusters, even if there is no meaningful way to cluster the data in five groups, it will group the data into some five groups. Second, the results of cluster analysis need to be interpreted. Cluster analysis would tell you that the observations belong to some clusters, but it does not tell you how to understand the clusters. You noticed it yourself, to describe the clusters in plain English, you derived some thresholds like "users transacted more than 100\$ and did >= 3 transactions in a month". This is not what $k$ -means does, it finds the clusters by grouping together the observations around the cluster means by the similarity metric. A better description of the groups would be to describe the "average" member of the group using the cluster means. If you want to apply the clustering to external data, rather than deriving the thresholds, use the predict method of the software that you used, which would classify the data using the similarity metrics. But going back to interpretation clusters, if you know what the cluster means, it doesn't tell you if and why those groups are distinct and if the grouping has any business relevance. Finally, even if you have a way of meaningfully clustering the data, that is not the same as using this knowledge for making business decisions. If you group the data into business-meaningful groups, but then serve the groups with very poor marketing campaigns, you would not see any increased revenue. The clusters themselves do not tell you how to turn them into profit. If the business profits from your results, sometimes may have very little to do with the results themselves. What I'm trying to say here is that the only thing that cluster analysis does, is groups the data into groups. It is your job to make sure that you use relevant data for the cluster analysis (so you don't accidentally cluster people on hair color or some other arbitrary criteria), do a detailed analysis to understand and validate the results (how do the clusters differ, are the patterns meaningful, what do domain experts say about the results, do the results lead to any actionable insights), and to translate the results to either insights or automated processes. So you don't know if the results would improve the revenue unless you do an experiment and try using them.
