PHP - How to start a session after HTTP authentication

I am dealing with the skeleton of an old website that uses http authentication for users to access membership data. The access content button is a link to a index.html page with the following: I would like to change this to a index.php page which would start a session then redirect with header(); Is there a php equivalent to content="0; in this case? I guess I could just use but is there anything more elegant?
