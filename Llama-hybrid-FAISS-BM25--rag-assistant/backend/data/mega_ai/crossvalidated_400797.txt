From looking at your data, it appears as though the time series exhibits significant volatility from day to day as well as general seasonality over time. To confirm if this is the case, I would recommend decomposing your data and examining components separately to confirm this. decompose(mydata) If it appears as though your data is highly volatile, then your analysis may be best served through running an ARCH/GARCH model specifically designed to handle such volatility. If you wanted to use a machine learning model to attempt to model such volatility, this is also an option. You might find the following resources of use: R-bloggers: A practical introduction to garch modeling 16.4 Volatility Clustering and Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity
