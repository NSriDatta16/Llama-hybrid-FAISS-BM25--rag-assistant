I think too that the O'Reilly book is going to be the only one, there isn't much about XSL-FO out there... Frankly I think it's a dead technology, it's just too complex for the average programmer to learn, it takes weeks - plus the good formatters out there are expensive as hell. This is not an answer to your question, but if anyone would ask me, I'd advise against learning XSL-FO. It's a solutions searching for a problem IMO.
