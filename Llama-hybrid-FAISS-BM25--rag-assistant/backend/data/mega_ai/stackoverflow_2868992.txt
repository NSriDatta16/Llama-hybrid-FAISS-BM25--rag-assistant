The obvious answer is to cast the data out of with var1.value () == var2.value () to compare them, but that requires you to know the type when comparing. It seems like in your case this might be possible. If you are just using enums, you could also convert it to an int for storage in the QVariant. Edit: For clarification about searching a QComboBox , it uses the model of the combo box to find the data . Specifically, it uses the match() function of the QAbstractItemModel to check for equality. Luckily, this function is virtual so you can override it in a subclass.
