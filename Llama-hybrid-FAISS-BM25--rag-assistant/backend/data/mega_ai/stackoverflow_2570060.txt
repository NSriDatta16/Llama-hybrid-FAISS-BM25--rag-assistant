Web-To-Print - What technology should I explore? Web-Content -> drag & drop to Templates -> PDF

I'm discussing some software design issues with a potential client and the idea of Web-to-Print technology has come up. We need users to be able to drag images from an image library to various regions defined by a template. Example: Images may go in box A, B, or C and text may go in boxes D or E. These templates would be setup Boxes A through E would be defined inside a template by administrators using some sort of editor. These templates would serve as a mapping from web-content to a PDF. Once users drag images and insert text in the appropriate regions of the template, the result will be converted into a PDF. Is this feasible these days with jquery & asp.net? That would be nice. If not, what would be the ideal solution?
