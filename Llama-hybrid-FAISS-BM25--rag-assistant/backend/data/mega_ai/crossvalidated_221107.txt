For each point in time, you don't have a single observation, but an entire curve or function, namely, the distribution function of your quarterly results over the 90 markets. This is a case of functional-data-analysis . Thus, I'd recommend you look for "functional data forecasting" or something similar. For instance, Rob Hyndman has a working paper on forecasting functional time series . It's on age-specific mortality over time, but the ideas might well be applicable to your case. That said, just ten observations (ten quarters between 2014Q1 and 2016Q2) is very little data. I don't know how well any method will perform here. Stick with something simple.
