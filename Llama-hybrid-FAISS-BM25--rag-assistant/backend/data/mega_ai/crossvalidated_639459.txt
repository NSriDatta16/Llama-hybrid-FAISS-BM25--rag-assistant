imputation of NA on financial ratios

I'm a student doing a data science report on finance. I need to impute NA on some financial ratios. For example, ROAE. I have negative values and positive values. There are also NA, where they are defined in this way " when the denominator is negative, the results return NA". How I can fill these NA? Also there are financial ratios that are only positive values and NA, for example P/E ratio. Here NA are defined as follow: " when the denominator is negative, the results return NA". But in this case seems that all negative values are replaced by NA. So, my question is how I can fill NA for the first example and for the second? I tried with a MissForest() , but I don't know if it works well. I think that most NAs are negative values, so maybe the solution is to randomly impute negative values that are appropriate to NA, but I donâ€™t know how I can do it. Maybe there is a way to limit MissForest() to impute only negative values...
