A quick answer would be to have a model like: [Blog] If you want to do versioning, then you would have something like: [entry]-(1)-------(N)-[entry_version] |-------------| | version_num | | content | |-------------| I don't think a document-storage engine would make much difference. You would still need to keep track of which version of content belongs to a given entry (or blog, or whatever). Unless, of course, the system you used already provided versioning. Now that I think about it, you could also do it in one single table: [ BlogSubEntry ] |----------------| | content | | entry_id |
