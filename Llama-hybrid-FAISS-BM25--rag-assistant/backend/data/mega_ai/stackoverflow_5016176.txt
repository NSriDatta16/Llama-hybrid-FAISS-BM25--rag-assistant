see ?mode : mode is giving you the storage mode. If you want the value with the maximum count, then use table. > Sample tmp tmp Sample a b c d e 9 12 9 7 13 > tmp[which(tmp==max(tmp))] e 13 Please, read the help files if a function is not doing what you think it should. Some extra explanation : max(tmp) is the maximum of tmp tmp == max(tmp) gives a logical vector with a length of tmp, indicating whether a value is equal or not to max(tmp). which(tmp == max(tmp)) returns the index of the values in the vector that are TRUE . These indices you use to select the value in tmp that is the maximum value. See the help files ?which , ?max and the introductory manuals for R.
