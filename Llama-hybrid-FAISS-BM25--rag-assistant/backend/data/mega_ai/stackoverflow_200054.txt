If you can you find enough candidates who really know template meta-programing then by all means, require it. You will be showing a lot of qualified and potentially productive people the door (there are plenty of legitimate reasons not to know how to do this, namely that if you do it on a lot of platforms, you will create code that can't compile, or that average developers will have trouble understanding). Template meta-programming is great, but let's face it, it's pushing C++ to the limit. Now, a candidate should probably understand basics (compute n! at compile time, or at least explain how it works if they are shown the code). If your new developers are reliably becoming productive within a few weeks, then your current recruiting is probably pretty good.
