No you cannot. I had a discussion with someone in their development/support team on the MSDN forums and currently they don't support 'drag and drop' type of functionality. However you CAN serialize the model output and then de-serialize them in Azure. Note that the answer in the image is a bit outdated and there is the 'Create R Script' module to replace the serialization-deserialization steps within Azure. However I believe you can still serialize outside Asure (in your Desktop version of R) and deserialize them in Azure.
