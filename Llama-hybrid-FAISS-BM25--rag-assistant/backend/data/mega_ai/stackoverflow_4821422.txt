In Magento, how can I organize products from different categories under a parent entity which in turn has it's own attributes?

The actual use case is similar to a multi-vendor implementation in that the store should display products from many different vendors, but each one only requires it's own landing page (not a problem), and to have some vendor attributes, like address, accessible easily from the products. No back-end interface or access control is required for the individual vendor. Categories with custom attributes would have worked except that then a single vendor could only exist under one category, and not several. How feasible is it to build a new content type into the Magento system to handle this? I'm interested to hear any ideas. Thanks!
