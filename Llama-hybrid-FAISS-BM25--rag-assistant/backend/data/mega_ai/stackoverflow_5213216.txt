xml:lang has the same purpose as lang - it defines the language a document or fragment is written in. Two different attributes are necessary because not all HTML is XML, and not all XML is (X)HTML. Use cases: If the XML describes a text document, a word processor could select the appropriate dictionary . te in English meant probably the , but it's a French word. A browser (web, help, or similar) could offer to automatically translate the content if it's not in the list of the languages the user understands (in fact, that's what Chrome does). The attribute could also prevent a code-heavy site from mistakenly being classified as English by search engines.
