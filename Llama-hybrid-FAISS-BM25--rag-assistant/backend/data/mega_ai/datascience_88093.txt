Having trouble scaling scores of logistic regression

I am constructing a credit scorecard using logistic regression, similar to the one shown here . However, when trying to convert the coefficients of logistic regression into score representation (by scaling the values using the provided formula) I am getting numbers that dont make much sense. Formula used for calculating scores: Score_i= (βi × WoE_i + α/n) × Factor + Offset/n where βi is the coefficient of the logistic regression (of variable i ), WoE_i is the weight of evidence of corresponding variable, α is the intercept of the logistic regression, Factor is calculated as PDO / ln(2) , Offset is calculated as target_points - (factor * ln(target_odds)) n is number of variables used in regression In my case PDO = 50, target_odds = 2, target_points = 500, n = 81, and intercept is -0.12686514. Here is an example of one of my features: As it can be seen, both WoE and the coefficients increase in value as the "revenue" variable increases. The score however does not act in this way. Initially I just assumed the scores acted in inverse proportion to those two values so I added a negative sign in front of the formula: Score_i= -(βi × WoE_i + α/n) × Factor + Offset/n But for some other features, the score is proportional to the other values: And adding the negative sign would now make this feature have a score that does not make much sense. How can I keep the scaling consistent? What am I doing incorrectly here?
