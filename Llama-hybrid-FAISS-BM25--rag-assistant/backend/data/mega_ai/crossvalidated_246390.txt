What precautions should one take when building a model in two stages?

My data has too many features to be estimated with a single predictive model (see How to model a stochastic trend in the response variable of a regression? ). In consequence, I'm considering a time series method (exponential smoothing, kernel, continuous AR, etc) to detrend the observations and then fitting a regression on the raw residuals (a model to explain the "distance from the trend"). In a simple case, I assume running ARIMA and then a regression on the residuals is less efficient than running ARIMAX. In this case there's no single model for my data, so I was wondering what precautions I should take and how much efficiently I'm losing.
