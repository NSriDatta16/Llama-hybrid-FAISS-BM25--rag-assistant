ISO/ANSI Standard SQL does not consider optimization at all. For example the widely recognized CREATE INDEX SQL DDL does not appear in the Standard. This is because the Standard makes no assumptions about the underlying storage medium and nor should it. I regularly use SQL to query data in text files and Excel spreadsheets, neither of which have any concept of database indexes.
