algorithms to pick best collection of classifiers

I have a bunch of methods that classify a binary outcome. I'm trying to figure out if some combination of those classifiers is better than any others. I'm hoping to run a bunch of methods. I've thought of running random forests/cart and perhaps a SVM model. What are some other common methods typically done for this?
