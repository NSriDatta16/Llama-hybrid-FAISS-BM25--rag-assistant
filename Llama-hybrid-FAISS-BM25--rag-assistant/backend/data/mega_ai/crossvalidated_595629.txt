By the $MA(\infty)$ representation, we may write $y_t$ as a linear combination of the uniform $\varepsilon_t$ . This weighted sum should then, for the process running for sufficiently many periods $n$ , behave approximately normally (the exact distribution of a linear combination of uniforms will be difficult to handle), so that it will exceed the normal $\alpha/2$ and $1-\alpha/2$ quantiles times the standard deviation of $y$ approximately a fraction $\alpha$ of observations. Here is an illustration showing that the 5 and 95% quantiles are exceeded 10% of the times on average. (In practice, you could estimate $\phi$ and $\sigma^2_\varepsilon$ from the series.) For other values of $a$ you'd back out which quantile they correspond to. (Or you resort to the simulation approach for a given value of $a$ directly.) sigma.eps boundary) # a little "simulation study" mean(replicate(10000, mean(abs(arima.sim(list(ar=phi), n, innov = runif(n, -1, 1))) > boundary)))
