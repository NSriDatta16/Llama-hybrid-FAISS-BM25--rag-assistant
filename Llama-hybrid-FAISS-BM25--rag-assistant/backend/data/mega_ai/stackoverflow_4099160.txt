Python error calculating program

Ask the user to enter payroll information for the company. Set up a loop that continues to ask for information until they enter “DONE”. For each employee ask three questions: name (first & last) hours worked this week (only allow 1 through 60) hourly wage (only allow 6.00 through 20.00) VALIDATE the hours worked and the hourly wage, and make sure a name is entered. Calculate each employee’s pay, and write it out to a sequential file. Be sure to include file I/O error handling logic. Include only the weekly pay Weekly pay is calculated: For (1-40 hours) it is hourly rate * hours worked For (41-60 hours) it is (hours worked – 40) * (hourly rate * 1.5) + hourly rate * 40 After all the employees are entered, read in the sequential file into a list named PAY for the weekly pay of each employee. Sort the list. Now print the lowest, highest, and average weekly pay for the week. I am having obvious problem with this code while len(eName)>0: eName=raw_input("\nPlease enter the employees' first and last name. ") hWork=raw_input("How many hours did they work this week? ") hoursWork=int(hWork) if hoursWork 60: print "Employees' can't work less than 1 hour or more than 60 hours!" else: pRate=raw_input("What is their hourly rate? ") payRate=int(pRate) if payRate 20: print "Employees' wages can't be lower than $6.00 or greater than $20.00!" if hoursWork
