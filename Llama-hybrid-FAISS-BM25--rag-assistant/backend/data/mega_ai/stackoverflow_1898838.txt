There are a number of reasons why one might use Tomcat over Jetty: One is already familiar with Tomcat One is developing web applications that need to be easily transported to a Tomcat installation The Jetty developer documentation is actually spottier than Tomcat's (amazing!) Getting questions answered in the Jetty community can sometimes take years, as in 2007. see Embedding Jetty Important: After Jetty 6.1.*, each web application opens into its own JVM, so if you're trying to gain programmatic access between your standalone access and your web app, your only hope is via a web API. If it's an issue for you, Tomcat is an open source project who intellectual property is owned by the Apache Foundation, Jetty is open source but owned by a small private company (Mortbay Consulting) Point #5 has been important in my work. For example, I can gain direct access to a JSPWiki instance via Tomcat, but it's completely inaccessible when using Jetty. I asked for a solution to that in 2007 and haven't yet heard an answer. So I finally gave up and began using Tomcat 6. I've looked into Glassfish and Grizzly, but so far Tomcat is (amazingly) the most stable and well-documented web container (which isn't saying much really).
