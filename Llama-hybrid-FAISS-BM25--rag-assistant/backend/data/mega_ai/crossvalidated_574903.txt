Which one is superior? Neither is superior to the other. There are cases where one is preferable to another. I will take what you mean by "mathematical modelling" to mean differential equations and the like, which are often used in the modelling of biological processes. ODE/PDE models are mechanistic in so far as we have an idea of how the system changes and we need only estimate the relevant parameters. Simple biological processes (e.g. population growth limited to some carrying capacity, the spread of an epidemic in a closed and homogeneous population, etc) are very well suited for mathematical modelling of this nature. Machine learning is better suited when we don't have an idea of how the system evolves, but we do have relevant data about the system at the time of observation. Our approach here is really descriptive, rather than mechanistic, often opting to make $E(y \vert X)$ our prediction.
