Image classification if rotated version same

I asked this question on stackoverflow but was advised to come here. I have some images to classify. I see that Convolutional neural network may be best for this, e.g. here . However, for my images, their rotated versions (to any degree) is effectively same image. What should I do so that this aspect is also taken into account. One method I thought is to create many rotated versions (say, every 30 degree rotation) of each training image and add them to train set with same label. Is there any other way? Also, will it help if I get each image in a circular area? Two example images are shown below:
