Regression on large samples: can aggregation of the dependent variable by covariate pattern increase speed of estimation?

Is there a way to build a regression model for continuous output using aggregate data instead of individual data points when all input variables are categorical? I have a moderately large dataset (few million rows). All my predictor variables are categorical or binary. I have two outcome variables - one binary and another continuous. For the binary variables I am using logistic regression. My R code is as follows: rawdata If I aggregate the data first and build the model its almost instant. library(dplyr) sumdata % group_by(F1,F2,F3) %>% summarize(y1 = sum(y),Visits = n()) system.time(agg_m The model output is exactly the same and it saves a lot of time and requires much less memory and computation power. My question is this works for a logistic model but is there a way to make this work for continuous output variables? If I calculate the mean and standard deviation can I feed that into a model? Standard errors in weighted least squares on aggregated data A good explanation is given here when the output variable takes a finite set of values, but is there an approach that works for continuous values. Please note I do have raw data so I can compute any statistics on it when aggregating.
