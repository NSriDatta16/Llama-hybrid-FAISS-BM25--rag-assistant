For those who think that validation is decisive, there are in fact two ways to get a div inside a p . One way is to use dom manipulation in script. For example var theDiv = document.createElement("div"); theDiv.appendChild(document.createTextNode("inserted")); var theP = document.getElementsByTagName("p")[0]; theP.insertBefore(theDiv, theP.firstChild); See it in action here: http://www.alohci.net/text/html/div-in-p-by-script.htm.ashx The other way is to use XHTML and serve it with an XML content type. (No support in IE prior to IE9) See that here : http://www.alohci.net/application/xhtml+xml/div-in-p-by-mime.htm.ashx (Do note however, that while it is possible this way - it is still not valid .) But You makes the vital point. Semantically, it's nonsense. You wouldn't put a block of something in the middle of a paragraph if you were writing text on to paper, so there should be no need to do it in HTML either.
