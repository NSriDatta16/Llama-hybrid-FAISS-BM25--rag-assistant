TFS 2010 Get operation fails periodically on large files (> 1MB)

Occasionally I get an error from my builds with the following error message: [Large File Name]: Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. One or more errors occurred while performing a Get operation. Everytime this happens, the file is always over 1MB in size. The setup is TFS 2010 with a Build Agent that is a VMWare Virtual Machine running Windows Server 2003 R2. As I mentioned earlier this does not happen all the time (maybe one out of ten times) so I hoping that there is a configuration setting I can alter to fix this.
