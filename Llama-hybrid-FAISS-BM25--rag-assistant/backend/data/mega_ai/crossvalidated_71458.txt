Silhouette coefficients after deleting some data and re-clustering

I was working on a dataset today on which I used K-means clustering algorithm and then calculated the Silhouette coefficients for each point. I then removed 5% of the data with worst silhouette coefficients and re-clustered again. The average silhouette coefficient for each cluster got worse after re-clustering and removal of those outliers (I expected opposite). Am I getting the right answer or have I made a blatant mistake? The results I got don't seem intuitive to me.
