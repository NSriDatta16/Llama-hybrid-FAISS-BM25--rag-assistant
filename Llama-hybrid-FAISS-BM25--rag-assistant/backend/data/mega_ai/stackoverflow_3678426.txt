How can I draw a border with squared corners in wpf?

You know, like Battlestar paper! I have given this a few goes but now I'm stumped. I haven't yet gone down the geometery route, so I'll explain this as best as I can. I'd like the border to be sizable, but contain fixed-size corners, just like CornerRadius does. Instead of rounded corners, I'd like them to be tapered, like: /---------\ | | | | \_________/ I've done two attempts at this: My first attempt attempts to manipulate a border class. This just doesn't work, as stretching the shape ruins the geometry and scale. The second attempt was a bit more out the box. Literally. I created a 3x3 grid and filled it with 4 borders, each with a thickness of 2,0,0,0 - 0,2,0,0 - 0,0,2,0 and 0,0,0,2 respectively. The final step, is the join the borders up with a Line. Here where my question lies.... First attempt Second attempt The Line is set to scale to the grid size. Setting the Line properties to X1="0" X2="1" Y1="1" Y2="0" and using Stretch="Fill" expands the Line to the edges. However, it ends up looking like this: (Annoyingly, I can't post images, I need to go answer someone elses questions to earn some rep. So instead please go to this link to see the line, or paste the above XAML into Kaxaml.) http://img375.imageshack.us/img375/1996/border1.png I drew a magenta border around the Grid element hosting the Line, to make the problem more obvious. How can I expand the line to really fill the gap (for example by inflating the drawable area within the grid), or, is there a better way? Also, transformations distort the line, making it thicker. I tried scaling up but there wasn't a consistency to this. Endcaps on the line look just as bad (Triangle for example). Finally, this method is still flawed, because I want to be able to set the corner size in the future, so having the edge width for the row/column set to 10 seems like a stumbling point. Binding to a property might solve that, I've never done that in a Style though. Thanks for reading, Tom
