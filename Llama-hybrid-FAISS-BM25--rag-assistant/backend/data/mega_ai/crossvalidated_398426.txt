increasing accuracy of binary logistic regression by reducing type II error?

I am to use binary logistic regression predict a deadly disease from 109 cases out of 385 patients. If during the preliminary diagnosis all patients were sent to the expert doctor for secondary diagnosis, the accuracy rate of the model is 109/385 = 28%. But sending all patients to the expert doctor is costly and not all hospitals have an expert doctor. So the model should increase this prediction accuracy. I also have chosen 13 risk factors to help to predict this disease: 3 numerical and 10 binary. I run a binary logistic regression with these risk factors in SPSS. In the classification table, after reducing the cut-off from 0.5 down to 0.05, I get no typeII error: all patients who have the diseases have been correctly diagnosed. (edit: in SPSS binary logistic regression report, there is a classification table where I observe results) However, the accuracy of the model does not improve much in this case. 30-35% from base 28%. I added the interaction terms 2-way, 3-way, the result does not seem to change much. Is this problem inherently not possible to solve with multivariate logistic regression? How can I improve the accuracy of the model? I want to keep the typeII error as close to zero as possible or zero, at the same time I want to improve the accuracy away from 28% (the base accuracy rate). Biostatistic experts are welcome to reply.
