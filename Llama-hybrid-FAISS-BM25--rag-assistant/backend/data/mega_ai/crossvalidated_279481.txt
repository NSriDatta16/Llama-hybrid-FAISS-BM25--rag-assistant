This is a possible approach, but by using an arbitrarily selected percentage cutoff for the dummy variable, it does not take into account that a percentage deviation below this could also form a structural change in the time series. For instance, let's say we have a time series that on average, shows about 10% volatility. Then, there is a 50% drop. This is clearly a structural change in the time series relative to its prior trend, but your dummy variable will not pick this up if you have set a threshold higher than this. The Chow statistic is one example of a test that is used to detect a structural break in a time series. Suppose that you have 100 observations in your time series. You suspect that there is a structural change at n=30 . To test this, you would firstly run three regressions: 1. Regression A: n = [1:30] (Before structural change) 2. Regression B: n = [31:60] (After structural change) 3. Regression P: n = [1:60] (Pooled Regression) Your Chow statistic would then be calculated as follows: CHOW = (RSSP â€“ (RSSA+RSSB))/k) / (RSSA+RSSB)/(NA+NB-2k) where RSS = Residual Sum of Squares, k = number of regressors (including intercept), N = degrees of freedom The null and alternative hypothesis for this test is as follows: Null Hypothesis: No structural break in time series Alternative Hypothesis: Structural break in time series Therefore, upon finding your f critical value , if you find that the Chow test exceeds this value - you can reject the null hypothesis of no structural break. You could choose, for instance, to implement a stepwise calculation of the Chow statistic as you move up in observations, and say, have a dummy of 1 if a structural change is detected (you reject the null hypothesis), and a dummy of 0 if you do not. Additionally, you could set the dummy variable of 1 as only being so if the movement is downwards to account for the trough. To summarise, you can certainly use the method you described. However, you may miss indications of a trough depending on the threshold you set. By using a more formal statistic, you are able to detect structural changes with more accuracy and relative to the overall trend. Hope this helps.
