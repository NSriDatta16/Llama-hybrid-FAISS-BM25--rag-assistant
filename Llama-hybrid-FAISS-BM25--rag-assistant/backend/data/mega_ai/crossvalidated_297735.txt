applying standard regression techniques to time series prediction via second level forcasting

The author of the book: Practical Time Series Forecasting with R: A Hands-On Guide suggests fitting a second level forecasting model to the residuals of a standard (first level) regression model in order to deal with auto regression via standard regression methods (auto regression violates one of standard regression's assumption). I have to admit that I do not fully understand this. Did anyone follow such a methodology to be able to use standard regression packages (e.g. PROC GLMSELECT in SAS)? Any feedback would be very much appreciated.
