Apache has a known and unresolved issue with Expect headers, see bug 46709 and bug 47087 . The issue is that some clients set the Expect header and only send the request headers before a PUT or POST of data. This allows the server to respond to errors/redirects/security violations prior to the client sending the request body (PUT or POST data). This is a laudable goal, but apparently, the client does not wait until it gets a response and just pushes out the body of the request, which results in the 417 error. If you have control over a .NET client you can use ServicePointManager.Expect100Continue Property set to false, to override this behavior. If you only have control over the server, it looks like you can either force HTTP 1.0 for those clients (perhaps based on user agent string) or force unset the Expect header using mod_header early on in the request. To remove the Expect header from the request early using mod_headers use this config directive: RequestHeader unset Expect early This works because the client is not actually waiting for the "100 Continue" response and acting as if the Expect header were not set.
