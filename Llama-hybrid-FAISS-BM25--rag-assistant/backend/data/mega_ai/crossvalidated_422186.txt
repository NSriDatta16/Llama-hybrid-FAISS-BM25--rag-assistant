Motivations for experiment design in statistical learning?

My interests in statistics centre around statistical learning, including Bayesian inference, inference in combinatorial spaces, Monte Carlo methods, Markov decision processes, modeling stochastic processes and so on. It is mandatory at my universityâ€™s program that we take an experiment design course, which seems rather orthogonal to my interests. I am hoping this opinion is a by product of my ignorance. Thus some questions I seek to answer include: what are applications of experiment design in statistical learning? How can I relate it to statistical learning? What are some motivating examples or challenging problems in experiment design?
