Given that you don't know what PokeAround is - it could be anything! - how do you write a test that guards against it? Is it at all possible? This question is specious. The situation is unlikely to occur in the real world. You always know what PokeAround is. It's unit testing. You have the source. If -- through some organizational evil -- you are prohibited from reading the source, you have an organizational problem, not a technical problem. If you don't know what PokeAround is, you have people who are being specifically evil and preventing success. They need new jobs. Or you do. You must use Mocks for this PokeAround so you can observe the side-effects. "guard against side effects added later on." This is not an example of a mysterious piece of code. You still know what PokeAround is. You always know what PokeAround is. This is why we do Regression Testing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing It's still unit testing. You still test PokeAround with a stand-alone unit test. And you test things that use PokeAround with a mock of PokeAround.
