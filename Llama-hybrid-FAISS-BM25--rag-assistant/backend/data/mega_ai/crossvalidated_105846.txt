Is a one sample t test the right approach for this question?

This is an example from my book that I'm trying to figure out but I'm totally lost. Can someone complete this step by step so I understand? A new meditation technique based on making barnyard animal noises promises to calm people, but you might be skeptical. You can imagine that it could cause stress to sit around oinking and mooing. To test the therapy, you ask 16 people to make animal noises, then ask them to rate emotion on a scale from 1-7, with 1 representing “Very Calm,” and 7 representing “Very Stressed.” You happen to know that people who don’t oink and moo have an average emotion rating of 4, with a standard deviation of 2.57. Below are the ratings from the 16 people who made animal noises. 4 5 6 5 4 3 7 4 3 4 4 3 5 6 5 4 Write the null and alternative hypotheses for this example. Write the specific type of analysis you will use. Zobt? Z crit? Provide a statement of a significant or nonsignificant effect. Write the obtained value. I believe my null and alternate hypotheses are: $\text{H}_0: \overline{X}= μ\quad\text{vs}\quad \text{H}_1:\overline{X} \neq μ$ for $t$ I did $\frac{4.5-4}{2.57/\sqrt{16}}$ and got $.778$? Is this correct? My $z_\text{crit}$ would be $2.131$?
