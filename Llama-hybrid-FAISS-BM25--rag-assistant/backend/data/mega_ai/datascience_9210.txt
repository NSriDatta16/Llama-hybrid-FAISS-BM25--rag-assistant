As far as I know, the existing (almost all) libraries in Python can handle very complex models of Neural Networks. TensorFlow is however not polished as of now. It still has a long way to grow before getting accepted as a mainstream library for ML. So, going ahead with the existing libraries like PyLearn/Keras/Torch, etc makes sense as of now (also as they have wide and dedicated communities already), as you need to concentrate on research rather than worrying on bugs and technical problems of a library.
