JavaScript has no block-level scope. That means that your this refers to the document. In order for this to refer to each element, you need to create a new function: $(document).ready(function() { $('.contract_quote .spot_quote').each(function() { $(this).qtip({ content: $(this).text(); }); }); }); That said, even if you'd need the title attribute, it would be good practice to set it anyway. Setting it automatically with JavaScript is OK but not ideal. Setting it with your CMS (if you use one) would be better. If a user agent, for some reason, is looking for the title of the link, it's just better to have one, even if it's always the same as the content, as user agents are not as smart as humans. Most of the times, anyway.
