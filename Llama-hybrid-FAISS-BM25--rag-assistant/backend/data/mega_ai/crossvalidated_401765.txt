There are several techniques related to this challenge of estimating the performance of a neural network without running the entire training procedure addressed by the multi-fidelity(quality of performance estimation) optimization literature. Some of them are: Training on a subset of data Training on lower resolution image if one is working on image datasets Extrapolating learning curves Two good references for this literature are below: https://www.ml4aad.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/automl_book_draft_neural_architecture_search.pdf https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter
