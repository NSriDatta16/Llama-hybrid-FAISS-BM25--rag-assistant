In the Breusch-Pagan test, the predictors included in the so-called auxiliary regression were unspecified, but generally assumed to be only those from the original regression. White provided a specific set of predictors that should be included---those from the original regression, those predictors squared, and all of the pairwise interactions. The White test is really just a special case of the Breusch-Pagan test. White's contribution was to show the properties of his proposed case. His version is the one typically used, as far as I've seen.
