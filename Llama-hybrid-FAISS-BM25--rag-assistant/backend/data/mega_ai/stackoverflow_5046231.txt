Deleting records using delete/where exists problem

My problem is I want to delete records from two tables, deleting the records that are a result of the following query: SELECT AVG(pr.rating) AS rating_average FROM products p INNER JOIN product_ratings pr ON pr.product_id = p.product_id GROUP BY p.product_id HAVING AVG(pr.rating) The above query shows average ratings of a product that are less than 3, I want to delete products and their associated ratings of all the results from the above query. I looked at DELETE FROM product_ratings, products WHERE EXISTS (//above query) , but this didn't work, I've been trying various DELETE statements to no avail. I have read the following, and still cannot find a solution: SQL: DELETE Statement & SQL: EXISTS Condition . The tables are products and product_ratings , with the following structure: products -------- product_id [PK] | link | ... product_ratings --------------- rating_id [PK] | rating | product_id Appreciate any help, as well as links to reference material to better understand how it's done. EDIT: Apologies for not stating what RDBMS I'm using, It's MySQL EDIT2: A bit confused now, @Martin's example doesn't use a temp table like the other answers, I assume this is because of my vague question not stating with RDBMS I was using?
