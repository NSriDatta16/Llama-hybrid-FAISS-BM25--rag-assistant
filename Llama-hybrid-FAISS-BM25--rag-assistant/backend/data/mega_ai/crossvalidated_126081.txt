The RF algorithm is quite fast once built, so for most cases you won't have any trouble running data through your model in real time. Just: Build your model with data at hand, adjusting parameters to get a good predictive model. Then have a look at the feature importances to see if you can trim down the set of variables you need for a good model. Once you've gotten the minimum set of features and the best model, set up a system to generate those features from your real time data as it comes in. Pump the generated features into your model and return the result. If you are looking for an online version of RF, where the model itself gets updated as new data comes in, that is a different technique. You can start with Online Random Forests and Streaming Random Forests if you are going that route.
