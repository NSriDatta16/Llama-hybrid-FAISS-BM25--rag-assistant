Will crypto currency mining hardware work fine for machine learning?

I've found that because of recession in crypto mining business a lot of mining rigs are available on sale in pretty reasonable prices. For around $1000 we can buy used machine. Will rig like this work fine for machine learning: 6x NVIDIA GTX 1070 8GB Intel Celeron G3900 120GB SSD DDR4 8GB Asus Z 170 Pro Gaming We are a small development company and looking for good priced rig efficient enough to teach some models on it. Such hardware seems to have a lot of CUDA cores, but what might be a bottleneck?
