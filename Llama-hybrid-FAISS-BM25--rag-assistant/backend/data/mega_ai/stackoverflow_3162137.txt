The reason you've probably spent more time over the past year doing web development is because there is more work in that arena. The TCO (total cost of ownership) to organizations offering web-based access to an application vs. fat client distribution is hard to argue with. There are relatively rare cases (hardware interface, disconnected solutions, OS plug-ins, etc.) where it still makes sense to write applications for the desktop, but in most cases the demand for your skills will remain on the web because that's where the savvy people paying for all this work are spending their money. Rather than turn toward WinForms development take a look at sharpening your skills for the cloud. Amazon Web Services, RackSpace, Microsoft Azure, VMWare, IBM and others are all getting into that space and it's only going to grow, and quickly. Right now there aren't a lot of people who have much experience in this space because it is relatively new. You can more easily differentiate yourself if you teach yourself some skills in this area while it's still new. If you aren't the teach-yourself type consider looking at something closer to what you already are comfortable with and check out ASP.net MVC or brushing up on jQuery. There are better online references and even some books to help with each of those. Good luck / keep enjoying what you're doing and the experience will come!
