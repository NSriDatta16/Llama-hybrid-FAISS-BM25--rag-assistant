If you're new to rails I recommend you read a book before you dive into the API documentation. Here are two recommendations: Agile Web Development With Rails - Great introduction and reference on how to use rails. Programming Ruby 1.9: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide - More on Ruby. Great references! After you've worked your way through those books, you'll have an idea of how Rails is designed and where to look for stuff. Both books are great reference books. If you want to access the Rails and Ruby API's online, make sure to checkout RailsApi.com
