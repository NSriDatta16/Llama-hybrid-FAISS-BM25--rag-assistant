Can i use rotated PCA factors to make models and then subsitute these back to my original variables?

I have been using PCA results and variable loadings on the factors generated to select original uncorrelated input variables for model making I was putting what i thought were rotated factors from PCA into models and seeing what factors were significant. Then i would go back and see if i could make sense of the results in regards to the original input variables. For example if rotated PC #4 was highly significant in my model and had a single loaded input variable (say variable 8 loaded onto PC #4 to 0.9) i would substitute PC#4 for variable #8. This did not work for one data set and i found that the factors i was using were generated raw unrotated PCA factors. These are obviously much less distinguishable in terms of the original x variables. Im not very familiar with the pure mathematical side of PCA but i had assumed the factors i generated related to the rotated factors not the unrotated factors. The initial data set i worked on appeared to be successful as the unrotated and rotated factors were fairly similar thus i didnt come across the issue Can i use rotated factors after PCA to make a model and then substitute these factors back to original X variables?
