By definition, the variance of a random variable $X$ is the average squared distance between $X$ and its mean $\mathbb{E}(X)$. That means that the average (unsquared) distance will be on the order of $\sqrt{\text{var}(X)}$. In this case, the random variable is not $X$ but $E_{\text{val}}(h)$. Since $$ \text{var}[E_{\text{val}}(h)] = \frac{\sigma^2}{K}, $$ on average the cross-validation error will be a distance of roughly $\sigma/\sqrt{K}$ away from its expected value of $E_{\text{out}}(h)$. Since we are interested in how this measure of precision changes with the size $K$ of the validation set, we drop the constant $\sigma$ and write $O(1/\sqrt{K})$ instead. Stepping back, what Professor Abu-Mostafa is saying here is that we can expect the cross validation error to be reasonably close to the out-of-sample error. How close exactly? Well as we increase the size $K$ of our validation set, we can expect the gap between the validation error and the out-of-sample error to be on the order of $1/\sqrt{K}$.
