Which neural network model to choose between different iterations?

I was running an experiment with neural networks and I could see that training the neural network model with the same input give different results on the test. This should be due to the different weight initializations. The question is how to choose a model from these iterations. Do we need to take the average of results or the best result or the take the average of weights and then retrain and get a single result?
