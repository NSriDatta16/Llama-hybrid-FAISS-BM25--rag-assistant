From the docs: "the default value is NO, which means that scrolling is permitted in both horizontal and vertical directions. If the value is YES and the user begins dragging in one general direction (horizontally or vertically), the scroll view disables scrolling in the other direction." I think the important part is "if... the user begins dragging in one general direction". So if they begin dragging diagonally this doesn't kick in. Not that these docs are always reliable when it comes to interpretation - but that does seem to fit with what you are seeing. This actually seems sensible. I have to ask - why do you want to restrict to only horizontal or only vertical at any time? Perhaps UIScrollView is not the tool for you?
