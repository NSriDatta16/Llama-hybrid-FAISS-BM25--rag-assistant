NotImplementedException from .NET's CustomLineCap constructor

I want to draw a custom line cap - a equilateral triangle with the radius r. Apparently I can't: Dim triangleSide As Single = CSng(3 * r / Math.Sqrt(3)) Dim triangleHeight As Single = CSng(3 * r / 2) path = New GraphicsPath() Dim points() As PointF = New PointF() { _ New PointF(-triangleSide / 2, 0), _ New PointF(triangleSide / 2, 0), _ New PointF(0, triangleHeight) } path.AddLines(points) ' Not Implemented Exception, Was is Das? ' _HlpCap = New CustomLineCap(path, Nothing) Do I something wrong or it's just a framework bug? EDIT: After Mark Cidade remark, I tried using (Nothing, path) and it helped, but I need to fill in the triangle, not only to stroke it out...
