How to use a different model to deep neural network with reinforcement learning based on DQN?

Is it possible to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm without using a deep neural network (DNN) as used in deep reinforcement learning e.g. Deep Q-Network (DQN)? How can I replace the DNN in the DQN algorithm with another algorithm? Should it be supervised or unsupervised, and what is this called - is it "un/supervised reinforcement learning" or "un/supervised DQN"? In the following DQN pseudo-code, if I want to replace a DNN section with another un/supervised algorithm, is it possible? If so, how?
