Most (if not all) logistic regression routines require the numerator and denominator to be integers, which I do not think is your case. The beta regression approach seems much more appropriate, though as you mention you will need to deal with the values that are greater than 1 since standard beta regression requires values in [0,1]. Is the precipitation amount used as both a predictor and as the denominator in your response variable (runoff ratio)? If so you may want to read: Spurious Correlation and the Fallacy of the Ratio Standard Revisited Richard A. Kronmal, 1993, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series A. Vol. 156, No. 3, 379-392. Which talks about how relationships can be distorted when ratios are used/misused. You may do better with a model that predicts just the numerator of your ratio.
