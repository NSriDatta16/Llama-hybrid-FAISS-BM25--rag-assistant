No. The simplest solution would be to use the svnperms.py script to handle this. The problem with svnperms.py is that you can't handle the situation to prevent seeing a folder (toto = ). Otherwise you have to handle it via copy&past. It might make your life easier if you change the organization to: +-- project1 +--- trunk +--- tags +--- branches +-- project2 +--- trunk +--- tags +--- branches But I don't know if this is an option.
