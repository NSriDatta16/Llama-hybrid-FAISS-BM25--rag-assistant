Approaching the limit in the .632 rule when n is unknown

This question relates to the ".632 rule" asked about in an earlier question here. My question is, assuming we have a process that approximates the random-sample-with-replacement for large (unknown) n contemplated by the rule, how can we measure our progress along the asymptotic curve toward $1/e?$ I had an inchoate idea, basically that we keep track of the frequency of previously noted marbles (so to speak) and use either the change in frequency over a given number of samples or use the absolute number ab initio as a measure of progress. The bottom line is a pragmatic determination of a point of diminishing return. Roughly speaking, if I am a biologist sampling a pond's population of rotifers, how do I know when I have seen about all I am likely to see? Thanks.
