Sharing code between projects without svn:externals

In order to simplify the build process, I've been trying to reorganize my version control repository. I am developing a simple client-server application. Following Rob Williams' advice , I have separated the client and the server into separate projects each with their own lifecycle. The problem though, is that client and server share some communication code. More specifically the client sends message objects that the server receives. Both projects are being developed in C++, and the message object headers are required for the client and server to compile. How should I go about sharing the message object headers between the two projects without using a version-control feature such as svn:externals?
