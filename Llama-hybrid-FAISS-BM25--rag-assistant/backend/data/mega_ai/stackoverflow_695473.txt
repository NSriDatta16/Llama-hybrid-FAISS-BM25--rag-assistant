I've written two commercial products that use an Access database, running from a network share, for typically up to 10 users. If you don't abuse it, there's really no problem; but as you can see many developers don't ever get there - and because of its low end nature, there are a lot of crappy hacks built on it. In the case of one product, I had to redesign the app because of all the problems described in detail by others; but after I cleaned it up, I never had a database integrity issue across hundreds of installations. Its one big advantage is the single file database, which is easy to back up, restore, and copy to your laptop to dissect. Pretty much all the alternatives, including sqlite (although some won't admit it), require some form of DBA attention now and then. In most cases, Access provides record locks, and file locks for some DDL (e.g. schema changes) by default. But Microsoft is basically obsoleting it, and some of your colleagues will heap scorn upon you for using it. (At this point I normally duck for cover and yell "INCOMING!!!".)
