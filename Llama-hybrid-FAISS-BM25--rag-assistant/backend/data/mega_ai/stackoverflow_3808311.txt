Is writing a cookie very slow in JS?

I need to make my website faster on the client side. I wonder if my excessive Javascript cookie manipulation could slow down the browser. It uses the harddrive, which is the slowest component of a computer. On a severely fragmented harddrive, could cookie manipulation freeze the browser? Is JS doing any optimizations for cookie writing/reading (caching, etc..). Could I exploit these optimizations to improve my site? Replacing client-side cookies with a server side database is out of the question because my servers are overloaded already.
