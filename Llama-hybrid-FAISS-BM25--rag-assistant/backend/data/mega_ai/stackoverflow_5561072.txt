UITextField scroll when keyboard present issue

I was following the code here #pragma mark UITextFieldDelegate - (BOOL)textFieldShouldReturn:(UITextField *)textField { [textField resignFirstResponder]; return YES; } -(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)sender { if ([sender isEqual:password]) { //move the main view, so that the keyboard does not hide it. if (self.view.frame.origin.y >= 0) { [self setViewMovedUp:YES]; } } } //method to move the view up/down whenever the keyboard is shown/dismissed -(void)setViewMovedUp:(BOOL)movedUp { [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:NULL]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.5]; // if you want to slide up the view CGRect rect = self.view.frame; if (movedUp) { // 1. move the view's origin up so that the text field that will be hidden come above the keyboard // 2. increase the size of the view so that the area behind the keyboard is covered up. rect.origin.y -= kOFFSET_FOR_KEYBOARD; rect.size.height += kOFFSET_FOR_KEYBOARD; } else { // revert back to the normal state. rect.origin.y += kOFFSET_FOR_KEYBOARD; rect.size.height -= kOFFSET_FOR_KEYBOARD; } self.view.frame = rect; [UIView commitAnimations]; } - (void)keyboardWillShow:(NSNotification *)notif { //keyboard will be shown now. depending for which textfield is active, move up or move down the view appropriately if ([password isFirstResponder] && self.view.frame.origin.y >= 0) { [self setViewMovedUp:YES]; } else if (![password isFirstResponder] && self.view.frame.origin.y It actually moves the view up when I tap on the password UITextField, however after I finish it did not scroll down again. What am I missing here?
