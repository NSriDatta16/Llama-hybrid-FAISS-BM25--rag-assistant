What's the best way to perform system tasks from Ruby on Rails?

I am building a small system administration web application (think Web-Min, but in RoR) and I need to be able to access system parameters from my Ruby code. For instance, I want to allow the user to change the hostname, time zone, or network config of the server. My current thoughts are to have a separate setuid script (Perl, Ruby, ??) so that I can call it from my RoR code and it will perform the actions. That is quite cumbersome and not very elegant. I'm a Ruby newbie and would like to know if there is a better way to accomplish this type of thing. Thanks!
