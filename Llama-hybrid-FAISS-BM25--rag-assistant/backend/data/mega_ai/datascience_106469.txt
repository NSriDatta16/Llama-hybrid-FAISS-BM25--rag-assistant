Why not rule-based semantic role labelling?

I have recently found some interest in automatic semantic role labelling . Most introductory texts (e.g. Jurafsky and Martin, 2008) present approaches based on supervised machine learning, often using FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998) and PropBank (Kingsbury & Palmer, 2002). Intuitively however, I would imagine that the same problem could be tackled with a grammar-based parser. Why is this not the case? Or rather, why would these supervised solutions be preferred? Thanks in advance. References Jurafsky, D., & Martin, J. H. (2009). Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition.
