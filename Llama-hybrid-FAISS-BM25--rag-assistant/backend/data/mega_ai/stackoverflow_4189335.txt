This is no different from what Mac OS X uses: typedef unsigned char uint8_t; What is your concern about the portability of unsigned char ? If the concern is that a char might not represent 8 bits of storage, then you can include a static assertion along the lines of: typedef int Assert8BitChar[(CHAR_BIT == 8)? 0 : -1]; This will cause compilation to error out when the assumption is violated.
