It's a dumb thing to shell out from your Perl program to run lwp-download , another Perl program. Just replace that call with the mirror API from LWP::Simple and you get decent error reporting, directly there in your program instead of messing with exit codes. Should you need even better/fine-grained error checking, mirror from LWP::UserAgent is available, too.
