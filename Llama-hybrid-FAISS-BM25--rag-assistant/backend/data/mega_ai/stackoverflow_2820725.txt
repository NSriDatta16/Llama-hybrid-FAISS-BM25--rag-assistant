Look at Deploy asp.net mvc beta to iis 6 causing 404's and http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2008/07/04/options-for-deploying-aspnet-mvc-to-iis-6/ . Do you have more URL in your application where POST are used? Are they work? Do you have more URLs without an extension like .aspx or .mvc? Are they work? UPDATED : I had a problem with different base/root parts of my URL in all JavaScripts like you. Because you use jqGrid, I think you have the same problem. If I publish my solution in a virtual directory on a Web Server, then all URLs which call my JavaScripts will be changed. So I give window.location.pathname and split it with '/' , then I find out a new rootPath corresponds to the new location. Such rebasing of URLs I placed in a function which I call inside of all JavaScripts of my solution. Hire is code fragment which works perfect on with my site: var pathArray = window.location.pathname.split( '/' ); var rootPath = ''; for (var i = 0; i The solution is not perfect, but it works. It can be that you should change this "rebasing" function to make it working with your side.
