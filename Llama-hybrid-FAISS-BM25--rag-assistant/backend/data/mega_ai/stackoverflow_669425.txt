Use the single data structure. Once you start encountering performance problems there are many solutions like you can partition your tables by website id also known as horizontal partitioning or you can also use replication. This all depends upon the the ratio of reads vs writes. But for start keep things simple and use one table with proper indexing. You can also determine if you need transactions or not. You can also take advantage of various different mysql storage engines like MyIsam or NDB (in memory clustering) to boost up the performance. Also caching plays a very good role in offloading the load from the database. The data that is mostly read only and can be computed easily is usually put in the cache and the cache serves the request instead of going to the database and only the necessary queries go to the database.
