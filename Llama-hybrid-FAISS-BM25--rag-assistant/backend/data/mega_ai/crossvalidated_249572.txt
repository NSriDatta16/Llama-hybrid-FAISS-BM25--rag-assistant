Filtering time series to forecast with specific error distribution

I have a time series of weather data (wind). I would like to create a signal from this time series such that the distribution of the difference between the two signals has very specific properties. (Mean of ~0, leptokurtic (excess kurt of ~1), and an RMSE between 10 and 20%. So far I'm using a low pass filter, but that does not give me control over the kurtosis. I was thinking of adding random noise, possibly random with a Laplace or Hyperbolic distribution to get the fat tails. But as wind can only have positive values, this is shifting the mean of the forecast signal. Any ideas how I should best proceed, preferably with methods available in Python or Matlab. Is it possible to specify these properties with ARIMA models?
