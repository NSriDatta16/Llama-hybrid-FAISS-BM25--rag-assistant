Causal inference for continuous exposures

I am new to causal inference world and want to find which is the correct statistical procedure that can be applied to my data. I found a number of predictors 1...n which are associated with a continuous outcome in a cross-sectional setting (N samples ~1000), both the predictors and the outcome being age-dependent and associated with some confounders (e.g., sex). For a subset of this sample (N samples ~250), I have both variables measured at two time-points (in average 5 years apart), and I want to identify predictors showing evidence for causal relationship. I am wondering what is the best way to tackle this problem. I came across the propensity score methods but, as far as I know, these methods have been mostly used for binary exposure variables. Thanks
