The problem that I am getting is when clicking on the paragraph tag will go to 'filter_marketing.php?page=' but will not work (i.e. displays nothing) since the 'var pageNum' is not defined. When trying the example page I just get correct page numbers, as shown by Firebug's Net panel. The strange thing I see is that results 10-12 are not shown, i.e. page 1 has results 1-9 and page 2 shows results 13-23 (you should really make it 10 or 20 results per page). Im just unsure how to make a button 'marketing' and clicking on it goes to the php page and gets the results in mysql db and displays it with the pagination. Where is 'marketing' in your source code ? Can you provide an example of this? I just don't understand this question. EDIT: I still don't understand this. #marketing hasn't been assigned an onclick-event. Moreover, I would use a button in a form like and attaching an onclick-event to it in your JavaScript. That function can call your PHP via AJAX or go to a different URL, returning false when successful to prevent the default action (or just let the button submit your form in the regular way).
