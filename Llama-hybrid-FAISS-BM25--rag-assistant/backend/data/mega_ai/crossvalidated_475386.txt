What does Penalize a learning algorithm mean in Machine Learning?

I am new to Machine Learning and have taken Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning. In one of the Logistic regression videos for binary classification for the error case where predicted value through logistic regression = 1 and actual value = 0 so error = 1. I didn't quite understand the statement " We'll have to penalize the learning algorithm by a very large cost". What does penalize a learning algorithm mean ?
