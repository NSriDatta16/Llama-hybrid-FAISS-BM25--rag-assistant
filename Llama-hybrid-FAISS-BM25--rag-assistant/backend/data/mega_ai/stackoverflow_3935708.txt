The answer really depends on many things. If you just want to find any subset and you're doing this only once, looping is just fine (and the best you can do without using additional storage) and you can stop when you find a single character that matches. If you have a fixed x and want to use it for matching several strings y , you can do some pre-processing to store the characters in x in a table and use this table to check if each character of y occurs in x or not. If you want to find the largest subset, then you're looking at a different problem: the longest common subsequence problem .
