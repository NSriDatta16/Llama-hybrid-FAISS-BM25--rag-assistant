It boils down to the business rules, really. If the behavior internal portfolios operates under a significantly different set of rules than mutual funds, then store them in separate tables and use views to combine them for reporting purposes. Both the internal fund table and the mutual fund table would have a foreign key pointing back to your customer table. If they're largely the same, the SEC views them similarly, etc., then I would use a design pattern similar to what a manufacturing organization would use for product assemblies & sub-assemblies (search for "Bill of Materials data model") or the single-table design pattern for Employees & their managers (where an employee's ManagerID is the EmployeeID of their Manager).
