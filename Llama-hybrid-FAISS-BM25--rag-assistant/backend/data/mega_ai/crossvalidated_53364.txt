Well, try virtually any book about Bayesian statistics. I haven't find one that doesn't have at least a few paragraphs debunking practice of significance testing. Really. And Gelman's books are good example of that. I used to remember relevant titles (I still remember my first one: E.T. Jaynes "Probability theory - the logic of science". Jaynes definitely wrote with passion, and the controversy over significance testing is something, that really made me do statistics professionally ;-) ), but soon I got overwhelmed by the abundance of literature on this topic. Try also the phrase +bayesian significance testing fisher in Google Scholar and I guarantee you will find at least dozen good references (and some interesting info too).
