What's the best way to organise FlexUnit 4 tests in FlexBuilder 3?

I've recently started practising test driven development - thus far I've been working on a library project, so I've organised my FlexUnit tests in a separate FlexBuilder 3 project, linking against my library's swc. Now I'm working on a web app and wondering how best to organise the tests for this. At the moment I've put them in a src/test package in the project I'm testing, with the test runner application at the same level as the default application. Is this the best way to do it, or should I have a separate test project and link in the source for the application I'm testing? Or something different? We don't automate tests at the moment, but this is something I would like to get working at some point, so a structure that would support that in the future would be helpful. I've had a look at http://docs.flexunit.org/index.php?title=Setting_up_a_FlexUnit_4_Project but this (and the other docs here) explains well how to organise your tests, but doesn't advise on where to sit the tests in relation to the project I'm testing. Thanks for any help, cheers, Ange
