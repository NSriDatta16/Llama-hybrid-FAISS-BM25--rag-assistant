If you're concerned about speed and don't want to care about file system storage, probably SQL is your best shot. You can optimize your table indexes but also will add another external dependency on your project. EDIT : Seems MySQL have an ARCHIVE Storage Engine : MySQL supports on-the-fly compression since version 5.0 with the ARCHIVE storage engine. Archive is a write-once, read-many storage engine, designed for historical data. It compresses data up to 90%. It does not support indexes. In version 5.1 Archive engine can be used with partitioning.
