How to filter items in a ListBox based on a searched string

I have a Windows Forms application (C#) containing a ListBox into which I have added some items (I'm not using a DataSource). I want to filter the items in the ListBox to show only items containing a string I'm searching for. I have done this by keeping a list of the original items and selecting matching items from that list each time the search string changes and updating the ListBox.Items Is there a more elegant/efficient way to do this?
