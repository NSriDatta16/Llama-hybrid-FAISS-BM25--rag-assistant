LightGBM and XGBoost Libraries can handle missing values LightGBM : will ignore missing values during a split, then allocate them to whichever side reduces the loss the most XGBoost : the instance is classified into a default direction (the optimal default directions are learnt from the data somehow) Finally, it is NOT a general property of gradient descent algorithms or tree algorithms. Only specific implementations of these algorithms have this property. Personally, I believe that LightGBM and XGBoost can handle missing values effectively, in case one wants to keep them
