I have built many data sets. The latest was a data set of species of birds. I has 100 species of birds so I had 100 classes. For each species (class) I had 100 training images, 5 test images and 5 validation images. Thats as total of 11,000 images.. The classifier I built had a final accuracy of 98% on 500 test images (5 test images per specie) Here are some things to consider in building your data set. 1- crop the data or not- depending on the images you generated via your cell phone what is on average the ratio of the pixels of the region of interest (example a milk bottle in the refrigerator) to the total pixels in the image. Your classifier will always work better when this ratio is high. You want your classifier to learn to recognize a milk bottle as a class.Any part of the image that is not a milk bottle is essentially noise. The rule of thumb I use to build a high quality data sets is 50%. That is that on average for your data set the region of interest should occupy 50% of the pixels in the image. 2- how many training- validation-test images should you have? depends on the problem but if you follow the 50% rule above I think you can build a solid data set with about 100 images per class, 5 validation images per class and 5 test images per class so you would need about 110 total images per class. 3- image augmentation - even with the small number of images you can create a good classifier using image augmentation. This is a way of artificially expanding the size of your data set. If you use Keras, the ImageDataGenerator provides several transforms that can be used to augment your data set. Documentation is at https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/ . 4-image size - CNN's operate with a fixed size for all input images. Again in general the larger the image the better the result(assuming the 50% rule is used). However you pay a price for large images in terms of computation time and memory usage. I have consistently used 224 X 224 X 3 (color images). Depending on the importance of color(ie how important is color to discriminating between classes) you may be able to just use gray scale images 224 X 224 X 1. 5- avoiding BIAS in your data set - make it diverse as possible. It is easy to accidentally build an unintentioned BIAS in your data set. Here is an example. A guy created a data set with 2 classes. One set had images was of various kinds of dogs. The other set had only images of wolves. He wanted to build a classifier that if given an image would classify it as either a dog or a wolf. He built his data set and trained the classifier with great results 99% training accuracy 98% validation accuracy. That is a surprising result since a lot of dogs very closely resemble a wolf. But when random images of a dog or a wolf were presented the accuracy was essentially 50%. WHy? Well he built a big bias in his data set. 90% of the training and validation images for wolves had a white background of snow. Since he did not crop the images most of the image was white. For the dogs his images were mostly of dogs NOT in snow. So what the CNN learned was "if background is white must be a wolf, if background is not white must be a dog. So think about avoiding building an unintentional bias in your data set. In your case say you have a class ketchup bottle. Now if all you take are images of HEINZ ketchup bottles (probably with the text HEINZ on the label) your model will not know anything about ketchup bottles that aren't Heinz ketchup bottles. Good luck I hope your task works out well. One more thing, why are you considering doing all the work of taking cell phone images? Why not just do a Google search for the items of interest and download the images. For example do a search for "ketchup bottle images" You will find hundreds of images (with diversity which is important) that you can just download.
