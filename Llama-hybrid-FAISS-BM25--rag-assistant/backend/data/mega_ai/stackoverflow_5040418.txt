Magento - batch import error

I am currently creating a batch script that will import products into a particular category. I am however, receiving an error in the output: exception 'PDOException' with message 'SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry '51-1' for key 'IDX_STOCK_PRODUCT'' This seems to insert the first record in my CSV file, but then fails on the next one. Has something gone wrong with my database, or is this an issue with my script? Thanks
