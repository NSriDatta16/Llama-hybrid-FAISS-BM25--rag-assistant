How to simulate two correlated AR(1) time series?

Is it possible to simulate two time series AR(1) for example 0.5 and 0.8 and at the same time these time series to be correlated with $\rho = 0.8$ using R? ts.sim I am not sure if yt and ts.sim or yt2 and ts.sim2 are indeed correlated. Note that ts.sim and ts.sim2 are slighty different approaches of the same idea. Just wanted to see if the results would be different.
