There are two approaches: if your session is Serializable (as should be), there are some tools that calculate the length of the serialized version of the Session object. e.g. LambdaProbe for Apache Tomcat if your session is not Serializable, then it's harder. The solution we've taken is to follow the sizeofagent technique . It makes use of the [Instrumentation.getObjectSize() method]( http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/Instrumentation.html#getObjectSize(java.lang.Object)) . It requires you to start the JVM with special agent: java -javaagent:sizeofag.jar
