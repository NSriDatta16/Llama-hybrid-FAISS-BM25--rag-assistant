Time Series Prediction via Neural Networks

I have been working on Neural Networks for various purposes lately. I have had great success in digit recognition, XOR, and various other easy/hello world'ish applications. I would like to tackle the domain of time series estimation. I do not have a University account at the moment to read all the IEEE/ACM papers on the topic (for free), nor can I find many resources detailing using ANN for time series forcasting. I would like to know if anyone has any suggestions or can recommend any resources concerning using ANN for forcasting via time series data? I would assume that to train the NN, you would insert a few immediately time steps and the expected output would be the next timestep (example: inputs of n-5, n-4, n-3, n-2, n-1 should come out with an output of result at timestep N. ... and slide down some amount of timesteps and do it all again. Can anyone confirm this or comment on it? I would appreciate it!
