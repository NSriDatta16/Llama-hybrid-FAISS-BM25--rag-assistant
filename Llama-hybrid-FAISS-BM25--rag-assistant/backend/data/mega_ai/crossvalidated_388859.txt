Is it possible to give variable sized images as input to a convolutional neural network?

Can we give images with variable size as input to a convolutional neural network for object detection? If possible, how can we do that? But if we try to crop the image, we will be loosing some portion of the image and if we try to resize, then, the clarity of the image will be lost. Does it mean that using inherent network property is the best if image clarity is the main point of consideration?
