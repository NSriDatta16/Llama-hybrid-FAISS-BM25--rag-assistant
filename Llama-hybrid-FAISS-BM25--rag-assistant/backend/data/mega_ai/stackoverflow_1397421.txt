The best way that I have found to solve this problem is by abstracting the logic in your application layer, and not the persistence layer. One of the cleanest/simplest ways I've seen this done is by passing the user's data in a value object (creating a common interface that's easy to validate against) to a validator with the current country code, which makes sure all the required attributes are set properly in the value object for that locale. Assuming it passes validation, pass the value object along to the persistence side of your application for storage. The key here is the value object - you're creating a common interface that multiple pieces of your application can talk to, validate, and read/write from. You can then also use that same value object when displaying the address: have your persistence layer get the information, put it in the value object, pass it to a factory with the current locale which returns the desired address format, and send that output to the front end.
