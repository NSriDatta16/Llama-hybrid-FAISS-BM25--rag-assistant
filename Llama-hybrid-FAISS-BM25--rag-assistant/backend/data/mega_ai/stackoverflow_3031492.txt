[java bean]hibernate Session breaks a java bean?

i have a simple JPanel bean in my projects, now i want to drag my panel bean class into my jframe. My panel bean class is like this: public class BeanPanel extends javax.swing.JPanel { /** Creates new form BeanPanel */ public BeanPanel () { initComponents(); Session session=HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession(); } This code seem to break the bean: Session session=HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession(); When i try to drag the class into my JFrame bean i had this error message: This component cannot be instantiated. Please make sure it is a JavaBeans Component If i comment it all works fine. What is the reason of this? Thanks.
