Am I supposed to be able to detect multi-finger taps this way?

This is the touchesBegan method for a view that has multiple touches enabled. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch* touch = [touches anyObject]; if ([touches count] > 1) NSLog(@"multi touches: %d fingers", [touches count]); NSUInteger numTaps = [touch tapCount]; if (numTaps == 1) { NSLog(@"single tap"); } else { NSLog(@"multi tap: %d", numTaps); } } I never seem to log a multi-touch. Just single and double taps. Am I wrong to have assumed it was as easy as getting the count for touches?
