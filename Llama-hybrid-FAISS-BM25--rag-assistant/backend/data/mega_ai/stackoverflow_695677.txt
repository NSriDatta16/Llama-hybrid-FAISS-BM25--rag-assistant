You could always consider embedding a dynamic language runtime in your application. The Lua core is not large at all, provides data types that meet your requirements, is open source, and MIT licensed so it is compatible with both FOSS and commercial projects. You wouldn't necessarily need to use code written in Lua to benefit, as its C API provides complete access to its data types and their values. However, you could later move some of the logic of your application into Lua, for the improved clarity of expression and other benefits of coding in a dynamic language with functions as first-class values.
