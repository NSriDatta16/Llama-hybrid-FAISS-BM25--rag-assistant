In short, yes, it happens due to the "variation" that you defined. The reason behind the model not converging is that your classes themselves have become something that has no characteristic features as there are objects of many different ImageNet classes in each of them, as you mentioned previously. Imagine some heaps of pictures (initial classes) on the floor (feature space). All of these classes have their center (average representation) close to the majority of pictures. The model basically distinguishes between the classes based on these averages. In your case, the heaps are mixed and separated on new heaps more or less arbitrarily. This shifts the initial centers closer to each other, making the new classes nearly indistinguishable from one another. That's why the model is not able to reach any meaningful results.
