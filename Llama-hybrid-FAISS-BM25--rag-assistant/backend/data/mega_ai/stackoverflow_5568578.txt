jQuery drag&drop: cloned draggable moves original

I've got a problem with Drag & Drop in jQuery. In my code there is a draggable div. When I move it to a certain droppable table cell, a clone of the div is appended to the table cell. But when I drag the clone, the original div is moved instead. This here is the function called on drop: function(event, ui) { var draggable = ui.draggable.clone(true); // cloning including attrs and children draggable.draggable(); // this is something I tried with no effect $(this).empty(); // empty the droppable cell $(this).append(draggable); // append the div to the cell } I couldn't find a clear answer by Googling. I don't know if it's got anything to do with this, but the div has a relative position (and needs to stay that way). How do I make sure the clone can be dragged just like its original?
