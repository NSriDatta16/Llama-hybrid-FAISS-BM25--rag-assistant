ggpredict random intercept logistic model: What does `ggpredict` actually predict? What does the manual mean by "population-level"?

In R, function ggpredict can be used to generate model-predicted values for a random-effect model, like a random intercept logistic regression model. For such model, ggpredict offers two possibilities, type="fixed" and type="random" . About the default type="fixed" , the manual says: Predicted values are conditioned on the fixed effects or conditional model only (for mixed models: predicted values are on the population-level and confidence intervals are returned). My question is about the last part of the above sentence, between the brackets: "on the population-level" sounds like "population averaged predictions", like gee-models produce. However, using gee (with an exchangeable correlation structure) to estimate my logistic model, leads to different predicted probabilities than those obtained from ggpredict . Furthermore, the predicted probabilities obtained with ggpredict are highly similar (up to 4 or 5 decimals) to those calculated "by hand" (based on results of glmer in R), for a respondent having an average intercept. So the predicted probabilities from ggpredict seem to be subject-specific rather than population-averaged. Do you have an idea what ggpredict actually does predict, or what the manual may mean with "population-level"?
