I would suggest looking at this IEBlog post , which describes how you do font embedding on IE. No, that doesn't match the CSS3 way, and no, you don't have any other way to do it in IE using @font-face. It might be worth noting that Microsoft submitted the EOT approach to the W3C in a move to get it standardized, and W3C has expressed interest in that course of action.
