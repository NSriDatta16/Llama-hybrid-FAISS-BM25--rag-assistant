What do you mean by a "better" model? How to measure a model depends both on the type of model and what you want to improve, but, e.g. for a OLS regression you could use $R^2$. There are pseudo $R^2$ measures for some other models. You could look at the differences (measured in various ways) between the predicted and actual values. For logistic regression there are sensitivity and specificity. etc. Fishing around for a transformation that improves the model (however that is measured) is kind of fishy. You should transform your data based on a) Interpretative sense and b) Model assumptions. What you are proposing is likely to be too dependent on the particular set of data, and also likely to be a model that is hard to interpret (e.g. the .314 power of a variable is not going to mean much). If you really want to do this, you should at least separate your data into training and test sets, and report fit only for the test set.
