Dropping a file into a normal input field will copy the local path to the image into the input field, however this is worthless to you since the .value property of an tag is readonly for security reasons. You will notice that gmail only allows you to drag / drop an image (for upload) to the input and not any other field. I think what you want to ask is "how do I style a tag like google" , which is a whole other topic. EDIT: Ok in IE you cannot drag a file into a tag
