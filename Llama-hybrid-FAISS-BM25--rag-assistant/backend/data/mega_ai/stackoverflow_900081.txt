Resize Flex/Flash object from the left side?

I'm working on Flex component which can be resized using handles on the right and left (that is, if you click and drag the left side, the component will grow to the left, if you click and drag on the right, it will grow to the right). Right now I am using: var oldX:Number = this.x; this.x = event.stageX + (initial.x - initial.stageX); // Move the left edge to the left this.width += oldX - this.x; // Increase the width to compensate for the move to the left But that makes the right side jump around, and generally looks ugly. What is the "right" to do this? Is there something fundamental I've gotten wrong? Thanks! Edit : The jitter occurs on the right side of the component. When I set this.x , the component moves to the left, the screen redraws, then the width is updated, and the screen redraws again.
