ADF test for Unit Root, should you select a trend if the trend changes once?

Let's say you have a variable with a time series going back ten years. In the first 5 years, it clearly trends from 5 to 10. And, in the next 5 years, it trends downward from 10 back down to 5. When you test it for Unit Root using either Dickey-Fuller or the ADF test, should you use the ADF test with a trend or not?
