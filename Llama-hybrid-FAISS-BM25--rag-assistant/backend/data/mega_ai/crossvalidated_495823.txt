Residual diagnostics in DHARMa for multilevel logistic regression

I'm running a multilevel logistic regression, and have been trying to look at residual diagnostics using the DHARMa package. My data is copy-pastable from here and the following code should run everything. library(lme4) library(DHARMa) m1 $year, xlab = "Year", main=NULL) plotResiduals(simulationOutput, data$ statistic, xlab = "Statistic Type", main=NULL) plotResiduals(simulationOutput, data $categorisation, xlab = "Category 1 or Category 2", main=NULL) plotResiduals(simulationOutput, data$ journalID, xlab = "Journal ID", main=NULL) # Plotting standardized residuals against the predicted value plotResiduals(simulationOutput, main=NULL) plotResiduals(simulationOutput, fitted(m1), xlab = "fitted(m1)") The following is the main residual plot function. There follow plots of standardized residuals against my continuous predictor Year, a nominal factor with 4 levels (Statistic), and against the binary predictor Category. There follows the default DHARMa plot of residuals against the predicted values. I also tried to plot the residuals against fitted(m1) , excepting that they would be the same thing. However, they aren't. My questions are: Why can't I plot the residuals against the predictor I modelled as a random effect (journalID). When I try to do it I get the error message Error in plot.window(...) : need finite 'xlim' values . Why is it that my two different ways of standardized residuals against the predicted value, plotResiduals(simulationOutput, main=NULL) , and plotResiduals(simulationOutput, fitted(m1), xlab = "fitted(m1)") , give slightly different results. Aren't they the same thing? The plot for my predictor statistic lists the levels of that factor as 1-4, while the actual names of the levels of that factor are "F", "chi","t","r". How can I work out which number maps onto which level of the factor? Do my residuals look OK? Is there anything further I should be testing in relation to them?
