Should I build my site using ASP.NET to leverage my C# knowledge or should I learn PHP and use that because of the cost?

I'm a C# programmer and I love the language. I think it's the best thing since sliced bread. Recently I have become real interested in creating a website that offers jobs and allows companies to post jobs for people to navigate through. This is going to be a nationwide site only, no international connections. I'm somewhat familiar with ASP.NET (I've used it before for a much smaller pet project) but I wouldn't say I'm more than a Newb - Journeyman - Novice - Experienced - Expert I have absolutely zero experience hosting a website or even registering a domain. I'm familiar with HTML and making applications in XAML for WPF has given me a much easier time understand things that laid out in markup. Is ASP.NET hosting expensive? Is PHP cheaper? I just need a little guidance. :) Should I use ASP.NET or PHP?
