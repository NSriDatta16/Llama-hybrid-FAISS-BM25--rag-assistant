Problem with Trigger in SQL Server 2005

I am having a problem with a trigger in SQL Server 2005, I have created the trigger and I have tested it inserting rows manually and it works fine that way, however I call a Stored Procedure from a c# web application and the triggers does not get fired, so I took same data inserted from the web application, deleted that row and reinserted it manually and the trigger worked that way again but it does not when called from the stored procedure from the web application. Any advice? Thanks in advance. Albert
