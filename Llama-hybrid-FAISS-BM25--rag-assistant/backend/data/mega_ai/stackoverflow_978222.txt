OpenMp C++ algorithms for min, max, median, average

I was searching Google for a page offering some simple OpenMp algorithms. Probably there is an example to calculate min, max, median, average from a huge data array but I am not capable to find it. At least I would normally try to divide the array into one chunk for each core and do some boundary calculation afterwards to get the result for the complete array. I just didn't want to reinvent the wheel. Additional Remark: I know that there are thousands of examples that work with simple reduction. e.g. Calculating PI. const int num_steps = 100000; double x, sum = 0.0; const double step = 1.0/double(num_steps); #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum) private(x) for (int i=1;i but when these kind of algorithms aren't usable there are almost no examples left for reducing algorithms.
