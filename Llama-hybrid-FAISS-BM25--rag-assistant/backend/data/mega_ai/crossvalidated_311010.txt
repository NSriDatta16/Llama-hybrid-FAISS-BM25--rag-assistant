The link ( http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/141085 ) provided in the comments give great insight. In this post I place some additions and specific comments on the particular biplot function used I especially recommend you to look at the documentation of the biplot function (in a R console type " ?biplot.princomp "). In that documentation you will read that the biplot is based on: Gabriel, K. R. (1971). The biplot graphical display of matrices with applications to principal component analysis. Biometrika , 58 , 453â€“467. link Also the documentation explains you that there are several options to alter the appearance of the plot. For instance your question 1 "Is the upper axis bound to PC1, and the right axis to PC2?" relates to the 'choices' parameter in the function. You can choose different PCs to be on the x and y axis. As well it is worthwhile to look at the source code of the biplot: > getS3method("biplot","prcomp") function (x, choices = 1L:2L, scale = 1, pc.biplot = FALSE, ...) { if (length(choices) != 2L) stop("length of choices must be 2") if (!length(scores 1) warning("'scale' is outside [0, 1]") if (scale != 0) lam with this source code you won't have any confusion about what type of scaling is used (e.g., see that a factor $\sqrt{n}$ is used instead of $\sqrt{n-1}$, the latter being mentioned in an answer to the earlier mentioned question) Also this scaling stuff answers your question 3. The princomp scales everything by the standard deviation. And the biplot does another scaling with $\sqrt{50}$ as well as the eigenvalues $\lambda$. The 2d (bi-)plots are essentially projections of multidimensional data. I always believe that a 3d view of PCA is a great help to understand that, and I hope that the following two images may provide you some additional insight for you. While your data is 4d I took the liberty to eliminate 1 of your variables in order to make the plotting possible. You will have to try to extend this idea to some imagination of a higher order dimensional space. The biplot: pok You should try to see for yourself whether you can recognize the 2d-biplot in the 3d-image. Note in the 3d image how the points as well as axes(attack, defense, speed) are projected onto the plane spanned by the PC1 and PC2 vectors. points as well as axes (Geometrically a biplot is this two-times projection, showing two things together: the transformed vectors, loadings, as well as the transformed points, scores. Algebraically the biplot is the dual representation of the singular value decomposition matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$, ands scaled versions thereof. in the 3d image the scales do not match the same as the scales in the 2d image. That's because in the 3d image we project both loadings and scores on the same plane, with the same scale in 3d (and we adjust the scales on the edges of the 2d plane), and in the 2d images those scales are placed on different axes allowing to stretch them such that the min and max of the scales coincide$ codeblock for animation (excuse for the dirty writing with little spaces etcetera): # centering and scaling pokt
