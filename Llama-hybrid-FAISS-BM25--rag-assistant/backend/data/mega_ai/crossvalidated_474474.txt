brms intercept only model runs very slow

I am trying to learn brms package for multilevel modeling. A reproducible code is as below: library(MCMCglmm) library(nlme) library(lme4) library(brms) data(MathAchieve,package='nlme') data(MathAchSchool,package='nlme') dat=merge(MathAchSchool,MathAchieve,by='School') str(dat) set.seed(23429989) m1=brm(MathAch~1+(1|School),dat) m2=lmer(MathAch~1+(1|School),dat) system.time(lmer(MathAch~1+(1|School),dat)) user system elapsed 0.054 0.002 0.056 system.time(brm(MathAch~1+(1|School),dat)) user system elapsed 124.646 5.787 143.627 While the model seems run properly, it runs much slower than a frequentist MLM model (e.g., using lmer()) even for an intercept-only model. What did I miss? Thank you very much.
