If you are only interested in the well set up reputable bots e.g. Google, Yahoo, MSN/Live/Bing/whatever-it-is-today, Ask etc then you can use round trip DNS checking. 1) Check for known user agent (look for known substring such as googlebot) e.g. Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; + http://www.google.com/bot.html 2) Do a reverse DNS for the requesting IP and check that it comes from a reasonable domain. e.g. rdns of 66.249.71.202 is crawl-66-249-71-202.googlebot.com (so happy that it comes from googlebot.com) 3) On it's own step 2 can be faked, so now check the dns of the A record for the result returned in step 2 and ensure you have the original requesting IP. e.g. dns for above is crawl-66-249-71-202.googlebot.com. A 66.249.71.202 66.249.71.202 was the requesting IP address so this is a valid googlebot.
