Does cucumber do away with the need to write unit tests?

I am a little confused by the sheer number of testing frameworks available for Ruby/ROR. I have recently watched the Cucumber Railscasts and found them very interesting. So I started having a play and then struggled to see conceptually where I would put various tests. It would seem to be quite possible to do everything that can be done in unit tests within Cucumber, so do I need to write unit tests or should I just write my feature definitions and concentrate on providing as good a coverage as I can get using that. Should I create my Unit tests using Rspec or Test:Unit? When I'm testing Ajax functionality should I use Selenium or Watir? There seem to be so many options here I am struggling to see which tools to use and where the boundaries are. What are other peoples experiences of Cucumber and where to draw the line between writing Cucumber Integration tests and Test:Unit and/or Rspec based unit and functional tests. Is anyone aware of a good write-up on this subject suggesting where to draw lines between testing methods and the strengths and weaknesses of the various tool. I appreciate that some of this is subjective but common approaches on how to attack this issue would be welcomed.
