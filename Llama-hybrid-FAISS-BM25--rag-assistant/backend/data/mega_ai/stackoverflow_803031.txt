That depends on the storage engine you're going to use and what's the read/write ratio. InnoDB will be better if there are lot of writes. If it's reads with very occasional write, MyISAM might be faster. MyISAM uses table level locking , so it locks up whole table whenever you need to update. InnoDB uses row level locking , so you can have concurrent updates on different rows. InnoDB is definitely safer, so I'd stick with it anyhow. BTW. remember that right now RAM is very cheap, so buy a lot.
