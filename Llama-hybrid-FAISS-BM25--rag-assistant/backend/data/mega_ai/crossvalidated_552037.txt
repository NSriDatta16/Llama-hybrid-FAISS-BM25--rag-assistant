Using an unbiased estimate $\hat\pi(\phi)$ of the target density $\pi(\phi)$ in a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is called the pseudo-marginal Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm , first introduced by Beaumont (Genetics, 2003) and later extended by Andrieu and Roberts (Annals of Statistics, 2009). It is validated by treating $\hat\pi(\phi)$ as an auxiliary variable.
