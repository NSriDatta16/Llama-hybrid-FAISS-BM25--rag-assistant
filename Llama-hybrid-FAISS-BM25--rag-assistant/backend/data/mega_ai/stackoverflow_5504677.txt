is this way valid for you?: $(function(){ var sHtmlText = $('body').html(); sHtmlText = sHtmlText.replace(/shoe/g, " "); $('body').html(sHtmlText); }) Explain: just get the full raw html in a string variable, and apply directly the replace statement and put the correct string again on body tag. i think that you dont need to split and iterate all the possible words in the html. if you can do this dynamically on the server side, i think that is better and you could prevent some kind of plage flicking or strage behaviours on this way!!
