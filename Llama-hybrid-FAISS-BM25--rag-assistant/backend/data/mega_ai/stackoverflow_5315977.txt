Simply check the touch event x and y coordinate, and check if this x,y-combination is within the box's bounds. I can see you are on the right path by looking at your commented out code. Do something like this: RectF rect = new RectF(x,y, x + box.getWidth(), y+box.geHeight()); if(rect.contains(touchX, touchY)) { // You hit the box, allow dragging... }
