Spring MVC comes with (very) useful velocimacros (see Spring MVC documentation ). One of them is #springMessageText. In your hello.vm file: #springMessageText("hi.message", "Hello Default!") This macro will read the message from your message sources, depending on the current locale (using the built-in ResourceBundleMessageSource from Spring). messages_fr_FR.properties hi.message=Bonjour messages_en_GB.propertie hi.message=Hello If no bundle is available for the current locale, the default message "Hello Default!" is used. By default, Spring is reading messages*.properties files. But you can specify more message sources in your servlet.xml configuration (here, messages*.properties and othermessages*.properties): messages othermessages How does SpringMVC knows about the current locale? Well, it's all built-in SpringMVC. The ResourceBundleMessageSource reads keys according to the Locale. I think a LocaleResolver is configured by default (using the locale sent along the client request), but you can register your own localeResolver . I encourage you to check all the available springmvc velocimacros and velocity tools (very useful!).
