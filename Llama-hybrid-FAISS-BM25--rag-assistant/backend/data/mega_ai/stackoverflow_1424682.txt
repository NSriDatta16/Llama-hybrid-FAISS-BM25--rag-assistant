It's tough to ask people "given x would you buy it for $y" and draw a real conclusion unless they are actually buying it for $y. People tend to answer "Yes" more easily when no real money is involved and no consequences are faced. It could be a gauge but don't overemphasize it. Networking is definitely a key...a few types of relationships we seek at tradeshows: Potential customers who could provide honest and direct feedback Potential partners to integrate into system or exchange data with Industry insiders who are excited about your product who could potentially be a sales rep or pay-per-lead Industry organizations and associations to partner with (creating content for, discount programs, etc)
