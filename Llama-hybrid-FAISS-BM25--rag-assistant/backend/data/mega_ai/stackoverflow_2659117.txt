Why are you using floats? Combinations only deal with integers... Use a formula that doesn't involve floating point arithmetic. No matter what happens, a recursive call is being made. This means that you will have infinite recursion. This is why the segmentation fault happens. I suggest you read the link I gave you and implement your program using one of the formulas given there. Pay attention to the base cases.
