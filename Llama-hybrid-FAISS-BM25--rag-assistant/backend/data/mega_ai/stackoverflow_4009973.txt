For the output parameters, you should access the returned data using Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi . Since the original memory was allocated within the unmanaged API, it's still your responsibility to free it as appropriate. I also think that you should use String on both the first two parameters, not sure why the first one is an IntPtr ?
