Add scheme to URL if needed

To create a Uri from a string you can do this: Uri u = new Uri("example.com"); But the problem is if the string (like the one above) doesn't contain the protocol you will get an exception: " Invalid URI: The format of the URI could not be determined. " To avoid the exception you should secure the string includes a protocol, like below: Uri u = new Uri("http://example.com"); But if you take the url as input, how can you add the protocol if it's missing? I mean apart from some IndexOf/Substring manipulation? Something elegant and fast?
