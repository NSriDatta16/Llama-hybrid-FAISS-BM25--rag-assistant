$\bar{X}$ is defined as $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$, your definition misses an average, and summation should start at $i=1$. $\mu$ is the population mean, not the sample mean ($\bar{X}$ is). Likewise, $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation. The crucial difference to the LLN is that the difference between $\bar{X}$ and $\mu$ (which indeed vanishes by the LLN) is scaled by $\sqrt{n}$, which diverges. So rewrite (1) as $\sqrt{n}(\bar{X}-\mu)/\sigma$, and it turns out (a proper proof would be too long here) that this product of two things, one of which tends to 0 and the other to infinity indeed (under suitable assumptions) still has a distribution asymptotically.
