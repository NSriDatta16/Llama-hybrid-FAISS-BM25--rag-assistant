You could do transfer learning , i.e., train a neural network (NN) architecture on dataset $A$ , and then use a similar NN architecture to continue learning on dataset $B$ . For instance, you may want to remove the input and final nodes of the NN trained on $A$ and replace them with new (untrained) units and weights to continue training on $B$ . Note, however, that if you don't have a huge dataset, an NN may not be your best bet. You may want to consider simpler models at first such as a Linear Regression, a regression SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forests, etc.
