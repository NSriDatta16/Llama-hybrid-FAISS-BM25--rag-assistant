Whether or not you use LINQ-to-SQL, it is often cmomon to use a separate DTO object for things like WCF. I have cited a few thoughts on this subject here: Pragmatic LINQ - but for me, the biggest is: don't expose IQueryable / Expression on the repository interface. If you do, your repository is no longer a black box, and cannot be tested in isolation, since it is at the whim of the caller. Likewise, you can't profile/optimise the DAL in isolation. A bigger problem is the fact that IQueryable leaks ( LOLA ). For example, Entity Framework doesn't like Single() , or Take() without an explicit OrderBy() - but L2S is fine with that. L2S should be an implementation detail of the DAL - it shouldn't define the repository. For similar reasons, I mark the L2S association properties as internal - I can use them in the DAL to create interesting queries, but...
