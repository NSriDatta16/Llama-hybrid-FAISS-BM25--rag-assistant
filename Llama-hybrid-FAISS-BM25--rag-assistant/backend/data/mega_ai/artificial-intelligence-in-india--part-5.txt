 with Shrijan. In November 2024, the Karnataka government approved a ₹28 crore investment to construct a Center of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence in Bengaluru. From 2025 to 2027, Microsoft to invest ₹25,000 crore (US$3.0 billion) on cloud and AI infrastructure. The construction of a 3 GW data center for AI services in Jamnagar was announced by Reliance Industries in 2025. On 12 June 2025, India's first locally developed, multilingual agentic AI, Kruti, was introduced by Ola Krutrim. National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems The mission which has a five-year budget of ₹3,660 crore, was authorized by the Union Cabinet in December 2018 under the Department of Science and Technology. A technological vertical in AI and ML, IoT, data bank and DaaS, data analysis, autonomous systems and robotics, cyber security, and quantum engineering has been assigned to each of the 25 technological innovation hubs that have been formed. To translate academic research on AI at the proof-of-concept stage into commercially viable goods and services, IIT Kharagpur established the AI4ICPS Innovation Hub Foundation in 2020. Under the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (NM-ICPS), the Department of Science and Technology awarded it a grant of ₹170 crore. With a seed money of ₹230 crore from the Department of Science and Technology and the Government of Karnataka, an Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Technology Park was established at the Indian Institute of Science as not-for-profit foundation in November 2020 for mission-mode research and development projects in cyber-security, healthcare, education, mobility, infrastructure, agriculture, and retail. TiHAN at IIT Hyderabad hosted India's first Autonomous Navigations Testbed Facility (Aerial & Terrestrial) in 2022, which was opened by Jitendra Singh Rana from Ministry of Science and Technology to develop next-generation autonomous navigation technology. To develop spectral and energy-efficient wireless communications technology for 5G and 5G-Advanced, Kiran Kumar Kuchi of IIT Hyderabad and IIITB Comet Foundation in 2024 developed an O-RAN base station solution that triples capacity and improves cell coverage when compared to 4G networks. Technology Innovation Hubs Legislation India currently does not have specific laws regulating artificial intelligence (AI). However, the Indian government has introduced several initiatives and guidelines aimed at the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. The Indian government has tasked NITI Aayog, its apex public policy think tank, with establishing guidelines and policies for AI. In 2018, NITI Aayog released the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, also known as #AIForAll, which focuses on healthcare, agriculture, education, smart cities, and smart mobility. In 2021, NITI Aayog published the "Principles for Responsible AI," addressing ethical considerations for AI deployment in India. These principles cover system considerations, such as decision-making and accountability, and societal considerations, such as the impact of automation on employment. The second part of this document, "Operationalizing Principles for Responsible AI," released in August 2021, focuses on implementing these ethical principles through regulatory and policy interventions, capacity building, and incentivizing ethical practices. In 2023, the Indian government enacted the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, which addresses some privacy concerns related to AI platforms. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has also issued advisories requiring platforms to obtain explicit permission before deploying unreliable AI models and to label AI-generated content to prevent misuse. India is a member of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI), which promotes the responsible use of AI through international collaboration. In 2023, the GPAI Summit was held in New Delhi, where experts
