Which CFA model is the best fit in my translation & validation study?

I have translated and adapted a questionnaire (based on a 5 factor model; 23 items) into my native language by following ITC and MAPI guidelines. Forward / backward translation, expert panel review, cognitive debriefing followed review again and pilot testing with bilingual sample. Initially I collected data from a sample 150 students (9-13 years old) and ran a PCA with varimax rotation. It yielded an unclear picture. Later I found a significant Shapiro-Wilk value indicating distribution was non normal. Based on these findings and considering the correlation among latent variables, I computed an EFA on same data using principal axis factoring with promax rotation. It provided a clearer picture than other methods. The factor matrix provided a 2 factor solution and the pattern matrix yielded 5 factors; two of which had 2 items each, and the other two had 8 and 5 items respectively. All items had reliabilities of more than .60. Four items were not loaded on a distinct factor. Thus, I retained 19 items. I collected another sample for main study afterwards (N = 672), and conducted CFA. I tried three models: Original 5 factor model: CMIN=414.77, DF= 199 (p It was apparently a good model fit yet two of the factors showed poor reliabilities (less than .55). A two factor model (which is mostly retained in other translations of this scale (i.e., Italian); and is supported by the factor matrix in our previous study). Values were: CMIN=467.28, DF= 208 (p Based on the pattern matrix of principal axis factoring, rotated solution, we ran another model (4 factor) resulting in good fit indices similar to model 1 values crossed .90 with RMSEA .04. Yet again, only 2 factors had better reliabilities. However, factor 2 and 4 covariance was .94 so I later merged these factors into one and eliminated items on factor 3 (that emerged as F2 in the previous model) because it always yielded low reliability (.55-.57, etc.) and was based on reverse scored items. The analysis was rerun. This time it provided an even better fit with values up to .93 and .94 for NFI, and CFI; RMSEA= .05. However covariance between these two factors was still high (.84). Did I follow the right track or I should have tested the model obtained from EFA only? Should I converge the two factors and try a unidimensional model or should I compute EFA once again?
