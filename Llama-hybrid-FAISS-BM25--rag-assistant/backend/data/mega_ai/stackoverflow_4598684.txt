I still see this problem. I am using IE 8, and the problem is there. @treeface, are you using build 8.0.6001.18702 ? @Šime, you don't see the problem anymore in IE8? I was the one who originaly brought this to Šime's attention, and as such, I'd like to re-open this question, to perhaps find out why my Internet Explorer is having this issue, while it seems that noone else's is? So really , you all are not having this issue? According to my IE Developer bar, this problem exists for me in Browser Mode: IE8, IE7, and IE8 Compatibility view. Also tested with the different Document Modes(IE7 Standards, IE8 Standards, Quirks Mode), but all give the same bug.
