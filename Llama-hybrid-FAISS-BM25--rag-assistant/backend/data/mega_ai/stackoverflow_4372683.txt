I know I am reapeating what I said in a comment, but, I dont think anyone got it. The phrase "equipment being controlled" signals to me that the program is some sort of device driver and its highly likely that the device is expecting a its flags to be in a specific area of memory. The reason common storage is being used is that the various modules can access and update these areas directly. Translating these into a C extern should work but you would really need to get hold of the documentation for the device interface to make sure you are doing it properly. Losing the common storgage as some posters suggest will simply not work under these circumstances. The best approach if you have the time and confidence would be to have a static class which handles all updates to the common storage and to replace all reads and writes to common storage with "get" s and "set"s to the new class.
