I don't think it's a good idea to send serialized objects to the other clients, because they will have some (considerable) overhead. I did some time ago a chat application and i used (successfully) the WebBrowser as the main control in the chat windows (which supports a lot of formating, rich media, etc), and I only send over the network html text (encrypted). Regarding your code, you cannot have the same instance of a Paragraph for example in two different controls, because it is a ContentElement - like you cannot have the same Label in two different panels.
