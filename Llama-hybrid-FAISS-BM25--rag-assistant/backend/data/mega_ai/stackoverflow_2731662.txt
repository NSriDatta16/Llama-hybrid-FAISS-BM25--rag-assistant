One option is creating a custom action and attaching it to the image. It still involves code, but is kinda blendy. public class ImageSwitchAction : TriggerAction { public ImageSource TargetImage { get; set; } protected override void Invoke(object o) { AssociatedObject.Source = TargetImage; } } After adding the class to your project and building, you can drag the new behavior to any image objects in the timeline, and configure the trigger and ImageSource in the action properties. In your case, add one action for MouseEnter and one for MouseLeave.
