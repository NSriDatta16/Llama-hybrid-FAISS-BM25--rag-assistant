A clustered index dictates how a table is physically stored on disk, and so updating a table with a clustered index may require that significant parts of the table be moved to make space for the new record, and that's slow. You can mitigate the problem by setting an appropriate fillfactor for your indexes. It's not quite so bad that you have to re-jigger the whole table when you add a record to the middle; it's usually just a few pages. Fillfactor determines how much of each page is filled before creating a new page, and how much to leave as wiggle room for new insertions. A lower fillfactor on an index will leave more space for new records and therefore give faster insert times on average, at the cost of more disk space and more pages and therefore slower reads. But if you're doing a lot more updating than reading it may be worth it.
