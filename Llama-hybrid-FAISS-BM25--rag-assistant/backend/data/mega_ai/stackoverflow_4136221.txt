There is not really any high level concepts in PHP you can learn. Closures became available just recently, but that is about as advanced as it gets. You already know MVC and OOP, which are used in some frameworks (CakePHP, Joomla). Wordpress, however is not well organized and clean. I don't know about drupal, though. I think CakePHP is the most Rails-like PHP framework. The tutorials in the manual are quite good, so you might want to read through them to see how PHP can look in an OOP, MVC environment where you feel at home. http://book.cakephp.org/view/1528/Blog
