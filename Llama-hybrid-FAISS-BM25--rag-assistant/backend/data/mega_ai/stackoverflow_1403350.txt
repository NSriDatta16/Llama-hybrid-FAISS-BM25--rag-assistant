When a target is batched it exectues independently of other executions of the same batched target. So in the first execution you populated the FullPath item to the contents C:\RootDir\UniqueDir1\Common1;C:\RootDir\UniqueDir1\Common2 Then on the second execution of the target you populated the value of FullPath to be C:\RootDir\UniqueDir2\Common1;C:\RootDir\UniqueDir2\Common2 Since items are not visible to the same batched target the second pass doesn't "see" that FullPath item. But when the TestTarget1 is completed the values for FullPath are combined into a single value which is. C:\RootDir\UniqueDir1\Common1;C:\RootDir\UniqueDir1\Common2;C:\RootDir\UniqueDir2\Common1;C:\RootDir\UniqueDir2\Common2 Does that clear it up? Batching can be kind of confusing at times. Here are some links on batching: MSBuild Batching Part 1 MSBuild Batching Part 2 MSBuild Batching Part 3 MSBuild RE: Enforcing the Build Agent in a Team Build
