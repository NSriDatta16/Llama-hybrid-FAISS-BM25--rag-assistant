Some people would find such 'marginal effects' difficult to interpret and non-unique. There are other ways to get 'marginal effects' in binary logistic regression. Because of non-collapsibility of the odds ratio, marginal estimates are not well defined in general, and they can represent quantities that are not weighted averages over the factors you are unconditioning on. Mitch Gail has an example where the partial odds ratio for an exposure x2 is 9 for both x1=0 and x1=1 but is 5.44 when not holding x1 constant. @ARTICLE{gai84bia, author = {Gail, M.H. and Wieand, S. and Piantadosi, S.}, year = 1984, title = {Biased estimates of treatment effect in randomized experiments with nonlinear regressions and omitted covariates}, journal = Biometrika, volume = 71, pages = {431-444}, annote = {covariable adjustment;bias if omitted covariables and model is nonlinear} } I wonder also whether you meant 'marginal effect' or 'effect on the original scale'. That would involve two different considerations. Effects on the log odds scale are easier to deal with, and you can relate odds ratios to absolute risk changes (as a function of starting risk) using a simple chart.
