Above all, you should take care of the time series . Despite from that, AEs are thoroughly used for time series, especially LSTM+AE. Did you vary the topology? For the CAE it looks reasonable but the other models lack some layers, or? Furthermore, some regular advices would be to standardize the input, change the activation functions (tanh worked well for me in the output layer) as well as the number of neurons per layer and the amount of layers in general. Could you provide the head() of the input data? An AE expects to fit X on X, maybe you missed that?
