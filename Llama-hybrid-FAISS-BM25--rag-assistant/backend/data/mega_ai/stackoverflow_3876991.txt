There is no way to do this in Designer. As far as I know, Qt does not provide a good way to do this in code either. If you really want this, you will probably have to rely on something a little hacky. Here's my first idea: Override resizeEvent() in the widget that contains the two group boxes to get the preferred size (via sizeHint() or minimumSizeHint()) of all of the labels and set the fixed width of all the labels to the largest preferred width. I would encourage you to ask yourself if this really matters (is it worth the development time?) and consider whether you can avoid the problem entirely with a slightly different UI design. BTW, you might want to take a look at QFormLayout if you haven't already.
