I'd like to add two further sources of bias: Living in a part of Europe where the forests slowly grow, but that also sees some shifting of the areas (over a decade 2002 - 2012, we saw ≈ 0.4 % of land area forest -> no forest and ≈ 0.8 % of land area no forest -> forest , my region has ≈ 42 % of land area being forest), I'd like to add that also original non-forest areas need to be surveyed in order to detect new forest growth. Otherwise, you'll be biased by the fact that you are systematically overlooking the possibility of new forests growing/existing forests expanding. Secondly (this is not clear to me from question and some comments). Sampling frequently involves several steps. in your case, that may be a satellite streaming image data along it's course, and then you sampling locations from that stream. in my case (analytical chemist), it's e.g. taking field samples and then reducing them into small lab samples suitable to put into some instrument. In such situations, Unbiased sampling in a previous step may be impossible to repair later on. or (in "lucky" circumstances), repairing bias in a previous step may be possible but may require non-random sampling. E.g. randomly sampling p % of the images of a satellite stream would be unbiased sampling of the statellite's images, but may yield a very biased sample wrt. the earth's surface depending on the satellite's orbit. To still arrive at unbiased sampling of the earth surface you may need a particular non-uniform sampling from the satellite images. Last but not least, uniform random sampling wrt. the overall sampling procedure may be unbiased but it may not be an efficient sampling strategy (if efficiency is a concern). I'd like to encourage you to look into literature about good sampling strategies for your application: A large tnumber of (2d) sampling strategies have been developed in particular for agricultural research together with guidelines in which cases which heuristics work well (and also wrt. to remote sensing). Developing a sampling strategy deserves substantial amounts of thought that takes into account the application/system under study.
