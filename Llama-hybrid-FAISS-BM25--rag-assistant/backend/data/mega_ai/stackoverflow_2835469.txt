How to perform rotate shift in C

I have a question as described: how to perform rotate shift in C without embedded assembly. To be more concrete, how to rotate shift a 32-bit int . I'm now solving this problem with the help of type long long int , but I think it a little bit ugly and wanna know whether there is a more elegant method. Kind regards.
