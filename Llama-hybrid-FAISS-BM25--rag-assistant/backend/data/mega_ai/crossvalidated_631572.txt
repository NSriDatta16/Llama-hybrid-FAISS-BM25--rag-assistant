You can test model performance empirically or against a simulation (but you should not confuse these two things with each other) If you have a model that makes predictions of observable things (which both Bayesian and frequentist models do), you can make predictions about outcomes and check those predications against what actually happened. You can also construct measures of prediction accuracy and compare these between models to see which models do a better or worse job of predicting some set of outcomes in a particular situation. This can be done either with empirical data (i.e., real world data coming from some process or mechanism) or with simulations from a model (i.e., generating outcomes on a computer using a PRNG in a model). While both of these approaches may potentially be useful for certain purposes, you should not confuse empirical data with simulation --- simulated binary values on a computer are simulated binary values on a computer; they are not empirical coin flips. When you determine the results of a predictive/inferential model on an underlying simulation, you are effectively looking at how well the inferential model performs on data from an underlying stipulated model. This is a purely theoretical exercise and there are relevant theoretical results that impact on this. In some cases it is possible to derive the results without any simulation just from the stipulated models. As whuber points out in the comments to your question, statistical models and inference/prediction methods are predicated on assumptions and the procedures are typically sensible (or indeed sometimes optimised) against the assumed model form. Consequently, looking at the accuracy of predictions/inferences from a model against simulated data is effectively a test of the "distance" between the assumptions of the inferential model and the assumptions of the model used for simulation. Unlike in the case of simulations, when you determine the results of a predictive/inferential model on empirical data from an observed real-world mechanism or process, there is no known "model" of the comparison process. The accuracy of the predictions will typically reflect how close the assumptions of the inferential model are to the reality of the mechanism or process generating the data in real life. Empirical analysis of this kind can be useful as a study in whether or not particular statistical models adequately capture real-world mechanisms or processes that produce data.
