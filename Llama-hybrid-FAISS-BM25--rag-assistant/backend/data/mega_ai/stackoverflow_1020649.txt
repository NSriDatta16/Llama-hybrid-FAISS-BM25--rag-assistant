I usually install the runtime. Then I run some common commands from the command line at the compiler or interpreter. I look online for forums to find out what other think about it. Then I investigate how to work with external parameters such as psvm(String[] args) in java. I guess to sum it up, I am always interested in the languages power on the command line due to my sys admin background in solaris.
