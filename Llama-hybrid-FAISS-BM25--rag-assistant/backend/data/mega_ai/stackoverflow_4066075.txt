Proper data structure to represent a Sudoku puzzle?

What would be a smart data structure to use to represent a Sudoku puzzle? I.e. a 9X9 square where each "cell" contains either a number or a blank. Special considerations include: Ability to compare across row, column, and in 3X3 "group Ease of implementation (specifically in Python) Efficiency (not paramount) I suppose in a pinch, a 2D array might work but that seems to be a less than elegant solution. I just would like to know if there's a better data structure.
