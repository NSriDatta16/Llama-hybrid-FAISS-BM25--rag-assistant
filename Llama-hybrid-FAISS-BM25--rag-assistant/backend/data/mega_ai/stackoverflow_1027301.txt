Eclipse 3.4+ - No more notifying a breakpoint in taskbar

This question may sound silly, but I was wondering if someone ever had that problem too. I was using Eclipse 3.2 to develop, earlier. Recently I changed to Eclipse 3.4 (ganymede), and I have a problem, concerning debugging. Before, whenever the debugger was hitting a breakpoint, Eclipse would blink in the windows taskbar, to notify about it. But since switching to 3.4, it doesn't "blink" anymore, so, to debug a Swing application, it can easily get annoying, because you don't see directly when you entered a breakpoint. In other informations, I'm using Eclipse 3.4 over the previous workspace, so I thought it might be a problem, with using the previous settings, but after trying on a brand new workspace, I encountered the same issue. I tried to search about it in the Eclipse community, but nothing like this so far. Has anyone ever had that problem ? And if yes, is there a way to make it work ? Edit: For information, updating to Eclipse 3.5 (galileo) didn't solve the issue, so I'm guessing it's not linked to only the previous update. Something probably changed since version 3.2, which is now preventing the usual "blinking" behavior. I can't figure out what, though.
