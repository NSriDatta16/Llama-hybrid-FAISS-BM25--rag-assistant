ARMA is a pure time series model, i.e. it doesn't have exogenous variables $X_t$ unlike a typical regression $y_t=X_t\beta+\varepsilon_t$ . In a generic formulation of ARMA such as $\phi(B)y_t=\theta(B)\varepsilon_t$ the exogenous variables $X_t$ are nowhere to be seen. There are a few ways to marry these two models. One is called ARIMAX: $$\phi(B)y_t=X_t\beta+\theta(B)\varepsilon_t$$ and the other is regARIMA: $$y_t=X_t\beta+u_t\\\phi(B)u_t=\theta(B)\varepsilon_t$$ The latter formulation can be easier to understand for you as it states that we have a linear regression where the errors are ARIMA, which is similar to how you described your understanding. Both approaches are estimated in MLE framework where exogenous coefficients $\beta$ and ARMA coefficients are estimated simultaneously, not in the two step approach that you suggest. If you didn't have moving average part in ARMA, then the ARIMAX can be estimated in a linear regression with OLS: $$\phi(B)y_t=X_t\beta+\varepsilon_t$$ $$y_t=\phi_1 y_{t-1}+\phi_2 y_{t-2}+\dots+X_t\beta+\varepsilon_t$$
