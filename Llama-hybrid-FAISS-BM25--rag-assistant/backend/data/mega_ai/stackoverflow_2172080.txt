Using XHTML states an intent , don’t underestimate that (but don’t overestimate this either). Web standards are politics: if nobody cares, nothing is gonna change. Using XHTML (or HTML5) signals “yes, we are in fact interested in the continued development of the standards. Furthermore, while clients certainly don’t enforce XHTML rules with a text/html content type, design tools still can do this. XHTML is much easier to support for editors than real HTML (with “real” I mean the whole ugly SGML package). There are good XHTML validators that do much more than HTML validators can (e.g. Schneegans’ XML schema validator ). All in all, many arguments against XHTML are in fact straw-men that aim at some of the poorly-formulated arguments for XHTML. For instance, Microsoft is responsible of publishing long lists of purported XHTML advantages (such as semantic web design). Attacking those arguments is like reductio ad absurdum . But there are good arguments for XHTML.
