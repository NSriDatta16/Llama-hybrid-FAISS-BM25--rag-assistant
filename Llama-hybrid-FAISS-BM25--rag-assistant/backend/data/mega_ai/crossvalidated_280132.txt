Predicting user selections based on previous answers and datetime

I'm completely new to machine learning and wish to implement it into my app to help my users travel between places. Let's say I have data (constantly updating data) that looks like this: user|from_id|to_id|timestamp 1234|4365|23075|xxx Where from_id and to_id is the start/stop place's ID. Based on this I would want to predict and suggest to the user where to go in the future based on the timestamp (and possibly either from_id or to_id). So for example; Let's say that I've been looking for routes to my work every weekday around 8 AM. I would then enter the user I'd want to predict and the current date/time into this algorithm and if the time is around 8 AM on a weekday it'd suggest a route from home to work because it's that time of the day. I've been looking at the linear regression but I'm unsure if it can handle time series without a fixed time between each data, and also if linear regression is suitable for online machine learning ? Are there any projects on ex. GitHub which could help me get started?
