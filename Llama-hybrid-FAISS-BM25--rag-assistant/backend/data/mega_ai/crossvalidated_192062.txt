issue calculating adjusted means for glmer model

I'm attempting to calculate adjusted means for a binomial outcome variable using a generalized linear mixed-effects regression analysis. I've got two interacting fixed factors and one random effect. I've never had trouble doing this with lmer or clmm in R , but I get the sense that I'm making a mistake; I'm getting some strange values from lsmeans() (lsmeans package) with a GLMER model. The question is: What is lsmeans returning in the lsmean column when you do this with a GLMER model? It cannot be a percentage of individuals at level 1 (like what the result of averaging all of the observations would be without random effects) because values greater than 1 are returned. here's a reproducible example require(lme4) require(lsmeans) model and the result looks like this: eg_type = full: train_cond lsmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL classify 1.4511796 0.1232138 NA 1.2096850 1.692674 switch 0.8621281 0.1195494 NA 0.6278155 1.096441 eg_type = partial: train_cond lsmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL classify 1.2388261 0.1195960 NA 1.0044222 1.473230 switch 1.0456869 0.1180998 NA 0.8142155 1.277158 Results are given on the logit scale. Confidence level used: 0.95 As you can see, there's no way the values in the lsmean column can be the adjusted means for proportions of a binary outcome variable, also df return as NA. I'm assuming this is an error with my understanding of this function + GLMER so any stats advice is greatly appreciated.
