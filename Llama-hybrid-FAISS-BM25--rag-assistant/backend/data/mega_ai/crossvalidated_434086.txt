t-test for time series (Diebold Mariano test?)

Currently I am working on the following problem: I want to compare the means of two different time series ts1 and ts2. As the samples are not iid and t-test can't be applied, I thought to use the Diebold Mariano test as an alternative. This test generalizes the variance estimate through autocovariance. Does anyone know if the Diebold Mariano test can be applied to compare two means of the ts1 and ts2? Which lag should then be chosen?
