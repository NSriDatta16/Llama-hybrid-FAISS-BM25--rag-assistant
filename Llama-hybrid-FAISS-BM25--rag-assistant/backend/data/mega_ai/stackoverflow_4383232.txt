make sure GD is properly installed and the function exists: also. Although this "creates" the image, you still have to write it to either the screen or a file to be able to use it. at the state it's in using imagecreatefrom[..whatever] it's just a object in your current state in your web app and has not been rendered out for storage or display. for that you need to do whatever you're going to do and use imagejpeg or imagegif or imagepng to actually render the object back out to some destination. you can test this by executing echo $src_img which should print something like: Resource id #1
