How can I get students to stick with data science?

I am a chief data scientist at one of the largest corporations in the world. I am constantly approached by employees to teach them more about data science and help them on their learning path. The problem is that no one really seems to stick with it over the long term, everyone just wants the "shortcut" to the sexy data scientist job without realizing the work needed. So, in effect, how can I get more of my "students" to stick with data science? What other techniques have you all used (if any) to teach people successfully? I am posting this because I'm tossing around the idea of starting a small study group where multiple people will help each other learn data science and I will guide them along. I am hoping that this accountability to their peers (instead of just one-on-one with me) will help them.
