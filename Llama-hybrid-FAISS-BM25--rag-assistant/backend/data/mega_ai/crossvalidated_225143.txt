Diebold & Kilian (2001) (a free version here ) suggest a measure of predictability for a time series. Here is an excerpt from the abstract: We propose a measure of predictability based on the ratio of the expected loss of a short-run forecast to the expected loss of a long-run forecast. This predictability measure can be tailored to the forecast horizons of interest, and it allows for general loss functions, univariate or multivariate information sets, and covariance stationary or difference stationary processes. We propose a simple estimator, and we suggest resampling methods for inference. The measure $P$ is defined on p. 659 as $$ P(L,\Omega,j,k) = 1 - \frac{\mathbb{E}(L(e_{t+j,t}))}{\mathbb{E}(L(e_{t+k,t}))} $$ where $e_{t+j,t}$ is the forecast error for (short) horizon $j$; $e_{t+k,t}$ is the forecast error for (long) horizon $k$; $L$ is a loss function; $\Omega$ is an information set; and $\mathbb{E}$ is mathematical expectation conditional on the information set $\Omega$. If $P$ is high (close to 1), the series is highly predictable at horizon $j$ relative to $k$. If $P$ is low (close to zero), the relative predictability is low. See also Theil's $U$ statistic mention on p. 659. According to Diebold & Kilian, Theil's $U$ assesses 1-step forecast accuracy relative to that of a "naive" no-change forecast, whereas $P$ assesses 1-step accuracy relative to that of a long-horizon ($k$-step) forecast. See also section 5. Concluding remarks and directions for future research (p. 666-668) for some discussion and possible extensions. References: Diebold, Francis X., and Lutz Kilian.
