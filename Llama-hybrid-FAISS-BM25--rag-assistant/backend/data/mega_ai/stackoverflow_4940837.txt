I have a very messy solution working, but I'd love to hear of some ideas for a proper/elegant solution. Right now I'm using GetListItems on the UserInfo list and creating a dictionary of ows_ImnName and ows_Name entries, then parsing the string from the list query into the names and using them as lookup values. There has to be a better way.
