WCF authentication in silverlight is performed via SOAP headers which you don't have access to - you can't pass authentication information from Silverlight to WCF as requested. Assuming you're using ASP.NET Application Services to perform user authentication (it's the only tech I know of that'll work here) your basic strategy could be to call the ValidateUser method, which will perform a login and instruct the Silverlight control to include that user session info in the SOAP headers, then make calls to WCF services. You can either periodically refresh the session by logging the user in behind the scenes or wait for a WCF call to fail based on credentials and then validate the user again. I don't know if there's some keep alive aspect to calling WCF services that may make the need to re-authenticate less pressing. You can store the user's login and password in isolated storage as suggested by another poster, but make sure you encrypt that data first, it's stored in plain text in an obscure location and is not safe.
