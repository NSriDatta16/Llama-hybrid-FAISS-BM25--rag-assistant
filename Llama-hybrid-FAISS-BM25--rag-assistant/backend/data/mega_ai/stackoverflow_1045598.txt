Create a document library with external persistence

I would like to create a custom document library where I use the standard UI but implement a different persistence layer. Basically fetch and display documents from a different source system. This way I can use my existing object model but leverage the great office integration within SharePoint. I found a decent article here but they are cheating, they have coded a completely new UI for the external persistence. I have looked at the SPList and SPDocumentLibrary objects but I can't override the necessary methods. I have looked at the event framework and it is closer but it lacks important events such as 'GetFile' or 'PopulateList'. Any thoughts?
