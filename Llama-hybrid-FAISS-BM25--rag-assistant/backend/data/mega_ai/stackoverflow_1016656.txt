Restrict Textarea for not accepting 250 character

I have a textarea in C#, please see below code: Question & Comments Now I want that textarea should not accept more than 250 characters, whatever user do COPY & PASTE, by WRITING and DRAG & DROP etc, if user try to copy or drag & drop more than 250 character the first 250 characters should be copied in textarea. I know that there no MAXLENGTH attribute in TEXTAREA. If it is not possible with .NET the solution with javascript or Jquery will work. Please help
