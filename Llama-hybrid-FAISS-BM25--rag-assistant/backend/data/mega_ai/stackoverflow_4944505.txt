FluentValidation on number issue

I am using FluentValidation in my ASP.NET MVC 3 application. I have a MaxNumberTeamMembers property in my view model as such: /// /// Gets or sets the maximum number of team members. /// public int MaxNumberTeamMembers { get; set; } I want to know if the following ruleset is possible: On the front end view, if the textbox is empty then I want a "MaxNumberTeamMembers is required" message to be displayed If the number entered is less than 1 then I want a message to display "MaxNumberTeamMembers should be greater or equal to 1". What would the ruleset for the above look like? I have the following but it does not work on the GreaterThan part if I enter 0: RuleFor(x => x.MaxNumberTeamMembers) .NotEmpty() .WithMessage("Max. number of team members is required") .GreaterThan(0) .WithMessage("Max. number of team members must be greater than 0"); UPDATE 2011-02-14: RuleFor(x => x.MinNumberCharactersCitation) .NotNull() .WithMessage("Min. number of characters for citation is required") .GreaterThanOrEqualTo(1) .WithMessage("Min. number of characters for citation must be greater than or equal to 1") .LessThanOrEqualTo(x => x.MaxNumberCharactersCitation) .WithMessage("Min. number of characters must be less than or equal to max. number of characters");
