There are any number of things that could be used to determine this - it'll depend on the system and what metrics the devs decide to use. A few examples: vBulletin, a PHP-based forum system can shut itself down if the Unix load average hits a certain (admin-selected) value Some systems that involve queuing (as Twitter does) can monitor the size of the queue and shut out users if the queue grows too large Some systems have the servers doing the actual processing behind a proxy or load balancer. If they go offline, the proxy or load balancer can redirect traffic to an error page like the failwhale.
