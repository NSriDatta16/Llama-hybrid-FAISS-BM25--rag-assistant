Iterative PCA R

I have a largish data set (400,000 variables of 1000 samples). I would like to identify what is the best set of these variables for capturing most of the variance between samples. What's the best way to perform an iterative principal component analysis that will perhaps go through X rounds of between Y and Z variables each time and result in a list of which round leads to the fewest number of PCs to capture a certain percentage of variance?
