That is actually 3 functions. memorycopy() ... well, someone else can figure that one out :P tworegistervarswap() seems to take pointers to two int s, and if they don't already match, then it does some bit fiddling with them ( XOR ). It swaps the values without using a temporary variable. bigintegeraverage() takes two int s and returns the mean (thanks Steve Jessop ) based on them, using bit fiddling as well (AND, XOR and RIGHT SHIFT).
