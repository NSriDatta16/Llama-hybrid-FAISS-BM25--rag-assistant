You can simply drag/drop the folder in Windows Explorer into the File System view of your Installer vdproj. All the files and folders in the hierarchy will be added to your setup project. Tip: If the folders are in SVN or similar source control, delete all the hidden folders before you do this! If you have PowerShell, check out get-childitem . -include _svn -force -recurse | foreach ($_) {remove-item -recurse -force $_.fullname} Or you can always use Windows Search to find all hidden directories in the hierarchy and delete them from the Results Window.
