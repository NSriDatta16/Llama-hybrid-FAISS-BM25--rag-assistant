Why do the fundamental time series model explain many dynamical phenomena

What is so special about the way Moving average models, Autoregressive models and their combinations (ARMA, ARIMA) are defined that they seem to fit many of the univariate time series we observe in our world ? What is so unique about the way many dynamical systems work that these models or a combination of these model seem to fit them ?
