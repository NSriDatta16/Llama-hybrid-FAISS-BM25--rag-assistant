I'll start with a very simple suggestion, add $5$ $3$-star reviews to each product. In your example above we would then be comparing an average of $4.15$ to an average of $3.33$. This starts every product at $3$ and requires some data to move away from $3$. While this seems like a silly idea with no mathematical justification, it actually is not. The idea of pseudo-counts , are derived from Bayesian models whose posterior means can be computed simply by adding a few fictional data points. I have not formulated a specific prior here because I know very little about distributions on ordinal data such as yours, but the idea still works. This is a form of regularization or shrinkage and these effects can be achieved in many ways, and in models of various levels of complexity. If you like the simplicity of pseudo-counts but want to be a bit more rigorous you can try adding $n$ reviews with an average of $\mu$ to each product and tune $n, \mu$ using cross validation to maximize some measurement of prediction accuracy. I would start with $\mu$ as the average rating in your whole data set, and play with values of $n$.
