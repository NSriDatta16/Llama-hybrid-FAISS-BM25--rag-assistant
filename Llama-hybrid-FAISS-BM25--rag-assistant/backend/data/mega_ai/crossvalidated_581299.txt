Another source, from a doctoral dissertation Multi-city time series analyses of air pollution and mortality data using generalized geoadditive mixed models by Lung-Chang Chien. Free online access . So far, there is no strict criterion to identify the level of concurvity which can severely affect model fitting. Ramsay et al. (2003a) suggested using 0.5 to be the cutoff point. If the level of concurvity in nonparametric or semiparametric models is greater than 0.5, it is necessary to seek in order to eliminate or reduce this problem.
