Your code is very unpythonic. Remember Python is not C. The semicolon is optional. The parenthesis in an if is optional. To get the last element of list a , use a[-1] , not reversing a then get its first element. Use the built-in functions! Your modified maxagent can be written simply using the max function: def maxagent(gamestate, depth): actions = gamestate.getLegalActions(0) filteredactions = filter(lambda action: action != Directions.STOP, actions) # alternatives: # filteredactions = filter(Directions.STOP.__ne__, actions) # filteredactions = (a for a in actions if a != Directions.STOP) bestaction = max(filteredactions, key=lambda action: self.minvalue( gamestate.generateSuccessor(0, action), depth, 1 )) return bestaction If you need the score too, consider returning a tuple . def maxagent(gamestate, depth) actions = gamestate.getLegalActions(0) scores = ( (self.minvalue(gamestate.generateSuccessor(0, a), depth, 1), a) for a in actions if a != Directions.STOP ) return max(scores) ... score, action = maxagent(gamestate, depth)
