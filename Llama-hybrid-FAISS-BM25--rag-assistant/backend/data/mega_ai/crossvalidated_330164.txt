For the variable importance in the party package help("varimp", package = "party") has a short explanation. Value: A vector of 'mean decrease in accuracy' importance scores. More details and the exact formulas can be found in Strobl et al. (2008). "Conditional Variable Importance for Random Forests." BMC Bioinformatics , 9 (307). doi:10.1186/1471-2105-9-307 However, the values of these importances may also change with the type of permutation (conditional vs. unconditional), the evaluation set (in-bag vs. out-of-bag), etc. And sometimes the importances are rescaled as you point out. So it is not always possible to exactly compare the numeric values between different packages/functions.
