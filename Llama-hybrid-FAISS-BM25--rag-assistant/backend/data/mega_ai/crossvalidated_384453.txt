As you have mentioned, RNN's and LSTM's are meant to capture time dependency in time-series data. Thus, feeding in an input with only one time-step does not make sense. (Unless one is using Stateful LSTM which has a different story). Here is an example: We have a product and we want to forecast its sales from historical data. We can then choose number of time steps based on which we want to make a prediction, for instance, given 7 days of sales, predict the sales of the 8th days. Thus, the input would be of shape (N, ts, 1) and output would be of shape (N, 1) . N is the total number of samples you have (so each sample has 7 days of sales as input and the sales of the next day as output). I am not sure which tutorials you are referring to, but this one might have a better example.
