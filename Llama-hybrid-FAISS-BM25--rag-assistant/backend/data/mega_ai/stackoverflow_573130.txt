A public key token is used to identify the organization in a strongly named assembly. This information is added to the assembly metabase. I would assume Richard is correct about the technical way it is stored. If you want to view the metabase of an assembly, use ILDASM. You can drill down into what is stored in the metabase in addition to seeing the IL.
