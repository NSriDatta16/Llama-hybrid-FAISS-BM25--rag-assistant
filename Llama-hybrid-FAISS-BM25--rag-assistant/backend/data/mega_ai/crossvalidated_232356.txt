Who are frequentists?

We already had a thread asking who are Bayesians and one asking if frequentists are Bayesians , but there was no thread asking directly who are frequentists ? This is a question that was asked by @whuber as a comment to this thread and it begs to be answered. Do they exist (are there any self-identified frequentists)? Maybe they were just made-up by Bayesians who needed a scapegoat to blame when criticizing the mainstream statistics? Meta-comment to the answers that were already given: As contrast, Bayesian statistics are not only defined in terms of using Bayes theorem (non-Bayesians also use it), nor about using subjectivist interpretation of probability (you wouldn't call any layperson saying things like "I bet the chance is less than 50:50!" a Bayesian) - so can we define frequentism only in terms of adopted interpretation of probability? Moreover, statistics $\ne$ applied probability , so should definition of frequentism be focused solely on the interpretation of probability?
