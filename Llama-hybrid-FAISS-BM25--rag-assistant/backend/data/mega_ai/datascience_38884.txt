Creating similarity metric with Doc2Vec and additional features

I have a dataset which contains many features. Each record is company that has many features. For example... Company A: Keywords - data, big data, tableau, dashboards, etc. Industry - Information Technology Sub-Industry - Data Visualization Total Funding - $150,000,000 I want to create a similarity metric between multiple companies, incorporating both doc2vec embeddings trained on the keyword lists as well as the additional features listed. I had a hard time searching/finding papers that did something like this. Any ideas?
