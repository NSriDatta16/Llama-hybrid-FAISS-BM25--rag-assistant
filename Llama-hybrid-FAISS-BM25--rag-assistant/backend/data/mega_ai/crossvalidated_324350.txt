The precise terminology might differ across sources, but according to the source I learned from, the first one is called the Bellman optimality equation or simply the Bellman equation. The second one is the Bellman expectation equation . The expectation equation is linear in $V$, so you can solve for $V$ using simple linear algebra. The optimality equation, on the other hand, is nonlinear (due to the max operation) so there is no closed-form solution... which is why there are many algorithms to find the optimal solution (Q-learning, value iteration, policy iteration etc.). The expectation equation is usually used to evaluate a known policy $\pi$, whereas the optimality equation is used to learn the optimal policy $\pi^*$.
