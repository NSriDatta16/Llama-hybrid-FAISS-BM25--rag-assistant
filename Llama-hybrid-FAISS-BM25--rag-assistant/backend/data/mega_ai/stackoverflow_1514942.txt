Is there an gcc/Xcode pragma to suppress warnings?

Is there a #pragma to have gcc/Xcode suppress specific warnings, similar to Java's @SuppressWarning annotation? I compile with -Wall as a rule, but there are some situations where I'd like to just ignore a specific warning (e.g. while writing some quick/dirty code just to help debug something). I'm not looking for "fix the code" answers.
