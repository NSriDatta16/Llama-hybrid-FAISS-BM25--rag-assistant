Random forest feature adjustment

so, I've found the misclassified instances in my Random forest model have lower values in some predictors, how can I adjust the model so that the threshold is more sensitive to these predictors? fit1 0.5, trainset1$b == 'three') result FALSE TRUE FALSE 213 200 TRUE 821 1121 As the result has shown, 821 of other classes are misclassified as "three", suppose I want to adjust the model so that it is more sensitive to these variables: negemo, posemo, swear. What should I do? Thank you
