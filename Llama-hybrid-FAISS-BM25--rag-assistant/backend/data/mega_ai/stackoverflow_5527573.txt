How do you get SQL Server 2008 Server Agent login credentials?

I would like to learn how to use SQL Server. My school offers the software as part of its enrollment package so I decided to download it and try installing it. Unfortunately, I get stuck at the following installation screen: No matter what name and password I enter for any of the fields, it comes back telling me that these are invalid. Where and how do I get valid login credentials? Am I supposed to register somewhere somehow? Any help appreciated! Thank you!
