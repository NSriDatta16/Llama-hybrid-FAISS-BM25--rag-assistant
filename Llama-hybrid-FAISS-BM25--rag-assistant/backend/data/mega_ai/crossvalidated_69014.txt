Hypothesis testing with a response scale of "1, 2, 3, 4, or not applicable"

Let's imagine I'm testing a new drug that purports to reduce the effect of a hangover when the drug is administered shortly before an episode of heavy drinking. On Friday night, I stake out the entrance to a frat party and, using random assignment, give each new guest either a placebo or the active drug. The next morning, I ask each participant to complete this two-item questionnaire: Did you get drunk last night? no yes If "yes," how hungover do you feel this morning? 1: not at all 2 3 4: extremely Normally I'd perform a simple t-test for the difference in mean response to the Likert scale. But in this case, the drug could have some effect in discouraging people from getting drunk in the first place . Anyone who answers "no" to Question 1 necessarily has missing data for Question 2. How can I do the usual hypothesis test -- that the drug does/does not differ from placebo -- given these idiosyncrasies?
