An MA(q) process has the characteristic equation: $$1-\theta_1 x-\theta_2 x^2 - \theta_3 x^3 - ... - \theta_q x^q$$ According to Time Series Analysis with Applications in R , the MA process is invertible "if and only if the roots of the MA characteristic equation exceed 1 in modulus." The first difference of your MA(2) process is: $$ \begin{aligned}\nabla Y_t &=e_t-\theta_1 e_{t-1} -\theta_2 e_{t-2} - (e_{t-1}-\theta_1 e_{t-2} -\theta_2 e_{t-3}) \\ &= e_t - (\theta_1+1)e_{t-1}-(\theta_2-\theta_1)e_{t-2}-(-\theta_2)e_{t-3} \end{aligned} $$ This process is invertible in the case where the roots of the equation $$1-\theta'_1x-\theta'_2x^2-\theta'_3x^3$$ are greater than 1 in modulus and where $$\begin{aligned} \theta_1'&= \theta_1+1\\ \theta_2'&=\theta_2-\theta_1 \\ \theta'_3&=-\theta_2 \end{aligned}$$ A general solutions can be found using the cubic formula.
