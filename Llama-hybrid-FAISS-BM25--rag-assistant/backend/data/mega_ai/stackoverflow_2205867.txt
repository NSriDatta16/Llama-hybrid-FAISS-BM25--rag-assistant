Alin Constantin at Microsoft helped me out here and has even written a blog post on how to do drag/drop within VS2010 properly! http://alinconstantin.blogspot.com/2010/02/drag-and-drop-in-visual-studio-2010.html Highlights, in case of link rot: In your tool window (the UserControl), override OnDragEnter , OnDragOver ( important! ) and OnDrop . Failure to override OnDragOver will cause drag/drop to fail. In OnDragEnter , do the following: Check to see if you can handle the drop If so, set DragEventArgs.Handled to true and DragEventArgs.Effects to the appropriate value Call base.OnDragEnter() In OnDragOver , you must do the same thing as OnDragEnter . If you fail to set Handled , Visual Studio will take over and you won't be able to handle the drop! In OnDrop , Handle the drop Set DragEventArgs.Handled to true Call base.OnDrop() Remember, not handling OnDragOver will result in Visual Studio taking over the drag operation, denying you the ability to handle it in OnDrop .
