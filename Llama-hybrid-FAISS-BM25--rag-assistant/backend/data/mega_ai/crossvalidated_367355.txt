The standard approach is to use probability scoring. See Gneiting and Katzfuss (2014) for some of the mathematical background. One example of a probability scoring measure is quantile scoring based on the pinball loss function. For each time period throughout the forecast horizon, you compute the $0.01, 0.02, \dots, 0.99$ quantiles --- call these $q_1,\dots,q_{99}$, with $q_0=-\infty$ or the natural lower bound, and $q_{100}=\infty$ or the natural upper bound. These 99 values then define (approximately) the forecast densities. For a quantile forecast $q_a$ with $a/100$ as the target quantile, the pinball loss $L$ is defined as: $$ L(q_a, y) = \begin{cases} (1 - a/100) (q_a - y), & \text{if $y Note that $L(q_{50},y)$ is equal to $0.5 |q_{50}-y|$, half the value of the absolute error. For other quantiles, the loss is not symmetric. To evaluate the full predictive densities, this score is then averaged over all target quantiles, from 0.01 to 0.99, for all time periods over all forecast horizons. The lower the score, the better the forecasts are.
