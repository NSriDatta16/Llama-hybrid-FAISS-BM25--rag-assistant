@RobertLong commented first, but hasn't fleshed this out into an answer. Predictive mean matching is a bit like propensity scoring. I'm simplifying the description in the link, but for each observation with missing $x$ , you find the $k$ complete data observations that should be most similar to the one with missing data, then impute one of the $k$ nearest neighbors' complete data observations, then repeat the process (note, it's more complicated that that and involves an additional stochastic step I didn't describe; read the link). You're drawing imputations from actual data, sort of like you would in bootstrapping. So, the imputed data are going to match the characteristics of the observed data. Since you're using Stata, one issue you need to be aware of is that the default setting has $k = 1$ , which Allison (the link above) argues is much too low and produces too little variability, and that you should set $k =$ 5 or 10. In Stata, the syntax would be mi impute pmm Status3_M = x1 x2 x3 ... , knn(5) Or, if doing as part of a larger imputation by chained equations, mi imputed chained (pmm, knn(5)) Status3_M (regress) ... (whatever else) ... = x1 x2 x3 Default $k$ s vary from program to program, but SPSS apparently shares Stata's default. SAS and R's mice default to $k=5$ .
