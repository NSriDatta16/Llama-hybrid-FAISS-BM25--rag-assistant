In most types of regression, typical approach to compare the effect of a program (drug type) on certain outcome is to make one model for all the observations, and a dummy (0-1) variable for treatment: $cells_i = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}drug\_type_i + \varepsilon_i$ If needed, other control variables may be included, such as: $cells_i = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}drug\_type_i + \beta_{2}dose_i + \varepsilon_i$ If you feel, that structural parameter $\beta_2$ differs between groups, and for some reason you want to investigate it, you can perform Chow test in order to test stability of parameters between two regressions, one for every group. However, it should probably end up in a single model with an interaction: $cells_i = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}drug\_type_i + \beta_{2}dose_i + \beta_{3}drug\_type_i \times dose_i+ \varepsilon_i$ Every variable in regression can be logarithmized, as @Dave correctly mentioned, it does not make it "logistic regression". It changes interpretation of variables for semielasticity, but do not change estimation method.
