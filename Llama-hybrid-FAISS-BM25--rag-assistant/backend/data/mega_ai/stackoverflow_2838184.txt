Learn Fundamentals of Silverlight 4 Data Binding

I'm just starting to work with Silverlight (no WPF experience either) and am having a difficult time finding a source that provides a full explanation of Data Binding. There is absolutely no lack of tutorials (starting with the ones on Silverlight.net or Scott Gu's blogs), but everything I have found is "by example". Is there a resource that explains how data binding works in Silverlight, from a Fundamental/Conceptual perspective, and provides end-to-end coverage of data binding features? The desire for a more fundamental source of information is driven by a number of questions that came up this afternoon in reviewing tutorials and writing sample apps, such as: Why can't I bind the value of a slider like this?: Value="{Binding=Age, Mode=TwoWay}" where Age refers to an int property in the object data context I bind in code-behind (the Visual Studio error message is Expected '[]' . How do I use the DataContext property in VS 2010? What's a Path, Relative Source, Static Source, ...?
