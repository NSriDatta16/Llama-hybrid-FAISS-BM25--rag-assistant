An intuitive motivation for the Innovations Algorithm used in Time Series

Is there a intuitive motivation for the Innovations Algorithm used in Time Series for forecasting and parameter estimations? I understand that one objective of the algorithm is to be able to write the linear predictors with uncorrelated terms (the innovations). But why would that be desirable, and how would that translate in the actual algorithm that we see in books like «Introduction to Times Series and Forecasting» by Brockwell and Davis? Any help would be appreciated. Addendum: To avoid having this question closed for «being unclear what I'm asking» , and after some searching, I've found these slides . So, from slides 4 to 7 there is equation (1) with several equalities, one of which I don't understand. The first equality is from uncorrelated property of the innovations. However, where does the second equality come from?
