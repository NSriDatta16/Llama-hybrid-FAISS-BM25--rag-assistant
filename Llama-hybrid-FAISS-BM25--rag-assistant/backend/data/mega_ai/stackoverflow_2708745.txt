I was the person that pointed you at the more up-to-date version at Twilight Dragon. The file you want there is http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-MinGW%20Installer/1.908.0/tdm-mingw-1.908.0-4.4.1-2.exe/download which is a Windows binary installer - you just run it. Note that you don't actually need to do this - the version that comes with Code::Blocks will work OK for someone starting to learn C++.
