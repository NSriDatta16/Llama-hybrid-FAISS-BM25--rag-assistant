Reference [5] seems to use an approximation in the function a_value but that doesn't seem to be the way the AUC is calculated in sklearn . It uses the method _average_multiclass_ovo_score , whose binary_metric is given as _binary_roc_auc_score . This method calls the roc_curve and general purpose auc method. I don't think this implements the logic embedded in the fourth reference. Even the toy example given in [5] does not give the same value as sklearn.
