If you're willing to put money down, you could look at something like TestComplete . Although I haven't really used it yet (our company just bought it), it seems quite nice. You can record clicks and keypresses and stuff, define success criteria, and it will replay the test for you later. It appears to be quite smart about UI changes - it remembers which button you clicked, not just the (x,y) of each click. It's scriptable, or drag-and-drop programmable. I'm not affiliated in any way, and this is not an endorsement, because I haven't really formed an opinion of it yet.
