Both Canvas and Grid honour the Canvas.ZIndex attached property, so either will do. However a more elegant approach might be to use the Visibility property to show / hide the placeholder elements. i.e. when you want to hide your placeholder use the following: placeholder.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed This is better than using Z index in my opinion
