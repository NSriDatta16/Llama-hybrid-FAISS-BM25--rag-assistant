How to speed up Azure deployment from Visual Studio 2010

I have Visual Studio 2010 solution with an Azure Service and an ASP.NET MVC 3 solution that serves as a Web Role for the Azure service. No other roles attached to the service other than that. Every deployment to the Azure staging (or production, for that matter) environment takes up to 20 minutes to complete, form the moment I click publish on Visual Studio until all instances (2) are started. As you can imagine this makes it a PITA to publish often, or to quick-fix some bugs. Is there a way to speed the process up? Would it be faster to upload the package to de Blob storage and upgrade from there? How would I go about achieving that? I feel on-line docs on Azure leave a lot to be desired. Particularly when it comes to troubleshooting by the way. Thanks.
