java: design pattern for paged results

So there's Iterable and Iterator and List . What do you use if you are trying to provide an interface to other Java code, in order to encapsulate functionality provided by a remote service that returns results in "pages"? As an example, consider a database or a webpage (e.g. flickr API ). After the first retrieval of results, you know the total # of results and the first N results, but you don't know the remaining results until you retrieve the rest.
