Criticisms In October 2020, Access Now, announced its official resignation from PAI in a letter. Access Now stated that it had found that there was an increasingly smaller role for civil society to play within PAI and that PAI had not influenced or changed the attitude of member companies or encouraged them to respond to or consult with civil society on a systematic basis. Access Now also expressed its disagreement with PAI's approach to AI ethics and risk assessment, and its advocacy for an outright ban on technologies that are fundamentally incompatible with human rights, such as facial recognition or other biometric technologies that enable mass surveillance.
