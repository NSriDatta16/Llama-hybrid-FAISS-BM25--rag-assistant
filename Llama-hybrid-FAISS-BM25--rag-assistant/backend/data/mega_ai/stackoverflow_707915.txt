It sounds like you're trying to take too much the easy way out. I would refactor those methods that were being used to do the direct database access, primarily by using an "Extract Method" refactoring. That would leave you with a (large) number of small methods, each accepting a set of parameters and returning a DataSet, and each with a specific purpose. You might find you want to refactor those further, to reduce the number or increase the level of abstraction. But if not, then you should then do the equivalent of extracting all of those methods into one or more interfaces. Those interfaces would become the ServiceContracts for your WCF service. Move the methods into the new services to implement these service contracts, and you're pretty much done. This works better with automated unit tests and good code coverage, of course. That will provide the level of confidence necessary to do something this radical.
