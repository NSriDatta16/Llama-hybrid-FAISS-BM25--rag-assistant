If you are using exclusive rankings (i.e., there can only be one #1, one #2, etc.) I would suggest that the most intuitive way for users to understand is, unfortunately, drag and drop. Having each row contain a radio button group that is as long as the number of rows would be confusing, and you would still need code to maintain the uniqueness of each rank.
