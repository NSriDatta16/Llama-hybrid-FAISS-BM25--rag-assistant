It sounds to me like a database is 100% what you need. It offers both the data storage, data retrieval (including queries) and the ability to export data to a standard format (either direct from the database, or through your application.) For a light database, I suggest SQLite (pronounced 'SQL Lite' ;) ). You can google for tutorials on how to set it up, and then how to interface with it via your C# code. I also found a reference to this C# wrapper for SQLite, which may be able to do much of the work for you!
