Add a column to an IEnumerable in c#

I don't think I can actually add a field (column) to an existing IEnumerable. But what I want is a new IEnumerable that is derived from an existing IEnumerable with a calculated field. The pseudocode in WebMatrix using Web Pages looks like: var db = Database.Open("LOS"); var ie = db.Query(sqlAssignments); // make a new ie2 that has an extra field // ??? ie2 I know how to do this looping through all the rows in ie. But I'm hoping there's something more elegant.
