As far as I know, when you use PanGestureRecognizer, you should reset it's translation to 0 every time you use it. So I would recommend you to rewrite this part of code like this: - (void)panPiece:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer { if ([gestureRecognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan || [gestureRecognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged) { CGPoint translation = [gestureRecognizer translationInView:self.view]; CGPoint textFieldCenter = textfieldToAdd.center; textfieldToAddCenter.x += translation.x; textfieldToAddCenter.y += translation.y; textfieldToAdd.center = textfieldCenter; [gestureRecognizer setTranslation:CGPointZero inView:self.view]; } } Another possible reason could be calling of layoutSubviews method of textField superview. Hope this'll help!
