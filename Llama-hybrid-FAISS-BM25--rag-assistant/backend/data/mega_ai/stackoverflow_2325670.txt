Draw polygon using mouse on google maps

I need to draw polygon using mouse and mark a particular area on Google maps. The purpose is to mark an area on Google maps and then showing hotels and attractions on that area. The user will mark the hotels on Google map while creating them so the db will have their latitude and longitudes. How can I draw the polygon and fill it with a color as background to mark the area in Google Maps? I have read the API Manual “how to draw polygons?” basically you would need to mark multiple points and then combine them into a polygon. But I will need to do this using mouse drag, just like drawing a shape. Kindly help me out how to achieve this.
