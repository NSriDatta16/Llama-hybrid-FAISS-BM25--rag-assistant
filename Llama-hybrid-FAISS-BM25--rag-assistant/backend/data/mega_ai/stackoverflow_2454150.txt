Two typical scenarios for views in our case are: Some columns in a table contain confidential data that should be only seen by a few people. You can create a view that excludes those columns and use that view for most users. You join two or more tables into a denormalised view that is practical for reporting purposes but would not make sense as a table for storage in the database. Hope this helps.
