Unless treatment was randomized or the treatment effect is constant (i.e., same for everyone), DID estimates the average effect for the treated units (ATET or ATT) rather than the average treatment effect for everyone (treated and untreated, aka ATE). Multiplying by the total sample size assumes that the effect for the treated applies to everyone. That is a strong assumption and will require some justification. Even if you are willing to do that, scaling by $N$ does not make sense to me if your effect is in percent. Say N=100. Is the aggregate product 300%? Perhaps you can spell out what you have in mind in more detail.
