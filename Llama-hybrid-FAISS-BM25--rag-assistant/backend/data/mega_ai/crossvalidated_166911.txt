If you need to limit the responses to positive values, you can construct a "tobit" model with the survreg function in Therneau's survival package for R. There is a worked example in the help page for ?survreg . This comes about because censoring and truncation have some commonalities. I realize this isn't the Bayesian answer you were looking for but it might be useful to have a frequentist alternative. It may also be helpful to use "tobit" as an additional search term.
