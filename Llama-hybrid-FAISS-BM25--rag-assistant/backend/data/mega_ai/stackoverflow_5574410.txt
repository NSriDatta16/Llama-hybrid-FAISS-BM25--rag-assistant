Layout Question about an iPhone app that uses css, Jquery and JQtouch

I'm learning how to build an iphone site using Johnathan Stark's O'Reilly Building iPhone Apps book. For the purposes of this question, you will be able to understand my problem by looking at it from the desktop at www.saudialberta.com . If you look at the home page, it has two panels, Dates and About . If you click on 'Dates,' it opens a new page with 6 days on it. Question: If you look at the html below, I'm trying to understand what allows the unordered list inside "Dates" to open on a new page, rather than just appear below "Dates" on the same page, and, for that matter, what allows the "p" element inside "About" to appear on a new page rather than just below the About div, as the html would suggest. Notice that there's no styling id or class on the "p" element inside the "about" div. Since "Dates" and "About" are both "toolbars" i'm guessing it's something in the toolbar css. The book also uses jqtouch and jquery, but there's nothing in those files (that I can see) that manipulates these html elements. Toolbar CSS .toolbar { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; padding: 10px; height: 45px; background: url(img/toolbar.png) #000000 repeat-x; position: relative; } .black-translucent .toolbar { margin-top: 20px; } .toolbar > h1 { position: absolute; overflow: hidden; left: 50%; top: 10px; line-height: 1em; margin: 1px 0 0 -75px; height: 40px; font-size: 20px; width: 150px; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,1) 0 -1px 1px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; color: #fff; } HTML Kilo Kilo Settings Dates About About Back Kilo gives you easy access to your food diary.
