While such configuration might work, it is particularly fragile and will lead to hard to understand code and hard to understand DI configuration. Convention over configuration is fine, but don't try to inject anything else than services. A double is not a service, it's a value. Here are three other approaches you might want to consider: Define one or multiple services with clear names that know how to return those values. For instance: public interface ISystemClock { DateTime Now { get; } } You can inject such service. Define an interface for the application's configuration: public interface IMyAppsConfiguration { double Value1 { get; } double Value2 { get; } double Value3 { get; } } Register the classes directly using Ninject. What's the best answer is hard to tell, because your question doesn't reveal much about what you are actually trying to inject. You are trying to inject doubles, but what do these doubles actually represent?
