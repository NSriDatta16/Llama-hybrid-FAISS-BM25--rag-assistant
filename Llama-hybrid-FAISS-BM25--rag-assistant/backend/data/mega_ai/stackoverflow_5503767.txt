I just tried out the HP/Palm/webOS Ares IDE, which lets you click and drag GUI elements and hook them up to JavaScript events. This is targeted at webOS devices, in that you can make JavaScript calls outside of the browser sandbox (similar to PhoneGap). But they claim they are targeting cross-platform web apps. Today they announced Enyo, which is the next generation of this, which claims to have vast improvements. I'm excited to evaluate it for general purpose HTML5 web app development.
