Creating line dividers in Android tab layout paragraphs

Hey all, first post and a noob in Android programming, but willing to learn! Basically I've taken the Google sample of a tab layout from here I found that method to be very easy to create tabs with text within each tab, but I'm trying to make it so that when a tab is selected, I want the text listed below to be separated by a dividing line. So that a line is dividing between each paragraph, however I'm having trouble doing this. This is what I have so far: main.xml: Here is the info in the java file: public class HelloTabWidget extends TabActivity { public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.main); TabHost mTabHost = getTabHost(); mTabHost.addTab(mTabHost.newTabSpec("tab_test1").setIndicator("TAB 1").setContent(R.id.textview1)); mTabHost.addTab(mTabHost.newTabSpec("tab_test2").setIndicator("TAB 2").setContent(R.id.textview2)); mTabHost.addTab(mTabHost.newTabSpec("tab_test3").setIndicator("TAB 3").setContent(R.id.textview3)); mTabHost.addTab(mTabHost.newTabSpec("tab_test4").setIndicator("TAB 4").setContent(R.id.textview4)); mTabHost.setCurrentTab(0); } } In main.xml I can get "this is the FIRST line of the 1st tab" on the first line, but "this is the SECOND line of the 1st tab" is showing up in the first line, and in all other tabs. Thanks in advance for any help, hopefully with my gained knowledge I can help others in the future.
