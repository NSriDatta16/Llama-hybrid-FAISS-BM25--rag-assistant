This isn't possible, but it's unrelated to static member constraints. Using normal generic constraints is equally doomed, for the same reason: // doesn't work let myUpcast 'b) (x: 'a) : 'b = unbox (box x) Basically F# does not allow type constraints involving two different type parameters; they are always constrained to be equal. See my answer to How to constrain one type parameter by another for more commentary.
