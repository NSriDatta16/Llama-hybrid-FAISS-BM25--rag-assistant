Where should I store my widget's preferences on the Configuration page on Android?

^Question^ I think that it would be too complex to open a database. Does using shared preferences make my app's data size become big. Is there a temporary storage place for my data or should I delete the data in the shared preferences for that widget. Short code samples are very appreciated :) Thank you
