Running single integration test quickly in Grails

Is it possible to quickly run single/all integration test in a class quickly in Grails. The test-app comes with heavy baggage of clearing of all compiled files and generating cobertura reports hence even if we run single integration test, the entire code base is compiled,instrumented and the cobertura report is getting generated. For our application this takes more than 2 minutes. If it was possible to quickly run one integration test and get a rapid feedbck, it would be immensely helpful. Also, is it important to clean up all the compiled files once the test is complete? This cleaning is fine if we run the entire set of integration test, but if we are going to run one or two tests in a class this cleaning and re-compiling seems to be a big bottleneck for quicker feedback to developers. Thanks
