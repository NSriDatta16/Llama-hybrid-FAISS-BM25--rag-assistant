Well you could also use databinding... seems a bit more elegant to me. Suppose you have two radiobuttons "rbA" and "rbB" and two textboxes "txtA" and "txtB". And you want to have txtA visible only when rbA is checked and txtB visible only when rbB is checked. You could do it like so : private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { txtA.DataBindings.Add("Visible", rbA, "Checked"); txtB.DataBindings.Add("Visible", rbB, "Checked"); } However... I observed that using UserControls instead of TextBoxes breaks the functionality and I should go read on the net why.. LATER EDIT : The databinding works two-ways! : If you programatically set (from somewhere else) the visibility of the txtA to false the rbA will become unchecked. That's the beauty of Databinding.
