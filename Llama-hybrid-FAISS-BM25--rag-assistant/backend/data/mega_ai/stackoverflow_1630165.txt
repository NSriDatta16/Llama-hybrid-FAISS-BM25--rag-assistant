Problem in LINQtoSQL with dual schema in Database

I have two tables, both named as say, Employee in two different schema HR and Production [i.e. dbo.HR.Employee and dbo.Production.Employee are my two database objects]. While dragging these two tables in LINQ to SQL design pane its generating two classes named Employee and Employee1. My ques: Is there any way I can create classes with Database schema name HR and Production in our case so that we can craete Employee class within that to replicate database schema?
