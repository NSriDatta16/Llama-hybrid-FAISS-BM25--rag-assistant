In real life, although the actual distribution is unknown, there are some hints if the normal approximation ("the $t$-statistic is $t_n$-distributed as if the data were normally distributed") is reasonable at moderate sample sizes or not. I assume you had to find the sample size $n$ for a $1-\alpha$-confidence interval for the parameter $E(X_i), i=1,\ldots,n$ that had to be $a\sqrt{E(X_i -E(X_i))^2}$ large. If the true distribution is not much apart from the normal distribution (in particular quite symmetric) and $\alpha$ is large enough, you can proceed the way your textbook solution suggested. In this case the normal approximation is pretty fast. Just simulate some distributions and watch how far the actual coverage of $\mu$ is missed by the $t$-based CI. This is also statistician's experience. If the true distribution is quite right-skewed, you can take the Berry-Esseen-Bound to adjust for possible liberalness due to nonormality and small sample size. Your conservative (i.e. $n$ may be too large, true coverage probability may be larger than $1-\alpha$) solution would then be the minimum integer $n$ solving $$ 2 t_{n-1,1-\frac{\alpha}{2}+\frac{C\rho}{\sigma^3 n}}\leq a\sigma$$
