How to interpret term cardinality?

An SRS document is provided describing various aspects of the end-product, system maintenance tool. The only paragraph I'm failing to understand is "Component Cardinality". What does this term mean in such context? The table looks like this: Component Cardinality ========================= Trigger | 1..* | 1..* Input | 1..1 | 1..* Transform | 1..* | 1..1 And the other one: Component | Configuration | Cardinality ======================================= Trigger | Schedule | 1 | Recurrence | 1 | Condition | 0..* Please help to interpret this properly. Many thanks
