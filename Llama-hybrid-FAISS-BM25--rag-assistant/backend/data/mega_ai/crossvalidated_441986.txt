Interpreting the Odds Ratio of a logistic regression model

I'm currently working on building a logistic regression model with the aim of predicting whether a given stock index will go up or down the following day. The table below shows the 3 models I've ran and the associated odds ratio's. The dependent variable in this study is the Direction of the stock market which can take 2 values - Up or Down. However, I'm struggling with how to interpret the odds ratio's of the independent variables. Specifically, how do I interpret the odds ratio associated with the variable Mu? The odds ratio for the variable Mu is 0.00000, how would do I interpret and explain what an odds ratio of 0.0000 means?
