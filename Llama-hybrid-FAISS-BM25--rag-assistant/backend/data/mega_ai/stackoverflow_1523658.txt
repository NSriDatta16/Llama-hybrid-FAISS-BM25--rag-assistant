Drupal OG Views: cannot create view of all groups of which I am *not* currently a member

(Also posted as http://drupal.org/node/596860 ) I would like to create a view showing only those groups of which I am not already a member (or a pending member). However, the obvious way of doing this (take the og_my view and change the filter "Organic groups: Group member" to false) does not work. The reason is that the SQL query essentially returns one row for every user in the group that matches your conditions. If you're searching for yourself (as in og_my), each group node will only show up once; if you're not searching for yourself, each group node shows up N times, where N is the number of other group members. Thus the groups of which I'm already a member continue to be displayed as long as there's at least one other member. Does anyone have a way around this? Thanks, Adrian
