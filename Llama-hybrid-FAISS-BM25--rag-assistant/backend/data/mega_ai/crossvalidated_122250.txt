Personally I remember the difference between precision and recall (a.k.a. sensitivity) by thinking about information retrieval: Recall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved, hence its name (in English recall = the action of remembering something). Precision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to the user's information need. Somehow you take a few shots and if most of them got their target (relevant documents) then you have a high precision, regardless of how many shots you fired (number of documents that got retrieved).
