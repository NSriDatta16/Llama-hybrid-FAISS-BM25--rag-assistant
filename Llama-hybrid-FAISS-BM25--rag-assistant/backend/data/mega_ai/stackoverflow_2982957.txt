Looking for more details about "Group varint encoding/decoding" presented in Jeff's slides

I noticed that in Jeff's slides "Challenges in Building Large-Scale Information Retrieval Systems", which can also be downloaded here: http://research.google.com/people/jeff/WSDM09-keynote.pdf , a method of integers compression called "group varint encoding" was mentioned. It was said much faster than 7 bits per byte integer encoding (2X more). I am very interested in this and looking for an implementation of this, or any more details that could help me implement this by myself. I am not a pro and new to this, and any help is welcome!
