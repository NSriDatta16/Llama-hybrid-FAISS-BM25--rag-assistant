By default the predict() method produces predictions conditional on the random effects, and this is why it asks for the trayid . You can get predictions only using the fixed-effects part of the model using predict(..., re.form = NA) . However, note that these are not marginal/population averaged predictions. I.e., they are not the average survival probabilities of the specific group of trees. If you want such average probabilities, have a look at the GLMMadaptive package, and in the vignette Methods for MixMod Objects that describes how you can obtain coefficients with a marginal intepretation using the marginal_coefs() function, and the corresponding predictions using the predict() method.
