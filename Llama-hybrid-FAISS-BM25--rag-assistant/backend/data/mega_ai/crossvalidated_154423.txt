There is a slightly better way of implementing IRWLS for kernel logistic regression that doesn't use the (weighted) normal equations and tends to have slightly better numerical properties. It basically fits the KLR model as a sequence of weighted Least-Squares Support Vector Machines (but with the logistic link function). There is a full derivation of this procedure in my paper (1) on approximate leave-one-out cross-validation for kernel logistic regression. If you use MATLAB, there is a toolbox that implements this approach. HTH (1) G. C. Cawley and N. L. C. Talbot, Efficient approximate leave-one-out cross-validation for kernel logistic regression, Machine Learning, vol, 71, no. 2-3, pp. 243--264, June 2008. ( doi , pre-print )
