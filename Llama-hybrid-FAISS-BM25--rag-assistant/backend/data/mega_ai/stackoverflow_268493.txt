Microsoft's Exchange server has support for Public Folders, email lists/groups. This may be an easy introduction to collaboration for your environment, using tools that are familiar. From the Microsoft Help on Public Folders: Public folders are an easy and effective way to collect, organize, and share information with other people in your workgroup or organization. You can use public folders to share files or post information on an electronic bulletin board. I'm not sure how effective the tools for managing those "lists" are - I'm not sure if you can mark responses such that all users see the mark, for example. But it is probably a good start. As people start to see the value of collaboration, something along the lines of a Wiki becomes more appealing. I've got to say that Confluence , especially now that editing with Open Office or Microsoft Office tools is possible really deserves a look. Not free (as in beer).
