Generating a static library

I want to know the step by step process of creating a static library (.a file) so that it could be exposed to other projects. This is how I am doing it right now: Right click on "Targets" --> Add --> New Target. Choose "Static Library" --> Next --> Gave some name & Finish Added build dependencies Dragged the header file to be exposed for other projects to "Copy headers" Dragged and dropped all the files to be compiled under "Compile Sources" Dragged and dropped the libraries in "Link Binary With Libraries". What is next? How to get the .a file after this and if there is a script from where do I need to run it?
