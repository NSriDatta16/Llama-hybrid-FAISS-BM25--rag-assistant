How is the reproductive number R being calculated?

The reproductive number $R(t)$ quantifies the expected number of secondary infections caused by an infected individual at time $t$ . Thus, an R number below 1 will be likely to stop a disease like Corona. Is there a gold standard how to calculate $R(t)$ based on daily time series data? What are the most established approaches? I am not interested in answers like "blindly use function X in package Y" but rather in specific formulas or approaches.
