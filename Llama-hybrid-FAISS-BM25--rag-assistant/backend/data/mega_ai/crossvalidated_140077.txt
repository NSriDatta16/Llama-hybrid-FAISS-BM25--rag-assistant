Derive the Gibbs sampler for this bivariate distribution

I understand the theory of Gibbs sampling. It is an iterative sampling algorithm that defines, sequence of random variables with the property of a Markov chain. Specifically, I choose any starting value, $(x_0, y_0)$ and discard the initial samples if my guess is poor (known as burn-in), then sample $x_1 \sim p(x|y_0)$ and $y_1 \sim p(y|x_1)$ for the first iteration. How do I derive the Gibbs sampler for the bivariate distribution with pdf: $p(x,y) \propto \mathbb{1}(|x - y| In the examples I've seen online, like on page 3 of Casella's 1992 paper ( http://biostat.jhsph.edu/~mmccall/articles/casella_1992.pdf ), the conditional distributions can be written as a known distribution with varying parameters. In the bivariate pdf above, I don't see how the indicator functions can be interpreted as a known distribution. Specifically, how do I solve for $p(x|y)$ and $p(y|x)$? My work thus far: \begin{equation} \begin{array}{lcl} p(x,y) &\propto & p(x|y) \\[2ex] &\propto & \mathbb{1}(-c
