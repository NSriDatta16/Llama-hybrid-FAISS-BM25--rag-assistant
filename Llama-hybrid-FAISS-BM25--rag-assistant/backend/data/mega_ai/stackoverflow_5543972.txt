Get fully-qualified name of an OU

I have a code to get the list of OUs within a domain. Now this just lists all the OUs and does not give any way to distinguish between an OU and a sub OU. DirectoryEntry entry = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://" + domain); DirectorySearcher mySearcher = new DirectorySearcher(entry); mySearcher.Filter = ("(objectClass=organizationalUnit)"); foreach (SearchResult temp in mySearcher.FindAll()) { OU_DownList.Items.Add(temp.Properties["name"][0].ToString()); } Is there a way i can get the fully qualified name of an OU? Something like this for a sub OU: CN=Computer1,OU=Department 101,OU=Business Unit #1,DC=us,DC=xyz,DC=com Any help is appreciated... thanks
