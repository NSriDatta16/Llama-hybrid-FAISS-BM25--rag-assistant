HTML usability question - (double) clicking to select text

As you well know, double clicking on a word in a browser selects it, triple clicking selects the entire paragraph. I'm tweaking a wiki, where signatures for anonymous users are created automatically and they look like: --- // // The "---" generates a â€” , // is for italic text and generates . This is how it works now, as I tweaked it. Now I'm wondering about the usability. My question is: how to generate the markup such that upon a double click on the ip address, the whole address and only the address will be selected? The markup language doesn't matter, you may provide a solution in HTML, but one specific for wikis (dokuwiki) is preferable. Thanks
