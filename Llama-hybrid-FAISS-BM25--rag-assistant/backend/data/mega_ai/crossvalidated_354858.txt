It is dangerous to think about frequency weights and probability weights as the same... or even similar. In terms of estimation, yes, you would see estimating equations defined as $$ \sum_{j\in\mbox{ sample}} w_j g(y_j,\theta) = 0 \Rightarrow \hat\theta $$ but I would never equate probability weights and frequency weights in any text I would write. I very reluctantly explain how to use Stata to produce say histograms with weighted data (because hist does not support [pw] ... duh...), but I would put all sorts of red circles around that. The formula on page 6 for the variance estimator is really obscure, and basically helps nothing; the author is an economist, so he wants to make everything like like an "auxiliary" regression. Instead, I would write things explicitly. First, the "bread" of the sandwich is $X'(\mathop{\rm diag} w_j) X$, the estimate of the population $X'X$ matrix. Second, the "meat" of the sandwich is $\sum_j w_j e_j^2 x_j x_j'$, the estimate of the variance of the estimating equations. Third, the regression degrees of freedom correction may or may not be in place. To really understand what pweights do (and with all due respect, clustered and stratified samples are very different, so again I would not put these two concepts with a slash in one sentence), you need to go into the foundations of sampling inference. It runs very counter to economists' "the world is a model" viewpoint, and goes with the view that the world is fixed, all $y_i$s and $x_i$s are fixed, and the only randomness is in the sampling inclusion indicators. (Truth be told, when economists talk about "$y_i$ and $x_i$ coming from some undefined population", and then ending up with sandwich formulas, they actually think more like sampling statisticians; more amazing that economists refuse to get familiar with that literature, and invent their own circular propulsion devices instead; the "black" Wooldridge, while an excellent econometrics book, has three wrong definitions in the opening paragraph of the "survey analysis" chapter which is really aggravating as we have to teach economists to unlearn wrong terms and concepts before they can make sense of survey statistics when they start working with surveys and official statistics production.) Sharon Lohr's book and Korn and Graubard are good places to start, and if you want to go (way) deeper into asymptotics and Edgeworth expansions and higher order properties, there's Fuller (same Fuller as Dickey-Fuller test), Mary Thompson and Sarndall et al .
