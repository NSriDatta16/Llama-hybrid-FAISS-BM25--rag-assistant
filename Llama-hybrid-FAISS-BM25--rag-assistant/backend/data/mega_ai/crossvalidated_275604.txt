$u_j$ is the deviation from the average predicted score due to the influence of which hospital someone was in. Just like $e_{ij}$ is the deviation from the averaged predicted score of someone in a specific hospital for an individual. $\sigma^2_{u_j}$ is the variance of the intercept. Each hospital has its own intercept. Your output (I'm nearly certain, but it would help if you posted the output from the model you ran) means that the average intercept is 1.89, with a variance of .037. That variance shows that it is a random effect, and thus you have already "calculated the random effects." As far as predicted scores go, you can slice it a couple of ways. I'll stick with keeping hours worked constant, saying we want to predict well-being for someone who worked 15 hours. The well-being of any particular person in the sample—who worked 15 hours—would best be predicted by (that is, the expected value of $y_{ij}$, the well-being score): $WBSCORE_{ij}$ = 1.886 + 1.095 + $u_j$ + $e_{ij}$ Now, each hospital has its own intercept. So you can add on another constant, which varies by hospital. If you are using the lme4 package and have fit an lmer() object, you can extract these random effects for a model (let's give it the name mod1 for now, and the cluster variable called hospital ) by entering: coef(mod1)$hospital Let's say you want the predicted score for the average person in Hospital 12. You can check that output and, let's say you find that Hospital 12 has a random intercept value of -0.20. You would simply fill that in the place of $u_j$, as in this case $u_j$ = $u_5$ = -0.20. So you have the equation: $WBSCORE_{i5}$ = 1.886 + 1.095 - 0.20 + $e_{ij}$ So, to address, your last point, no, the expected value of well-being score is not: $WBSCORE_{ij}$ = 1.886 + 1.095 + 0.037 + 0.347 Those last two terms are variance estimates (again, to be 100% certain, I would have to see the output) and are random (or residual) terms whose expected value is 0: $E(y_{ij})$ = 1.886 + 0.073*$HOURS_{ij}$ + $u_j$ + $e_{ij}$ Since the expected values of the last two are 0, you simply have: $E(y_{ij})$ = 1.886 + 0.073*$HOURS_{ij}$
