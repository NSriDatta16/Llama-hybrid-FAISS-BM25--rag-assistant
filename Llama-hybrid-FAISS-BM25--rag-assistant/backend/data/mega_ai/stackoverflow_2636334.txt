You can use the -p ( --page-prerequisites ) flag to tell wget to retrieve linked resources. From man wget : This option causes Wget to download all the files that are necessary to properly display a given HTML page. This includes such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets. You might also look at the --follow-tags option, which lets you limit that process: Wget has an internal table of HTML tag / attribute pairs that it considers when looking for linked documents during a recursive retrieval. If a user wants only a subset of those tags to be considered, however, he or she should be specify such tags in a comma-separated list with this option.
