Maybe I'm little bit late with the answer, but probably it would be useful for some body in the future. Adaptive Resonance Theory is a good algorithm for binary classification problems. You can read more about ART 1 (i.e. Neural Network Design book in chapter 19). The algorithm is quite easy to implement and, in the book, you can also find step-by-step instruction on how to build the classifier.
