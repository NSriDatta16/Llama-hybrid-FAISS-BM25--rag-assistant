No, they don't have the same ability. The fact that the middle layer has only 2 nodes in one and 3 in your other case is fundamental to the capacity of the network. It's similar than just simple principal components analysis. 2 components will to be able to describe as much of the variability of an ensemble than 3 components. Mathematically, the cardinal of real values is not the cardinal of complex values and you have the same problem with the size of 2 real numbers with 3 numbers. You cannot describe triplets of real numbers with duplets. This reduction is also the basis of autoencoders, if such an equivalence were true, then we would not be able to talk about dimensionality of the embedded space.
