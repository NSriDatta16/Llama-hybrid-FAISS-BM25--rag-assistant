What is the intuition behind larger number of samples are better for statistics? This is because the larger the sample, the most likely it is to be a faithful representation of the full population. Formally this is a consequence of the law of large numbers : In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.
