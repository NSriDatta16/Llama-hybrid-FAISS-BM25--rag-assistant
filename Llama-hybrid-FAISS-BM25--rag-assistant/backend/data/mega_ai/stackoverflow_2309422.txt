Putting Javascript through the PHP interpreter is probably not a good idea. Likewise, CSS It encourages the antipattern of having server-side code writing client side code It makes it harder to test the JS and CSS in isolation (if they start being full of PHP code) It makes the PHP output bigger Clients will not cache part of a page, only a whole object To expand on the last part - Javascript and CSS can get big (compared to HTML). If you have the client browser cache them, it does not need to download them. True, including in the main document means there is no separate request which reduces overhead (particularly with SSL), but the client still needs to download the file. Having it coming from client cache is usually faster. On the other hand, your code var foo = ; Looks like it's a piece of data, not Javascript code, so it might vary. You may also want to escape $bar correctly.
