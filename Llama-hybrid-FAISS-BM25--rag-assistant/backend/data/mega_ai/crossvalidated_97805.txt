Is highly correlated factors in a prediction model a problem?

I have built a logistic regression model with two or more highly correlated factors. I did this by doing a bagging procedure. In my understanding having highly correlated factors in a prediction model is not an issue (especially after bagging). But in a model where you are trying to explain the target, this could be an issue. I remember something like the above was stated in a machine book but I can't find it. Do you guys agree with this viewpoint and can point me to a reference or two on this?
