OK, answering my own question... hate doing it but I got the answer after much digging. http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joshuaflanagan/archive/2009/04/27/asp-net-400-bad-request-with-restricted-characters.aspx The long and short of it is the Microsoft in all its glory decided not to stick to a international standard, again. %, &, *, or : can not be in a URL, encoded or decoded before a ? for any reason. To get around this I've written my own encode and decode: static public string UrlEncode(string encode) { if (encode == null) return null; string encoded = ""; foreach (char c in encode) { int val = (int)c; if (val == 32 || val == 45 || (val >= 48 && val = 65 && val = 97 && val Neither of the functions are Unicode friendly at the moment, but for now it works.
