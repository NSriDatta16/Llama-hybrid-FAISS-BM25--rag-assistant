Machine Learning and Flow Maximization

Has anyone ever seen machine learning (ML) used to assist a Max Flow algorithm? I have a very large directed graph that has some fractal characteristics, meaning that this large graph can be roughly split into smaller ones. I was wondering if I could run a Max Flow into one of this smaller instances and use this knowledge to train an ML system as to what nodes participate in the max flow solution and what nodes don't (feeding info such as node degree, reachability to some other node, etc, etc). Thus, I could then use this trained system to give me hints of what nodes should I prune from the large graph or to what edges should I push flow... Has anyone ever heard of anything like that?
