When you use time dummies, you don't need a time dummy for every individual separately but for every year. So this leaves you with 28 time dummies and 997 individual dummies (always omitting the first year and first individual to avoid the dummy variable trap). The solution to your problem is much simpler than what the other answer suggested here. If you read any introductory text on panel data (you can start with these lecture notes ), you should acquaint yourself with the fixed effects estimator which is sometimes referred to as the within estimator as well. The procedure is as follows: average each variable over time for each individual, e.g. $\overline{y}_i = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{29}y_{it}$ and $\overline{x}_i = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{29}x_{it}$ subtract this individual mean from each observation, $\tilde{y}_{it} = y_{it} - \overline{y}_{i}$ and $\tilde{x}_{it} = x_{it} - \overline{x}_i$ regress $\tilde{y}_{it}$ on $\tilde{x}_{it}$ and you year dummies, and cluster the standard errors on the individual's ID to account for serial correlation Even though it is not very apparent, Mundlak (1978) has shown that this procedure is equivalent to including a dummy for every individual minus 1 (again omitting the first individual) as you propose it. The advantage is obvious: you don't need all those dummies when you use this three step procedure which is called the "within transformation". Most statistical software have ready canned packages/routines for this type of estimation as it is fairly standard. In Stata you would simply declare your data to be a panel data set which allows you to use the corresponding panel data regression and data analysis commands. For example: webuse nlswork tsset idcode year xtreg ln_wage age union i.year, cluster(idcode) Where i.year automatically inserts your year dummies for the regression. So with 29 years you lose 28 degrees of freedom which isn't awful. A nice introduction to the topic is Wooldridge, J.
