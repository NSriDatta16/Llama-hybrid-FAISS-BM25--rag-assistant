No. Yes. http://symfony.com/download http://symfony-reloaded.org/learn Quote from above link: Please note that Symfony 2 is not yet ready for production. The final release is planned for late 2010 and will only support PHP 5.3.2. In the meantime, we highly encourage you to use the current symfony 1.4 stable release for all your projects.
