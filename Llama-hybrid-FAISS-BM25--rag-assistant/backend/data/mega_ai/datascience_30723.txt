I assume that when you say values that are originally small get changed the same ratio you are standardizing your features so that every dimension is on the same scale from [-1,1] This is common practice as it helps many models converge faster. It would not prevent your models from generalizing the data, so here are some other possible causes for your problem: The ML algorithm you are using is not appropriate for your task The data is either insufficient in quantity or quality (e.g. noisy data) The preprocessing stage is lacking some steps such as dimensionality reduction
