In general, boosting error can increase with the number of iterations, specifically when the data is noisy (e.g. mislabeled cases). I wouldn't be able to say if this is your problem without knowing more about your data Basically, boosting can 'focus' on correctly predicting cases that contain misinformation, and in the process, deteriorate the average performance on other cases that are more substantive. This link ( Boosting and Noise ) shows a better description than I can provide of the issue. This paper ( Random Classification Noise ) by Long and Servedio provides more technical details of the issue.
