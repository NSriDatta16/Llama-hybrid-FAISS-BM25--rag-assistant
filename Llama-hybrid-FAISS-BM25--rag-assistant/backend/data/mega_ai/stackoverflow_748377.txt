How do you make a multi-module spring configuration?

I have a multi-module (maven) spring build. All the modules publish some beans, and most also consume beans defined further down the dependency graph. Although most of it is annotation declared beans, almost every module also has one or two xml-declared beans. Although we have a half-decent solution, but I am really wondering what is the correct/optimal way to organize the xml files in this scenario? Do you use import between the modules or is there some other way ? Do you put all the xml files in one place or spread them around according to the dependency graph? How does your solution handle partial spring contexts (typical integration tests) ? I'd also like to have this organized in a way that lets me leverage my IDE's spring support optimally (IDEA and a few eclipse users).
