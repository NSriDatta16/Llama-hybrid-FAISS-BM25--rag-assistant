SL4: How do I change the scale w/o scrolling the canvas?

We have a large canvas contained in a scrollviewer. The user can move the canvas by dragging with the mouse, or using the scrollbars. How can we change the zoom (scale) in the scrollviewer while keeping the current center point? I think the issue is getting the correct CenterX and CenterY for the ScaleTransform: var st = MapCanvas.RenderTransform as ScaleTransform; if (null != st) { st.CenterX = point.X; st.CenterY = point.Y; st.ScaleX = st.ScaleY = scale; } Thanks for any hints...
