Is it OK to have a precision value of 100% in text retrieval system?

Since the formula for precision is : retrieved_and_relevant/(retrieved_and_relevant+retrieved_and_irrelevant) I am wondering if the value for precision in a text-retrieval system will ever be different from 100%. I think so because, all we programmers put a hell lot of effort in not forgetting to squeeze each and every text of all documents out there. So, when a query text is fired into the text retrieval system, it will output all the documents containing the query text. This means that all those documents retrieved are relevant documents; essentially making the score of 100%. Is this true or am I missing some point ?
