This happens pretty frequently when running Tomcat inside Eclipse during debug sessions etc. From memory, it's an issue with the Sun JVM. Annnyway, there's an easy fix: Just add the following below your -vmargs in eclipse.ini (which is in the same directory as your eclipse binary): -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled This will enable a more aggressive garbage collection while running Eclipse, and is a more elegant solution than just throwing more RAM at Eclipse. Hope this helps!
