How to combine short term and long term time series?

I need to combine two traffic data series which are long term ( with 15 S / 30 S/1 minute interval) and short term( with 2 S/ 3 s) for my research purpose. These two types of data series reflect different traffic dynamics. What would be the best way to do it/ what would be the most suitable technique?
