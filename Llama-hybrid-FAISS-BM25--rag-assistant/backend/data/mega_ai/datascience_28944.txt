Plots getting rid of whitespace

So I'm doing the Udemy course for Data Science in Python, and there's something weird happening with the plots. The first one in the above picture is mine, the second is the instructors. How do I get rid of the white space on the sides, they seem to be default when using the plotting function in pandas. Edit: This is all the code. Everything is basically default, so I'm guessing the matplotlib has some default settings changed in newer version of the package. The file df3 is here https://github.com/sxsheng/Udemy Code: import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt df3 = pd.read_csv('df3') %matplotlib inline (This line is to be used in jupyter notebooks to display plots) df3['a'].plot.hist()
