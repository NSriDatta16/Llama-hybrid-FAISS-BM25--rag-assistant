From Wikipedia : Varchar fields can be of any size up to the limit. The limit differs from types of databases, an Oracle 9i Database has a limit of 4000 bytes, a MySQL Database has a limit of 65,535 bytes (for the entire row) and Microsoft SQL Server 2005 8000 bytes (unless varchar(max) is used, which has a maximum storage capacity of 2,147,483,648 bytes).
