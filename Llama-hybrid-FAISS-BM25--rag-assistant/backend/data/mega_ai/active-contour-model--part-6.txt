It has inspired tremendous progress in the related fields, and using numerical methods to solve the level-set reformulation is now commonly known as the level-set method. Although the level set method has become quite a popular tool for implementing active contours, Wang and Chan argued that not all curve evolution equations should be directly solved by it. More recent developments in active contours address modeling of regional properties, incorporation of flexible shape priors and fully automatic segmentation, etc. Statistical models combining local and global features have been formulated by Lankton and Allen Tannenbaum. Relations to graph cuts Graph cuts, or max-flow/min-cut, is a generic method for minimizing a particular form of energy called Markov random field (MRF) energy. The Graph cuts method has been applied to image segmentation as well, and it sometimes outperforms the level set method when the model is MRF or can be approximated by MRF.
