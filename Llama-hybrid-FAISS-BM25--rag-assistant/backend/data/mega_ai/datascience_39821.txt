Binary classificaiton for weather data if its class 1 or class 0 alert

I am working on weather data and it has few features that are independent variables such as severity , severity_id , urgency_id etc ... Based on these values, I would like to classify alerts into class 0 or 1. For example, below is row item from data source Alert | Severity | Sev_Id | Urg_Id | Event | Sys_Rec(Target Variable) -------------------------------------------------------------------------- dummy | Extreme | 1 | 1 | STORM | 1 dummy | Minor | 3 | 5 | RIPTIDE | 0 dummy | Extreme | 1 | 1 | HURRICANE| 1 For severity_id 1 it should be class 1 (Yes) and for others its class 0 (No).The objective is to build a general binary classifier using decision trees. So I started with DTClassifier, but later I realized it could also be done with logistic regression. I am confused which would be a better fit for this kind of data for classification. Please advice and give me some starting points.
