designing picture puzzle

I am planning to develop a jigsaw puzzle game. Now I already have images and image pieces, so we don't need algorithm to cut the image in pieces. On the UI side there would be two sections First section contains the broken images in random order. Second section contains the outline of the full image. User need to drag and drop the the cut images onto the outline image. I am not sure how can the pieces be matched on the the outline image? Any idea about the algorithm or the starting pointers?
