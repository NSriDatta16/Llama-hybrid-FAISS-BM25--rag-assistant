Scala syntactic sugar with java listener pattern

I have to use java code in my scala project. The java code encourages the usage of a listener pattern. The code is something like this: asyncHttpClient.prepareGet("http://www.ning.com/ ").execute(new AsyncCompletionHandler (){ @Override public Response onCompleted(Response response) throws Exception{ // Do something with the Response // ... return response; } @Override public void onThrowable(Throwable t){ // Something wrong happened. } }); I am wondering if it is possible to use anything better in scala with this code. I know there is a paper written by Martin Odersky saying that observer pattern is bad but I didn't go deep with the matter. Thanks
