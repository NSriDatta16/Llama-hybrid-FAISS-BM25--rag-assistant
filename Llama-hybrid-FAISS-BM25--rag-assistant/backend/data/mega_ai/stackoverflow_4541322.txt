The PCI-DSS applies whenever an organisation stores, processes or transmits payment card data. Payment cards are Visa, MasterCard, JCB, American Express and Diners International branded cards. Compliance with PCI-DSS is measured either by a self assessment for small organisations or through an on-site assessment by a QSA for larger organisations. The size cut-offs are determined by the card schemes and based on the number of transactions that an organisation is involved with. Associated standards are PA-DSS and PTS-DSS for payment applications and PIN transaction security. All of these standards are set and maintained by the PCI Security Standards Council . Compliance with the standards is mandated by the various card schemes but is communicated through acquiring banks or other parties. Failure to comply to PCI-DSS can result in fines or other sanctions. Latest version of PCI standards PCI DSS 3.2.1
