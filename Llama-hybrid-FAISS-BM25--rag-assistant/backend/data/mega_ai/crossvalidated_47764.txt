Understanding the bivariate Poisson distribution

Researching bivariate Poisson over the web is no easy task unless you can make sense of the Greek symbols. I am familiar with Poisson and have a deep understanding of it. So could someone explain bivariate Poisson with its formula so that I can fathom it. My whole model it seems should be based on bivariate Poisson and not Poisson. I have found this paper to be helpful but am still struggling: "Bayesian and Non-Bayesian Analysis of Soccer Data using Bivariate Poisson Regression Models" by D. Karlis and J. Ntzoufras. I understand that the univariate model treats each teams goal scoring as a stand-alone independent process. Thus, the probability of the home team scoring ($\text{HG}$) 1 goal is the same whether the away team scores ($\text{AG}$) 0,1,2 or 10 goals, i.e.: $$p(\text{HG}=\alpha, \text{AG}=x) = p(\text{HG}=\alpha, \text{AG}=y) \quad \text{for all $\alpha$, $x$ and $y$}$$ So the expression above is independent of $x$: $$p(\text{HG}=\alpha,\text{AG}=x)=f(\alpha) \quad \text{for all $x$}$$ With the bivariate distribution, the probability function is a function of both the home and away scores. This allows a dependency between the home and away scores to be included in the model. But I would appreciate it if someone gave a complete example with a working out as it will help my get a thorough understanding of bivariate Poisson.
