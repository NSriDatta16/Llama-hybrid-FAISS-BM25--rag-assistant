Using the reader monad in snap (or, monad transformers in snap)

Can someone show how to use the snap monad inside the reader monad? Monad transformers confuse me. (Alternatively, I will gladly accept suggestions of tutorials about monad transformers, and ways to see the light and finally grok them.) Edit: Oops; forgot to specify what I'm actually trying to do, instead of asking for help with a specific thing. Strategy, not tactics. I specifically want to share a database connection/pool amongst all handlers, without having to explicitly pass that database connection/pool when specifying routes. It seems that the reader monad would be the way to accomplish that.
