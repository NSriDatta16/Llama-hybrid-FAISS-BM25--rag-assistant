Product price prediction - include important external factors

I need some hint over what is the general prediction solution to modelling products prices in such a case: I have several models (types) of the product I want to predict prices for each of these models separatedly, for a few weeks long time window I have great historical data for each of the model from last 1-2y (which makes time series analysis my first obvious choice, doesn't it?) I know there is a number of external factors which may have a VERY important and immediate effect on the product price (possibly more or less different for each model); My questions are: Is time series prediction a good way to follow? Maybe some kind of regression would be more approproate in this case? Which approach to choose to include these external factors effects in the best way?
