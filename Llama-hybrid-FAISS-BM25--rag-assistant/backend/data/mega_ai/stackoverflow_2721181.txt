Java JEditorPane Format

im trying to implement a Chat feature in my application. i have used 2 JEditorPane. one for holding chat history and the other for sending chat to the previous JEditorPane. the JEditorPane is text/html type. the problem i am having is when i put more than one space between characters it is automatically removed by the parser because it is HTML! how can i make it so, that the spaces are not stripped? example: hello world becomes: hello world also i am having to parse the html tags so the new messages can be added to the history window. is there a better option than using JEditorPane? if i used JTextPane would it be easier to implement? i would like the chat boxes/panes to be able to handle bold, URL embedding for now. thank you and look forward to your guidance. EDIT: im trying to replace " " with a relavent char. newHome[1] = newHome[1].replace(" ", newChar) what should be the newChar value? EDIT: im trying: newHome[1] = newHome[1].replaceAll(" ", "&nbsp;"); but it is not producing the results. any ideas? EDIT: @Thomas - thanks! for some reason i can post a note to your answer.
