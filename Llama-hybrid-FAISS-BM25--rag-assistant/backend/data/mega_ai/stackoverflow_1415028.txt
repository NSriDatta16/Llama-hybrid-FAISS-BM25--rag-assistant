We sure like to admire our nice code, but it's not always easy to know what to admire. Complicated and elaborate code is sometimes mistaken for admirable code, while elegance and simplicity should rather be what to strive for. Two quotes come to mind: "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.‚Äù -- Brian Kernighan and "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler." -- Albert Einstein
