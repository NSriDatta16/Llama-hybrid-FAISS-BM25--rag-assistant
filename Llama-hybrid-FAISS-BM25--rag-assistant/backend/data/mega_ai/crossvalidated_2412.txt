You might consider using Breiman's bagging or random forests . One good reference is Breiman "Bagging Predictors" (1996). Also summarized in Clifton Sutton's "Classification and Regression Trees, Bagging, and Boosting" in the Handbook of Statistics. You can also see Andy Liaw and Matthew Wiener R News discussion of the randomForest package.
