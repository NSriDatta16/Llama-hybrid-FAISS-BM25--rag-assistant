Expires is an HTTP header field that cannot be set by jQuery. But you could try to add an HTTP equivalent META element : $("head").append(' ') But it depends on the user agent if such an HTTP equivalent META element is recognized. The better way would be to set that in the HTTP header. By the way: In HTTP 1.1 the Cache-Control header field with max-age parameter is preferred over Expires (see Modifications of the Basic Expiration Mechanism ).
