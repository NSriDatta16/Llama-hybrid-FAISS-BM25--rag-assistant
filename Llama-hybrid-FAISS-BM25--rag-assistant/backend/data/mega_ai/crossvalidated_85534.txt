I've played with the max-depth parameter extensively and I think that they provide this in case your data set is large. In those instances, it may take a very long time for the trees to be fully grown. This is then compounded if you then ask for many trees (say, 1000+). Also, it is important to note that the Random Forest code actually uses the Decision Tree code for generating its trees and there's actually a hard coded maximum value for the max-depth parameter (which is set to 25). In other words, if you specify any value larger than 25 then it will just change your parameter to max-depth=25. It is possible to change the source code and then recompile (I've done this).
