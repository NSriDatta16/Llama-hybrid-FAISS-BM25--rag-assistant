Tensorflow (or Keras) vs. Pytorch vs. some other ML library for implementing a CNN

I am looking into implementing a convolutional neural network for a research problem. I've heard of deep learning libraries like Pytorch and Tensorflow and was hoping to get some additional information about their suitability for my needs. I haven't looked much into Pytorch, and have only briefly read about Tensorflow. I don't hear very nice things about Tensorflow in terms of ease of use. I hear Pytorch is easier to use. But there seems to be more tutorials for Tensorflow, and specifically for creating CNNs. What sort of questions should I be asking myself in determining which library would best suit my needs?
