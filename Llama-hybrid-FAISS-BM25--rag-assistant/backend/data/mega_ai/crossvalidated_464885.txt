Time series regressions

I'm trying to make a basic scatter plot/regression to look at the relationship between two time series. Series a is volume of mentions of a product on a forum over time, series b is the sales of the product over time. The series are at the weekly level, with matching dates, across four years. I'm interested to know if there is a relationship between greater mentions and sales (obviously there is no direct causal relationship, they are likely both being mediated by another variable; however, that investigation will come at a later dateâ€”for now I just want to see if there exists a relationship). My first method was to difference the data to remove the trend and seasonality and then run a regression on the variables. My second method was to decompose both series and then regress over the residuals/remainder of the decomposition. My third was just only detrending the data (basic linear detrend). What's making me think twice, is that the products in some cases are seasonal so maybe I shouldn't be deseasonalising them; however, at the same time I feel like I should be more interested in the relationship regardless of seasonality. I'm confident I should be detrending so as to get rid of any spurious correlations from just general growth in numbers; however, I'm in two minds about removing the seasonality. Obviously with it left in we see a stronger relationship than with removed. Question one: is it appropriate to regress over the residuals of a decomposition (I can't seem to find a good steer on this; however, I don't see anything inherently wrong with this)? Question two: should I be sometimes detrending and sometimes differencing depending in the results of the KPSS and ADF tests? Question three: should i be deseasonalising? My gut said yes, now it says no.
