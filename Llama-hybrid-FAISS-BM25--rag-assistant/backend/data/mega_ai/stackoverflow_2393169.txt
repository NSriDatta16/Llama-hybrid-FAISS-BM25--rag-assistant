I was trying to run from the wrong part of the project since my toolbar was not hooked up correctly. I am still working out the details and I will edit this when I figure it out completely. First of all, this was a new workspace that I wanted to create to organize my different unrelated projects. As a result, the RUN of the toolbar did not have a target configured (i.e., in the history), so it tried to run my main.xml file. Right-click on one of the *.java files and select 'run as...' then you can create a run configuration with its target (pick or create an AVD), the project, etc. I recommend visiting each of the tabs and review the defaults for your situation. Then, sit back and wait for the emulator to load for the first time (mine took about 1 to 2 minutes on a Macbook).
