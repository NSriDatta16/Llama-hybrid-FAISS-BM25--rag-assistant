The literature is vast. Experimental evidence is abundant but incomplete. For an introduction that focuses on the psychological and semiotic investigations, see Alan M. MacEachren, How Maps Work (1995; 2004 in paperback). Jump directly to chapter 9 (near the end) and then work backwards through any preliminary material that interests you. The bibliography is extensive (over 400 documents) but is getting a little long in the tooth. Although the title suggests a focus on cartography, most of the book is relevant to how humans create meaning out of and interpret graphical information. Don't expect to get a definitive answer out of any amount of such research. Remember that Tufte, Cleveland, and others were primarily focused on creating graphics that enable (above all) accurate, insightful communication of and interpretation of data. Other graphics artists and researchers have other aims, such as influencing people, creating effective propaganda, simplifying complex datasets, and expressing their artistic sensibilities within a graphical medium. These are almost diametrically opposed to the first set of objectives, whence the hugely differing approaches and recommendations you will find. Given this, I think a review of Cleveland's research should be sufficiently convincing that many of Tufte's design recommendations have decent experimental justification. These include his use of the Lie Factor, the Data-Ink Ratio, small multiples, and chartjunk for critically evaluating and designing statistical graphics.
