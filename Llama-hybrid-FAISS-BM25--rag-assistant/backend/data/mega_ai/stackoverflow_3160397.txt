:with option in thinking sphinx. First of all, you have to define those attributes in your index definition ( check out attributes section here ). has views_count, :as => :views, :type => :integer has user.id, :as => :user, :type => :integer Then you could search for posts like this: Post.search '', :with => {:views => 12..maxint, :user => User.first.id} (I am not sure if there is any more elegant possibility of giving open ranges, but 12..max_int should be enough) Two important things: if you want to count related objects (e.g. responses), you should use counter cache if your "user" is polymorphic association, I recommend "CRC32(CONCAT(user_type, user_id))" instead of user.id
