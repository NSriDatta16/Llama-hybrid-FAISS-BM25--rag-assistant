Derive cauchy distribution as a scale mixture of normal distributions

I doing Bayesian modelling these days. I found that cauchy distribution can be written as a scale mixture of normal based on following source. Link So I started to derive this. Somehow, I am not getting what I want. I am trying to prove the third implementation in the above source. It says : $Cauchy(x|0,1)=\int N(x|0,\tau^{-1/2})InvGamma(\tau|1/2,1/2)d\tau$ Or in other words $X=x_a*\sqrt{x_b}$ follows a cauchy(0,1) if $x_a \sim N(0,1)$ and $x_b \sim invGamma(1/2,1/2)$ So here is my working : $N(x|0,\tau^{-1/2}) \propto \tau \times e^{x^2\tau/2}$ and $IG(\tau|1/2,1/2) \propto \tau^{1/2-1} \times e^{-2\tau}$ . So the integral, $\int N(x|0,\tau^{-1/2})$ $IG(\tau|1/2,1/2)d\tau \propto \int\tau^{1/2} \times e^{-2\tau(x^2+1)} d\tau$ $\propto 1/(x^2+1)^{3/2}$ . (by creating the inverse gamma integral inside) Ideally, I should get 1 as the exponent of the $x^2$ +1 . What am I missing here ? Can anyone help me to figure this out ? Thank you.
