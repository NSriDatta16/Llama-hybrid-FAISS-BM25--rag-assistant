Estimates of some function of a parameter (MCMC)

Let's say I have some MCMC framework whereby I am estimating two parameters $$(\log\alpha,\log\beta)$$ The reason for the $\log$ functions is so that the implementation of the joint prior distribution on both these parameters is easier. Let's say I run my MCMC and have two chains of estimates, one for each of these parameters. Overall, my goal was to obtain estimates for $(\alpha,\beta)$. So does it suffice to take both these chains and apply $(e^{\log\alpha_{i}},e^{\log\beta_{i}})$, $\forall i$. I was going to take the expectation of these posterior chains and get the MMSE estimators. I'm fairly sure I can't do the above but was looking for some confirmation of it.
