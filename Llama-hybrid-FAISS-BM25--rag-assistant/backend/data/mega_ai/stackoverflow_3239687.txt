Change int counter = 0; char* data[counter]; ... int len=strlen(data); ... for(; i to int counter = 0; #define MAX_DATA_LINES 1024 char* data[MAX_DATA_LINES]; //1 ... for(; i //1: to prepare valid memory storage for pointers to lines (e.g. data[0] to data[MAX_DATA_LINES]). Without doing this, you may hit into 'segmentation fault' error, if you do not, you are lucky. //2: Just to ensure that if the total number of lines in the file are MAX_DATA_LINES] is no more valid.
