Sharepoint permissions. Require multiple groups

I have a permission question I hope someone can help me with. I have setup permission groups for each department in an organization, i.e. “Dept-1”, "Dept-2", etc. My plan is to put people in these groups so they correspond with the department they work for. Next I’m setting up groups that correspond to areas of work, i.e. “Area-Tech”, “Area-Manager”. What I’d like to be able to do is give access to a list where a user needs to be in both “Dept-1” and “Area-Manager” in order to view and edit items. If a user is just in “Dept-1” they shouldn’t have access. Can this be done? Maybe there is another way. Thanks
