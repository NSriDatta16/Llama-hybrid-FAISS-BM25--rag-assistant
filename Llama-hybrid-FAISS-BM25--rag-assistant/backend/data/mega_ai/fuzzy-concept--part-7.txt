s and Data Mining (FSDM) has its 11th International Conference (FSDM2025) in Hanshan Normal University, Chaozhou City, Guangdong Province, China. The Asia Pacific Neural Network Society, founded in 1993, has board members from 13 countries: Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Qatar, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey. The International Association for fuzzy-set management and economy (SIGEF)[135] is based in Spain and publishes the Fuzzy Economic Review[136] since 1996. Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems (INFUS) is an international research forum to advance the foundations and applications of intelligent and fuzzy systems, computational intelligence, soft computing for applied research in general, complex engineering and decision support systems. The interdisciplinary Japan Society for Fuzzy Theory and Intelligent Informatics (SOFT) traces its origin back to 1972 and publishes two journals. The original Korea Fuzzy System Society founded in 1991 is now known as the Korean Institute of Intelligent Systems (KIIS). In mainland China, there is the Fuzzy Mathematics and Systems Association of China (FMSAC) based at the School of Mathematics, Sichuan University in Chengdu, and there exists also an important Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association. The North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society (NAFIPS) was founded in 1981. There exists also a Hispanic-American Fuzzy System Association (HAFSA) based in Mexico. In Europe, there is a European Society for Fuzzy Logic and Technology (EUSFLAT) which includes the Working Group on Mathematical Fuzzy Logic. The North European Society of Adaptive and Intelligent Systems (NSAIS) is based in Finland. In 2002, the Iran Fuzzy Systems Society (nowadays merged into the Iranian Coalition on Soft Computing) was approved as an affiliate of the Statistics Association of Iran, and in 2005 registered as a non-commercial scientific institute. When Lotfi A. Zadeh received an honorary doctorate from the University of Teheran on 9 March 2017, a member of Iran's parliament stated that Iran now ranks third in the world with regard to the output of scientific research about fuzzy systems. In 2005, Russia's Association for Fuzzy Systems (founded in January 1990) became the Russian Association for Fuzzy Systems and Soft Computing (RAFSSoftCom). Zadeh's seminal paper on fuzzy sets was translated into Russian in 1974, and subsequently Russian fuzzy research began to take off — increasingly overcoming official skepticism. In 2009, the Brazilian Applied Mathematical Society (SBMAC) created the Thematic Committee on Fuzzy Systems which inspired the First Brazilian Congress on Fuzzy Systems (CBSF I) in 2010. CBSF VI was held at São Paulo State University in 2021. There also exists a Brazilian Society of Automatics (SBA). In India, the Center for Soft Computing Research at the Indian Statistical Institute (Kolkata) organizes and publishes research on fuzzy sets, rough sets, and applications of fuzzy logic. The Sri Lanka Association for Artificial Intelligence is a non-profit scientific association devoted to understanding the mechanisms underlying thoughts and intelligent behaviour, and their emulation in machines. Other national scientific bodies include the Hungarian Fuzzy Association (HFA), the Fuzzy Systems Association of Turkey (FSAT), the Indonesian Soft Computing Society (SC-INA), and the Vietnamese Fuzzy Systems Society (VFSS). Achievements Lotfi A. Zadeh estimated around 2014 that there were more than 50,000 fuzzy logic–related, patented inventions. He listed 28 journals at that time dealing with fuzzy reasoning, and 21 journal titles on soft computing. His searches found close to 100,000 publications with the word "fuzzy" in their titles, but perhaps there are even 300,000. In March 2018, Google Scholar found 2,870,000 titles which included the word "fuzzy". When he died on 11 September 2017 at age 96, Professor Zadeh had received more than 50 engineering and academ
