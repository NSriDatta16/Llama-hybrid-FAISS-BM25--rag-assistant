Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. The languages in this family include Perl 5 and Perl 6. [Wikipedia] Perl 5 is a capable, feature-rich programming language with about thirty years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from portables to mainframes and is suitable for both rapid prototyping and large scale development projects. Perl 6, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, is a separate language which has its own development team.
