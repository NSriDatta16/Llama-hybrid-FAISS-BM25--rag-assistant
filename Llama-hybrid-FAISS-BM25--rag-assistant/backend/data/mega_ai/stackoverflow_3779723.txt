how storage is reserved by SQL Server? and howto overrule it?

I am trying to understnad how SQL Server allocates and reserves space. Having run the examples from the article "How table design can impact your SQL Server performance?" [1], I received the results [My 1.1] diverting from those in article [1.1]. Why? Why in one case the excessive space is reserved/allocated (all cases in [1]) but not in another [My 1.1]? (Note that in [1] in both cases the excessive space is reserved, though on my computer only in one of cases) How is space allocated, reserved by SQL Server? And how can I control/manage it?
