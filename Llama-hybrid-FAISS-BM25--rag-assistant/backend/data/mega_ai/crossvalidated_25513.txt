Binary classification problem

I have a binary classification problem. My inputs consist of a time-series of values plus some binary values. For real-valued inputs I would usually use a neural network, while for binary-values inputs I would use either a neural network with a step function or some other method fit for binary inputs (like a maximum entropy classifier) In the case where input types are mixed what architecture should be used?
