With only 16 data points, machine learning techniques would not be a good way to approach your problem. What you likely want is some form of extrapolation . The key for the success of your prediction would be the "qualitative" story, or assumptions behind the extrapolation that you choose to use. You might want to think about why the numbers between 2001-2016 have been the way that you see, what drove them, and what might happen to these drivers in the future. Some of these drivers could be population growth and growth in prosperity. Forecasting either of those is not trivial, but you may be able to use forecasts made by other researchers. You may also want to extrapolate the data into the future using different assumptions and show the projections under each assumption. Depending on the application, you may want to also assign a probability to each scenario.
