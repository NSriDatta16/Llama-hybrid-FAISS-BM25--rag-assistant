how to differentiate between isCellEditable() being called due to a user click or due to column dragging

I have a JTable with custom editor and renderer. I have my table model also.I want to instantiate an special input window when user clicks on a cell of an specific column. I have written the logic in isCellEditable() but now the problem is that when I click on any cell of that specific column then the input window pops up then I input my value until now every thing works fine. But now when I try to shift the column position by dragging the header then again isCellEditable() is called and without any user click on the cell of that specific column the window pops up. Kindly suggest how to differentiate between a user click and column dragging. Regards Krishna
