The best I can get is a nested subquery: var x = from e in db.events group e by 1 into grp select new { count = grp.Count(), avgDuration = grp.Average(x => x.Duration) } According to LINQPad, this will output the SQL: DECLARE @p0 Int = 1 SELECT COUNT(*) AS [count], AVG([t1].[Amount]) AS [avgDuration] FROM ( SELECT @p0 AS [value], [t0].[Duration] FROM Events AS [t0] ) AS [t1] GROUP BY [t1].[value]
