passing (function) pointers between c and mono

Hi after refering to http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono i can call methods from managed code by using mono_runtime_invoke. Now i want to call a method in the managed code with a function pointer (or at least some pointer) as argument from native c code managed code public delegate void MyDelegate (); //method i want to call from native code public static MyDelegate mono_method(MyDelegate c_ptr) { //...do sth return c_ptr; } native code typedef void (*FUNC_PTR)(); FUNC_PTR my_fct_ptr = some_c_function; //calling the managed method MonoObject *result_of_mono_method = mono_runtime_invoke(mono_method, NULL, my_fct_ptr, NULL); edit: to point out the problem how can i call public static unsafe int* mono_method(int *c_ptr) from native c code, without using dllImport.
