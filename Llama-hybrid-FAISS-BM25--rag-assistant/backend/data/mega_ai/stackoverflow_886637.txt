Can you download it, edit the source to fit your needs, and redistribute ever for commercial use? So, it is open-source. The code, at least. What about the documentation, support? It's another way... Man, I'm sorry, but you can't think that if someone creates an open-source project, then it is bound to it and MUST follow the support every day... Maybe he should or, better, he will be great if do so. Probably you're right; there is a conflict of interest, and maybe they used the open-source edition to grant popularity and then sell the enterprise-edition - I don't know; I just gave a quick look at Magento in the past.
