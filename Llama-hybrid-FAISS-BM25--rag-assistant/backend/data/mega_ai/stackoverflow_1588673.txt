I've taken to always using a CSS reset and building back up from this base for my projects. It simplifies things a lot as you no longer have to worry about differing default sizes, etc between browsers. Besides, any sufficiently large project has a large amount of CSS reseting in it anyway, and in those projects not using a CSS reset sheet they will instead most likely have it split across lots of areas, badly done and buggy :) I tend to use the YUI CSS sheets for my projects but I may now check out Blueprint now it's been brought to my attention ;)
