Alternatively, you could think of this in a Bayesian context. Compute the posterior distribution of the probability of, say, a head separately for both experiments, perhaps using an uninformative prior distribution (I would suggest a $\textrm{Beta}(0,0)$ prior, which is improper but okay since your posterior will in this case be proper). Then simulate two vectors of the same length from each of those posteriors. Perform element-wise subtraction of one vector from the other to compute the posterior distribution of the difference in the probability of heads between the two coins. Then take the empirical quantiles of that difference to estimate a credible interval for the difference. As for computing the probability that the two coins are fair, you could compute the posterior probability that each coin's probability of heads is different from 0.5 by simply subtracting 0.5 from the vectors you computed above, then computing credible intervals by taking the desired empirical quantiles.
