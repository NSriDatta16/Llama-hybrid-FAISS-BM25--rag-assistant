Reducing the number of variables by PCA vs. by clustering the features

Assume you have much more variables than samples and you want to reduce the number of variables (because you think some of them are redundant). The natural approach to do this is PCA, but is it possible to apply clustering algorithms where you consider the features as samples and try to regroup them? If so: is there a 'better' approach between pca and clustering of the variables?
