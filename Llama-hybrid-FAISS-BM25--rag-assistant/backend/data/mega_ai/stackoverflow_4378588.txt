I am not aware of anyone ever having successfully downgraded Magento. That said, a few considerations: Are you using version control like you should be? If so, you should have a copy of the site and database from just before the upgrade. You should be able to use this as a starting point. This is your most optimistic route by far. If no version control, you can download both of the versions and use diff to get the changes. Doing this in reverse theoretically creates a backwards patch. If you've stayed out of the core code entirely, the code change could be nearly as simple as replacing app/code/core . Even if you do downgrade the code, the data structures between versions have probably changed, so you'll need someone experienced to find those changes and tell you have to back-patch your database. This is, to say the least, perilous. Overall, I wouldn't want to undertake this task. As Anton said in the comments, you'll probably have an easier time getting integration done than reverting the changes. Best of luck! Thanks, Joe
