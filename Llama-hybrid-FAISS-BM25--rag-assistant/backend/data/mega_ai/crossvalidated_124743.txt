You seem to have a number of confusions in your question. I think it might be best to address those by explaining a way to construct confidence intervals, which might help to clarify some of the ideas. There are a number of ways of constructing confidence intervals, but let me give you a basic (somewhat informal-and-handwavy) rundown of a standard approach. Step 1: Form a pivotal quantity for the parameter in question. That is, form a statistic, a function of the parameter ($\theta$, say) and the data $\mathbf{x}$, $Q=g(\mathbf{x},\theta)$ whose distribution doesn't depend on $\theta$. We can specify an interval that would contain the desired fraction of random $Q_i$'s (has the desired coverage probability). So we could for example, write an inequality representing the interval along the lines of $l\leq Q \leq u$, which across many such random $Q$ values would contain the given proportion of them. Step 2: Back out an interval in terms of $\theta$ (i.e. rearrange the inequality to put $\theta$ by itself in between the $\leq$ values). Everything else in the inequality is determined once the sample is observed. This will have the desired coverage for $\theta$. Many of the common parametric intervals can be derived this way. e.g. for i.i.d. data from a $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, a pivotal quantity for $\mu$ is $Q = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$, since $Q$ has a standard t-distribution with $n-1$ d.f.
