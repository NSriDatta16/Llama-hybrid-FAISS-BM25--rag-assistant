Try SELECT sbc.PolicyC.PolicyName as namn,COUNT(*) as cnt FROM sbc.AgentC, sbc.PolicyC WHERE sbc.AgentC.PolicyGuid = sbc.PolicyC.PolicyGuid GROUP BY sbc.AgentC.PolicyGuid, sbc.PolicyC.PolicyName UNION SELECT 'TOTAL' as nawn,COUNT(*) as cnt FROM FROM sbc.AgentC, sbc.PolicyC WHERE sbc.AgentC.PolicyGuid = sbc.PolicyC.PolicyGuid ORDER BY namn ASC This will compute the total in a separate query. However, you might need to either add some non-printing, high-ASCII character to force the total to the bottom, or add some numeric ordering key... mySQL may also have an operator (similar to WITH ROLLUP in Microsoft SQL) which would be more efficient than the above code... So while this would work, there are probably more efficient options available to you...
