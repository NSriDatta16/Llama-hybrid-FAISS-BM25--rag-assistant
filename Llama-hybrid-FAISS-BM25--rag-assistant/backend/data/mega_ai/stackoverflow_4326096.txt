PhluffyFotos does not work on Azure SDK 1.3

I have tried PhluffyFotos example on Azure SDK 1.2 and it works perfect. Today I have installed on another (clen) computer Azure SDK 1.3 and I have also want to try PhluffyFotos on it but it does not work. I have problem with this part: if (!Roles.GetAllRoles().Contains("Administrator")) { Roles.CreateRole("Administrator"); } It seems it somehow does not load the custom RoleProvider (TableStorageRoleProvider). Do you have any idea what it could be? I get the following error: "The Role Manager feature has not been enabled.", because of the following exception "'System.Web.Security.Roles.ApplicationName' threw an exception of type 'System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderException'". Can someone test this example and see what is the problem? http://phluffyfotos.codeplex.com/ Firsty I have the "SetConfigurationSettingPublisher" problem with this example, but I have successfully resole it . EDIT: I have look deeper into it and I am sure there are a problem with Role provider. Somehow the Roles class do not read config file. Have anyone any idea why?
