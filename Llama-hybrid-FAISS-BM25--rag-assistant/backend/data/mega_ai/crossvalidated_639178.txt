Does cointegration test of exogenous variable with Y variable make sense when doing ARIMAX/SARIMAX?

The cointegration test between two time series variable is generally relevant from my understanding when you are performing a regression model. In terms of ARIMA model the approach is straightforward to use the Box-Jenkins methodology to build the ARIMA model. https://davegiles.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-forecasting-performance-of-models.html But when using an ARIMAX model ( consisting of multiple time series macro-economic variables- non-stationary too ), do we need to specifically do the cointegration test of exogenous variable against our dependent variable. Since to what I understand these exogenous variables are added to ARIMA as external multiple regression (x) variables. Also, any further assumptions/tests to be performed or assessed before adding these exogenous factors to the modelling of ARIMAX. FYI: I am using the stats package from python to model this arimax.
