Based on some googling, it seems you're at the wrong end of the pipeline. As I understand it: A VTX file is a Valve Proprietary File Format that is the result of a set of steps. The final output of Studiomdl for each Half-Life model is a group of files in the gamedirectory/models folder ready to be used by the Game Engine: an .MDL file which defines the structure of the model along with animation, bounding box, hit box, material, mesh and LOD information, a .VVD file which stores position independent flat data for the bone weights, normals, vertices, tangents and texture coordinates used by the MDL, currently three separate types of VTX file: .sw.vtx (Software), .dx80.vtx (DirectX 8.0) and .dx90.vtx (DirectX 9.0) which store hardware optimized material, skinning and triangle strip/fan information for each LOD of each mesh in the MDL, often a .PHY file containing a rigid or jointed (ragdoll) collision model, and sometimes a .ANI file for To do: something to do with model animations Valve Now the Valve Source SDK may have some utilities in it to read VTX's (it seems to have the ability to make them anyway). Some people may have made 3rd party tools or have code to read them, but it's likely to not work on all files just cause it's a 3rd party format. I also found this post which might help if you haven't seen it before.
