I believe it has to be named web.config. You are facing a common problem. One solution that I have used that worked really well in a large organization was to set environment variables on the web servers. Such as DEV, QA, UAT, PROD. Then, in code, you can query the environment variable to see which machine you are on, and then choose the values of appSettings accordingly. For example, you could have a database connection string named DEVconnection, and another named UATconnection. If your code determines from the environment variable that you are on UAT, then it would use UATconnection. This does assume that you have the ability to set environment variables on the web server. In this instance, the admins running the servers were the ones who suggested this solution. What was sweet about this was that there was ever only one version of web.config.
