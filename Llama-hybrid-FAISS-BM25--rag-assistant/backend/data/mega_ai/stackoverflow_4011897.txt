jQuery No Conflict Mode for extra functions

I'm sure this is a simple question, just can't seem to get it to work right. I was having some conflicts with jQuery, so I used the aliasing feature mentioned in the official documentation. jQuery(document).ready(function($){ $('.loadmore').addClass('hidden'); // works fine! loadmore(); }); function loadmore(){ $('.loadmore').addClass('hidden'); // doesn't work! } How do I get the aliasing to work for my code that I threw into functions for better organization and for the ability to reuse? I'm currently using jQuery instead of $ for everything due to the issue presented in the sample above. Thought I could save a few bits of data and use the alias that's shown in all the tutorials.
