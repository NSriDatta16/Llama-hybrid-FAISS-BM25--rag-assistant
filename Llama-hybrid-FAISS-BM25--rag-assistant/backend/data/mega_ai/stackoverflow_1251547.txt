Force an event in jQuery

To all; I have created a up and down counter for decimal places and when a change occurs I have it force a blur event to recalculate fields with the following code: $('button').click(function(){ var decPlaces = document.calculator.dpv.value * 1; var hii = document.calculator.origin.value; if (this.id == 'up' && decPlaces 0){ document.calculator.dpv.value = decPlaces - 1; if (hii != ''){ document.calculator[hii].focus(); document.calculator[hii].blur(); } } Works well in FF but drags in others particularly IE - suggestions on making the cleaner and faster is appreciated.
