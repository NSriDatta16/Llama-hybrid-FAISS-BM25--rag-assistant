rails - outputting user input with Paragraph Returns?

I have a textarea input that allows users to input in more than on paragraph, meaning the user can output a new line. Problem is when I output that from the database it's all shrunk into one line? How do I make that new line into an HTML friendly new line so it looks the way the user inputted the text? thanks
