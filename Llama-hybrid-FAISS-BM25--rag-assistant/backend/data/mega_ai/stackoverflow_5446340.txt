You do not need to activate register_globals in order to use persistent $_SESSION variables. In fact, the use of register_globals is strongly discouraged by many developers and deprecated as of PHP 5.3.0. With register_globals off , we can still define values like: # foo.php session_start(); $_SESSION['foo'] = 'bar'; and on another page, return that value: # bar.php session_start(); echo $_SESSION['foo']; Turning register_globals on would allow us to access that value more easily: # bar.php session_start(); echo $foo; but opens up a number of security issues you can read about here .
