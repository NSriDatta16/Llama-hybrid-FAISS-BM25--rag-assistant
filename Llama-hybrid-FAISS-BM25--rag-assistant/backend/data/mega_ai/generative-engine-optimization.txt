Generative engine optimization (GEO) is the practice of adapting digital content and online presence management to improve visibility in results produced by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). The term was first introduced in November 2023 by six researchers in an academic paper. GEO describes strategies intended to influence the way large language models, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity, retrieve, summarize, and present information in response to user queries. GEO exists within a broader ecosystem of content optimization strategies. While traditional Search Engine Optimization (SEO) focuses on improving rankings in conventional search engines, and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) targets platforms that provide direct answers through voice assistants and featured snippets, GEO specifically addresses optimization for generative AI platforms that synthesize responses using large language models. Recent data indicates that approximately 53% of website traffic continues to originate from traditional organic search, yet an estimated 58% of queries are now conversational in nature, demonstrating the growing importance of GEO and AEO alongside traditional SEO methods. Industry practitioners increasingly recognize that SEO, AEO, and GEO represent complementary aspects of a unified content strategy rather than competing approaches. Unlike traditional search engine optimization (SEO), which focuses on improving rankings in conventional search engines such as Google or Bing, GEO specifically targets generative engines — AI-driven systems that produce direct, summarized answers rather than lists of external links. The approach aims to ensure that brands and publishers are cited or represented on such platforms. Other terms used to describe the same concept include AI SEO (artificial intelligence search engine optimization) and LLMO (large language model optimization). History Origin of the term The concept of GEO developed in parallel with the rise of generative AI technologies that became integrated into mainstream search and information retrieval systems. In November 2023, six researchers introduced the term "generative engine optimization" in their paper GEO: Generative Engine Optimization. They described GEO as "a new paradigm that helps content creators improve the visibility of their content in answers generated by generative engines," stressing the need to adapt existing optimization strategies to the AI-driven search environment. In the same study, the researchers introduced GEO-Bench, a benchmark dataset of 10,000 queries designed to evaluate GEO techniques empirically. The results showed that certain optimization practices significantly increased the likelihood of a source being cited or included in generative engine answers, recognizing GEO as a distinct though related field to SEO. Adoption and industry growth Following publication of the paper, the term GEO gained traction among digital marketing firms, SEO consultancies, and technology companies. By early 2024, marketing outlets such as Search Engine Land began covering the concept, identifying GEO as a strategic necessity for visibility in AI-generated content. The growing interest led to the development of dedicated GEO tools and services, including getSAO; Cognizo AI; Hall; Scrunch AI; Am I On AI; Peec AI; Otterly AI; LLM Scout; Rankshift; Senso; Whitebox; Profound; and Wilgot. Profound; and Wilgot. By 2025, generative engine optimization had become a standard part of digital marketing strategies, with many firms incorporating GEO into their SEO workflows. Transition to generative engines Traditional SEO emphasizes keyword density, backlinks, and page rankings within link-based indices. By contrast, generative engines such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) generate direct, context-driven answers to user queries.
