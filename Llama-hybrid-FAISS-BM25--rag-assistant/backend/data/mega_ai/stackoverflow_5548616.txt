I know from personal experience that JSch works fine for this as long as you create a separate SSH connection for each thread. There's also sshj and Ganymed SSH-2 that you might want to check out. Here's a quick example of remote command execution with JSch: JSch jsch = new JSch(); Session session = jsch.getSession(user, host); session.setConfig("StrictHostKeyChecking", "no"); session.setPassword(password); session.connect(timeout); Channel channel = session.openChannel("exec"); ChannelExec channelExec = (ChannelExec) channel; channelExec.setCommand(command); channel.connect(); // read channel.getInputStream() here if you want to capture the output channel.disconnect(); session.disconnect();
