Cross validation score for PCA

I've recently seen an example (Python with scikit learn), where sklearn.decomposition.PCA was passed to cross_val_score as estimator with some data, like this cross_val_score(PCA(n_components=10), X) But how is it possible to measure any score if PCA doesn't produce any output, since it's not a learning method? Moreover, there was no y passed to the cross validation function, though the result was an array with several cross validation scores. So the question is what exactly was computed there, inside cross_val_score ? P.S. I hope the question is not a Python specific, I just don't understand what mathematically can be a score in such a case?
