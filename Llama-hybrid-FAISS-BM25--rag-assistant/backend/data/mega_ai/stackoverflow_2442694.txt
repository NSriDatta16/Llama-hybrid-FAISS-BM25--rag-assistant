Personally, I'd code it as tinyint and: Either: change it to text on the client, check constraint between 1 and 4 Or: use a lookup table with a foreign key Reasons: It will take on average 8 bytes to store text, 1 byte for tinyint. Over millions of rows, this will make a difference. What about collation? Is "Daily" the same as "DAILY"? It takes resources to do this kind of comparison. Finally, what if you want to add "Biweekly" or "Hourly"? This requires a schema change when you could just add new rows to a lookup table.
