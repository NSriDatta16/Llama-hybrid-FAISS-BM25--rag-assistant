You should consider grabbing the trial for http://l2sprof.com/ (if you're using LINQ to SQL) or http://efprof.com/ (if you're using Entity Framework) and using that to figure out what SQL your query is generating. They're both free for 30 days, which I hope would be plenty of days to figure out this problem. ;) Another possibility, pointed out by Robert in the comments, is to set the Log property on your DataContext , which will output the generated SQL to wherever you want. You also could just use the SQL Server Profiler, which probably will display much more than you need, but hey, it would probably still get the job done.
