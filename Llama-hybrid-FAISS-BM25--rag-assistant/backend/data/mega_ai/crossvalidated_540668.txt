Time series outlier detection: Determine if a forecast is an outlier

I checked some similar questions but I could not find anything in particular that would work for my case. I have time series data that is being used to make a prediction. Within that predication/forecast there are assumptions that are NOT captured by the input data. I want to write an detection algo that determines if the forecast makes sense relative to the input data. However, in the input time series data, the data could be increasing in value overtime, or their could be a rush order that causes the subsequent forecast to be higher. I would like to put weight or emphasis on the more recent time data Does anyone have any tips? I would like to do this in R
