In C++, you should always use const int SOME_CONST = 17; for constants and never #define SOME_CONST 17 Defines will almost always come back and bite you later. Consts are in the language, and are strongly typed, so you won't get weird errors because of some hidden interaction. I would put the const in the appropriate header file. As long as it's #pragma once (or #ifndef x / #define x / #endif), you won't ever get any compile errors. In vanilla C, you might have compatibility problems where you must use #defines.
