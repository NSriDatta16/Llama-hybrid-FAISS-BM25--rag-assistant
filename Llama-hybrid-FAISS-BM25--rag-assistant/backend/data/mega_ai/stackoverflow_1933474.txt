What is the difference between ${...} and !{...} in the Spark View Engine?

What is the difference between ${...} and !{...} in the Spark View Engine? There probably is a really distinct difference between the two, but I see them used interchangeably. Does one encode the output and the other doesn't? Which I have seen some discussion about in the groups? If that is true then what does this do: ${H(Model.Name)} Also how will setting the following in the config effect ${} and !{} ? I am hoping to document this for others as well, because the current documentation seems fragmented and out of date. http://sparkviewengine.com/documentation/
