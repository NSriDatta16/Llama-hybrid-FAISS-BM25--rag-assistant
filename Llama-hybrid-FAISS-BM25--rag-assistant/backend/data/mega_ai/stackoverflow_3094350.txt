It is a warning level 4 message, falling in the category "this may byte you in the rear end some day". Support for calling methods with default parameter values without specifying the value is spotty in the .NET languages. VB.NET always had it, C# just acquired it in version 4. C++/CLI does not support it and surely never will. Which is notable because the C++ language does support it. A C++/CLI programmer could well be surprised by this, thus the warning. There isn't much you can do about the warning, the code for the dataset is auto-generated. It is otherwise utterly benign, if you call the method without supplying a value for the argument with the default value then you'll get a compiler error. Just turn the warning off with #pragma warning(disable:4564) or Project > Properties > C/C++ > Advanced > "Disable Specific Warnings" setting.
