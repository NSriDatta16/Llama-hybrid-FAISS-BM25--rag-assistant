Question about rotating a slider

I am working on an application which needs to rotate the slider at one end. However, by using CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(), I can only rotate the slider at the centre. What should I do in order to rotate the slider at the end point? If possible, please give a short paragraph of sample code. Thanks a lot.
