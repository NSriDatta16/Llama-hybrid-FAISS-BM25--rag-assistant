Using K-Means to cluster vectorized user reviews

I have a dataset of user written reviews. What I would like to do is to cluster similar reviews together. I have already trained a word2vec model on vocabulary of 50000 words, and I have updated my data frame so that each user review has dimensions (numb_of_words, 375) where numb_of_words indicates a number of words in a given user review and 375 indicates the length of word embedding. My question is this, can I use K-Means to cluster similar user reviews? Not individual words, but the whole reviews. If so, must I first get them all to the same dimension? Or must I perform some sort of dim. reduction technique first?
