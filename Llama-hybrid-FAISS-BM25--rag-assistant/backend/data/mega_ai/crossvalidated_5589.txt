If these 3 models are estimated from independent samples, then you can assume that $\beta_1$ are independent for these 3 models. Then you can average them. The standard error of the average then will be the square root from the average of the squares of the standard errors. However you should check if you do not have omited-variables problem . If you do, then one of the $\beta_1$ in your models is biased, so it should be discarded. Of course if you have all the data for these 3 models, I suggest estimate Model 3 with all the data and then use the coefficient $\beta_1$ with its standard error, assuming that your model is adequate.
