Logistic regression is a valid inferential method, because, as you've noted you're modeling the odds. The coefficients on explanatory variables $X$ will also be valid. However, the intercept term $\beta_0$ will not be; this is because the number of positive and negative outcomes are fixed by the case-control design. So the intercept term will be meaningless, but your other estimates are fine. More information is in Agresti, An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis (second edition; 2007), p. 105.
