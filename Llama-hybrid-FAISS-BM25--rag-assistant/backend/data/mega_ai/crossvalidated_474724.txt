Simulating the annual salary of some lawyers in R

I'm trying to simulate the annual salary of 30, say, lawyers given their years of experience and age. By design, age and experience are extremely correlated with each other. I was wondering if my simulation procedure is accurate? ( Particularly: I often see the error term defined as rnorm(n, 0, some SIGMA) , but isn't it that we are drawing from a known population and so the the common SIGMA should be a single known value.) MY ASSUMPTIONS: I assumed that both predictors ( age and experience ) are highly correlated ( $\rho=.99$ ) normal random variables. As a result, I drew their random realizations from a bivariate normal distribution with some specified mean and sd for each predictor. Then, I created a linear model assuming the average annual salary of lawyers was $100000 ( B0 ) and that age and experience can each increase the salary by $6000 ( B1 & B2 ) a year. I then attached the linear model to the mean of the normal distribution of salary and assumed the conditional normals each have a common sd of $700 dollars? library(MASS) rho = .99 # correlation bet. age & experience n = 30 # A sample of 30 lawyers mnor
