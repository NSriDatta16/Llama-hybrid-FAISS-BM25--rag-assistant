Another good library is Raize DropMaster. Anyway, I believe that it IS possible to do what you want, but maybe it'll turn out to be HTML or RTF drag/drop? Hard to say. I can, for example, drag/drop the list of hyperlinks on this page (over there to the right, under "RELATED") into Word, and they all show up, with hyperlinks on board. So it IS possible. But I suspect that WinWord is dropping as HTML. Anyway, Rob's suggestion of looking at examples is a good one - between that library and Raize, you should find something that you can use as a prototype.
