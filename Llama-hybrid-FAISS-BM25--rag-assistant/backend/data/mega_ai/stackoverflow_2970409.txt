Most likely, the compiler has added a byte of padding between dummy1 and very_important_data to align very_important_data on a 16-bit boundary. In general, the alignment and padding of fields in a struct is implementation-dependent, so you shouldn't rely on it. If you absolutely need a particular behavior, many compilers offer #pragma or other directives to control this. Check your compiler's documentation.
