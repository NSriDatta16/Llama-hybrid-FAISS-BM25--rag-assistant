Canvas Click events in Silverlight when not over a UIElement

I have a canvas object and I am sprinkling fantastic controls all over it. I'm using a ScaleTransform object to scale the canvas so I can zoom in/out. I have wired up the controls so that I can drag them around, and the drag and drop works well by using MouseLeftButtonDown, MouseLeftButtonUp, and MouseMove. Now, I want to work on enabling an event when I click only on the Canvas. When I read the docs for the canvas object, I see that the MouseLeftButtonDown event only fires when it's over a UIElement. Occurs when the left mouse button is pressed (or when the tip of the stylus touches the tablet PC) while the mouse pointer is over a UIElement. (Inherited from UIElement.) Unfortunately, I want the opposite behavior. I want to know when the mouse is clicked on the Canvas while the mouse pounter isn't over any controls. Since I'm new to Silverlight, I could be doing this the wrong way. Is there something I have overlooked? Am I going about this the wrong way? I'm looking for a little help, and perhaps a lot of direction.
