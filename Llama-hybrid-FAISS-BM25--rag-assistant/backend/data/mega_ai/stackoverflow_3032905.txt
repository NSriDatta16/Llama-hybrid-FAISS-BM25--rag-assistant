How to correlate gtk.ListStore items with my own models

I have a list of Project objects, that I display in a GtkTreeView . I am trying to open a dialog with a Project's details when the user double-clicks on the item's row in the TreeView. Right now I get the selected value from the TreeView (which is the name of the Project) via get_selection() , and search for that Project by name in my own list to corelate the selection with my own model. However, this doesn't feel quite right (plus, it assumes that a Project's name is unique), and I was wondering if there is a more elegant way of doing it.
