TransformerFactory.newInstance() stops?

I have code written that converts my Document to a string prior to printing TransformerFactory tf = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Transformer trans = tf.newTransformer(); trans.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.OMIT_XML_DECLARATION, "yes"); trans.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, "yes"); //create string from xml tree StringWriter sw = new StringWriter(); StreamResult result = new StreamResult(sw); DOMSource source = new DOMSource(doc); trans.transform(source, result); xmlString = sw.toString(); This works perfectly in a standalone program. I have cut and pasted this code directly into a module running under jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28 (JDK 1.5) and it stops prior to the TransformerFactory.newInstance(). Is there something that I need to tell my jvm under jakarta about where to find the appropriate classes? BTW, the call never returns, it just stops with no response.
