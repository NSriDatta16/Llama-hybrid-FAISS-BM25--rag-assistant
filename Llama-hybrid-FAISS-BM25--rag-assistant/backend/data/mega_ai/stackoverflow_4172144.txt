I work alone on some customer projects using Trac, and I have added the timingandestimationplugin as well as the TracBurndown plugin. I can then enter the customer requirements/changes as tickets with an estimated time of work on that issue. For a particular milestone I can by a keypress see how many hours of work I have left before I'm finished, and it is shown as a graph which sometimes grows (!) (i.e discovery of new defects/requirements that must be fixed to complete another ticket). Gives me a good control of when I might be able to deliver the next release and also a list of what I have spent my time on in projects. Both of these issues are sometimes very critical to have a good and fast answer to when customers calls about a month after I have sent the bill and need an answer for their boss of what they have actually paid for.
