Is this a Suitable Approach for Handling Unseen Factor Levels?

I have the following question about using statistical models for prediction when faced with unseen factor levels. To illustrate my example, I will use the R programming language. Part 1: Data and Model: Suppose you have the following data: var1 You are interested in predicting "var1" based on the other variables. Suppose you decide to do this using a random forest model: library(randomForest) rf = randomForest(var1 ~ ., data=d1) Part 2: Prediction (Here is the Problem) Suppose you have a single new observation and you would like to predict the value of the response variable for this new observation based on the model you created above: new_data = data.frame(var1 = 2, var2 = 3, var3 = "A", var4 = "GG", var5 = "L") Since this observation contains unseen factor levels for var4 and var5, the random forest model will not be able to handle this. Part 3: Proposed Solution Suppose you decide to add a single row of 0's to the original data and re-train the model: d2 = data.frame(var1 = 0, var2 = 0, var3 = 0, var4 = 0, var5 = 0) old_data = rbind(d1,d2) rf = randomForest(var1 ~ ., data=old_data) Next, you can replace any unseen factor levels in the new data with 0: library(dplyr) new_data = new_data %>% mutate(across(where(is.character), ~ ifelse(. %in% as.list(old_data)[[cur_column()]], ., 0))) var1 var2 var3 var4 var5 1 2 3 A 0 0 Now, the random forest model can handle the above data and make a new prediction: pred My Question: Is the above approach a valid approach for dealing with unseen factor variables? As far as I understand, the random forest algorithm works by taking the average (via "bagging") response variable for different combinations of the predictor variables. Thus, when unseen factor levels appear in new data - the random forest algorithm should be able to still make a "partial prediction" by querying the training data to check the average value of the response variable for the non-unseen values of the predictor variables. Of course this is a risky approach - but at least it allows you to make a "partial prediction" on a new observation with unseen factor levels, compared to completely discarding this observation and not being able to make any prediction whatsoever. Can someone please comment on this? Thanks!
