There are plenty of possibilities. E.g. one could probably calculate a logistic regression model with variables "high income group" (yes / no = low), "test group" (yes / no = control) and interaction "high income group" * "test group". I would then test, if the interaction term is significant. If significant, one could conclude, that the effect of your intervention is different between groups.
