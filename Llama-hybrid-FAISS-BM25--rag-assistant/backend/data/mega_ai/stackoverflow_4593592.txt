To access a library it needs a Python library installed in the Python version you are using. From what you write above it seems to me that you install OpenCV in general, but that you don't specifically install the Python library. This is why it doesn't work. I'm not sure how to install the Python wrappers, and the OpenCV documentation is a bit sparse on that info. But if you did build them (and that needs to be turned on explicitly, says the docs) they seem to end up in opencv/release/lib . Look at "Testing Python wrappers" on http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide If there is still no luck, there is a bunch of alternative Python wrappers available: http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=opencv&submit=search Maybe they are better documented.
