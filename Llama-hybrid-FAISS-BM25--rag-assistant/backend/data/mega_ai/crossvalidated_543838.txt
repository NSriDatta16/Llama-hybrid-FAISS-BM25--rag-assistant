Help in understanding zero inflated neg binomial model summary

I'm writing this topic because I would need to get some more information about model conversion in brms (zero-inflated_negbinomial) model. Let's say I have this model result : Where I want to model how many fish are being caught by fishermen at a state park. Visitors are asked how long they stayed, their job area and how many fish were caught. Some visitors do not fish, but there is no data on whether a person fished or not. Some visitors who did fish did not catch any fish, so there are excess zeros in the data because of the people that did not fish.‚Äù I used the bmrs package in R summary(fit_zinb1) Family: zero_inflated_negbinomial Links: mu = log; shape = identity; zi = identity Formula: count ~ job_area + time Data: data (Number of observations: 225) Draws: 2 chains, each with iter = 1200; warmup = 600; thin = 5; total post-warmup draws = 240 Population-Level Effects: Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS Intercept -1.01 0.17 -1.35 -0.67 1.00 2878 2555 job_area_agriculture 0.87 0.04 0.79 0.96 1.00 3021 2668 job_area_business -1.37 0.10 -1.56 -1.18 1.00 2736 2836 Time 0.80 0.09 0.63 0.99 1.00 2792 2416 Family Specific Parameters: Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS zi 0.41 0.05 0.32 0.49 1.00 2889 2706 where Job area has 3 modalities : (Politic (Intercept), Agriculture and Business) from the following summary, could I say the following sentences : On average, 0.41% of zeros are zero from people who fish but did not catch anything and 59% are coming from people who do not fish at all. Do I have to transform the Estimate coefs if I want to say that on average, people with a job in business are catch -1.37 less fish than Politics ? and If yes how do I transform it ? By an exponential ? For each unite of time , the number of fish caught is equal to 0.80.
