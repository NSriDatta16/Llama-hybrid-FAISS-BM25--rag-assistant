Are there any cms/social networking platforms that facilitate the creation of multiple communities?

We are building an app that we want to add social networking like features too. Our first thought was to take an open source social networking platform or a cms with community features and drop our app into it. It seems that most of these platforms seem to be organized around the idea that there is one network and everyone is part of that network, i.e. the Facebook model. A better model for our app is the Ning model. We want a new sub-network for each of our customers, and different customers don't even need to know the others exist. To further complicate things, we may at a later date want to allow very limited sharing between these sub networks. Are there open source or commercial platforms that support creating many different subnetworks/communities?
