Repast restart issue

I'm developing an artificial intelligent program to explore a given space for resources. I'd like to run multiple scenarios in order to collect data and output to a file. I used the "multiple runs" option in the gui and i do stop() when one module run is finished (all the resources have been explored). The problem is when It runs the model a second turn, it doesn't work properly. What I mean is that after running once I always need to kill the application by exiting because the restart option doesn't work properly. Is there anything that "restart" forgets to do? Because if I exit the application and run it again it works perfectly Edited so it's more clear: I use the Repast platform in order to simulate an exploration to Mars. I have 3 kinds of agents, scouting, digging and transporting. They communicate among them to schedule tasks and other things. The first time I run the simulation everything runs smoothly. And when all the mineral resources of the planet have been explored I restart the model and try again so I can collect data. The problem is, when I use the "restart" option the Simulation doesn't run well. But if I exit (not restart) and run it again it works fine. What I'd like to know is if the restart option of Repast GUI misses any steps.. Thanks in advance PS: If you guys think that it's absolutely necessary I can post some code...but the project is quite big
