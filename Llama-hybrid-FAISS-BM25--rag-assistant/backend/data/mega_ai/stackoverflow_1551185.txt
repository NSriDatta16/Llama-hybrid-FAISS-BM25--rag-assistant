In C++, you can (and should) always use std::string (while remembering that string literals actually are zero-terminated character arrays). Use char* only when you need to interface with C code. C-style strings need error-prone manual memory management, need to explicitly copy strings (copying pointers doesn't copy the string), and you need to pay attention to details like allocating enough memory to have the terminating '\0' fit in, while std::string takes care of all this automagically.
