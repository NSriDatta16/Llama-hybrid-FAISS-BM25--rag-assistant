"DOM tree is convenient enough to organize namespaces, why disregard it ?" Because the DOM can change due to AJAX or other javascripty-goodness. I like @ocdcoder 's constant/variable analogy. Sometimes you want to refer to exactly that particular element. Having to adhere to a strict DOM namespace is a straightjacket that doesn't help maintenance at all, imho.
