What is a simple teachable example where normalization/standardization of data is necessary or convenient for valid inference?

Many students come across normalization and standardization as a easy to understand, but hard to grasp/motivate problem. Often times reasons for why we should normalize or standardize data range from the fact we want to do PCA (variance sensitive) or want to make the results more readable. I was wondering if anyone had a simple, nearly trivial example that is teachable to students where the motivation behind normalization or standardization is justified?
