Where do I put standalone scripts? You organize them "functionally" -- based on what they do and why people use them. The language (Python vs. Java) is irrelevant. You have to think of scripts as small applications focused on some need and create appropriate directory structures for that application. We use /opt/thisapp and /opt/thatapp . If you want a shared mount-point, you might use a different path. How do structure the project's layout in a way that the user do not need to dig deep into the folders to run the programs You organize them "functionally" -- based on what they do and why people use them. At the top level of a /opt/thisapp directory, you might have an __init__.py (because it's a package) and perhaps a main.py script which starts the real work. In Python 2.7 and Python 3, you have the runpy module. With this you would name your top-level main script __main__.py http://docs.python.org/library/runpy.html#module-runpy What is a standard way to create modules that allow easy reusability(mycompany.myapp.mymodule?)
