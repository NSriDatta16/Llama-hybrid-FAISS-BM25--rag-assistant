Have a look at Microsoft's Azure - http://www.microsoft.com/azure/default.mspx And Amazon's Cloud - http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ At the moment, Cloud Computing is banded about and I'm sure that for most marketing purposes all it means is a 'hosted service'. This means that rather than install the applications on a client's hardware, the vendor agrees to charge a subscription fee and host it on their own site (or a third-party). The term "Cloud" is used because when depicting "T'Internet" in techie diagrams, we draw a picture of a cloud. That's it. In reality, it's just used as a big, cheap storage space at the moment. PAYG-computing is the ideal, but we're a few years from that yet.
