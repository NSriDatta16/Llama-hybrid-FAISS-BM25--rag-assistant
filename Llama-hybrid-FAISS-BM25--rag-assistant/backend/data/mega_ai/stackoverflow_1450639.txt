wx.StaticBitmap or wx.DC: Which is better to use for constantly changing images?

I would like to have a python gui that loads different images from files. I've seen many exmples of loading an image with some code like: img = wx.Image("1.jpg", wx.BITMAP_TYPE_ANY, -1) sb = wx.StaticBitmap(rightPanel, -1, wx.BitmapFromImage(img)) sizer.Add(sb) It seems to be suited for an image that will be there for the entire life of the program. I could not find an elegant way to delete/reload images with this. Would using a wx.DC be a better idea for my application?
