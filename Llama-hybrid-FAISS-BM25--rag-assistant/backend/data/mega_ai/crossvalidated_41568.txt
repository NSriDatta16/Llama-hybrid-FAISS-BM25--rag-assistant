As Bayesian software improves, the "easier to apply" issue becomes moot. Bayesian software is becoming packaged in easier and easier forms. A recent case in point is from an article titled, Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test . The following web site provides links to the article and software: http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/BEST/ An excerpt from the article's introduction: ... some people have the impression that conclusions from NHST and Bayesian methods tend to agree in simple situations such as comparison of two groups: “Thus, if your primary question of interest can be simply expressed in a form amenable to a t test, say, there really is no need to try and apply the full Bayesian machinery to so simple a problem” (Brooks, 2003, p. 2694). This article shows, to the contrary, that Bayesian parameter estimation provides much richer information than the NHST t test and that its conclusions can differ from those of the NHST t test. Decisions based on Bayesian parameter estimation are better founded than those based on NHST, whether the decisions derived by the two methods agree or not.
