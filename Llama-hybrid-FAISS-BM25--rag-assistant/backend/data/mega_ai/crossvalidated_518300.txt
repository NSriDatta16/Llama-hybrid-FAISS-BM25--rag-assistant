The idea of soft margin classifier means that one allows a number of misclassifications on the wrong part of the margin. This has nothing to do with the used kernel. Using a linear kernel or other type of kernel only affects in which kind of space the separating margin is searched. All SVMs uses soft margin, but one can push the soft margin behavior towards a hard margin behavior but imposing a very large penalty on errors. [Later edit:] Linear SVMs either for regression or for classification have a special characteristic. The numerical computations are simpler because one can compress the original result of the algorithm into a much simpler formula (due to it's linearity). This is why often implementations for SVMs and SVCs have sometimes separate implementations for the linear kernel.
