HTML5 Local Storage of audio element source - is it possible?

I've been experimenting with the audio and local storage features of html5 of late and have run into something that has me stumped. I'd like to be able to cache or store the source of the audio element locally to enable speedier and offline playback. The problem is I can't see how this is possible with the current implementation. I have tried the following using WebKit: Creating a manifest file to set up local caching but the audio file appears not to be a cacheable item maybe due to the way it is stream or something I have also attempted to use javascript to put an audio object into local storage but the size of the mp3 makes this impossible due to memory issues (i think). I have tried to use the data uri and base64 to use the html as a audio transport that can be cached but again the filesize makes this prohibitive. Also the audio element does not seem to like this in WebKit (works fine in mozilla) I have tried several methods of putting the data into the local database store. Again suffering the same issues as the other cases. I'd love to hear any other ideas anyone may have as to how I could achieve my goal of offline playback using caching/local storage in WebKit.
