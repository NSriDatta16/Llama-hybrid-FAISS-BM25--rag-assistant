Accuracy improvement for logistic regression model

I have achieved 68% accuracy with my logistic regression model. I want to increase the accuracy of the model. How can I apply stepwise regression in this code and how beneficial it would be for my model? What changes shall I make in my code to get more accuracy with my data set. I have attached my dataset below. Following is my code: library(dplyr) data1 % as.matrix.data.frame() accuracy = sum(diag(tab))/sum(tab) print(accuracy) print(tab) table(testset$VALUE, testset$outcome) Following is my dataset: Link 1: http://www.filedropper.com/hj_2
