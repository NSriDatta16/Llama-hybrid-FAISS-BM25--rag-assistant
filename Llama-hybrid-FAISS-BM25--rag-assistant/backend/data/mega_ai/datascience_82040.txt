How to get used to matricial/vectorial operations?

I came to data science/machine learning from another background in computer science and i feel that i'm lacking of experience with matricial/vectorial operations. Python or Matlab, for instance, provide awesome features like numpy to easily manipulate tabular data. However, the first solution that comes to my mind when coding is for or while loops. I've faced situations where my code could be easily reduced to 1 line or so with numpy . I'd like to know if there are good lectures/books you can recommend to change this way of thinking when it comes to problem solving/coding approaches. Thanks in advance.
