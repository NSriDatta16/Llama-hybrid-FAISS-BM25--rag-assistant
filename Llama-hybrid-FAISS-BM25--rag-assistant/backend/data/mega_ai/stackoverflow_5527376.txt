OpenCV 2.2 installation - everything fine but debug output shows "cannot find or open PDB file"

I have just installed the OpenCV 2.2 library with VS 2010 following the willowgarage install guide . at first no dll could be detected so I copied every .dll file in the OpenCV folder to Windows, system and system32 folders. The sample and image output comes fine, however the debug output in Visual studio 2010 shows a series of .dll (including 'kernel32.dll') whose PDB files couldn't be found or opened. Now will this affect my development in any way, or should I just ignore it and get back to image processing proper? Any way to work around this would be really helpful.
