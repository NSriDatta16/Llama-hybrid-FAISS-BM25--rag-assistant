Email to a friend in Product view page is not working

There is Email to a Friend (a kind of Referring to a friend) functionality in Magento. You can see the "Email to a Friend" link in Product view page. Whenever I try to send email to a friend from this, I get the following error:- Some emails was not sent I have configured Host from System -> Configuration -> ADVANCED -> System -> Mail Sending Settings . I have also configured SMTP and sendmail_from in php.ini file. Any idea why I am getting this error?
