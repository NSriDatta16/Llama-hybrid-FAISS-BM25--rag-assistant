The book " OpenCV " has a great two pages on this on pages 462-463 . Searching the Amazon preview for the word "discriminative" (probably google books also) will let you see the pages in question. These two pages are the greatest gem I have found in this book. In short: Boosting - often effective when a large amount of training data is available. Random trees - often very effective and can also perform regression . K-nearest neighbors - simplest thing you can do, often effective but slow and requires lots of memory . Neural networks - Slow to train but very fast to run , still optimal performer for letter recognition . SVM - Among the best with limited data , but losing against boosting or random trees only when large data sets are available.
