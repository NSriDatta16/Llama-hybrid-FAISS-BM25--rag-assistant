Of course you can plot lots of MAEs. If you have a single time series you are predicting, you can simply plot a time series of your absolute error over the forecasting horizon. (Not much "mean" here.) If you have multiple time series, e.g., predictions of rentals at different locations or of different products or car models, then you can average AEs over time series per future time bucket and then plot time series of MAEs. If so, I usually find it very enlightening to also plot the time series of quantiles of errors - sometimes the MAEs look fine, but the high quantiles (the "bad boys") are the ones you learn a lot from. Here is an example: horizon I am not aware of any R package to do this automatically, but as you see, it's not hard to munge and plot your errors by hand.
