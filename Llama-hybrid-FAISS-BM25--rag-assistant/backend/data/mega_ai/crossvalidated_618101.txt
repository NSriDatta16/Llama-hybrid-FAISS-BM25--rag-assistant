If time series are mentioned, ACF plot for me implies a graph of the autocorrelation function, not the case here. Your plot is instead fitted versus actual given a model fit. This is quite a common plot across many fields, although practice varies on which variable goes on which axis and what to call each variable or the plot as a whole. I've seen mention of {observed} on the one hand and {predicted, forecast} on the other hand and names such as calibration plots, distortion plots and fitted value plots. That's all secondary. How to interpret your graph depends intimately on the exact model you are fitting, what is the outcome or response and what predictors did you use. I guess wildly that your data include life expectancies for quite different age groups and for different years and that in essence age group is in that comparison utterly dominant -- no surprise as the life expectancy of a 1 year old is utterly different from that of a 80 year old. This interpretation follows from noticing a dominant pattern of more or less horizontal bands. What do you expect to learn from your model fit? You might expect to see some effects of the covid pandemic. If you have predictors such as ethnicity as well, then it could be interesting to see if different races differ given age group and year. You have one outlier at data around 20 and fitted about 60. That's a cause for major concern. An anomaly so strong with this kind of data suggests to me a data entry error -- or alternatively very high mortality given the pandemic among very elderly people. I am very positive about plotting both raw data and the results of a model fit, but here a table of parameter estimates together with confidence intervals and so forth is likely to be much more informative. But the graph is worthwhile alone for exposing a serious outlier.
