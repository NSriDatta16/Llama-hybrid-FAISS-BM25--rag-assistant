As Gandalf and Darrel Miller said, HttpClient. You don't need to be constructing XML from HTTP params. XML should only be your interface between two separate systems. Using HttpClient puts you in Java with the String values at your disposal, goinn back into XML from there is needless. If you are going back into XML at this point in order to send out to another system, you should be thinking about moving the values from the HTTP params back in to your domain/app logic before communicating with another system. This is necessary to keeps proper seperation of application logic from inter system communications.
