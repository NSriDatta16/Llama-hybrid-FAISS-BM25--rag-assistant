Generative model to generate hidden activations coming from a previously trained hidden layer

I need to train a generative model to generate vectors which resemble the activations of a particular hidden layer of a neural network which has been previously trained. In particular, the hidden layer has been previously trained by merging outputs of a recurrent neural network and a convolutional neural network. Is it possible to use a standard Variational Autoencoder to do that? If not, is there a generative model which is better suited to generate them? Thank you.
