Although the SVM is using only support vectors for prediciton, it uses all the data during the training process. You can think about the training process as to looking for parameters describing your decision boundary, such as they will minimize some kind of average misclassification error function. If you have 9 times samples from class A as from class B, they will add 9 times as much error. So the decision boundary will be pushed towards the minority class.
