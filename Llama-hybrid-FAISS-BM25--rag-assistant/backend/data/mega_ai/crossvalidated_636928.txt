Regression of a binary vector from another binary vector in Keras

I am trying to work on building a relationship in Keras , between X and Y where X= (1,30) and Y= (1,10) . I made model , to predict the Y from X. I am working in the biology field, and I want to predict the binary vector of Y through X with accuracy (90%) . I will explain mode: X is a binary vector of length n (e.g., X(1,:) = [0/1, 0/1, ..., 0/1]). Y is a binary vector of length m, where m (e.g., Y(1,:) = [0/1, 0/1, ..., 0/1] ). For each X => Y the data is like that : for example a sample : X = [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1] and its Y=[0,1,1,1,1,0,1] My objective is to develop a machine learning model M that can predict the vector Y from the vector X with an accuracy greater than 90% . I accept only an error of 1 bit ! not more. My question, what is the best cost function and loss function should I use ?
