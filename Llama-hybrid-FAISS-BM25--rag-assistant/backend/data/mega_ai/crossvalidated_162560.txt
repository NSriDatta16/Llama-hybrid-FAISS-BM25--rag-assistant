Distribution of the largest fragment of a broken stick (spacings)

Let a stick of length 1 be broken in $k+1$ fragments uniformly at random. What is the distribution of the length of the longest fragment? More formally, let $(U_1, \ldots U_k)$ be IID $U(0,1)$, and let $(U_{(1)}, \ldots, U_{(k)})$ be the associated order statistics, i.e. we simply order the sample in such a way that $U_{(1)} \leq U_{(2)} \leq, \ldots , \leq U_{(k)}$. Let $Z_k = \max \left(U_{(1)}, U_{(2)}-U_{(1)}, \ldots, U_{(k)} - U_{(k-1)}, 1-U_{(k)}\right)$. I am interested in the distribution of $Z_k$. Moments, asymptotic results, or approximations for $k \uparrow \infty$ are also interesting.
