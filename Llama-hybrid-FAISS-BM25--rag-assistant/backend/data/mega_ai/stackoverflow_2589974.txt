There is no one answer to this. The C and C++ standards just say that string literals have static storage duration, any attempt at modifying them gives undefined behavior, and multiple string literals with the same contents may or may not share the same storage. Depending on the system you're writing for, and the capabilities of the executable file format it uses, they may be stored along with the program code in the text segment, or they may have a separate segment for initialized data. Determining the details will vary depending on the platform as well -- most probably include tools that can tell you where it's putting it. Some will even give you control over details like that, if you want it (e.g. gnu ld allows you to supply a script to tell it all about how to group data, code, etc.)
