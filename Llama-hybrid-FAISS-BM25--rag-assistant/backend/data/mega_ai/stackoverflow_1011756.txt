For me, the 'code smell' here is 'lots of code'. If the amount of code in the loops is particularly large, the distance between the inner and outer loops means that they're not as likely to be compared against each other for correctness. Admittedly, looking at the start of the inner loop in isolation should bring the issue to your attention, but having the main structure in as small a section of code as possible gives your brain less to digest. It may be possible to extract the 'lots of code' sections into separate functions/methods, in order to reduce the size of the main structure - but this may not alway be practical. Also, I'd say that 'i1' isn't a particulary good choice of variable name, as that tends to encourage 'i2', 'i3' etc, which doesn't really lead to understandable code. Maybe replacing all of the loop variables with something more meaningful would help the clarity of the code, and reduce the chances of the original error.
