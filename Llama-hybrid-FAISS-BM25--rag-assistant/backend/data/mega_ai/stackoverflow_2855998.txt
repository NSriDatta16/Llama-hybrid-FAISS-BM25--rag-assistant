IE7 resize problems

i have a page that contains content which need to be dynamically changed according to the current page size. in order to do that, during the onload event, i attach some JS function to the "onresize" window event. it looks like that: window.onresize = function() { //do something here... }; This is working fine in any browse, except IE7! These are the problems i'm having: It seems that in IE7, when i resize the window vertically only (i.e. clicking with the mouse on the bottom border, and drag it down), it does not fire the "onresize" event. sometimes, i get an infinite loop of "onresize" event, causing the browser to hang forever. I will appreciate any help with any of these issues. thanks, Moe 2 days and no answer... no idea? i thought i'll find some help here...
