Is there a term for an average per equal amount of data?

Let's say I have data $y$, which is dependent on $x$. First I sort the data according to $x$, and then I take the average of the first $k$ values of $y$ and $x$, and then the average of the second k values, and so on; i.e., $$ _i = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{(i-1)\cdot k+1}^{i*k} y $$ and $$ _i = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{(i-1)\cdot k+1}^{i*k} x $$ for some value of $k$. Is there a term for this type of average? And is there a term for the graph when I plot $ _i$ against $ _i$ ?
