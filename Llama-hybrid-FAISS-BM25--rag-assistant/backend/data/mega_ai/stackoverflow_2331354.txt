Xcode template > format

I'm working up a custom Xcode template, and I'd like to change the way > is formatted. For example: // Created by «FULLUSERNAME» on «DATE». // Copyright «YEAR» «ORGANIZATIONNAME». All rights reserved. if the file was created today would fill as: // Created by SooDesuNe on 2/24/2010. // Copyright 2010 MyOrganization. All rights reserved. Dates formatted in any "all numbers" format can cause a lot of confusion, since the ISO and JIS way of writing the same date is 24/2/2010. It's clear on the 24th day of the month, but not so clear on the first 12 days of the month. I would like x-code to populate > like: // Created by SooDesuNe on 24-Feb-2010. // Copyright 2010 MyOrganization. All rights reserved. Since there is no ambiguity that way. Anyone know how to change the date format?
