normalization of time series for clustering via self-organizing maps

I have weekly average values aka time series. They are the same units (e.g. revenue in Â£s). I want to use self-organizing maps in its standard setting (using euclidean distances) to order/cluster these times series according to their shapes and amplitudes. How should I normalizes these time series, to get the best performance out of the SOM using euclidean distances? One option would be to normalize each week's column: x_norm = (x - min)/(max-min) Here min and max are the minimum and maximum of each column. I am doing all this in R btw. What do you think?
