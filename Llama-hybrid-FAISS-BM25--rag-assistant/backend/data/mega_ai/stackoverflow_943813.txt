There are two sorts of errors. Application errors and HTTP errors. The HTTP errors are just to let your AJAX handler know that things went fine and should not be used for anything else. 5xx Server Error 500 Internal Server Error 501 Not Implemented 502 Bad Gateway 503 Service Unavailable 504 Gateway Timeout 505 HTTP Version Not Supported 506 Variant Also Negotiates (RFC 2295 ) 507 Insufficient Storage (WebDAV) (RFC 4918 ) 509 Bandwidth Limit Exceeded (Apache bw/limited extension) 510 Not Extended (RFC 2774 ) 2xx Success 200 OK 201 Created 202 Accepted 203 Non-Authoritative Information (since HTTP/1.1) 204 No Content 205 Reset Content 206 Partial Content 207 Multi-Status (WebDAV) However, how you design your application errors is really up to you. Stack Overflow for example sends out an object with response , data and message properties. The response I believe contains true or false to indicate if the operation was successful (usually for write operations). The data contains the payload (usually for read operations) and the message contains any additional metadata or useful messages (such as error messages when the response is false ).
