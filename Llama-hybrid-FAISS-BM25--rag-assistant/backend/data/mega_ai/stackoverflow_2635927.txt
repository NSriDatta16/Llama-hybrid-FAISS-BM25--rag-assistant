Ajax backed List/Menu

I am developing a web application using Spring JS and Dojo Toolkit. In this application I want a Menu that lists the different organzational units in my application. The users will be able to add/remove these units and I want the menu to immediately reflect those changes. Example: My user adds an new organizational unit "Strategic Consulting". So he/she expects this new unit to show in the menu to his left among the other units like "Marketing" "Sales" etc. So basically I need a Menu that is backed by some collection of business units on the serverside. How do I do this using the Dojo Toolkit?
