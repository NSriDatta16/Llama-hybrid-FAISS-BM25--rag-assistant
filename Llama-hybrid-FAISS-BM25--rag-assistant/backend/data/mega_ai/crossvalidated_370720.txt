First we attempt to state the nature of problem attempted to be solved by these methods. If a problem is straightforward, Polynomial or NP Complete we have ready to plug algorithms that could provide with a deterministic answer, by simple recombination of the axioms along logical rules. However, if that is not the case, we would have to rely on a method of reasoning, wherein, we attempt to treat the problem as being heterogeneous and plug it to a network, the nodes being evaluations and the edges being pathways between the components. In any kind of network based reasoning, we do not reason deductively, by using abstract generalisations and combinations, according to logical rules in a linear flow, but rather work through the problem based on the propagation of reasoning in different directions, such that we solve the problem one node at a time, open to improvements on discovery of new facts concerning any node in the future. Now let us see how each of these techniques approach this method of problem solving in their own way. Neural Network: The Neural network is a black box, where it is believed (never could be verified from outside the system) that connections among simpleton nodes are formed and emphasised by repeated external reinforcements. It approaches the problem in a Connectionsitic paradigm. The problem is likely solved, but there is little by way of explainability. The neural net now widely used because of its ability to produce quick results, if the problem with explainability is overlooked. Bayesian Network: The Bayesian Network is a directed acyclic graph, which more like the flowchart, only that the flow chart can have cyclic loops. The Bayesian network unlike the flow chart can have multiple start points. It basically traces the propagation of events across multiple ambiguous points, where the event diverges probabilistically between pathways. Obviously, at any given point in the network, the probability of that node being visited is dependent on the joint probability of the preceding nodes. The Bayesian network is different from the Neural Network in that it is explicit reasoning, even though probabilistic and hence could have multiple stable states based on each step being revisited and modified within legal values, just like an algorithm. It is a robust way to reason probabilistically, but it involves encoding of probabilities, conjecturing the points where randomized actions can happen and hence need more heuristic effort to build. Decision Trees: The Decision tree is again a network, which is more like a flow chart, which is closer to the Bayesian network than the neural net. Each node has more intelligence than the neural net and the branching can be decided by mathematical or probabilistic evaluations. The decisions are straightforward evaluations based on frequency distributions of likely events, where the decision is probabilistic. However, in Bayesian networks, the decision is based on the distribution of 'evidence' that points to an event having occurred, rather than the direct observation of the event itself. An Example For instance, if we were to predict the movement of a man-eating tiger across some Himalayan villages that happens to be in the edge of some tiger reserve, we could model it on either approach as follows: In a decision tree, we would rely on expert estimates whether a tiger would given the choice between open fields or rivers would choose on the latter. In a Bayesian network, We track the tiger by pug marks, but reason in a manner that acknowledges that these pug marks might have been those of some other similar sized tiger routinely patrolling its territory. If we are to use a neural net, we would have to train the model repeatedly using various behavioural peculiarities of the tiger in general, such as its preference to swim, preference of covered areas over open areas, its avoidance of human habitations in order to allow the network to generally reason over the course the tiger might take.
