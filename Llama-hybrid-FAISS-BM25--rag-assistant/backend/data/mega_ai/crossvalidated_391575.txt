Does it make sense in Bayesian regression modelling to say “I am adding the covariate A into the model to control for the covariate A”?

In Bayesian regression context, does it make sense to say things like: “OK, I am going to add the covariate A into my model in order to control for the covariate A”? My impression is that, since we are treating the regression coefficients to be random quantities, one can no longer control for a certain covariate by adding it into the Bayesian regression model? Thank you,
