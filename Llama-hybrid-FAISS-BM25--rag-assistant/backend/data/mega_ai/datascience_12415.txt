As a first step, to segregate the messages that appear to be a bot, you could first try binning by message size. For example, if messages sent by bots are likely to be around 128 bytes to 140 bytes, assign these to a unique bin. Next, create a time series based on this bin. Try to decompose the time series using an additive or multiplicative method such as Holt Winters. A strong seasonal component would help you identify regular and repetitive messages which are being generated automatically.
