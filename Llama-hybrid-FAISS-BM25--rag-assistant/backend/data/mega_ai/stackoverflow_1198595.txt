If you're talking readability, bit-sets and C++, why don't I find anything on std::bitset in there? I understand that the embedded programmer race is quite comfortable with bitmasks, and has evolved a blindness for its sheer uglyness (the masks, not the races:), but apart from masks and bitfields, the standard library has a quite elegant solution, too. An example: #include enum tFlags { c_firstflag, c_secondflag, c_NumberOfFlags }; ... std::bitset bits; bits.set( c_firstflag ); if( bits.test( c_secondflag ) ) { bits.clear(); } // even has a pretty print function! std::cout
