if you just want the textField do normal things except the showing keyboard action, you could subclass UITextField and overwrite the touchesBegan/Moved/Ended , just call super touchesBegan/Moved/Ended and add additional code which would hide the keyboard, if you have a reference to the keyboard ( you may figure it out urself how-to ), call the method : [keyboard resignFirstResponder] , you may try to Category the UITextField class so you would have the reference to the keyboard ( if it's private ) - but not recommended because categorying may break our project design, but if you just need it for the only purpose, give it a try. Hope it helps.
