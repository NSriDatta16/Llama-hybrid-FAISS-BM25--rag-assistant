Testing calendar anomalies

I have time series of returns of some stock $X_1,X_2,...X_t$. I want to test if day of the week has some effect on returns. I am considering using the following regression (where $D_i$ are five dummy variables for each day of the week): $$X_t = \sum a_i D_i + \epsilon$$ Is this regression viable for my needs?
