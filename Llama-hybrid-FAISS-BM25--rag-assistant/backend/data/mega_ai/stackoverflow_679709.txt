My favorite method of creating human friendly, pronouncable, but ultimately meaningless and random words is Markov chains. Here are some links to help you along this path. http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001132.html - Jeff Atwood's explanation (very good!) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain - Wikipedia's entry on Markov chains is lengthy and goes over the math. http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/pearls/sec153.html - From Programming Pearls, has Perl for a Markov chain generator. http://www.xradiograph.com/WordSalad/ChainsOfLove - Has links to Markov chain generators. http://www.jwz.org/dadadodo/ - Jamie Zawinski's implementation in C. And remember that you have to feed these generators text to make the chains, then it'll generate words and sentences out of them.
