You have a few options off the top of my head: You can use a database or you can create an archive. Personally, I would use the archive approach, but a database in sqlite or CoreData will work just as well (and may even be faster). To create an archive, your classes need to subscribe to the NSCoding protocol, implementing the two methods - (id) initWithCoder:(NSKeyedUnarchiver*)aDecoder and - (void) encodeWithCoder:(NSKeyedArchiver*)aCoder . These are used by calling [aCoder encodeObject: myString forKey: @"theKeyIWantToUse"]; and [self setMyString: [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey: @"theKeyIWantToUse"]]; Reading and writing data from an archive is very easy and relatively fast thanks to Apple's polish on the coding system. Again, alternatively, you can build a CoreData backend that will manage object storage and retrieval in a database. This abstracts where data is stored and how it is accessed, which is very useful. Hope that helps!
