How to use Python iterators elegantly

I am trying to use iterators more for looping since I heard it is faster than index looping. One thing I am not sure is about how to treat the end of the sequence nicely. The way I can think of is to use try and except StopIteration , which looks ugly to me. To be more concrete, suppose we are asked to print the merged sorted list of two sorted lists a and b . I would write the following aNull = False I = iter(a) try: tmp = I.next() except StopIteration: aNull = True for x in b: if aNull: print x else: if x How would you code it to make it neater?
