Help with scrollbar class

Here is the scrollbar class in question: http://jsfiddle.net/brandondurham/6SUyM/3/ Currently the height of the scroll handle is dynamic and determined by the amount of content, much like a standard browser scrollbar. I need to be able to make this static (200px), regardless of the amount of content. You can see in the code where I tried to set the height, but when I did that the handle would land in strange places when dragging. Suggestions for making that height static instead of dynamic?
