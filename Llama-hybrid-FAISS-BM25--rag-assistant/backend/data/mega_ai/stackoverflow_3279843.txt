Python: How do i split the file?

I have this txt file which is ls -R of etc directory in a linux system. Example file: etc: ArchiveSEL xinetd.d etc/cmm: CMM_5085.bin cmm_sel storage.cfg etc/crontabs: root etc/pam.d: ftp rsh etc/rc.d: eth.set.sh rc.sysinit etc/rc.d/init.d: cmm functions userScripts etc/security: access.conf console.apps time.conf etc/security/console.apps: kbdrate etc/ssh: ssh_host_dsa_key sshd_config etc/var: setUser snmpd.conf etc/xinetd.d: irsh wu-ftpd I would like to split it by subdirectories into several files. example files would be like this: etc.txt, etcCmm.txt, etcCrontabs.txt, etcPamd.txt, ... Can someone give me a python code that can do that? Notice that the subdirectory lines end with ':', but i'm just not smart enough to write the code. some examples would be appreciated. thank you :)
