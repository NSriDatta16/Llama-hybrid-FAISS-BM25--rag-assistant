There is an method for using LVM snapshots for backup and restore that might be an interesting option for you. Instead of doing a mysqldump, consider using LVM to take snapshots of your MySQL data directories. Using LVM snapshots allow you to have nearly real time backup capability, support for all storage engines, and incredibly fast recovery. To quote from the link below, "Recovery time is as fast as putting data back and standard MySQL crash recovery, and it can be reduced even further." http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2006/08/21/using-lvm-for-mysql-backup-and-replication-setup/
