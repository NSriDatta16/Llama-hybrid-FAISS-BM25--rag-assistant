Python: convenient way to initialize lots of class members

If I have lots of class variables to initialize, any way to shorten the use of "self." ? That is, instead of doing: self.variable1 = 1 self.variable2 = 10 self.variable3 = "hello" etc. is it possible to do some shortcut like: with self: variable1 = 1 variable2 = 2 variable3 = 'hello' Just thought I could save on some typing if that's possible. BTW - when putting in code fragments in here, is there a way to indent a whole block. I find that selecting a whole block and then hitting tab does not work.
