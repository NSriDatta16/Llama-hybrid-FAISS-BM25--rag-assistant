Use example to explain odds ratio to layperson audience

I found an example of how to express odds-ratios in plain english. Here is the link http://www.pitt.edu/~bertsch/risk.pdf It says: How does one express an OR of 0.15 in plain English. Had this been a RR would have said that the intervention reduced the risk by 85%. Because it is an OR we must say that for every 15 persons who experienced the event in the experimental group 100 persons experienced the event in the control group. I find this a useful explanation for a lay audience. I have two logistic regression models with a categorical independent variable that I need to report odds ratios for. If the odds ratio for group a (compared to group b) is 1.75, can I say that for every 175 persons in group a that experienced the event, 100 persons in group b did, while controlling for the other variables? My second model has an odds ratio less than 1 so I would use the quoted example. Are there any concerns with this approach?
