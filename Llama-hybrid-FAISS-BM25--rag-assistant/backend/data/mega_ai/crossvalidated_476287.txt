Intuitively, if the noise and measurement errors from your sensors are independent and have zero mean, then using multiple sensors will improve the signal to noise ratio because the noise and errors will tend to cancel each other out as you increase the number of sensors. There is an interesting parallel to be made with the concept of ensembling in machine learning: Averaging the output of multiple models will improve accuracy for similar reasons (They reduce the variance that is inherent in a single model). So you can check the math underlying ensemble prediction methods to figure out a similar mathematical justification to using multiple sensors. Look for example at how Random Forests work as ensembles of high variance decision trees. But, but...this only works if the noise and errors are independent and zero mean. Often times in lab and industrial instrumentation situations, the noise and errors have some systemic environmental cause or are due to flaws in the measurement process which is introducing a non-zero mean bias to your model, so a more in-depth analysis is necessary than simply averaging the output of multiple censors.
