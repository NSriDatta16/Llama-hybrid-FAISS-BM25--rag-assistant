Your goal should be to get to a point where you don't need a release sprint to deploy to production:) But with that said, what are you doing in your release sprint? There are still tasks to be done, but they are even more predictable than developing code. I've never seen a difference in how the burndown/planning works other than it usually involves adding people to the team from ops. That of course can be its own problem. Maybe you could give a quick idea of what a release sprint looks like in your organization.
