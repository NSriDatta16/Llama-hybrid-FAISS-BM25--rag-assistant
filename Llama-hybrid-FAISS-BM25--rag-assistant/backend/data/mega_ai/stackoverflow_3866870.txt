Embedding Flash in Wordpress: filepath problem?

I have a Wordpress site. I want to embed a Flash file in one of my pages, like this: The Flash file that I have been given (I'm not a Flash coder, as will become clear) comes with a bunch of extra .zlib and asset files. I have put main.swf and all its accompanying files in a _flash directory in the DocumentRoot. If I go to http://mywebsite/_flash/main.swf the Flash loads just fine. However, from my Wordpress page - say http://mywebsite/flashypage - it does not. /_flash/main.swf loads OK, but the browser is looking for all the accompanying .zlib and other files not in /_flash , but in /flashypage (which of course doesn't exist as a directory). My Flash coder tells me that Flash will always look for its assets in a directory relative to the loading HTML page. In that case, given Wordpress's URL routing, is there any way I can actually embed Flash? Viz: I can't create a /flashypage/_flash subdirectory, or symlink, in the document root and put the Flash assets in there, because then when I try to load http://mywebsite/flashypage , I just see a directory listing. And I can't just put an index.html page in the /flashypage directory to load the Flash, because I need this page to be part of Wordpress, and use my Wordpress templates. Any ideas?
