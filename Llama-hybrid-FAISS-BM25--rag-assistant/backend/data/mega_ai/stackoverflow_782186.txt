Is it possible to auto-generate my Linq2Sql DBML via a script?

I use Linq2Sql and am tired of recreating the dbml everytime the database changes. Is it possible to script the creation of my model given that I want ALL tables and ALL procs? Ideally it would be part of the build process or a custom tool. A simple "refresh from schema" button would be fine too, but from all I can tell, there is no such thing. Currently the only way I have to update my model is to delete the tables and procs that were changed and re-drag them over from the server explorer. Maybe I'm missing something?
