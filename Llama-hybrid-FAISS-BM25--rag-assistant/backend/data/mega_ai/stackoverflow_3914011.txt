I would support @Jon Hanna's answer but emphasize the fact that .Net events implement a commonly-used pattern (Observer) with sufficient elegance that it is sheer perversity in most instances to implement it any other way. This is demonstrated by the way events turn up in the .Net Framework classes themselves, not just as a language construct for application programmers to play with. They are a first-class language feature, and as such to consciously avoid using them does not make sense. It would be like avoiding foreach loops just because there are other ways to achieve the same end. See here for an overview of Observer pattern and how events address this in .Net . It's unlikely that anything you build using other .Net programming methods would match the simplicity and expressiveness of the event implementation.
