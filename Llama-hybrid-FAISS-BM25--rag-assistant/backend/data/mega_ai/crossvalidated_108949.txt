Unbiased Estimator of Days Until Completion?

I'm trying to get an estimate of average number of days until some event occurs (the event is guaranteed to eventually occur). I have some sample where this event has already occured for most observations, so the number of days is known. However, this event has yet to occur for many other observations. I can't just omit those observations, since this will bias the average downwards. Can I get an unbiased estimate of the average? If so, how? Thank you!
