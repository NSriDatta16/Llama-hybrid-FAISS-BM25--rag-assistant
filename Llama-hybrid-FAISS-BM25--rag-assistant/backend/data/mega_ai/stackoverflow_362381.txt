How can I embed images in an ASP.NET Generated Word File

I have a quite common problem, as I saw in the various user groups but could not find a suitable answer. What I want to do is generate an ASP.NET page in my website which will have the option of being exported into Microsoft Word .doc format. The method I have used is this: Response.Clear(); Response.AddHeader("content-disposition", "attachment;filename=Test.doc"); Response.Charset = ""; Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.ContentType = "application/msword"; StringWriter sw = new StringWriter(); HtmlTextWriter htmlWrite = new HtmlTextWriter(sw); Page.RenderControl(htmlWrite); Response.Write(sw.ToString()); Response.End(); However this eventhough it generates a word doc, the images are note embedded in the document, rather they are placed as links. I have looked for a way to do this, but have not found something that actually worked. I would appreciate any help I can get, since this as "last minute" requirement (talk about typical) Thanks
