Generating Image data sets for training CNNs

I want to build a system that recognises (with a given uncertainty) the make and model of a car from an image. I have decided to use Convolution Neural Networks, specifically the Caffe framework. My next decision is how best to build my data set. According to this book, I need around 5000 data points for each class (so lets say ~500k images). I've done a little bit of reading on here and other resources, and it seems that the Google Custom Search API is a potential option; but that limits me to at most 100 searches per day (for free). I thought about building a script to scrape sites like Autotrader ; but my experience with scraping the web is zero. Does anyone have experience generating image data sets of this size? Any pearls of wisdom that you could share with me? I am happy to invest time and effort learning for example Beautiful Soup or this Google API, but I don't want to waste time going down the wrong rabbit hole.
