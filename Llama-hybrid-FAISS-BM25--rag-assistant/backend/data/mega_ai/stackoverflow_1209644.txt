Multitouch question

I want to detect, what part of screen is touched, when user shakes iPhone. I do it in the following way: -(void) accelerometer: (UIAccelerometer*)accelerometer didAccelerate: (UIAcceleration*)acceleration { float shakeStrength = sqrt( acceleration.x * acceleration.x + acceleration.y * acceleration.y + acceleration.z * acceleration.z ); if (shakeStrength >= 1.5f) { if (isLeftHandTouches && isRightHandTouches) { DebugLog(@"both hands shake"); } else if (isLeftHandTouches) { DebugLog(@"left hand shake"); } else if (isRightHandTouches) { DebugLog(@"right hand shake"); } } } -(void) touchesBegan: (NSSet *)touches withEvent: (UIEvent *)event { NSSet *allTouches = [event allTouches]; for (int i = 0; i Everything works fine if user removes both hands before making another shake, but everything gets messed up if I have both hands on the screen and remove one of them. i.e. I shake with both hands on the screen and afterwards I want to shake the iPhone with only one hand. In this case the shake won't count - as if there no touches on the screen. I assume that when I remove one hand from the screen, both "touches" are being removed. What is the problem and how can I fix it? Thanks.
