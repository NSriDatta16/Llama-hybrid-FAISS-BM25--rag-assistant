Missing Prediction Intervals by R package autoTS

I'm using autoTS R package to fit automatic time series estimation and prediction to a very very large number of time series. One of the outputs of the prediction function (my.predictions()) is a 95% prediction interval. But sometimes the lower and upper bounds are missing. Does anyone know the reason(s) for this? I've inspected the R codes of the involved functions but didn't get anywhere... Thanks in advance!
