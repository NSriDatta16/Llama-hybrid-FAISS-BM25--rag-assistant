getting cookie server side in rails when using Facebook Javascript SDK

I'm using this example to use the Facebook Javascript SDK to login. https://github.com/facebook/connect-js/blob/master/examples/jquery/login.html Everything works fine in that I can login and it shows the profile picture in the div. I then want to retrieve the cookie server-side and use it to make some requests of the Facebook API. I added a debugger statement in my rails application, and then restarted the server in debug mode. To simulate a simple request, I opened Firebug and did this: > $.get( '/', {}, {} ); When I am inside the debugger I run these commands: (rdb:1) p cookies {} (rdb:1) p request.cookies {} So, no cookies are set. When I look inside Firebug, I don't see cookies set in the request headers.
