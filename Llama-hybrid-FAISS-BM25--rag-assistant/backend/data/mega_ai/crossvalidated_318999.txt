Just looking at the question: Is theoretical and principled pursue of machine learning really that important? Define what you mean by "important". Coming from a philosophical point of view it's a fundamental distinction if you want to describe something or understand something. In a somewhat crude answer it is the difference between being scientific or something else. The practical part of it is of no concern to the underlying question. If something is too hard to prove, or even impossible to prove this in itself is an important discovery. (Enter Goedel et al.) But this does not mean it is irrelevant. It may at least seem irrelevant from a pragmatic point of view. But it should be at least be recognized as something of principal importance and value. Consider an analogy: medicine as a whole (and from its past) is non scientific. In certain ways it can actually never be. It is a discipline that is entirely governed by its outcome. In most cases there is nothing like "truth". But it turns out, that some parts can actually be scientific -- and this is where most of the planned progress is happening. Another extremely short description might be: without theory you can make a lot of money. If it's really useful for a "greater good", then you even might get a Nobel prize for it. But you will never ever get the Fields medal.
