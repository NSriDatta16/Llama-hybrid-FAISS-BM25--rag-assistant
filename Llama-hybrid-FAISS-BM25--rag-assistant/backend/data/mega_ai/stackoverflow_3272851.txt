IE 8 input type text/password bug

Password: The code above increases the CSS offset of the input element 6 pixels right. If the type is changed to 'text' as opposed to 'password' the CSS offset is not increased. I would file this as a bug with MS but I don't have the time nor energy to jump through their hoops. In addition it's common knowledge that IE is a sub-standard browser. We strongly encourage all of our users to abandon IE in favor of a standards-compliant browser.
