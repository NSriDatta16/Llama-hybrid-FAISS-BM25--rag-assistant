MLE is not a method. It corresponds to the choice of a score function over the set of distributions you search into. MLE means you take, for your score, the log-likelihood of your distribution given the dataset, that is the probability of the dataset given the distribution : $P(D/\theta)$. So a distribution that will make your dataset more probable than an other will have a higher score. The problem of MLE is that you do not take into account the prior within your distributions space. For instance, if you toss a dice a get a 3, MLE score will attribute the highest score to the distribution that has a probability of 1 on the 3 output and 0 to the others (which is counter-intuitive). You can introduce a prior to obtain a more sophisticated score. In that case your score will have two elements : one due to the prior and the other to the likelihood. There are many choices of prior depending on the family of model you want to learn (Bayesian network, Markov network,...)
