most rational way to drag popup menu in flex

In my app I currently have a popup menu implemented as a BorderContainer with a lot of buttons, textfields, date pickers, etc. PopUpManager handles its appearing and disappearing based on some UI events. I'd like to be able to drag the container by clicking on any part of it minus all the components on it. In other words, when I click on buttons, text fields, etc. I'd like for them to respond as usual and for the container not be draggable. I've tried this very simple implementation _menu.addEventListener(MouseEvent.ROLL_OVER, toggleDragON); _menu.addEventListener(MouseEvent.ROLL_OUT, toggleDragOFF); private function mouseDown(event:MouseEvent):void { _menu.startDrag(); } private function mouseReleased(event:MouseEvent):void { _menu.stopDrag(); } but this definitely doesn't do the trick, i.e. all components lead to dragging. I've tried to make sure that mouseEnabled and mouseChildren are true for all the components but this doesn't seem to make any difference. I then came across this thread which makes a lot of sense, but I have a hard time believing that the best way for one to handle this is to handle all click events for each of the components on the popup. Is there an obviously simple way to do this that I'm missing? thank you! f
