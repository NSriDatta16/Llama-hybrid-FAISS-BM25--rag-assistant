Although not a 100% elegant solution this works in SQL Server. You should use a subquery to get the default price, but I did it this way for clarity. DECLARE @Price DECIMAL(9,2) SELECT @Price = price FROM Products WHERE Region = 0 SELECT A.accountNumber, A.Product, ISNULL(P.Price, @Price) AS Price FROM Accounts A LEFT OUTER JOIN Products P ON (A.Region = P.Region AND A.Product = P.Product)
