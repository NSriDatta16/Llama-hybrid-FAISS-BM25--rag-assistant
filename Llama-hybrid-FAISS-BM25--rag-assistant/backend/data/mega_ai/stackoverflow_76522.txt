Should my C# .NET team migrate to Windows Presentation Foundation?

We make infrastructure services (data retrieval and storage) and small smart client applications (fancy reporting mostly) for a commercial bank. Our team is large, 40 odd contractual employees that are C# .NET programmers. We support 50 odd applications and systems that we have developed. A few members of the team began making WPF , WF and WCF based applications. Given that they are the first, most members do not understand these technologies. What benefits do they convey that would overcome the cost of retraining the team?
