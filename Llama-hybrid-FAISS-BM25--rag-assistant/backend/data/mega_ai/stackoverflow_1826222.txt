O(n) where n is the length of the strippedText string. Worst case, every character will be equal to the searchText and will result in n itterations, but even if that isn't the case (which I am assuming it won't be) your average case will be some factor, c, of n where c is greater than zero but less than 1, so the number of loops will be cn, but a constant factor of n will still be represented as O(n).
