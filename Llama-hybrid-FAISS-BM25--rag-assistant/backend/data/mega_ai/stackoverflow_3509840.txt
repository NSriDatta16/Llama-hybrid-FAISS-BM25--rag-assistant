What languages to write windows shell extensions

I know how to write shell extesions in python. The drawbacks are it does not work on 64 bit Windows I am unsure how creating a python process everytime something “happens” reduces performance. I know how to write shell extensions using .Net (C#) The drawbacks are discouraged by MS I am unsure how this reduces performance. (does it?) I have seen shell extenions written in (free)pascal. Are there drawbacks using this approach Does this work with 64bit windows. Obviosly one can write shell extensions using c or c++ Well... I am still trying to understand com in c and c++.... What other optios are there, what other languages ? Do they have drawbacks?
