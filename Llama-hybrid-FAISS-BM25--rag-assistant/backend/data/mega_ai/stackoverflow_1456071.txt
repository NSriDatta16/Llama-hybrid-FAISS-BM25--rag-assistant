Let's start with the idea that application should be deployed in complete form only for integration testing. That happens may be twice a day. All other times you do unit and local integration testing (i.e. JUnit test with actual database connection), and those tests have next to zero startup time. My dev activity is like this: write (mocked) unit tests and code at the same time; run unit tests may be 20 times before the code works as I expect write local integrated tests for major cases; run the tests may be 3 or 5 times before I'm sure it's ok package the whole application and do a walk-through of the scenario via UI once or twice In the time allocation like that AS startup time doesn't take much of my performance. So instead of complaining about AS it's better to make an effort to organize the development process in the first place.
