If you're embedding it, why use JSON or JSON.parse at all? Why not just literals: templateLoader('questionTemplate', 'questionContainer', [{"ID":1,"Text":"something with an escaped \"double quote\" and a single quote does the unicode version\u0027s end of string"}]); Clearly, you have to modify templateLoader accordingly. You can change serializedData to json (except that the name is misleading, since json is actually an array, not a JSON string), then delete the first line of the function.
