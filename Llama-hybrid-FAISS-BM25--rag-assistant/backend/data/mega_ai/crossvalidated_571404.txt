Is there any terminology for slope/mean(Y) in 2D time series linear regression

I am using linear regression to calculate trend of 2D x-y data. (x is time and y is some sensor data) However, I realized that sometimes slope of linear regression needs proper scaling. For example, even though data is same, slope can be varied by unit. (kilo-meter, centi-meter ...) I'd like to extract somewhat normalized trend for time-series data, and one of my approach is dividing slope over mean(Y). In this case, I think, slope/mean(Y) means that the ratio of change in unit time. Assuming mean(Y) is an estimate of desirable sensor data, I intended slope/mean(Y) can have meaning like "this sensor data is being changed 00% daily". (So, to express like this, it's a little bit different with normalizing data.) In this background, will there be any proper terminology for slope/mean(Y)? Thanks in advance.
