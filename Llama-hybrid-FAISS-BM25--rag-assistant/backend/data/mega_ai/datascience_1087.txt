Here's a simple initial approach to try: Calculate the TF-IDF score of each word in each document. Sort the documents by the average TF-IDF score of their words. The higher the average TF-IDF score, the more unique a document is with respect to the rest of the collection. You might also try a clustering-based approach where you look for outliers, or perhaps something with the Jaccard index using a bag-of-words model.
