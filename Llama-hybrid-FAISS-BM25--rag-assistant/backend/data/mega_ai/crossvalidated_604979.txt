Is it reasonable to choose a subset of the time series to create a model?

I am new to time series forecasting and would much appreciate your reply. I have an annual housing starts data between1970-2022 shown, below. I want to forecast the next 10 year housing units. If I use the whole series to model, the prediction interval is quite wide, below. Based on a very similar project is here ( https://towardsdatascience.com/applied-time-series-forecasting-residential-housing-in-the-us-f8ab68e63f94 ) I tried the last 12 year as predictor and I get better accuracy, below. But, is choosing only last 12 year for modelling reasonable? I am concern that my model doesn’t capture the evolution of the data if I don’t use the whole series. Any suggestions? Thank you in advance.
