Conditional logistic regression vs GLMM in R

I have paired data (GWAS case/control study) and I have heard using conditional logistic regression or generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) is appropriate. Which should I use in this case? Why would you use one over the other. More importantly can you guys point me towards resources for doing these methods in R ? I'm finding a lot of material for SAS , which I do not prefer. I can provide more details if necessary.
