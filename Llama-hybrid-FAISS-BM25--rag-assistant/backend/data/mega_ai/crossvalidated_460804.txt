Which type of time series is my data? Random Walk? MA? White Noise?

I am given a time series data. I read that there are several types of such a data, namely, Random Walk, Moving Averages and the White Noise. This I discovered here . Before doing any analysis, should I first to determine the type of time series or is it sufficient to check for (weak) stationarity? At the end, I have to do spectral analysis.
