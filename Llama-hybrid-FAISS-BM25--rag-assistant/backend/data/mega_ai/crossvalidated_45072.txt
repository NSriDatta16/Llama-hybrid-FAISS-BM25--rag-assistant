The suggested procedure -- toss out the extra hour, fill in the missing hour by averaging nearby values -- strikes me as quite reasonable. The affected hours are in the middle of the night when the system is drawing its base load. There is much less volatility of base loads than of peak loads. Therefore, the forecasting results are unlikely to be sensitive to the details: any reasonable way of accounting for the change-over should yield about the same result in terms of calibrating a forecasting model.
