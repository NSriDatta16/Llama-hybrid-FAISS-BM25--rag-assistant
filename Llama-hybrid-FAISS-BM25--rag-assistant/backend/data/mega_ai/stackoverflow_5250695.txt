How to get Hudson to see rcov results?

I am currently working to integrate rcov with our Hudson server. I am able to run rcov via rake and get the results with out issue (see rake file below). When I run things via Hudson - calling the rake task - the tests with coverage are clearly generated and displayed in the console. But at almost the end, the following shows up in the console: ** Execute test:coverage Recording test results No test report files were found. Configuration error? Build wasn't successful, skipping rcov coverage report Finished: FAILURE Rake task desc 'Aggregate code coverage for unit, functional and integration tests' task :coverage => "test:coverage:clean" %w[unit functional].each do |target| namespace :coverage do Rcov::RcovTask.new(target) do |t| t.libs "test:coverage:#{target}" end Going to coverage/ I see output file. The coverage.data file is present as well. Any thoughts on what might be going wrong here? Am I missing something blindingly obvious?
