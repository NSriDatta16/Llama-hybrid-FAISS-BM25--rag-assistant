dynamic error in asp.net mvc 3.0 razor

I am trying to add some code that I got from nerdinner @Html.OpenIdSelector(this.Page, new SelectorButton[] { new SelectorProviderButton("https://me.yahoo.com/", Url.Content("~/Content/Images/Account/Index/yahoo_64.png")), new SelectorProviderButton("https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id", Url.Content("~/Content/images/google.gif")), new SelectorOpenIdButton(Url.Content("~/Content/images/openid.gif")), }) however I get this error Error 1 'System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper' has no applicable method named 'OpenIdSelector' but appears to have an extension method by that name. Extension methods cannot be dynamically dispatched. Consider casting the dynamic arguments or calling the extension method without the extension method syntax. I have no clue what it wants. Edit I get this now CS1928: 'System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper' does not contain a definition for 'OpenIdSelector' and the best extension method overload 'DotNetOpenAuth.Mvc.OpenIdHelper.OpenIdSelector(System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper, params DotNetOpenAuth.OpenId.RelyingParty.SelectorButton[])' has some invalid arguments Edit 2 They must have changed it. I was checking and my version of dotnetopenauth does not take in 2 parameters only 1. Nerd dinners version takes in 2. Anyways now I removed that and get this Server Error in '/' Application. The current IHttpHandler is not one of types: System.Web.UI.Page, DotNetOpenAuth.IEmbeddedResourceRetrieval. An embedded resource URL provider must be set in your .config file.
