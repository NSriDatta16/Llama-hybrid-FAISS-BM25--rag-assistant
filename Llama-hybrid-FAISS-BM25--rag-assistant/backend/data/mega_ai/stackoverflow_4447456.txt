Flex Data Management is part of Flex Data Services . It is a framework and toolset for storing data on the server ( not locally in the web browser). Here is a tutorial for using Data Management with a java-based server . Shared Objects are designed for local (in-browser) storage. I know you said you don't want to use them, but why not? That's what they're there for. The only other approach that might be feasible, is to utilize the new HTML5 database storage (see this S.O. answer ). In order to access it from flex/flash you'd have to (a) write some JavaScript function(s) to do the storage/retrieval, and (b) use External Interface to call your JavaScript from within flex/flash. I'd strongly suggest that you consider using Shared Objects.
