Java | compare char word in a char array

How do I get the index of a single word (represents in a char array) which can be found in a paragraph (again represents in a char array). the char represents the word char word[] = new char[]{'w','o','r','d'}; and here's the paragraph char para[] = new char[]{'f','g','q','z','y','i','o','p','w','o','r','d'}; I would like to get the index of the first letter in this case 8th. I used binary search by when sorting the words get scrambled. Thanks.
