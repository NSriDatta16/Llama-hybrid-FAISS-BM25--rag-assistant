How to pool more than two sample means and standard deviations?

I have 4 independent samples from one population, with their respective sample sizes, means and standard deviations. I don't have the raw data, and all of them follow gaussian distributions. Sample 1: n1=5, mean1=183, sd1=24 Sample 2: n2=10, mean2=170, sd2=20 Sample 3: n3=19, mean3=165, sd3=21 Sample 4: n4=20, mean4=117, sd4=13 How can I calculate the average of all of them (four samples) and obtain the resulted normal distribution (which would be number 5)? It would be represented by its new sample size, mean and sd.
