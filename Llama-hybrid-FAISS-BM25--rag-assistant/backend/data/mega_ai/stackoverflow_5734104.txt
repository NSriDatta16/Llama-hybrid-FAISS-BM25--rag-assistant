What is the correct url helper for my cart in magento top links

I am trying to rearrange the order of the top links using a local.xml file and so far everything is going well, however for the cart I keep getting an non existent url. At first I just added the block back into the top links in the following manner Account Account 130 Home Home 50 which worked by adding in my cart. So then I wanted to position it as the last link so I figured I could use the following snippet Account Account 130 Home Home 50 Cart Cart 150 neither this or using "addCartLink" works.So what is the correct way to do use addLink for my cart in the toplinks?
