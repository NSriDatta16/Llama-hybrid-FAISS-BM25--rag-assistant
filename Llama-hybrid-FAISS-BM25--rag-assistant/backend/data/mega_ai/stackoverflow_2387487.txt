In the second page, the code in your "ready" handler can check the page location. If the location has something like '#wrapper' in it, then your javascript can reset the location. $(document).ready(function(){ $('#wrapper').append($(' Here is Section A Some more content here. ')); if (document.location.hash === '#wrapper') document.location.hash = '#wrapper'; }); I'll try this out to see if it actually works. :-) edit OK here's a test page: http://gutfullofbeer.net/hash1.html There are two links: one has the hash in it ('#hello' in my case) and one doesn't. When you click the second one, you'll notice that you see the "hello" section at the bottom of the page. When you click the first one, you go to the same page but the "hello" section won't be visible (unless your browser window is really gigantic).
