Full model significant but insignificant predictors (NO COLLINEARITY)

A follow-up on this unceremoniously deleted question , and before you yet again send me to this one , keep in mind that, as was re-iterated in the original formulation , collinearity is not an issue here (which is the only explanation brought up in that other discussion ). We fit a logistic regression model with about ~10 numerical predictors, for $n=500$ observations (a seemingly respectable sample size) and got the following: Full model is statistically significant. Here are the ANOVA results using ChiSq test. None of the individual predictors are significant in the full model. Here is the model summary. No evidence of collinearity (VIF scores all 0.5, etc) . Here is the VIF output for the model. And when enough variables are dropped (e.g. via stepwise selection to reduce the model), the individual predictors eventually start becoming significant.. What might be operating here if not collinearity ?
