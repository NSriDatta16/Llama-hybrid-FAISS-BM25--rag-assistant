If the population we sampled from (low income) would indeed have an expected weight gain of 30 pounds, seeing 36.2 as an average would be very unlikely. Thus, it is more plausible that the population we sampled from has a higher average weight gain. The idea is that maybe the unconditional population mean is 30, but that the weight gain is negatively correlated with income. Thus, the conditional expectation of weight gain conditional on being poor might be higher. This could explain the high average in our sample.
