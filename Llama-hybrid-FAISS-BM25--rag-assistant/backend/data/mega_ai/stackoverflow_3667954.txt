Url and title with php snippet

I read several similar posts but I don't see my fault. index.php looks like: Demo Title footer.php looks like: (.*?) /is',$text,$found)) { $title = $found[1]; } else { $title = " -- no title found -- "; } ?> A request for the URL http://127.0.0.1/test/index.php results in: http://127.0.0.1/test/index.phpCan't open HTTP_REFERER. or for http://127.0.0.1/test/ http://127.0.0.1/test/Can't open HTTP_REFERER. Any hints appreciated.
