What is the best way to normalize a set of datasets

I have a data set that contains the same Time series "Sensor readings" for different days and I want to make a deep learning model to predict these values. What I did was I splatted the data into Time series data according to the day, then I normalized it separately (min-max) (the readings have different ranges, for example, the max value for the first day is 100 but the max for second is 48) but I'm really confused now do I need to normalize it using the max/min of the all days or what I did was right?
