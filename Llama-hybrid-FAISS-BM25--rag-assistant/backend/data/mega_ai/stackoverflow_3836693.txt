I use snippets on the mac. I found a similar app (though not as beautiful...) called glipper. It is an gnome applet that was designed as a clipboard manager. It has a snippet collector built into it though (turn it on in plugins) that lets you save snippets forever. It is not very well organized...but it is a very simple offering that has a simple interface.
