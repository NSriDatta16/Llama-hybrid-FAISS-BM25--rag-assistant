I've written a macro (in Visual Studio) that allows me to not only code CSS for named colors but to easily calculate shades or blends of those colors. It also handles fonts. It fires on save and outputs a separate version of the CSS file. This is in line with Bert Bos's argument that any symbol processing in CSS take place at the point of authoring, not not at the point of interpretation. The full setup along with all the code would be a bit too complicated to post here, but might be appropriate for a blog post down the road. Here's the comment section from the macro which should be enough to get started. The goals of this approach are as follows: Allow base colors, fonts, etc. to be defined in a central location, so that an entire pallete or typographical treatment can be easily tweaked without having to use search/replace Avoid having to map the .CSS extension in IIS Generate garden-variety text CSS files that can be used, for example, by VisualStudio's design mode Generate these files once at authoring time, rather than recalculating them every time the CSS file is requested Generate these files instantly and transparently, without adding extra steps to the tweak-save-test workflow With this approach, colors, shades of colors, and font families are all represented with shorthand tokens that refer to a list of values in an XML file. The XML file containing the color and font definitions must be called Constants.xml and must reside in the same folder as the CSS files. The ProcessCSS method is fired by EnvironmentEvents whenever VisualStudio saves a CSS file. The CSS file is expanded, and the expanded, static version of the file is saved in the /css/static/ folder. (All HTML pages should reference the /css/static/ versions of the CSS files). The Constants.xml file might look something like this: ... ... In the CSS file, you can then have definitions like: font-family:[[f:Text]]; background:[[c:Background]]; border-top:1px solid [[c:Red+.5]]; /* 50% white tint of red */
