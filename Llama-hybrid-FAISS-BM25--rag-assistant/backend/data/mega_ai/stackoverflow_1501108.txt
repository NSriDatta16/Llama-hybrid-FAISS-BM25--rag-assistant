How to get the url of a webpage that is embedding another page in an iframe on a different origin domain

Webpage A is embedded in an iframe inside of webpage B. A and B are on two different domains and therefore the same origin policy prevents A from accessing properties of B like so; location = window.top.location.href // emits a "Permission denied" error Is there any other way for A to get B's url?
