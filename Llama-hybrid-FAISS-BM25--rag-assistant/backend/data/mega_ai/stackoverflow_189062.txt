Does a MasterPage know what page is being displayed?

When I navigate on a website utilizing MasterPages, does the application know what page I am on? If so, does it store it in an object I can access? The reason I am asking is so I can replace this: //masterpage //content page(s) Home FAQ Videos Button 4 Button 5 With a more elegant solution for the navigation, which highlights the link to the page by having the list item's ID set to "current". Currently each page recreates the navigation with its respective link's ID set to current.
