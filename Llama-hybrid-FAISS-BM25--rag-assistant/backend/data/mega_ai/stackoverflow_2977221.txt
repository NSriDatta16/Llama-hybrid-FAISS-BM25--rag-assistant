Deleted Code and prev post. Silence: "Real" silence must be zero. Otherwise it is often called "room" silence, a very small noise which is present everywhere if you dont use a noise gate. (recording) Its just an idea: remember that using signed values will cause 1 bit to be used for the signed/unsigned marker. Maybe ( i dont know) this is what you see after converting it to a signed wave file using audacity. Im sorry but i dont have the time to test this. Wave files: I don't know how much you know about soundfiles, but: If you just want to add silence try it this way: Each sample is of size X bits: so you need X/8 bytes for one sample. You know the sampling rate-so you can just copy the original raw byte array into one of size (silence_length_in_samples bytes_per_frame)+(original)+(silence_length_in_samples bytes_per_frame) and just write it back into a soundfile by using the python tools which i hope can do this. 2 Channels: The raw bytes are organized in: [sample1(channel1_bytes, channel2bytes)][sample2(channel1_bytes,channel2_bytes).... I hope it is clear what I mean :)
