Can any probability be expressed as an expectation?

In section 6.1 of the notes Stat 3701 Lecture Notes: Bayesian Inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) by Charles J. Geyer, the author states Suppose we have a probability or expectation we want to estimate. Probability is a special case of expectation: if $g$ is a zero-or-one valued function, then $$ E\{ g(X) \} = \Pr\{ g(X) = 1 \} $$ and any probability can be written this way. So we just consider expectations. I would assume that $g$ in this context is the function $$ g(X) = \begin{cases} 1 & \ \text{if} \ \ X \in A \\ 0 & \ \text{if} \ \ X \notin A \end{cases} $$ such that $$ \Pr\{ g(X) = 1 \} = \Pr\{ X \in A \} $$ where $A$ is some subset of the range (image) of $X$ . Is this true for any random variable $X$ ?
