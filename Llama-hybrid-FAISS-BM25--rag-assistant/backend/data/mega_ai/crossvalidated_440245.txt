It is almost always necessary. I say almost always because it changes the interpretation of the other coefficients. Leaving out the column of 1s may be fine when you are regressing the outcome on categorical predictors, but often we include continuous predictors. Let's compare a logistic regression with and without the intercept when we have a continuous predictor. Assume the data have been mean centered. Without the column of 1s, the model looks like $$ \operatorname{logit}\left( \dfrac{p(x)}{1-p(x)} \right) = \beta x $$ When $x=0$ (i.e. when the covariate is equal to the sample mean), then the log odds of the outcome is 0, which corresponds to $p(x) = 0.5$ . So what this says is that when $x$ is at the sample mean, then the probability of a success is 50% (which seems a bit restrictive). If we do have the intercept, the model is then $$ \operatorname{logit}\left( \dfrac{p(x)}{1-p(x)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta x $$ Now, when $x=0$ the log odds is equal to $\beta_0$ which we can freely estimate from the data. In short, unless you have good reason to do so, include the column of 1s.
