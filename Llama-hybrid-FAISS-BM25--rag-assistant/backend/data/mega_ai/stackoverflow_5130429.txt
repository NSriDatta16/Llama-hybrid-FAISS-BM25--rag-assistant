About generating JSON or a partial view in the controller, both options are valid. I'd go with JSON if the HTML to generate/modify isn't too complex, and I'd choose returning a HTML fragment for something like refreshing a big table, or load a new complex panel, etc. To generate JSON I usually go with a Spring MVC controller method with a bean return type annotated with @ResponseBody .
