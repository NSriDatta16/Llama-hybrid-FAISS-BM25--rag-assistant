You want to know if you can use anomaly detection with transformer in multiple features, right? The answer is yes and the most straighforward solution is to keep one detection system per feature if there is no dependencies between them. But if there are anomalies depending on a group of features, it would require a more complex transformer architecture, including a multi-head attention function or something similar.
