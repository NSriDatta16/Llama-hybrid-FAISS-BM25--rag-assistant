You're touching on problem formulation, where the designer defines input variables and their characteristics. Looking at the structure you show, if you were trying to predict whether a liquid is frozen or solid, such a structure would be useful. If you were trying to predict a future value of the variable, then it would be much less useful. So your question is quite abstract, and so the answer is yes such a structure is surely used and has advantages in certain circumstances. But the challenge in machine learning is the inverse of the challenge you propose. Given a problem that needs a solution, what are the best variables and model to solve the problem.
