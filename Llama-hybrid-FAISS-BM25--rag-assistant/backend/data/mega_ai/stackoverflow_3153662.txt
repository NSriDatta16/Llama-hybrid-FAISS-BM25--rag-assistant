EXECUTE Permissions Denied - .NET and SQL2008 Compatibility Mode 100

We recently began testing our new SQL2008 servers running in Compat mode 100 and one of our .NET applications has stopped running and returning the error: The EXECUTE permission was denied on the object 'My Stored proc', database 'My Database', schema 'dbo'. Now I have already made sure that the login this application is making the connection on has the proper EXECUTE rights granted so I know that is not the issue. So I was wondering if there was any other cause that could be making this happen related to the compatitiblity mode of SQL Server 2008, or even something else? The .NET application is currently in 3.5 and using System.Data.SqlClient to call the stored procedure. Thanks in advance!
