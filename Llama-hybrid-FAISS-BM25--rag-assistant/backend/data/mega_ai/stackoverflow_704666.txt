Look at the Windows Portable Devices API, it has functionality that allows you to attach it to an SD reader (it's known as a storage device) and get events when a card is inserted or removed. It just has two (possibly major) drawbacks: It requires Windows Vista or later It only has a COM API, so if you want to use it from a .NET program you either have a lot of interop ahead of you, or you have to write a wrapper in C++ or C++/CLI
