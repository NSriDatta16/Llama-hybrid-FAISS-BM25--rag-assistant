The R package pdc offers clustering for multivariate time series. Permutation Distribution Clustering is a complexity-based dissimilarity measure for time series. If you can assume that differences in time series are due to differences w.r.t. complexity and, specifically not due to differences in means, variances, or the moments in general, this may be a valid approach. The algorithmic time complexity of calculating the pdc representation of a multivariate time series is in O(DTN) with D being the number of dimensions, T being the length of the time series and N being the number of time series. This is probably as efficient as it gets since a single sweep over each dimension of each time series is enough to obtain the compressed complexity representation. This representation can be used to calculate dissimilarity between two time series at low cost (depending on the chosen representational complexity which can either be pre-specified or derived from the data). Here is a simple worked example with a hierarchical clustering of multivariate white-noise time series (the plot illustrates only the first dimension of each time series): require("pdc") num.ts The command pdcDist(data) generates a dissimilarity matrix: Since the data are all white noise, there is no apparent structure in the dissimilarity matrix. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 4.832894 3 4.810718 4.790286 4 4.812738 4.796530 4.809482 5 4.798458 4.772756 4.751079 4.786206 6 4.812076 4.793027 4.798996 4.758193 4.751691 7 4.786515 4.771505 4.754735 4.837236 4.775775 4.794706 8 4.808709 4.832403 4.722993 4.781267 4.784397 4.776600 4.787757 For more information refer to: Brandmaier, A.
