Is there a way to capture/override Ctrl-R or F5 on IE using Javascript?

I want to capture the Ctrl - R or F5 shortcut on the browser to prevent it from performing a browser refresh, but instead perform a custom refresh. I was able to capture Ctrl - R on Safari and FF using: document.onkeypress = function(e){ if ((e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey) && e.keyCode == 114) // Ctrl-R e.preventDefault(); } But that doesn't work on IE. Is there any way to do this on IE? Update: For people who are asking why I am doing this in the first place: I just wanted to do a custom app refresh, but wanted to avoid having a "refresh" button because I kinda discourage using the refresh (We have a full page flex app). We ended up switching to F8 because F5 was just too hard to get working on all browsers.
