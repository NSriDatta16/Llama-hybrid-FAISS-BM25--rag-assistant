Your should be using the training data preprocessing model to do the predictions on the test dataset. Leave the validation dataset as it is, because it is to be considered completely new data for your machine learning model. As far as the test data is concerned, if you build a seperate model of pre-processing on the test dataset, you are kind of using the test data also to train your model, and that is known to be over-fitting of the model
