Generic Collections

In VB6, there used to be a Collection data type that would allow retrieval of an item in the collection by either its key or its ordinal. However, it wasn't strongly typed. Now, with VB.Net, I am looking for a suitable replacement that is strongly type and could be used with a generic collection. This is a simple example of what I want to do. The only problem is that the underlying collection class, BindingList, does not support efficient retrieval of an item by an alpha key, so I have to loop through the elements to get the item I am looking for. For large collections, this is not efficient. I have looked though the various Collection type classes and have found no suitable replacement. This is what I want to do, except for the looping that is done with the Item property. Rather than just saying "Use Hash tables" or something like that, if you could, please include the detailed out as I have done for the short example below. Public Class Car Public Sub New(ByVal keyName As String, ByVal property1 As String) _KeyName = keyName _Property1 = property1 End Sub Dim _KeyName As String Public Property KeyName() As String Get Return _KeyName End Get Set(ByVal value As String) _KeyName = value End Set End Property Public _Property1 As String Public Property Property1() As String Get Return _Property1 End Get Set(ByVal value As String) _Property1 = value End Set End Property End Class Public Class Cars Inherits System.ComponentModel.BindingList(Of Car) Public Overloads ReadOnly Property Item(ByVal key As String) As Car Get For Each CurrentCar As Car In Me.Items If CurrentCar.KeyName = key Then Return CurrentCar End If Next Return Nothing End Get End Property End Class
