Unfortunately, no. The analogous concept in the Java world is the Isolate, that appeared first in the JSR 121. This was an API for a future JVM feature that would allow safe separation and communication between different applications running in the same JVM. After the JSR was published (around 2004) one research team in Sun worked in the Barcelona project. This project tried to implement the Isolation API in Sun's HotSpot 1.5 VM. After two years, they released a prototype for SPARC/Solaris. Windows/Linux versions were never released due to stability problems. Recently, SUN has introduced a limited version of the Isolation API to J2ME, focusing of offering "multiple processes" in environments that didn't actively offer them. Recently, we also asked Sun for their status in implementing the Isolate API to standard JVMs and their response was that they plan to release a JVM with limited support. They plan to offer the ability to load/unload Isolates but without the ability to communicate between them. Also, there has been an old reserach efford to build an Isolates-compatible JVM version, called JanosVM (java 1.1) but I doubt that it can be of any use today. Hope this helps...
