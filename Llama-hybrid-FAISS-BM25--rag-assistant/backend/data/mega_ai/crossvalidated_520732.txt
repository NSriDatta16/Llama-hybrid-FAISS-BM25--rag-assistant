What the difference between clustering methods?

I am focusing on a thesis for introducing clustering methods. Chapter 3 includes hierarchical clustering, partitional clustering and density-based clustering. Meanwhile, chapter 4 is mainly on Self-organizing map, such as 2DSOM and GHSOM. However, I have no idea on the title of chapter 3 and chapter 4. In my opinion, ch3 is traditional clustering methods, while ch4 is neural network clustering methods. What the best title for dividing and concluding their difference?
