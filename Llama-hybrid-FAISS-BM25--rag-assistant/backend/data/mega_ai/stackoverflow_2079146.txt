My .emacs file loads ~/.emacs.d/init.el , which defines the following functions, written first for XEmacs, but working well enough for Emacs these days: (defconst user-init-dir (cond ((boundp 'user-emacs-directory) user-emacs-directory) ((boundp 'user-init-directory) user-init-directory) (t "~/.emacs.d/"))) (defun load-user-file (file) (interactive "f") "Load a file in current user's configuration directory" (load-file (expand-file-name file user-init-dir))) Then the rest of the file goes and loads lots of individual files with forms like this: (load-user-file "personal.el") My current set of files is as follows: personal.el platform.el cygwin.el variables.el paths.el mail-news.el misc-funcs.el bbdb.el calendar.el gnus-funcs.el c-and-java.el lisp.el clojure.el go.el markdown.el sgml-xml.el tex.el spelling.el org.el packages.el fonts.el color-theme.el frame.el server.el keys.el aquamacs.el Some of them are much more specific in intent than others, as the names suggest. The more fine-grained the files, the easier it is to disable a cluster of forms when you're reinstalling a package or library. This is especially useful when "moving in" to a new system, where you drag your configuration files over but don't yet have all the supporting packages installed.
