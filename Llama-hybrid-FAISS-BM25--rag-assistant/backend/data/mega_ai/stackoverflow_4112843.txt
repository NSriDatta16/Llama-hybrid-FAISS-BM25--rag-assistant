You can use ' PHP block visibility settings ' to achieve what you want here. Using PHP you can query the database, and check whether the logged in user is the same user that created the node in the organic group. There is an example already on drupal.org that I have adapted (you will probably need to customise this further) - uid) { // check we've got a group, rights to view the group, // and of type "group_type" - change this to whichever group you want to restrict the block to // or remove the condition entirely if (($group = og_get_group_context()) && node_access('view', $group) && ($group->type == 'group_type') ) { // check current user is a team admin as they should get access if (og_is_node_admin($group)) { return TRUE; } // check to see if the current user is the node author if (arg(0) == 'node' && is_numeric(arg(1))) { $nid = arg(1); $node = node_load(array('nid' => $nid)); if ($node->uid == $user->uid) { return TRUE; } } } } } return FALSE; ?>
