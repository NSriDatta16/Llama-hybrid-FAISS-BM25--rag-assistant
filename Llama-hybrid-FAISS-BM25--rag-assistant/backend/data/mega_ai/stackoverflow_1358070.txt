Yeah. There are many ways to do this. Most common: (DataTemplate + DataTrigger) or ItemTemplateSelector. In DataTemplate+DataTrigger scenario in the DataTrigger you will update content of your DataTemplate via setters. With ItemTemplateSelector you can decide based on your item which DataTemplate to use. I really encourage you to read wonderful series of articles by dr. Wpf "ItemsControl: A to Z" . If you spend 4 - 6 hours on reading today you will save much more hours later, when you find yourself one on one with problems in ItemsControl (hopefully not right before the deadline). More details on your particular question is here: 'D' is for DataTemplate
