XSLT passing url to asp page that does not de-escape & to &, what to do?

I have a problem, I have a URL provided from a website in the form: http://data.dezrez.com/PictureResizer.ASP?PropertyID=99999999&amp;PhotoID=1&amp;AgentID=9999&amp;BranchID=9999&amp;width=750&amp;rotation=0 i am then using in an XSL-FO file which is using the return code however the ASP page at dezrez is not recognising the url as it cannot understand the &amp; and escape it to &, I have not access to their ASP page and need to know how to approach it so that it will work.
