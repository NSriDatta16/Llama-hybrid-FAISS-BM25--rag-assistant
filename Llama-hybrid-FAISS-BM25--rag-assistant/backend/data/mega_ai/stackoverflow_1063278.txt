First of all there are multiple protocols to retreive mail: POP3, IMAP, etc... I suggest you start by familiarizing yourself with the various components that make up an e-mail system. Mail Transfer Agent (Protocol: SMTP) Mail Delivery Agent (Protocols: POP3, IMAP) Mail User Agent (Outlook, Webmail, Thunderbird, your application) Basically what you are trying to write is a Mail User Agent. A mail user agent has to "fetch" the mails from a Mail Delivery Agent using either POP or IMAP. This means you will have to learn about these two protocols: POP3 RFC: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1939.html IMAPv4 RFC: http://james.apache.org/server/rfclist/imap4/rfc2060.txt Since e-mail communication happens using TCP/IP you will have to learn how to use the classes in the System.Net.Sockets namespace. Take a look at the TcpClient class: http://james.apache.org/server/rfclist/imap4/rfc2060.txt Try to understand these concepts first and then I suggest you start out with POP3, this protocol is quite easy. If you have problems then with very specific TcpClient code please update your question or post a new question. Hope this sets you on the right track.
