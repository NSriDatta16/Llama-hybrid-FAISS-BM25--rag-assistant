Chris, I agree with you to a degree, but in my experience what ends up happening is that in their eagerness to publish you end up with too many "me too" codes and methods, which don't really add to the quality of science. If there was a little more thought about open sourcing code and encouraging others to contribute (without necessarily getting publications out of it) then everyone would benefit. Definitely agree that a separation between the scientific programmers and the software engineers is a good thing, especially for production applications. But even for scientific programming, the quality of my code would have been so much better if I had followed good practices at the time.
