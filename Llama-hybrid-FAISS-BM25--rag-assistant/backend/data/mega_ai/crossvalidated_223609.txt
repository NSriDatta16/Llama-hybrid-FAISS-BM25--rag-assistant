This is a topic of deep interest to me, but I have not achieved a strong enough grasp of statistics to explain its intuition mathematically. However, I can paraphrase a strategy for solving such problems. While we discuss this topic, my only request would be to treat it as a guide for how one might choose to solve the problem, rather than figuring if your solution was the most comprehensive one possible. Data science is infinitely complex. It is futile to assume we would have a clue what the actual distribution is. Sample size governs all. So if I'm faced with a business problem and the solution of which can gradually shift me towards a more optimal one then I have conceptually succeeded. Now, long story short. In your case if your data gave you each day a new experiment that could help you answer one question - What is the best way I can predict what will happen tomorrow? This is in the most generic sense the objective of any data science. So in effect, everything we ever will use statistics for is just this single truth. The moment a simple learning algorithm can somehow get better at just guessing on your behalf what happens tomorrow slightly better than you could with a calculator, you have shifted into an optimal mode of operation with autopilot. (This also has all sorts of oversight and operational issues of its own, but bear with me here.) If in each subsequent day we perform a gradual percentage on error lower we are better off. The longer we keep this journey, the more straight forward it is to see that eventually the models will evolve and possibly reduce the errors on most targets. Now imagine this ability on steroids: if rather than trying to figure out what will happen next day, we can make slightly easier guesses about what will happen in the next 10 seconds, or 1 second for instance. Suddenly you can think of a massive number of things that we can easily learn without being too strict about the methodology. If at the end of this path, for assume a week or two one of two things happen. Either you can see a clear evidence of change for better or you would find that the results aren't all the good. If it isn't good something is off. OR the system is inherently unpredictable in some way i.e. the stock market. Not "learnable".. yet, entirely. I have no clue however if this answer actually addresses your question, but I've personally been able to see some actual change and often it didn't require much more complicated models than logistic regression, cluster analysis, linear regression. And you have neural networks to throw at at the drop of a hat for any big data problem you can think of. Be it genetic research or space exploration. You obviously have way more exciting discoveries to make than you have time for knowing one more type of probability distribution, for most human beings at least. My two cents.
