Scrolling speed during UITableView re-ordering mode (not performance related)

Is there a way to increase the speed that you can drag a cell up/down during a table's movable row mode of a UITableView ? For instance, there seems to be a standard speed that the table will allow you to drag the cell when you are moving it around and the scroll speed seems to increase if you hold it near the top/bottom edge of the device screen. For a given cell height and a whole bunch of cells, this might take a while to re-order them all if I have to use their standard slow scrolling. So basically, I would like to increase the speed that it scrolls up/down when you are dragging the cell so it won't take as long to get to where you want to drop the cell in place. I understand that you can speed up the moving process by decreasing cell height to place more cells on the device screen, but I'd rather do this only if I can't increasing scrolling speed. Any suggestions or ideas from past experiences with this? Any advice is greatly appreciated!
