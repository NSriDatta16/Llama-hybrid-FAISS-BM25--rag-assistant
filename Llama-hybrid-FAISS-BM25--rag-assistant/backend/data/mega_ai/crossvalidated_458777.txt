How to construct features for LightGBM for discovering a property?

I'm using lightgbm on time series data to solve regression problem, I learned that I can construct new features, such as Shift and diff features for target, how does that actually help to make the model has a smaller Mean Square Error? I guess the model discovers properties in data such as cyclic property through these features, but I failed to give a clear explanation.
