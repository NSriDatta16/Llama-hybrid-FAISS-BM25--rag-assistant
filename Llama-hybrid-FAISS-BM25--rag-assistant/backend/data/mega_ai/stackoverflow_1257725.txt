visual studio 2008 won't let me drag certain controls

group box, flow layout panel, panel, split container,and tab control do not drag. I believe uninstalling resharper is when it started to happen. I've done a repair on visual studio. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Any idea where I would look or what is wrong? When I click on the drag icon. the mouse snaps left to the resize handle, and does not let me drag.
