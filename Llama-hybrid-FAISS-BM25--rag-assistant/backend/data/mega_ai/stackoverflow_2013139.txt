Replace symbol with tag using jquery

I have specification for products in text doc that I need to transfer into HTML. Might sound a bit strange but but what I'm trying to do is replace paragraph tags into two table columns, so this: Load (kg):5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 Excitation Voltage: 10vdc recommended, 20vdc maximum into this Load (kg) 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 Excitation Voltage 10vdc recommended, 20vdc maximum To replace paragraph tag I've used function bellow $("p").each(function () { $(this).replaceWith(" " + $(this).text() + ' '); }); So I have to hook up to ' : ' to close and close and open another table data (column) Any help much appreciated Thank you in advance Dom
