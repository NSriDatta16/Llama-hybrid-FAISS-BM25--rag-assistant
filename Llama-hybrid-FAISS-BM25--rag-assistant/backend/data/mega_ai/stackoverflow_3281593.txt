Also, be VERY wary of doing this in conjunction with version control systems. You have to know your version control system really well to know how it's going to react to such major refactoring. Other than that, what you are describing doing is not all that difficult. You do have to edit the solution files and maybe the project files by hand, and you might need to remove a project from a solution and add it again when it's under the right directory. I would make a backup, and then refactor away. I think it is a mistake to think that you can do everything you need from the IDE, though. And if you do what you describe from the IDE in a source control system that uses the old Visual SourceSafe API, you will certianly (guaranteed) mess up your bindings, that API is just not made for moving (or renaming, for that matter) files around in the way you describe. The best way to do this under that scenario is to remove all source control bindings and then re-add the reorganized solution back in. It's not that difficult, you just have to prepare (do a backup) and experiment until you get it right.
