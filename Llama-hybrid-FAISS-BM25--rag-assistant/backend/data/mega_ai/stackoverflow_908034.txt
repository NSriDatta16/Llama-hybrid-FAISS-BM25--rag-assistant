I stick to Dijkstra's teachings: goto is harmful . And continue/break are goto's little brothers. If the problem is that you're indenting the code too much, the solution is not putting a continue in the loop, but reducing the complexity by separating the code in different functions or thinking about a better way of organizing it. For example, @Kamarey snippet would be even clearer like this: loop { if (!(cond1 || cond2 || cond2 || ...)) { the loop actions; } } or @Ori Pessach example could be expressed like: bool foo(int arg) { if(arg) { /*do some work*/ } return arg != 0; } In brief, usually I can't find a good enough reason to use non structured programming constructs (maybe for some cleanup codes in a very limited ocasions...)
