Best practices for using RDLC in a distributed environment

My company has a Windows Forms application that leverages ClickOnce and .NET Remoting (soon to be WCF) to a back end IIS web application that handles all data access operations. For reporting, we currently use SSRS and have the distributed clients connect directly to the report server. We would like to potentially remove, or augment, our dependency on SSRS reports with the ability to support local reporting via RDLC files. One hurdle that I have to overcome is that it is unlikely that the individual client machines will have direct access to the database and therefore would require the report data to be fetched from the web application over our Remoting or WCF transport layer. "Discovering" the parameters of the report for purposes of dynamically building a UI of report parameter prompts I don't think is terribly difficult, but actually telling the back-end system what class/method to invoke in order to return the correct data for the report is less simple. Has anyone experimented with somehow embedding information into the RDLC file (either through a comment in the report or otherwise) that can be used as a "hint" to the server application layer for determining what method to execute? It's likely that the actual RDLC will be stored in the database versus being distributed with our application. Any insight or guidance would be appreciated. -MrB
