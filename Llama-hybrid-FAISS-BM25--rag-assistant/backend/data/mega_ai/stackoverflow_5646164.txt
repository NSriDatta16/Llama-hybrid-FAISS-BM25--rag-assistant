Edit: If you are referring to the highlighted rectangle, such as the one that appears as you drag your mouse over the desktop, then your approach would certainly be valid and feasible; I do not believe that are any features in Swing which provide an implementation of this feature. I don't know whether JDesktop supports this, but it may be worth a look. Edit 2: Also take a look at GlassPane . It would make it much more convenient to implement what you describe than doing everything on the same pane would. If I understand your question correctly, the effects which ensue when the button is being hovered over or pressed are controlled by the Look and Feel (L&F). You can select the Look and Feel you would like among those that are available on the host operating system by using the javax.swing.UIManager class. Writing your own Look and Feel is a nontrivial task and usually takes several weeks of time, even for a person who is experienced in using image-editing applications and knows how to program graphical user-interfaces. Here's an example (from this link ) which shows you how to change the L&F to Nimbus: try { for (LookAndFeelInfo info : UIManager.getInstalledLookAndFeels()) { if ("Nimbus".equals(info.getName())) { UIManager.setLookAndFeel(info.getClassName()); break; } } } catch (Exception e) { // If Nimbus is not available, you can set the GUI to another look and feel. } There are many others available, but it bears noting that many developers (and users) prefer to use the system's default look and feel rather than that which is default for Java Swing components.
