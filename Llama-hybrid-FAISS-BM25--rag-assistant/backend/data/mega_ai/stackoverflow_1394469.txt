Update: Just realized that I've misread your question as you are looking for methods defined via the Flex ExternalInterface class rather than those of the Shockwave ActiveX control itself; I'm gonna keep my original answer below as it might still be helpful regarding SWF usage via C# in general. Concerning ExternalInterface I don't have an answer right now, but you might look into Fun with C# and the Flash Player 8 External API to get an idea on how to use this API via C# in the first place. (Another helpful sample might be Use External Interface of Flash 8 in Python and C# Applications .) From what I'm reading in the former article there is likely no straight forward solution and the calling conventions via passing crafted XML fragments to CallFunction() are somewhat quirky, still you should be able to translate Georges solution to this in principle (as I said, it's likely not gonna be pretty ;) Good luck! How to access a SWF from .NET via COM Interoperability: SWF for Windows is implemented by means of the Adobe Flash Player ActiveX control , consequently you would use it from .NET via COM Interoperability . You can find a (legacy) article/sample regarding this on Adobes site, see Embedding Macromedia Flash Player in a C# Application to Display Stock Information for an overview (please note the introductory note of the article regarding unavailability of the sample code), but see below. More specifically you can find the initial steps you need to take to achieve your goal on another page of this article, see Embedding and Communicating with the Macromedia Flash Player in C# Windows Applications - in particular please follow the article/steps up to and including section Making the Macromedia Flash Player ActiveX Control Available Within Visual Studio .NET . Once you have completed the outlined steps to add the Shockwave ActiveX control to your toolbox and to a particular projects references you can simply double click this reference (named ShockwaveFlashObjects in Visual Studio 2008), which will open the Visual Studio object browser highlighting the assembly Interop.ShockwaveFlashObjects ; then navigate down into the namespace ShockwaveFlashObjects , where you'll find, amongst others, the interface IShockwaveFlash , exposing (depending on your view filter) all its members, including the desired external methods with their respective C# signatures .
