if you are ready to learn new stuff I would recommend using PHP/MYSQL with a file uploader like the one included in tinyMCE, the license cost about 60$ I think, once the video is uploaded you can work on it via the PHP plugin FFMPEG installed on many host. FFMPEG allow you to convert the video format and also to create thumbnail of the video automatically. You can view those site for reference / license http://tinymce.moxiecode.com If you prefer not to learn new language / use database server, you should go with the youtube embedding system which is quite simple. You can view help about the youtube embedding system by typing "youtube embed" on Google.
