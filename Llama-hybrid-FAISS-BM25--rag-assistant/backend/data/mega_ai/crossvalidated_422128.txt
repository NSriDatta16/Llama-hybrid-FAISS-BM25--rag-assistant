What you describe is a conditional GAN. Your condition (text input) provides some info to the generator of what to generate (i.e. image based on the given text). The discriminator frequently uses the condition (text input) as well. This became quite popular, since this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004 . They used the concatenation successfully and this resulted in using the concatenation in the discriminator, especially in tasks related to images. Since then, different ways of using this condition have been used, e.g. by inner product: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05637 . In short: Your schematic (probably) shows concatenating the text input in a later layer of the discriminator to facilitate its binary classification task (real/fake).
