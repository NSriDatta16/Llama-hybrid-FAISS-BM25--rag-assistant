ML models like XGBoost, Random Forest and etc are usually called black box models for the exact same reason you mentioned, that they don't give you an interpretable functional form like statistical models such as logistic regression. However, you can still extract variable importance out of them to get some insight on which of the predictors are more important. Alternatively, you can try partial dependence plots that are model agnostic and can explain how the dependent variable changes with the independent variables. But they are not perfect and they have their own pros and cons. For more information check out this link: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/partial_dependence.html#:~:text=Partial%20dependence%20plots%20(PDP)%20show,the%20'complement'%20features . Also, nothing stops you to create more complicated interpretable models yourself. For example, you don't have to use the vanilla logistic regression form for your problem. You can extend it by adding interactions, nonlinearity and etc to enhance its flexibility and also performance and keep the interpretability in place. For example, you can check my answer to another question for which I customize a logistic regression to be more flexible: Analyse categorial data where best outcome is middle level
