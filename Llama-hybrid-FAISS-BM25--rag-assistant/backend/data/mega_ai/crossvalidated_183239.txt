Here are some of my thoughts. It doesn't address every angle you could look at your question from, in fact, there is a lot it doesn't address (the question does feel a bit broad). Why is it hard for laypeople to understand the mathematical calculation of Variance? Variance is essentially how spread out things are. This is easy enough to understand, but the way it is calculated may seem counter-intuitive to a layperson. The issue is that the differences from the mean are squared (then averaged), and then square rooted to get the Standard Deviation. We understand why this method is necessary - the squaring is to make the values positive and then they are square-rooted to get the original units. However, a layperson is likely to be confused with why the numbers are squared and square-rooted. This looks like it cancels itself out (it doesn't) so seems pointless/strange. What is more intuitive to them is finding the spread by simply averaging the absolute differences between the mean and each point (called Mean absolute deviation). This method does not require squaring and square-rooting, so is far more intuitive. Note that just because Mean Absolute Deviation is more straightforward, does not mean it is 'better'. The debate of whether to use Squares or Absolute values has been going on for a century involving many prominent statisticians, so a random person like me can't just show up here and say one is better. (Averaging squares to find variance is of course more popular) In a nutshell: The Squaring to find variance seems less intuitive to laypeople who would find averaging the Absolute differences to be more straightforward. However, I don't think people have a problem with understanding the idea of spread itself
