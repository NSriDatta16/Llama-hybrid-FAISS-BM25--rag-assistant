I believe you're talking about the least square regression line. Basically, this is the line where the sum of the residuals of each data point to the line is minimised. A residual is the distance from the point to the LSR-line in an axis (i.e vertically or horizontally). Now, let's make up some data. Pretend you have 2 points on a straight line, 10 units apart, and you want to find a point where the sum of the distance from each is minimised. It doesn't matter where you place it in the middle; 8 units + 2 units = 5 units + 5 units = 10 units + 0 units, etc. The sum of the distances always equals zero. However, the least square regression line squares these residuals. As you may know, 10 2 + 0 2 is bigger than 8 2 + 2 2 , which is bigger than 6 2 + 4 2 , etc. The perfect minimised answer is 5 2 + 5 2 . Therefore, the point should be right in the middle, which is the mean. Extend this to a whole scattered data set, and the fact that you take the average of the y-axis and x-axis, and consider the fact that you take the residuals and not the distance, you can see why the line goes through the mean of x and y.
