There are several tools you can use to explore the presence of seasonality. As you did, you can start by looking at the sample autocorrelation (functions stats::acf and stats::pacf ). Significant autocorrelation at seasonal lags would suggest the presence of seasonality. The same would be suggested if significant peaks are observed in the periodogram at seasonal frequencies (function stats::spectrum ). You might as well test the significance of seasonal dummies as suggested by @RichardHardy. Other possible approach is to fit the basic structural time series model and check if the variance of the seasonal component is close to zero relatively to the other parameters (function stats::StructTS and package stsm ). You may also find some relevant test statistics in the documentation of function nsdiffs in package forecast . You must be aware of breaks that may undergo the series (some are graphically observed around year 2009). These effects may distort the interpretation of the results based on the above tools. To handle this issue you may include dummies for these effects or explore the series at different subsamples. For the series that you show, be aware that the data are annual rates that are obtained by taking seasonal differences in the raw data, this will remove most of the seasonality (if any) so I wouldn't expect a major seasonal pattern in this series. You may be interested in the monthly index of the harmonised consumer price index, the raw index and the seasonally adjusted series are available here .
