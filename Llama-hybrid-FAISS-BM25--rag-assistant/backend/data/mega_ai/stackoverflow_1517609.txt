You don't really need an IDE for Python; just a good text editor. An IDE you might like though is Editra . It is actually written in Python itself, so you can use it on Linux, Mac, and Windows! I used Editra as my Python IDE for about 6-10 months. It gives you all you need and nothing more: syntax highlighting, code folding, auto indenting, and optional plugins to integrate a Python shell right into the editing window. You'll definitely want auto indenting when you are coding in Python. As for designing GUIs visually, I suggest you check out Glade . It allows you to design GUIs easily with the GTK+ toolkit. (GTK+ GUIs work on Linux, Mac, and Windows!) It will take a bit more effort to integrate them into your Python programs than it does in Microsoft's Visual languages, but it isn't that bad once you learn it. The nice thing about using GTK+ and Glade is that you design your interface using containers, padding properties, and things like that. It is possible to design them dragging and dropping anywhere on the grid like in Visual Studio, but who wants to do that? Once you learn your way around containers and padding, you'll be very happy with them. It's much easier to make everything even, and to have similar widgets grouped together for hiding/disabling and things like that. Good luck in your Python journey! :)
