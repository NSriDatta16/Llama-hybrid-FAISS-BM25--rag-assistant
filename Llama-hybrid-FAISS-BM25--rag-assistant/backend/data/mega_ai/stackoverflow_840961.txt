By highlighting, I am assuming you mean to make the text bold. It's not as elegant as some of the other client side technologies, but you could handle the node being changed and make the selected node bold with something like treeNode.Font = new Font(treeNode.Font, treeNode.Font.Style | treeNode.Bold);
