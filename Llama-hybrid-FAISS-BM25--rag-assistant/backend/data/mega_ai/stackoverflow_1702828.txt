Perhaps you could setup your access database to compact and repair on close. To do so (depending on your version, perform the following): Open the Access database or Access project that you want Microsoft Access to compact automatically. On the Tools menu, click Options. Click the General tab. Select the Compact on Close check box. Access databases are designed to allow themselves to consistently increase in size. When you delete a record from the database, the space allotted for that record continues to be held in reserve by the database and it is not released for reuse. Likewise, extra space, created by modifying and shortening records, is not released for reuse. Compacting and repairing alleviates this. The compact and repair utility reduces the physical size of your database by making an exact duplicate of the database while also ridding the database of any excess space created by deleting and modifying data. The Compact Utility restructures table records and objects, and then stores them in successive memory blocks, eliminating wasted space. The utility also updates table statistics to reflect database characteristics of the restructured data. The more additions, deletions and modifications performed on databases, the more often they should be compacted If you never compact your access database, your database will retain the "wasted" space and continue to consume additional space to accommodate additional data. As an example, if you delete all of the records from a 1MB Microsoft Access database and then add 2MB of data, your database will be in excess of 3MB. The 1MB of space, which was allocated to the deleted records, is held by the database as wasted space, which only serves to corrupt your database and fragment your data.
