Calculate 3-year average on survey results

Statistics is not a normal part of my job. I've been given survey data from three years. Survey data includes a number of categories the respondents are split into. There is a set of five possible responses for each. Each year, the percentage of each response for each category is calculated. I need to provide a three year average for each response for each category. Which method do I use to calculate the three year average for each category? Add the raw totals from each year for each response and divide by the total respondents over the three years. Add the three single-year percents, then divide by 3 to get an average percent. I can provide example data if that would be helpful.
