Curve Sprite Movement COCOS2D

I'm trying with no luck to move a sprite position in an simetric curve way with the touch drag. So far I use the following code with no luck -(BOOL) ccTouchBegan:(UITouch*)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { lastTouchLocation = [MultiLayer locationFromTouch:touch]; return YES; } -(void) ccTouchMoved:(UITouch*)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint currentTouchLocation = [MultiLayer locationFromTouch:touch]; moveTo = ccpSub(lastTouchLocation, currentTouchLocation); lastTouchLocation = currentTouchLocation; } -(void) update:(ccTime)delta { CCSprite* sprite = [sprites objectAtIndex:1]; if (moveTo.x != 0){ float X = sprite.position.x + moveTo.x; float Y = sprite.position.y + (pow(X,2)); sprite.position = CGPointMake(X, Y); } } The curve way i'm trying to simulate is in the form y=x^2. Is this posible? Thanks in advance!
