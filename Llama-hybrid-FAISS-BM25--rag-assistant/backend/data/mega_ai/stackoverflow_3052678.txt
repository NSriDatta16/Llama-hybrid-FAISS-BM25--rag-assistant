Fancy dynamic list in Android: TableLayout vs ListView

There is a requirement to have not-so-trivial dynamic list, each record of which consists of several columns (texts, buttons). It should look something like: Text11 Text12 Button1 Button2 Text21 Text22 Button1 Button2 ... At first obvious way to accomplish that seemed to be TableLayout . I was expecting to have layout/styling data specified in res/layout/*.xml and to populate it with some dataset from java code (as with ListView , for which its possible to specify TextView of item in *.xml and bind it to some array using ArrayAdapter ). But after playing for a while, all I found to be possible is fully populating TableLayout programatically. Still, creating TableRow by TableRow and setting layout attributes directly in java code doesn't seem elegant enough. So the question is: am I at the right path? Is TableLayout really best View to accomplish that? Maybe it's more appropriate to extend ListView or something else to meet such requirements?
