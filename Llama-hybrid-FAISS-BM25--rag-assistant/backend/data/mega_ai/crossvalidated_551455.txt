If your sample is large, then you can use the usual formula for the CI of the mean because the sampling distribution will be normally distributed due to CLT. It's the sampling distribution that needs to be normally distributed, not the data, although that assumption is not extremely important anyway. If you are asking how to compute CI of the mean assuming a specific distribution of the data, then I do not know the answer, but you can always fit that distribution using Bayesian methods and get a credible interval from a posterior. I don't think it would make a difference in your situation.
