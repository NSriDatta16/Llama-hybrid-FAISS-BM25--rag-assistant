400 : Bad Request !

I am developing an application which uses an xmlrpc service to communicate. I developed the server-side with windows using WAMP and it works pretty well. However, I have decided to implement the server-side on Ubuntu. So I've started downloading and installing what's necessary (apt-get install lamp-server^) and everything which comes with. When I tried it, It didn't work and I got that error : 400 : Bad Request. At first, I thought I came from lamp-server and a bad configuration so I uninstalled it all and started again all components one by one but I still that error ! I'm using pear's xml_rpc package (http://pear.php.net/package/XML_RPC/redirected). And It seems it work, here's the page source which gives me this error : ---SENT--- POST server5.php HTTP/1.0 User-Agent: PEAR XML_RPC Host: localhost Content-Type: text/xml Content-Length: 309 storeData 03-10-2010-16.55.23 popop ---END--- ---RECEIVED--- HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request Date: Wed, 13 Apr 2011 14:31:33 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.16 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.3.3-1ubuntu9.3 with Suhosin-Patch Vary: Accept-Encoding Content-Length: 226 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN&quot;&gt; &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;400 Bad Request&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Bad Request&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; ---END--- Fault Code: 5 Fault Reason: Didn't receive 200 OK from remote server. (HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request) Do you have any idea what could raise that error ? any tips or clue ? Thanks in advance !
