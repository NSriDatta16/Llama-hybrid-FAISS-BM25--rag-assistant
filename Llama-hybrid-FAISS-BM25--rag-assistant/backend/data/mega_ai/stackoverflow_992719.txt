How do I turn off snaplines in Visual Studio 2008?

How do you turn off those blue guide lines when working on an ASP.NET form in VS 2008?. You used to be able to just drag absolute controls around. Now, I'm fighting with the designer which won't let me put things where I want to put them! Cheers, Rob.
