TransmitFile is the lightest-weight programmatic way to serve a file that I am aware of. However, you might not need to write your own HttpHandler. You can use the MVC handler and just dedicate a controller action to the job. Something like: http://storage.foo.com/Files/Download/SomeFileIdentifier ...routing to... public FilesController { public ActionResult Download(string id) { //...some logic to authenticate and to get the local file path return File(theLocalFilePath, mimeType); } } The File() method of controller uses TransmitFile in the background, I believe. (PS, If you want shorter URLs, do it via custom routes in global.asax.)
