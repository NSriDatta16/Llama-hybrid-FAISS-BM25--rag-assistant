The problem of addressing effect of all 9 questions on 10th can be easily addressed by any multiclass classification technique (logistic regression/SVM). One way of converting block data into scalar would be performing PCA on the block and selecting major principle component. In R, this could be done as: fit for each block. This could then be followed by standard classifier.
