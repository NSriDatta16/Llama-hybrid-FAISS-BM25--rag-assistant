I would go with the Lift framework written in Scala. You will see a great productivity boost just by switching to Scala . Scala is also very stable and it's extremely easy to call Java code from your Scala code. Not only that but it's quite similar to Java but with some added features. For some examples you should refer to 5 Things a Java developer needs to know about Scala. Twitter will move part of it's codebase to Scala. You will never "get stuck" on a piece of code because you can just think about how you would do it in Java and write similar code. First class functions and actors will give you an even greater productivity boost and are both in Scala. Scala is of course statically typed and has a performance that is similar to Java. I will quote the author of the Lift framework for an description of it: Lift borrows from the best of existing frameworks, providing Seaside's highly granular sessions and security Rails fast flash-to-bang Django's "more than just CRUD is included" Wicket's designer-friendly templating style (see Lift View First) And because Lift applications are written in Scala, an elegant new JVM language, you can still use your favorite Java libraries and deploy to your favorite Servlet Container. Use the code you've already written and deploy to the container you've already configured!
