David Bohm in his work Causality and Chance in Modern Physics (London: Routledge, 1957/1984) describes causality, chance, randomness, and independence: "In nature nothing remains constant. Everything is in a perpetual state of transformation, motion, and change. However, we discover that nothing simply surges up out of nothing without having antecedents that existed before. Likewise, nothing ever disappears without a trace, in the sense that it gives rise to absolutley nothing existing at later times. .... everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things. This principle is not yet a statement of the existence of causality in nature. To come to causality, the next step is then to note that as we study processes taking place under a wide range of conditions, we discover that inside all of the complexity of change and transformation there are relationships that remain effectively constant. .... At this point, however, we meet a new problem. For the necessity of a causal law is never absolute. Thus, we see that one must conceive of the law of nature as necessary only if one abstracts from contingencies , representing essentially independent factors which may exist outside the scope of things that can be treated by the laws under consideration, and which do not follow necessarily from anything that may be specified under the context of these laws. Such contingencies lead to chance ." (pp.1-2) "The tendency for contingencies lying outside a given context to fluctuate independently of happenings inside that context has demonstrated itself to be so widespread that one may enunciate it as a principle; namely, the principle of randomness. By randomness we mean just that this independence leads to fluctuation of these contingencies in a very complicated way over a wide range of possibliities, but in such a manner that statistical averages have a regular and approximately predictable behaviour." (p.22)
