HTML5 Drag and Drop API on Touch Screen Devices

I was just wondering if the HTML5 API for Drag and Drop included support for touch screen displays. I was thinking of iPhone, but I know this isn't supported yet. I was wondering if that is just catching up on the part of Apple, to support HTML5 drag and drop on Safari mobile, but I also was thinking maybe the HTML5 API wasn't powerful enough for this, but I highly doubt that. How about on a standard touch screen laptop tablet or the like, I don't have one so I can't test but I would imagine that support is included because, as far as I know, that table interface just replaces mouse control, so, as far as the browser is concerned, the end-user is really just using a mouse. Any thoughts?
