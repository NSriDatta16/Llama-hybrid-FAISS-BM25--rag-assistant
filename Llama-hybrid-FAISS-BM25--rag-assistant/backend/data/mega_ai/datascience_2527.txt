Using Clustering in text processing

Hi this is my first question in the Data Science stack. I want to create an algorithm for text classification. Suppose i have a large set of text and articles. Lets say around 5000 plain texts. I first use a simple function to determine the frequency of all the four and above character words. I then use this as the feature of each training sample. Now i want my algorithm to be able to cluster the training sets to according to their features, which here is the frequency of each word in the article. (Note that in this example, each article would have its own unique feature since each article has a different feature, for example an article has 10 "water and 23 "pure" and another has 8 "politics" and 14 "leverage"). Can you suggest the best possible clustering algorithm for this example?
