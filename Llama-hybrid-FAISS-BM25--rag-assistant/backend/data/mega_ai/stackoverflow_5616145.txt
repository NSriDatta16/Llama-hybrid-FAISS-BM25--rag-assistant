You need to link the .lib's included with Berkley DB. There is probably a C:\Program Files\Oracle\Berkeley DB 11gR2 5.1.25\lib folder. You will need to add this folder, or possibly an appropriate sub folder. For example, there might be a Windows folder with x86 and x64 sub folders. You will need to add the appropriate sub folder to your 'Library Directories', which is just below the Include Directories options. You will then have to specify to the linker which .lib's to include. You should check the software's documentation to see which one is needed. There are two ways to add library dependencies in VS2010. The first way is to add the following line of code in an appropriate place inside of your project (in your snippet, it would belong at the very top of your only source file). #pragma comment(lib, "filename.lib") Note that your file name needs to be wrapped in "s, and that the line should not be followed by a ;. The other way is to add the name in the Project Property settings. If you go to Project Settings->Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies. You should see the default .libs that you need to build console applications such as kernel32.lib, user32.lib, etc. Simply add the file the same way you did the additional include folder.
