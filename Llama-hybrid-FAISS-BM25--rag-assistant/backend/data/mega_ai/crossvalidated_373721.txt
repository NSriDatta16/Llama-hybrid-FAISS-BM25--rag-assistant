Descriptive statistics such as mean, sdev, skewness, and kurtosis are not as useful for prices as they are for returns. The reason is that the price data generating process is not stable; instead, the price distribution varies from day to day. Hence, a "global" measure does not necessarily refer to anything useful about "the distribution" of prices. For example, if the price is trending upward, then the average price will seriously underestimate the means of the future price distributions. Return distributions are not perfectly stable, but they are much more stable than prices, so their descriptive statistics are more relevant for future predictions. On a related note, a gross mis-use of statistics is to perform any standard statistical method (t-interval etc) on prices, because the fundamental assumption that the observations are independent and identically distributed is grossly violated for prices. Generally, prices are highly autocorrelated (nearly random walk in many cases, where the autocorrelation is ~1.0). On the other hand, autocorrelations in returns are usually small (~0.0); and if not, there is a violation of market efficiency.
