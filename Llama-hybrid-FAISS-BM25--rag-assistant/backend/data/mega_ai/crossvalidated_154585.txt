Meaning of negative elements in Principal Component Analysis(PCA) rotated component matrix

Suppose that we have this rotated component matrix from PCA (SPSS output): Rotated Component Matrix Component 1 2 VAR00001 .944 -.008 VAR00002 -.018 .978 VAR00003 .918 -.064 VAR00004 .835 -.169 VAR00005 .608 .189 *Extraction Method: Principal Component Analysis. *Rotation Method: Varimax with Kaiser Normalization. *Rotation converged in 3 iterations. What is meaning of negative values in this matrix? for example -.018 in component 1 and -.008 in component 2? The effect of VAR00001 is negative on component 1?
