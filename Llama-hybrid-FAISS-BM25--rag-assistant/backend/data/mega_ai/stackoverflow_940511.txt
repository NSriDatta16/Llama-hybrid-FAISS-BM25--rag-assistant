I think a certain amount of cruft is to be expected as a code base evolves. Even when you try to be systematic about deleting away old unused code it is hard to remove it all. It's always satisfying to find unused code in my system that I can delete. Strong typing is your friend here, since it allows you to track types and usages in a much better fashion than weak typing. So stay away from those string data types, they make cleaning up harder. A really neat trick is if you can replay 24 hours worth of traffic from your production systems over a test system with a code coverage tool running at the same time. That's usually a gold-mine of dead code, but it can be hard to find the time to deal with such large amounts of cleanup among other priorities ;)
