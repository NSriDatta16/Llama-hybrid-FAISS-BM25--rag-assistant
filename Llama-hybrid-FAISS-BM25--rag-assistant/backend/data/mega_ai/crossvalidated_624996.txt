If by "modelling" you mean regression, then collinearity can be a problem if it is extreme, but correlation is not the same as collinearity and a moderate degree of collinearity is not a problem (and occurs in a LOT of regressions). We have to use the PCA such that each PC is orthogonal to one meaning every PC is independent of one another. No. If you do have problematic collinearity the PCA is one solution, but it's not the only one. For example, you can use ridge regression (which is quite different and keeps the original variables) or you can use partial least squares (which is similar to PCA but includes relations with the dependent variable). You have to determine by looking at the scree plot to see how many PC you should be using Again, no. The scree plot is ONE way of choosing a number of PCs, but it is quite subjective. I would rather first figure out what each PC means and then decide which ones to include. Including all four is not unreasonable in many cases -- that 4th one may be important to your research question. But, why is the variance for PC1 greater than PC2? Is there any good explanation? The first PC is always biggest, because it is the PC that extracts the maximum amount of variance. Each subsequent PC will always be smaller. But the pattern of how fast they decline varies a lot from one PCA to another.
