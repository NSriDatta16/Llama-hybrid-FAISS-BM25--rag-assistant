What is the difference between period cycle and seasonality?

From what I read here https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/47 , there is no seasonality as the data are annual data. "Is there seasonality, meaning that there is a regularly repeating pattern of highs and lows related to calendar time such as seasons, quarters, months, days of the week, and so on." But for example if I have a time series for rain with data in years, and the data show a pattern that is repeated in the same months during the year, this is not seasonal because the period is in years? How do you know if it's seasonality or period cycle? Look the example below Look what they said for the housing sales series "The monthly housing sales (top left) show strong seasonality within each year, as well as some strong cyclic behaviour with period about 6â€“10 years. There is no apparent trend in the data over this period." But how they know it is seasonality? I can see nothing.
