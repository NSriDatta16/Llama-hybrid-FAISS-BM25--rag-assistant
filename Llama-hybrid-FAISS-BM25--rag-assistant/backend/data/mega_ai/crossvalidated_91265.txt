You are looking for time series forecasting . I recommend this free textbook . Histories of 15 yearly data points are not uncommon in time series forecasting. For instance, the very first one of the series used in the classical M3 competition has only 14 data points. Let's use R and look at this dataset. library(Mcomp) M3[[1]] M3[[1]]$x We can fit an Exponential Smoothing model using ets() (for "Error, Trend, Seasonality"), which attempts to automatically choose the correct model in terms of trend, seasonality and error - seasonality is irrelevant for yearly data. Let's forecast using this model. forecast() will give us a point forecast as well as (by default) 80% and 95% prediction intervals. We can also plot the original series, the point forecasts and the prediction intervals. ets.model Similarly, auto.arima() will try to fit the best ARIMA model: arima.model The textbook I linked to above will bring you up to speed on both Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA, as well as other aspects of forecasting, like model selection and accuracy measurement. As I noted in my comment above, I don't know a "Grey model", and after a couple of years in this field, I would rather suggest using standard methods like Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA than an unknown method - after all, there are reasons why these methods have evolved to be the mainstay in time series forecasting. Happy forecasting!
