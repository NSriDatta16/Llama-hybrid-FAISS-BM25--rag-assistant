Why does the normal distribution show up everywhere?

I know that the common explanation for this is the Central Limit Theorem being applicable to most probability distributions. However, I can't seem to apply the Central Limit Theorem to simple examples like: if I were to sample the height of everyone in the world and plotted them on a histogram, it would look close to a normal distribution. But the Central Limit Theorem tells us that $\sqrt{n}(\overline{X_n} - \mu) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ . How does the average $\overline{X_n}$ of iid random variables $X_1, \dots, X_i$ have anything to do with height? Or weight? There are more examples but you get my point...
