You need to set up port forwarding (on port 80) on your router to forward from its external IP to your laptop's internal IP (192.168.0.7). Then, when you connect from an external network you need to use your router's external IP. This can be obtained (when you're on the internal network) from whatismyip.com , or you can set up a hostname which resolves to the external IP via dyndns.com using their agent. However I'd also recommend setting up either an actual static IP on your laptop or a DHCP reservation so that its internal IP is always the same.
