As you discuss, the definition of regression is predicting a continuous variable. Logistic regression is a binary classifier. Logistic regression is the application of a logit function on the output of a usual regression approach. Logit function turns $(-\infty, +\infty)$ to $[0,1]$ . I think it is just for historical reasons that it keeps that name. Saying something like "I did some regression to classify images. In particular I used logistic regression." is wrong.
