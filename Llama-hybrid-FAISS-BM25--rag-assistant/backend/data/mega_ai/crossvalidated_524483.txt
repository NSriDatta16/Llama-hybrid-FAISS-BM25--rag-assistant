Yes, plotting the Pearson residuals vs fitted is one way to check for deviations from the assumed variance-mean relationship; the point cloud should be roughly equal in width (i.e. no "fanning" in either direction). However, this can be hard to judge if the sample is unbalanced (i.e. lots more points for some ranges of fitted values), because our eyes tend to read the total amplitude of the point cloud (which will be bigger if there are more samples, even if the variance is unchanged). Your $\mu_i$ vs $r_i^2$ plot doesn't suffer as much from this problem. However, the standard solution is the scale-location plot, which typically shows $\sqrt{|r'_i|}$ , where $r'$ denotes the standardized Pearson residuals (i.e. $(y_i-\mu_i)/\sqrt{\phi V(\mu_i) (1-h_i)}$ , where $V()$ is the variance function, $\phi$ is the estimated dispersion, and $h$ are the "hat values". If you have a fitted glm() model m , this is what plot(m, which=3) shows you (it's the third panel in the default 4-panel plot produced by plot(m) ). (You can retrieve the standardized residuals for your model with rstandard(m) .) This has some advantages: (1) standardizing takes care of the increased variance expected in values with greater leverage/farther from the center of the data; (2) according to ?plot.lm , plotting the square-root of the absolute values of the residuals reduces skew in the results (I'm not actually sure why that's important). The plot method also adds a smoothed line, which can help you assess the overall trend. (3) It is arguably easier to detect deviations from a constant/flat line than from linearity (e.g. see here for "worm plots", or detrended quantile-quantile plots, as an alternative to the standard Q-Q plot). Below I show an example using the famous data set on deaths per year from horse kicks in the Prussian army . I use broom::augment() + ggplot2 , which may be overkill for your case (it does allow a little more flexibility, in this case with showing replicated points) to generate the scale-location plot. The scale-location plot only diagnoses a difference in the overall mean-variance relationship from linearity, not whether there is "too much" variance overall (e.g. $V= \phi\mu$ with $\phi>1$ ); don't forget to check for such overdispersion ...
