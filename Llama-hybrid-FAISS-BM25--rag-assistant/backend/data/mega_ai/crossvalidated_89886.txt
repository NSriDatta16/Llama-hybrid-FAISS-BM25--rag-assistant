Error trying to reduce my data dimentions

I'm trying to produce a linear regression model, but I only have 25 observations and 34 predictors. I'm trying feature selection, library(MASS) full.m but I get this error, Error in step(full.m, direction = "both") : AIC is -infinity for this model, so 'step' cannot proceed Well, then I tried PCA and factor analysis but I get this weird image from PCA. r In factor analysis, f I get, Error in solve.default(cv) : system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 1.09137e-18 Any help please? EDIT: I can answer this.
