Be aware, that its not sure that this will improve the overall performance of your application. The windows standard heap (also the Low fragmentation heap) is not laid out for frequently transmitting allocation information from one thread to another. This will work, but it might produce quite an overhead of processing. The documentation of the hoard memory allocator might be a starting point do get deeper into that: http://www.cs.umass.edu/~emery/hoard/hoard-documentation.html Your approach will though improve responsiveness etc.
