You need to quadruple the backslashes, because the the string literal is first interpreted by the JS parser, and then the result is again parsed due to the eval call. Or, preferably, try to avoid using eval. It is almost never necessary and it adds complication and slows down execution. This example would work as just: document.getElementById('mainTabs').innerHTML='\\C\ganye\file.doc';
