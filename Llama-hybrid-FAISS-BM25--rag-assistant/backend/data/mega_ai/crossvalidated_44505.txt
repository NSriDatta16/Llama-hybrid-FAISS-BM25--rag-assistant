How to elegantly determine the area of a hysteresis loop (inside/outside problem)?

I have measured two parameters (Dissolved organic carbon DOC = y, and discharge = x). When these two variables are plotted against each other, we get a hysteresis loop (see code example and picture). Now, for further analysis, I would like to determine the area of this hysteretic loop. I figured out that this can be done using the Monte Carlo darting method. This method says that the area of an unknown area is proportional to the area of a known rectangular times the hits in the inside field (the loop). My problem now is, how to solve the inside / outside problem using R. How can I draw a rectangular with a known area and how can I excel the random hits inside and outside the hysteretic loop? Please note, that I am open to any other method... I googled, and searched various statistical sites but could not find an answer. Any direct help or linkage to other websites/posts is greatly appreciated. Data
