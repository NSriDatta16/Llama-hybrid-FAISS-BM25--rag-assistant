Get two target possibilities by random forest or svm

I have a dataset with sequence tuples and targets like the following: input_0 input_1 input_2 output 0 0 1.0 2.0 4.0 1 1 2.0 4.0 2.0 2 2 4.0 2.0 4.0 3 4 2.0 4.0 7.0 4 2 4.0 7.0 8.0 I have trained algorithms using the output as a target value. What I want though, is to get the two most possible variables that can occur by one tupple. For example if i have two tuples for training: a,b,c,d and a,b,c,e I want to get d and e as a result with the respective percentage. Is there something like that possible?
