Regular expression matching, Parsing, Flow control in a complex system. Regular expressions are a simple form of state machine, specifically finite automata. They have a natural represenation as such, although it is possible to implement them using mutually recursive functions. State machines when implemented well, will be very efficient. There is an excellent state machine compiler for a number of target languages, if you want to make a readable state machine. http://research.cs.queensu.ca/~thurston/ragel/ It also allows you to avoid the dreaded 'goto'.
