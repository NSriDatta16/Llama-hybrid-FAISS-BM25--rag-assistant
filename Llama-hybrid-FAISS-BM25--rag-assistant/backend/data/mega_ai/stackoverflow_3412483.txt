google map v3 dragging marker issue

I am using Google map api V3, and in my application i m making gradable marker. Every thing is working fine except the marker icon while dragging. What happens in Google Map V2 was it changes marker icon automatically when it was being dragged but in Google Map V3 when dragging the marker its icon doesn't change like it used to change in V2.
