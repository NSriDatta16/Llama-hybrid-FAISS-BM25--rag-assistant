Call Javascript function from a URL

Is it possible to call a javascript function from the URL? I am basically trying to leverage JS methods in a page I don't have access to the source. Something like: http://www.example.com/mypage.aspx?javascript:printHelloWorld() I suspect the answer to this is no but, just wondered if there was a way to do it.
