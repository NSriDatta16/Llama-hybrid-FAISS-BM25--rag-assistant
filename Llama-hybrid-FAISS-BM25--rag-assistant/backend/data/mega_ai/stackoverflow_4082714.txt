Google Search with Python

From this question I've learned how to google-search using Python 3. But in the example given there you can retrieve only the first 4 results. I need to retrieve information about the first 25 results (at least). For each result I want to be able to get its: title url visible url (the visible url of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval is http://en.wikipedia.org/ ) site description How can I do it? EDIT: I'm using Python 3.1
