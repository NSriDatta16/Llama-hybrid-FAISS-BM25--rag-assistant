Posterior Distribution for parameter with beta distribution given binomial data

I am currently working on a problem but I'm having issues due to not having much experience with Bayesian statistics at the moment I have a sequence of observations $X_1, X_2, \dots X_N$ the are distributed Binomially iid with parameter $\theta$. $\theta$ is distributed by a beta distribution with parameters $a,b$. I'm asked to find the likelihood function $L(\vec{x};\theta)$ and the posterior distribution for $\theta$ given my $N$ observations. Here is my work \begin{align*} L( \vec{x} ; \theta) &= Pr(\vec{x}; \theta) \\ &= \prod_{i=1}^N \theta^{x_i}(1-\theta)^{1-x_i} \\ &= \theta^{\Sigma x_i} (1-\theta)^{N - \Sigma x_i} \end{align*} This one I think is correct Now for the posterior distribution of $\theta$ I am having some issues: \begin{align*} Pr(\theta \vert \vec{x}) &= \frac{Pr(\vec{x} \mid \theta) Pr(\theta)}{Pr(\vec{x})} \\ &= \frac { \theta^{\Sigma x_i} (1-\theta)^{N - \Sigma x_i} \cdot Beta(a,b) } { \sum_{i=1}^N \theta_i^{\Sigma x_i} (1-\theta_i)^{N - \Sigma x_i} \cdot Beta(a,b) } \end{align*} Mainly with the denominator, $Pr(\vec{x})$. Is it true that I have to calculate the total probability for all possible values of each $\theta_i$ to get $Pr(\vec{x})$ since the observations depend on $\theta?$ The question says that I must express the posterior distribution in terms of $a,b,$ and the data, but Im not sure how to get rid of the $\theta$.
