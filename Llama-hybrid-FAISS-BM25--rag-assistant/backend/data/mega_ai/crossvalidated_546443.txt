It helps to start by putting this in the context of using each biomarker individually to distinguish groups A and B. That could be done by using the continuous values of each biomarker to construct a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for distinguishing the 2 groups. The area under that curve (AUC) is a measure of the ability of that biomarker to distinguish the groups. It's also the concordance, the fraction of comparable pairs with one member from each of group A and B for which the direction of the difference in the biomarker value agrees with group membership. The Mann-Whitney test isn't a test on medians unless you know that the distributions of values between the two groups only differ in position, not in shape. But the Mann-Whitney U statistic is directly related to the AUC and thus to the general measure of concordance. So one approach would be to gauge whether your individual biomarkers differ significantly in concordance with the A versus B groups. That comparison would probably best be done by bootstrapping your data rather than relying on asymptotic normality of the Mann-Whitney statistic. A potentially more informative approach, if the numbers in each group aren't too small, would be to model the A/B binary distinction as a logistic regression, starting with all 3 continuous biomarker values in a single model as predictors modeled as flexibly as possible, e.g. with splines. That would tell you whether you might be better off using all 3 biomarkers rather than restricting yourself to 1. You could test the contributions of the individual biomarkers by comparing that full model against models that include subsets of the biomarkers.
