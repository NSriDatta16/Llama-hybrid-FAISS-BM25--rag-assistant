What statistics can be used for correlating gene expression on a specific organ with its function

My hypothesis is that a gene whose function is related to an organ will have higher gene expression in that organ compared to other organs. An example of my hypothesis: From a published literature, it is evident that gene x is function in liver lipid metabolism. So, as per my hypothesis, the expression of gene x would be higher in liver compared to other tissues or organs as, genes Kidney Brain Heart Liver Pancreas Cornea gene a 3.09 3.27 4.29 3.4 4.97 3.91 gene x 4.38 4.49 3.4 12.84 4.87 6.21 gene k 4.77 4.34 3.68 4.64 4.90 5.95 gene m 6.27 5.82 4.84 7.41 6.57 6.13 . . gene 20000 5.21 3.70 8.21 8.01 7.11 4.87 I have checked a few genes with reported organ related function and its level of gene expression in all organs. Most of the gene expression pattern justified my hypothesis. What I have is 1) Normalized gene expression micro-array data for 20000 genes from 15 different organs as similar to the example above 2) A set of 35 genes for which function is identified in specific organs (based on literature published data). I would like to know how can I apply statistics to test my hypothesis?
