What you describe resembles the sum of absolute deviations ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Average_absolute_deviation ), except that you propose to add up absolute differences between pairs of points, while deviations are defined as differences from the mean. Both work, the main difference being perhaps that your proposition would produce more "dramatic" results, as each deviation from a balanced proportion is added up multiple times through the multiple pairwise differences.
