I would think that the threshold would depend upon the average darkness (or distribution of colors) upon each image independently. If you go with an arbitrary value, then you'll end up losing a lot of data if the image started out pretty washed out. Also, you can emulate some of the grayscales by sparsely populating an area with black and white. 50% gray is an every-other checkerboard, 75% you color in half the remaining white squares, 25% you invert black and white, etc. I don't think there's a fixed answer for this question without considering each image individually.
