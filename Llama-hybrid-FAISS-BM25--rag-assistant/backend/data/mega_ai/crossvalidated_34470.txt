This is because in the background, a number like 5 can actually be 4.67, 5.00, or 5.33. However, since you have suppressed decimal place to 0, the output table will appear to have 3 rows of 5s. Suppressing the decimal place at the variable tab is only decorative, in order to truly get rid of all decimal places, you'll need to work on it at the compute stage. This is your original score: compute myout1 = mean(v1,v2,v3) . execute. If you'd like to truncate: compute myout2 = trunc(mean(v1,v2,v3)) . execute. If you'd like to round up: compute myout3 = rnd(mean(v1,v2,v3),1) . execute. If you run a frequency on myout2 and myout3 , the multiple lines should be gone. On a side note , averaging items and then using their mean as a variable can sometimes be too rough because the underlying assumption of the three items carrying equal weights is often challenged. If you have a large enough sample size, consider modeling them differently, such as putting them into the model independently.
