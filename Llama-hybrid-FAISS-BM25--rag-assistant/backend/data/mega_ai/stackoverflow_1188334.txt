After talking with some people in IRC I've found an answer. You need to hold on to the reference to the original ICriteria. It should have been obvious. ICriteria query = Session.CreateCriteria (); query.Add (x => x.FldUrlSafeName == teamName); query.CreateCriteria (x => x.TblSportsType) .Add (x => x.FldUrlSafeName == sportsType); query.CreateCriteria (x => x.TblSportsOrganization) .Add (x => x.FldUrlSafeName == sportsOrganization); return query.UniqueResult ();
