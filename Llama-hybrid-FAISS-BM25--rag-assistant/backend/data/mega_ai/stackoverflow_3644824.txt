Remove highlight on jQuery slider control

Does anyone know how to remove the bluish highlight which appears when dragging the jQuery slider control in webkit browsers? It appears to be a dotted highlight box in FireFox, and I'm not sure about IE, but you can view it here: http://www.marioplanet.com/index.asp It's on the top of the left column, and it appears after dragging it around.
