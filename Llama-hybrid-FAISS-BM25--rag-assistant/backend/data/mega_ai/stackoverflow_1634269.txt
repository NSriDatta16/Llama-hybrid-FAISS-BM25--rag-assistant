XSLT to transform list into table with columns determined dynamically

I need this XML, martin donald whistler mother carl liz cosmo to look like this: martin donald whistler mother carl liz cosmo When columns="4" , it should look like this: martin donald whistler mother carl liz cosmo Any hints on what the XSLT file should look like? Near as I can tell, it requires some kind of loop (recursion?), but I'm not sure if there's a more elegant way.
