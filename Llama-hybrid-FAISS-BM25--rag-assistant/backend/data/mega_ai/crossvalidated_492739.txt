Parameter estimation with differential equation?

I have an unknown function in an ODE as follows: dx/dt=Q(t)-a*x(t), a is a function of time and unknown. I plan to consider a as an unknown values at different time points. Then I use MCMC to estimate the unknown parameters by having measurements, x(t). My question is if there is any advantage in using smoothing spline compared to interpolation? or Gaussian process? Which one do you recommend?
