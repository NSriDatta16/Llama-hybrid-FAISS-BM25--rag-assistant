How you can read here Authorization Manager in does not support concurrency when policy is stored in XML . Authorization Manager does leverage Active Directory for support for concurrency. Active Directory and ADAM have a non-transactional model that supports concurrent additions and subtraction of multi-valued or linked object attributes. In Active Directory and ADAM, changes to object attributes are atomic (at the attribute level) so you never have an attribute that is a mesh of two changes. Active Directory uses a "last writer wins" mechanism to determine which write request will persist. Attributes are never merged; one write request (the last write received) will always win. For AD linked attributes (such as Authorization Manager role and group memberships, or links between operations, tasks, and role definitions) changes are additive; so concurrently adding or subtracting users or linking and unlinking operations, tasks, and roles is supported. However, the Authorization Manager MMC snap-in UI maintains a client-side cache that is not updated when the store is changed from some other UI or application; therefore, applications that require multiple concurrent administrators require a custom UI. I personally prefer to use SQL Server as the Authorization Manager Policy Store. If you create a new SQL-based policy store and look inside of the corresponding database, you will see RowUpdateTimeStamp columns of the type timestamp in almost all of the tables. More then that, many tables have additional ChildUpdateTimeStamp column of binary(8) type and XX_UpdateParentTimeStampOnXXX triggers. All this show that at least SQL-based Authorization Manager Policy Store is designed to support concurrency . The problem is only that this part is not really documented and which errors/exceptions exactly one will receive is not clear. One more remark. If you not yet use IAzAuthorizationStore::UpdateCache you can consider to use it before to made changes in the AzMan Store.
