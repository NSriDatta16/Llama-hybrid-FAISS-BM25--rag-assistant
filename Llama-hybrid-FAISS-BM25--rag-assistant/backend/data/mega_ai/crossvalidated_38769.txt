This is usually called the leverage problem; it is easiest to understand in the language of optimization in which regression is done. Basically, we want to have such a line that sum of squared residuals (distances on y between points and regression line) is minimal; because of that a single point with extreme coordinates may have a dominant contribution to this sum. Here is an example of such a situation. Green line seems more correct, but its cost is huge because of the outlier's residual (black) -- because of that the red line is generated. In your case, the line is simply made between those two outliers effectively ignoring or treating the rest of points as one.
