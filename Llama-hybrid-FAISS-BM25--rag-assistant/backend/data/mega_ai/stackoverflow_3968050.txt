I'll add to what others have said since they're correct and meaningful. More than just the code, you'll need to bring over your unit tests. This doesn't sound hard until you start changing mutability and threading constructs while still attempting to have everything work the same way as it did before. During the transition it's very important to keep all the edge cases in mind while discovering additional edge cases you may introduce during the migration. If you bring your unit tests into a good Scala testing framework like ScalaTest with a direct translation you may find that what you are testing is not what you were testing before. While making your migration it's important that you keep the intent of the code together with the tests instead of allowing fragmentation of thought.
