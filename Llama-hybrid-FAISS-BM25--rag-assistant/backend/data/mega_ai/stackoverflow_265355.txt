I've worked on teams doing 1, 2 and 4 week sprints. It really is dependent on your organization. I prefer 1 or 2 week sprints. The current team I'm running is at 4 week sprints because we are coordinating efforts of 12 different products. I'm looking to move them to 2 week iterations soon. The key thing to defining length is getting to "done, done". For some teams, this means in production. For others, it may mean verified by the business to meet their needs using an internal release. I'd start by defining done, done, then looking at how to structure your sprints around that. Ideally all stories are getting to done at the end of the sprint - and you aren't just doing Scrummerfall.
