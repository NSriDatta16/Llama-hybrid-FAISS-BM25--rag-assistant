Movable widgets over video in website

I am still very much in the planning phase on this but here is the basic idea of what I want to do. I also have not done much/any web development in the past few years so I am a little out of the loop on what will/wont work. I want to have a video playing essentially on a background layer with various widgets on top of it. The widgets will all be fairly simple HTML based text and maybe a few images. The widget also need to be movable (eg. I need to be able to drag and drop the widgets to move them). Finally I would really like it to work on a tablet (iPad or Android). Am I going to need to use flash or silverlight for something like this? I would rather not because I know that makes it hard to get tablets working. I know HTML5 is supposed to be the new hotness but I don't really have a good idea of its capabilities.
