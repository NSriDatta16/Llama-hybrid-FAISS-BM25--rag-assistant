Validate implementation of back-propagation algorithm

Let's say I implemented a CNN. Is there an easy way I can validate, that my implementation of back-propagation does not contain errors ? May be I can feed some dummy values into my network so it can do forward and backward pass, so I at the end I can compare the result with some pre-calculated target values ? Or may be there is a way to validate the logic of my layers on layer-by-layer basis ? Is there a general solution for that ?
