What is the difference between an RMSE and RMSLE (logarithmic error)?

RMSE vs RMSLE Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) both are the techniques to find out the difference between the values predicted by the machine learning model and the actual values. But, what is the purpose for RMSLE( "logarithmic") Does a high RMSE imply low RMSLE? Can somebody explain in-detailed differences between RMSE and RMSLE? And how the metric works under the hood? When would one use RMSE over RMSLE? What are the advantages/disadvantages of using RMSE over RMSLE?
