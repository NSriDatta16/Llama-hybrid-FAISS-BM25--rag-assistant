"I though their ought to be something in the lines of a wizard letting you drag fields from your tables to a form and generates the logic behind..." - this is the basic idea behind ASP.NET WebForms. But, please do not abandon MVC in favour of WebForms. One way to achieve what you want is to create a class representing your stats, e.g. public class Statistic { public string TableName { get; set; } public int RowCount { get; set; } } Your Model code could populate an IList instance which is passed to your View, which renders the stats accordingly.
