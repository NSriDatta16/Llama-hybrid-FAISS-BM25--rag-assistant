php echo vs open&close tag

Just to clarify: The issues "echo vs print" and "double quotes vs single quotes" are perfectly understood, this is about another thing: Are there any reasons why one would prefer: echo ' '; foreach($lotsofrows as $row) { echo ' ',$row['id'],' '; } echo ' '; over: would either one execute/parse faster? is more elegant? (etc.) I tend to use the second option, but I'm worried I might be overlooking something obvious/essential.
