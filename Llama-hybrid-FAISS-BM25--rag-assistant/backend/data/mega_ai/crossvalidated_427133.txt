Test significance of weighted average of multiple regression coefficients from different models

I have 3000 independent time series samples (customers) where I fit a dynamic regression model with ARIMA errors to each sample and estimate regression coefficient of interest (intervention), $B_1{_i}$ from the following model $Y{_i} = B_0{_i} + X_1{_i}B_1{_i} + .... + e{_i}$ where $Y_i$ is sales per customer $i$ . I used ARIMA to take into account any seasonality and trend and am okay with ARIMA terms capturing other unexplained variance. I end up with 2 vectors of size 3000; one for the $B_1{_i}$ and another for their standard errors, $SE_1{_i}$ . Some coefficients are significant and others are not. An overall estimate of $B_1$ is needed so I use a weighted average (a weight has been derived based on prior year sales proportion out of the total) to calculate the overall estimate and use wtd.t.test from the weights package in R to test for the significance of the overall estimate. My questions are Is it valid to test the significance of the overall estimate using a weighted one-sample t-test? Or do I need to combine the standard error estimates, $SE_1{_i}$ from all the models and calculate an overall standard error? And how would i calculate the overall standard error integrating the weights?
