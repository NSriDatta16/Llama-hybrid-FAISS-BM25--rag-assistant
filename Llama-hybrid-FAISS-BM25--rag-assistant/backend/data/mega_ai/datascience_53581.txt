ML is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that creates systems to learn and predict outcomes without manually programming a computer and is also known as predictive analytics or statistical learning . It is a set of algorithms and techniques focused to learn from data. This algorithms can be implemented by: Python: The scikit-learn (additional packages of SciPy) exposes a concise and consistent interface to the common machine learning algorithms. In case of Deep Learning , one of the most prominent and convenient libraries for Python in this field is Keras , which can function either on top of TensorFlow or Theano MATLAB especially using Deep Learning Toolbox JAVA or C++ The Data could be an organized collection of measures and/or classes; and learning means the ability to get information from data that would generalize to other sets of data. This last is what differences ML techniques from other statistical tools. They focus on the generalization aspect of the data analysis and not only in creating a model that works with the data at hand. A ML model is general, it is valid for new data points the model has never been exposed to. Beside of that , there are another libraries and packages which pave the way to load, access, modify data, even plot them!
