javascript date formatting with timezones

I'm receiving a date from a data source which is returned to javascript code. 2011-01-03T05:53:00Z What is the best way to format this date? The TZ doesn't need to be offset as the users will all be in the same zone, I need a method to simply format it. 03/01/2011 05:53:00 I have already done this in a couple of lines with replace() but is there a more elegant solution?
