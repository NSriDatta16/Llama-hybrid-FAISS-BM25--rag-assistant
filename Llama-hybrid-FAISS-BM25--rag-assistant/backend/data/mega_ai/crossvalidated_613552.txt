Machine Learning - clusterization (which algorithm to choose?)

I have a set of a hundred people. For each person there is a table (Time, Point X, Point Y). The number of rows in each person's table is different (about 1500-2000 rows). I want to divide these people into groups, using the data in the tables. Can you tell me what clustering algorithm I can use in this case, or what direction to take in general? I understand how clustering algorithms work when there is one table with objects, but what to do when each object has its own table? The meaning of each table: a person draws a square, using a special device and as a result we get a table with the coordinates of the point of the square and the time when each point was put. Using coordinates of each table you can draw this square.
