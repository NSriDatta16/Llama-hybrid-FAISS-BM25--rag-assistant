How can I prevent text/element selection with cursor drag

I made a paging control and I noticed that while clicking on the buttons it is very easy to accidentally select the individual images and text. Is it possible to prevent this? To clarify selecting I mean highlighting with the mouse. (Try dragging your mouse from one side of the screen to the other.) If you try to highlight the text/controls in this grid it can't be selected. How is that done? Link
