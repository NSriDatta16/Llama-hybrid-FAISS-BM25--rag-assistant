If you are already working, or have knowledge of the two areas you mentioned; I'd agree with what @Nemo_the_scientist says, i.e., DevOps > Full Stack Development for data science; though I feel bit eerie saying something like that, because the three areas are overlapping, and it is not right to say knowledge of the one is better than the other. In my work (as a data scientist / ML engineer) I have dealt more with dev ops works (dealing with CI/CD pipelines, model deployment, monitoring, retraining, etc.) than with any front/back end development. Logically, you can view an ML model as an artifact similar to a complete business application, and you need to continuously integrate it with other systems, keep it up-to-date by retraining, monitoring its performance (both in terms of performance on the business, and in terms of software - prediction latency, model size, memory requirements, etc.). This sounds more like the dev ops, rather then full-stack programming. On the other hand, I'd think that full-stack programmers are better equipped to work with databases and this would help you greatly in data science role. To wrap up: you'll need some skills from both fields (maybe bit more from dev ops). Have a look at what skills some popular online courses are offering, or what skills job ads at big and middle sized companies are requesting.
