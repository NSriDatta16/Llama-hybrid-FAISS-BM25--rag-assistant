It would help to know more about why you'd wanna do it this way, but one approach that I can think of is to first do PCA on your 2000 dimensions and get the explained variance and cumulative variances. Then set a threshold for the cumulative variance and whichever dimension hits that threshold (say 95%) take that dimension number as the count of target dimensions to reduce to using PCA or t-sne. So if you get 95% cumulative variance on dimension # 654, your target for reduced dimensions should be 654.
