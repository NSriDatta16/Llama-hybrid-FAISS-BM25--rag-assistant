log4net: How to store data in DB

I am planning to replace few different logging mechanism with the only 1. Also I would like to store data not in file, but in DB. For this purpose I am planning to choose log4net. But looking on the documentation I don't see a way to configure it to use DB as logs storage. Am I missed something? Could you please point me if there is a way to store data in DB using log4net. And how to do that? Thanks a lot!
