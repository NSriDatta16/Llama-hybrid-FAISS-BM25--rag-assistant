Flash widget system

I want to create a little flash application, what would implement a widget system. Main points: Widgets are separate SWF files, loaded dynamically from a folder Active widgets and their position are saved on a given interval Widgets can be dragged after a long press (time of press can be set) Open source and free Not too important but maybe multi-page support? Something like on iPhone? Is there any such widget system for Flash?
