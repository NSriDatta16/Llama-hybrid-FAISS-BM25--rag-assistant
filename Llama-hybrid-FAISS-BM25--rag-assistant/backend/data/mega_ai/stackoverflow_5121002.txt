Organizing Javascript with callbacks

I am trying to figure out the best way to organize a bunch of AJAX methods on my site. The problem is that I want to run a bunch of callbacks after each one is received. Here's an example (assume each method runs asynchronously): Log_in_user if response received and call was successful get_user's_data if response received and call was successful alert user Hopefully by now the problem is clear. Because each method runs asynchronously, the code will not run in order. If instead, I want to pass the next function to run as a callback to run after the function that proceeds it, I will have to pass an increasingly large number of callbacks to the first function depending on how many things I want to happen after each asynchronous method returns. For example, in this case, I will have to pass two callbacks to the Log_in_user function Log_in_user(get_user's_data,alert_user). The more callbacks I have running after each other, the more callbacks I will have to pass to the original Log_in_user function. Is there a more modular and better organized way to do this?
