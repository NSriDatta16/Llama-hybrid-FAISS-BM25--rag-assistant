How to group and order columns in r

The information given above is very similar to the data frame I am currently using, however, there are a few hundred thousand data entries, with thousands of games and multiple drives for each game. I have been trying to find the first and last row for each drive for each GameID and then determine if a Field Goal or Touchdown was scored at the end of the drive. Ultimately I would like the data organized in a way where each row has a game ID, drive, 1st play yrdln, last play yrdln, Field Goal (yes or no), and sp (scoring play). Or hopefully something close to this. I don't really know where to begin with something like this and have been failing for a good part of a day trying, so any and all help is greatly appreciated. If anything needs further clarification, please let me know!
