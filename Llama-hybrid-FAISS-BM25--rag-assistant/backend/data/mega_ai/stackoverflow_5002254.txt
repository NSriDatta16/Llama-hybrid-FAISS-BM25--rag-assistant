Adapt existing code for OpenGL stereoscopic rendering?

I'm trying to implement stereoscopic 3d in OpenGL using a side-by-side technique. I've read this article which in great detail explains how to set up the camera for left and right views. It uses a camera model and set up the left and right views using gluLookAt. However in my case I want to adapt existing code that already set up the projection . See the following example where "existingcode" represents the code that I cannot make changes to. //Render left view // setUpCamera set the gl projection and model matrix existingcode.setUpCamera() .. here I want to somehow modify the current gl projection matrix for the left view .. existingcode.renderScene() //.. then render right view Can it be done, perhaps by calling glGetMatrix and modify it somehow?
