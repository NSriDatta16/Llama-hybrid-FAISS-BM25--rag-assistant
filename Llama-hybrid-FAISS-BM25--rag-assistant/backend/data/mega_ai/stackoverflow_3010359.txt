The interface can't declare / enforce a constructor. Define the interface and create an abstract base class that provides the most likely implementation of the constructor -- probably just saving the resource context passed in. Encourage, but don't require, plugin authors to derive from the base class. There may be other useful methods that the base class could also provide. Continue to use reflection to check the plugins.
