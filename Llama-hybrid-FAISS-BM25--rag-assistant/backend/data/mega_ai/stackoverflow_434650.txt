Instant Messaging has been around from long time (mid to late 60), but IRC did not come before 1988. Video communication , on top of that, (as in, for instance, Windows Live Messenger , or Skype, or ...) really did change the way we are communicating ;) and is much more recent. (see VideoConferencing: 1968 , alt text http://wpcontent.answers.com/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/64/On_Line_System_Videoconferencing_FJCC_1968.jpg/180px-On_Line_System_Videoconferencing_FJCC_1968.jpg , as Alan Kay himself points out in the comment: Again, please check out what Engelbart demoed in 1968 (including live video chatting and screen sharing). IOW, guessing really doesn't work as well as looking things up . This is why most people make weak assumptions about when things were invented.) Take that in my face ;), and rightfully so. Note: the "webcam" (video setup) of those times were not exactly made for your average living-room ;) [... resuming the answer:] The generalization of webcam alt text http://wpcontent.answers.com/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Logitech_Quickcam_Pro_4000.jpg/180px-Logitech_Quickcam_Pro_4000.jpg helped too (Started in 1991, the first such camera, called the CoffeeCam, was pointed at the Trojan room coffee pot in the computer science department of Cambridge University). So: Post-1980: 2 out of 3: IRC and Webcam.
