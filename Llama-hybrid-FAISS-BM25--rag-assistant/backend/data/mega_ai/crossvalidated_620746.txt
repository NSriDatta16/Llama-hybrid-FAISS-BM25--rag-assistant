MAE Confidence Intervals: how many bootstraps?

I have predictions and actuals for a dataset. There is a categorical feature in this dataset. Call it state . I want to know the average MAE at the state level with confidence intervals . (Like a Mean MAE, not just MAE of the entire dataset) I'm assuming the answer involves bootstrapping, but my question is which level(s) to perform the bootstrap on. To lay out the options: State Level Select a state randomly (with replacement) Calculate MAE from all predictions within that state Repeat many times, use quantiles to estimate CIs State and Prediction Level Select a state randomly (with replacement) Take a bootstrap sample from within that state Calculate MAE Repeat many times, use quantiles to estimate CIs Prediction Level Take a bootstrap sample of predictions within each state, exactly once per state Calculate MAE Repeat many times, use quantiles to estimate CIs Note: The state variable contains all states, the entire population. So can we just do the Prediction level and ignore the state level?
