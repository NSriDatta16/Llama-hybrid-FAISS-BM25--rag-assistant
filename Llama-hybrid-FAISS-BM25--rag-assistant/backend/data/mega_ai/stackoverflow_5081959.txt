If you set a "central" git repository server, then that server will have bare repositories only (because of push restriction ), meaning: not all the files but only a compressed version of all the history of those files. The space taken by those bare repos isn't that important if you are dealing with sources (text files). But if you have, as a webapp designer, many binaries (mainly pictures), then you need to externalize them in another storage, while keeping your git repos in your central server. The current solution is git-annex .
