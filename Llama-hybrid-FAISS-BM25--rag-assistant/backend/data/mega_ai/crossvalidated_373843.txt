I see various areas you should have a look into: Basics of probability Here you should understand the most common continuous probability distributions (e.g. normal distribution, t-distribution) and the most common discrete distributions (e.g. binomial distribution and geometric distribution). You should also understand how they are related to each other, e.g. a t-distribution converges to a normal distribution if n goes to infinity. You should also understand concepts like conditional probability and Bayes' theorem and you should have a look into random processes, e.g. random walk. Basics of inferential statistics You should understand the basics of inferential statistics and statistical testing. In statistical testing p-values and power of tests is important. Linear algebra Linear algebra is one of the most important mathematical concepts for statistics. Important concepts are e.g. the inverse and the transpose of a matrix. You should also be able to calculate with matrices, e.g. multiplication. Regression and econometrics There are three different areas of regression analysis: Cross-sectional regressions, panel data and time series analysis. You should go through all of the three areas. Time series analysis might be the most important area of this three areas for practitioners as it is used for forecasting. Machine learning algorithms After having an overview of the different areas of machine learning you should have look in some of the most common supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g. regression and classification) and the most common unsupervised machine learning algorithms (e.g. clustering, cimensionality reduction and anomaly detection) Coding with statistical software R and Python are the most widespread languages for statistical computing. If I were you I would choose R as you need less pre-knowledge in object-oriented computing for using it.
