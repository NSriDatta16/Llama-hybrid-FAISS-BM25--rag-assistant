If you execute code in -(id)init, you have to pay attention when you use some codes like self.view.frame = .... or [self.view addSubView:xxx] inside -(id)init, it will load view and run -(void)viewDidLoad method before -(id)init return. If you made your view with IB, then a method named -(void)awakeFromNib; would be called when your codes load view from IB. If you made view by codes, you can put those codes inside -(void)loadView to construct the view hierarchy.
