Java/Swing GUI best practices (from a code standpoint)

As a contrast to this wiki , I am looking for the proper way to implement Swing GUI controls from a coding standpoint. I have been on a quest to learn Java and its GUI tools but I find internet tutorial after internet tutorial that throws everything in main and I know this isn't right. I've also tried RAD systems like Netbeans and other "visual" editors but by the time I get to coding I've got a heap of code that I don't know half of what it does, so I'm intent on learning to hand code swing, and I know the basic controls and layout, but want to do it the right way. Is there a model or standard I'm missing? example questions... do I extend JFrame and create my own frame object? (I would assume yes) do I encapsulate the main menu inside that frame object? or do I create its own? etc... How to I separate "View" logic from "Application" logic? Basically, I'm looking for what the industry standard is, on how to organize GUI code.
