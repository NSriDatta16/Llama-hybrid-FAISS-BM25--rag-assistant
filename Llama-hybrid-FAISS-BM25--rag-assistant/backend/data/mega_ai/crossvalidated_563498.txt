$PS \equiv Pr(X_1 > X_2) \tag{1}$ is a statement about two random variables. You describe approach 2 by saying [...] Conditional on the data (not the parameters), $X$ 's have a known distribution. [...] This is incorrect. You seem to be describing the Bayesian approach to estimating the parameters of distributions of random variables and the priors. It is not known but estimated unless you mean something else than you described. Then you comment In the second approach, $PS$ appears to be a known quantity. It's not a random variable, because it is conditional on the data, which is not random. It doesn't have a distribution. It's just a number. In statistics, we consider the samples as realizations of random variables. If you are concerned about "just numbers" then statements like $PS \equiv Pr(X_1 > X_2)$ make no sense. You gathered some data that presumably is a sample, so it is random due to the sampling. Most likely you want to generalize what you learned from the data to some population, so again, if you treat the data as "just numbers" that tell you about the "known" parameters, then you cannot generalize the results to the population without considering them as random variables. So answering the question answered in the title, "known quality" is something that you know about the population of interest. If you calculate something from the sample, it is estimated, not known. It would be known only if you have the data about the whole population.
