I don't really see how the data exactly fits to the variables mentioned in a question, but I understand what you are trying to say. What you could try is a bar chart (showing an average value for this variable for example), but instead of showing just one bar for each variable you could provide two, showing the average value for this variable for instances of each value in your binary variable. I would advise to colour-code them to make it more easy for people to compare. This approach could of course be extended into other visualization techniques which allow for analysis of more complex patterns in your dataset like boxplots etc. Hope this helps!
