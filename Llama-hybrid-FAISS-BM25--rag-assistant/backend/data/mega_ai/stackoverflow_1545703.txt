You can store OrganisationID in session [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")] public ActionResult AddFile(Guid? id) { Session["OrganisationID"] = id; } and then set EntityKey with something like: quote.OrganisationReference.EntityKey = new EntityKey("ContainerName.OrganizationSet","ID",Session["OrganisationID"]) If You have organisation ID in URL, You can change post function to: [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public ActionResult AddFile(Quote quote,Guid? id) and retrieve it automatically (with adequate routing). You don't neet to get organisation from repository during get, just store ID.
