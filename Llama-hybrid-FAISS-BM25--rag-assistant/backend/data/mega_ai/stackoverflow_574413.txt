In my SVN repository I have a single trunk / branch / tag directory. I put all of my projects in trunk and organize my branch and tag directories separately based on the projects that actually reach a taggable state. Convention might suggest using a branch / tag / trunk directory for each project however that can be impractical if you don't expect to be tagging and branching. Even personal projects can benefit from infrequent tagging and branching before major rewrites or after a long hiatus.
