What to do with principal components?

I'm running some basic R and there are a lot of great tutorials about PCA but they always stop once they've obtained a biplot. My question is what do you do with the principal components? I have two principal components that explain 95% of the data. How do I use them for further data analysis or is the biplot the endgame with them?
