Jailbroken 3GS / 4.2.1 I tried Matthew Frederick's recommendation without success. Anyone happened to find a solution to this problem? EDIT Please note that I used a jailbroken 3GS and a non-jailbroken 3GS . Workaround, requires a non-jailbroken iPhone 3GS with 4.2.1 (8C148a) : Delete /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.2.1 (8C148a) Connect the non-jailbroken iPhone 3GS with 4.2.1 (8C148a) Open Xcode and Organizer Configure the new iPhone for development by clicking the "Use for development" button in the Organizer. Let it extract the debugging symbols from it recreating /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.2.1 (8C148a) Unplug it, remove from Organizer At this point you can debug your jailbroken iPhone again. Cheers!
