Stacking GBT using Logistic Regression

1) I build Gradient Boosted Tree Model in h2o and now i have the POJO. 2) I extracted the weight for each tree of GBT for my population 3) I used the extracted weight to train a logistic regression model. What do you think about this stacking approach ? Have anyone worked on this before ? Any leads will be appreciated ?
