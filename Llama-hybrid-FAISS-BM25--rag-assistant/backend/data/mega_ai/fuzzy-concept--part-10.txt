ints for many Facebook users. When Mark Zuckerberg replied to his critics, he stated that because the revolutionary technology of Facebook (with 2.2 billion users worldwide, at that time) had ventured into previously unknown territory, it was unavoidable that mistakes would be made, despite the best of intentions. He justified himself saying that: "For the first ten or twelve years of the company, I viewed our responsibility primarily as building tools, that if we could put those tools in people's hands, then that would empower people to do good things. What we have learnt now... is that we need to take a more proactive role and a broader view of our responsibility." Integrity It remained "fuzzy" what was more important to Mark Zuckerberg: making money from user's information, or real corporate integrity in the use of personal information. Zuckerberg implied, that he believed that, on balance, Facebook had done more good than harm, and that, if he had believed that wasn't the case, he would never have persevered with the business. Thus, "the good" was itself a fuzzy concept, because it was a matter of degree ("much more good than bad", as indicated by the fact that more than 2 billion people stay signed up with Facebook). He had to sell stuff, to pay the bills, finance development and keep the business growing. If people do not like Facebook, then they simply should not join it, or opt out, they have the choice. Many critics however feel that people really are in no position to make an informed choice about joining Facebook, because they have no idea of how exactly their information will or might be used by third parties contracting with Facebook; because the company legally owns the information that users provide online, they have no control over that either, except to restrict themselves in what they write online; the same applies to many other online services (see further Facebookâ€“Cambridge Analytica data scandal). After the New York Times broke the news on 17 March 2018, that copies of the Facebook data set scraped by Cambridge Analytica could still be downloaded from the Internet, Facebook was severely criticized by government representatives. When questioned, Mark Zuckerberg admitted that "In general we collect data on people who are not signed up for Facebook for security purposes" with the aim "to help prevent malicious actors from collecting public information from Facebook users, such as names". Where the privacy boundary was drawn, was somewhat fuzzy. On 2 May 2018, it was reported that the Cambridge Analytica company was shutting down and was starting bankruptcy proceedings, after losing clients and facing escalating legal costs. The reputational damage which the company had suffered or caused, had become too great. In July 2018, Facebook and Instagram barred access from Crimson Hexagon, a company that advises corporations and governments using one trillion scraped social media posts, which it mined and processed with artificial intelligence and image analysis. From 2018 onward, Facebook faced a lot more lawsuits brought against the company, alleging data breaches, security breaches and misuse of personal information (see Lawsuits involving Meta Platforms and Facebook Federal Litigation Filings). In November 2023, Meta Platforms was reported to be a defendant or co-defendant in at least 2,100 lawsuits. Annual lawsuit filings by and against Meta Platforms end up costing millions of dollars and even more; the cumulative legal costs run into billions of dollars. This creates a powerful financial incentive to get the company systems working right and neutralize malafide online operators. There still doesn't exist a standard international regulatory framework for social network information, and it is often unclear what happens to the stored information, after a provider company closes down, or is taken over by another company. Mark Zuckerberg's Meta company also reports its own legal actions. In 2023, Meta Platforms sue
