The user will never see the "database problem" message, as the script will die() out if the query fails. As well, you're embedding HTML into the message, but are not building a proper HTML-format email. Some mail clients may be smart enough to figure out there's HTML and render it as such, but that's just luck. The hash you generate is limited to generating only 1001 hashes. Given the birthday paradox, after 38 people sign up, the odds of a collision are 50%. After 100 people, the odds are 99.29%. Instead of hashing a random number, do something like: $hash = md5(serialize($_POST) . $some_other_stuff_in_case_POST_is_empty);
