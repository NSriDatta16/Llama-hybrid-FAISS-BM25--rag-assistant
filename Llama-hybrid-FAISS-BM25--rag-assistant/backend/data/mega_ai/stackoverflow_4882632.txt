Three reasons for using _ notation: As you mentioned, performance . Functions are not recreated with each construction. Debugging . It's easy to view all the properties of an object at runtime. Structure . It's easy to break parts of the code into different files, or inherit properties in child "classes". Variables made private by closures restricts how you can organise your code. This is kind of like the argument to use protected/friend variables versus private variables in OOP languages. There are other arguments in either direction, but it gets more philosophical - about whether to trust programmers with your code or to enforce "good practice", but I won't go there ;)
