Without any formal definition of what it means to be "95% confident", what justification is there for labelling #5 true or false? A layman would doubtless misinterpret it as synonymous with a 95% probability of the mean's being in that interval: but some people do use it in the sense of having used an interval-generating method whose intervals contain the true mean 95% of the time, precisely to avoid talking about the probability distribution of an unknown parameter; which seems a natural enough extension of the terminology. The similar structure of the preceding statement (#4) might have encouraged respondents to try to draw a distinction between "we can be 95% confident" & "there is a 95% probability" even if they hadn't entertained the idea before. I had expected this tricksiness to lead to #5 having the highest proportion in agreementâ€”looking at the paper, I found out I was wrong, but noticed that at least 80% read the questionnaire in a Dutch version, which perhaps should raise questions about the pertinence of the English translation.
