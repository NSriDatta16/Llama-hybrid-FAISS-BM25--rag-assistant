Is Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X (3rd edition) outdated?

got a quick question for you (pretty much the title): is the book Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X (3rd Edition) outdated? It's just that I read a little in it, until page 36 (in a .PDF ebook version) where I came across a problem. The chapter introduces you to Objective-C and Cocoa, and you already have to write a program by yourself. Exciting. But when he makes a class called Foo.h and Foo.m, my Xcode doesn't follow the guide. His Interface Builder is different from my Interface Builder. When he is about to make outlets and actions, I can't do it. They just won't show up. I am sure I entered the correct info in my Foo.h file: #import @interface Foo : NSObject { IBOutlet NSTextField *textField; } -(IBAction)seed:(id)sender; -(IBAction)generate:(id)sender; @end the Foo.m file: #import "Foo.h" @implementation Foo @end and I dragged them both to the "Class" folder, but it still won't show them in IB. Besides that, Xcode shows three warnings: Incomplete implementation of class 'Foo' Method definition for '-generate:' not found Method definition for '-seed:' not found This is why I think the book is outdated, but these are not errors, just warnings. Here's some screenies: This just made me think that the book might be outdated, and if I can use it all (if there are mistakes in every chapters). Is it me that made a stupid mistake, or is the book really outdated? Please help me out on this one, as I really want to learn Objective-C and Cocoa :) Thank you.
