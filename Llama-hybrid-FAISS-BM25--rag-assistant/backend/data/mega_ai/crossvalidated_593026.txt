Data Splitting Proportions and Distributions

I am performing a machine learning task. I have data, 8163 observations in total, with which I will need to split into a train and test (holdout) set. I am also performing cross validation with the train set to prevent overfitting. My question is that does the distribution of the train, each validation fold and test set have to be roughly equal such as this: The first split between train and test is 93% (train). Then I used BlockedTimeSeriesSplit cross-validation, with 7 folds, each being split 50% for training and testing.
