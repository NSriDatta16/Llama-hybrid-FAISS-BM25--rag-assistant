As suggested by others, please put more for of an effort into your questions. The following is a very basic implementation of what you're after. It does ignore some email types, but hey, its the same amount of effort you put in. $matches = preg_match_all( "/[a-z0-9]+([_\\.-][a-z0-9]+)*@([a-z0-9]+([\.-][a-z0-9]+)*)+\\.[a-z]{2,}/i", $text, $emails ); $text is your paragraph. $emails is the array of matched values.
