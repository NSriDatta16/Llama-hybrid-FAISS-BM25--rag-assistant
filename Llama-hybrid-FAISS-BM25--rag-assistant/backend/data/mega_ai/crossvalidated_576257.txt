Seasonal and trend adjustment for irregularly spaced time series

I know of different methods that exist to remove seasonality and trend in the data to make it stationary. However, that exists only for regular time series; that is, a series that follows a fixed frequency. For example, a series that has a daily recording of temperature. But what about methods for irregular time series where data is ordered by time, but doesn't follow a fixed time pattern, that is, it is not regularly spaced, data comes suddenly, sales data, when some days don't sell? What methods are there to stationarize irregular time series if they are non-stationary (seasonal and trendy)? timestamp I have: timestamp p1 p2 p3 2014/03/01 5 6 4 2014/03/02 6 6 8 2014/03/03 9 25 20 2014/03/05 9 5 55 2014/03/08 0 2 4
