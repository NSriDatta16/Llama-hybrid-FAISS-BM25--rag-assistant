If my memory serves, silhouettes often tend to support smaller number of clusters, but there are bigger issues with your analysis. You're analyzing biological data and straying far from the best practices in the field. In your case both 1+2 vs 3 and 1 vs 2 vs 3 are valid clusterings, so you'd be better off with the hierarchical clustering, (3, (1, 2)) in a Newick notation. UPGMA/NJ , if you don't have the computational resources, ML or bayesian phylogenetics otherwise. In addition, Hamming distances can be applicable only for very close strains, where the distances would be on the order of single mutations. Otherwise use some distance metric aware of possible multiple mutations on a single site and different mutation rates. There are quite a few of those , as well as methods for choosing the best one using eg Bayesian information criterion. Kimura 2-param seems to be a safe choice.
