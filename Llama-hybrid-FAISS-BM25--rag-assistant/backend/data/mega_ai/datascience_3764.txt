After reading your question, I became curious about the topic of time series clustering and dynamic time warping (DTW) . So, I have performed a limited search and came up with basic understanding (for me) and the following set of IMHO relevant references (for you). I hope that you'll find this useful, but keep in mind that I have intentionally skipped research papers, as I was more interested in practical aspects of the topic. Resources: UCR Time Series Classification/Clustering : main page , software page and corresponding paper Time Series Classification and Clustering with Python : a blog post and an ipython notebook Capital Bikeshare: Time Series Clustering : another blog post Dynamic Time Warping using rpy and Python : another blog post Mining Time-series with Trillions of Points: Dynamic Time Warping at Scale : another blog post Time Series Analysis and Mining in R (to add R to the mix): yet another blog post And, finally, two tools implementing/supporting DTW , to top it off: R package and Python module
