Priority Queue with a find function - Fastest Implementation

I am looking at implementing a priority queue with an added requirement, a find/search function which will tell whether an item is anywhere within the queue. So the functions will be: insert, del-min and find. I am unsure whether I should use a Heap or a Self-balancing binary search tree. It appears PQs are usually implemented with a Heap, but I am wondering if there is any advantage in using a binary search tree since I also need that find function. Furthermore, on average I'll be doing more inserts than deletes. I am also considering a d-ary heap . Basically, every second counts. Thanks!
