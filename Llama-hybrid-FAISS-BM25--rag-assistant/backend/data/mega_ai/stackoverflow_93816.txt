Do you chat online for work purposes?

I've worked with folks who are chatting online with their peers, constantly batting around ideas. I've also worked with folks who adamantly refuse and think it's a waste of time. Are online live chatting forums of particular use to you? Why or why not? Internal to your company, or external and world-wide? Does your employer encourage or discourage their use? Update: I see some people are voting this question down, yet so far all the answers have been positive, if with some reservations. If someone has a strong negative opinion (I hate online chatting and think it should be banned etc.) I'd really like to hear why.
