Javascript: Inherit+modify associative array?

I'm looking for an elegant way to override values in an associative array. For example, say I have my base options as: var base_options = { hintText:"something", borderStyle:Titanium.UI.INPUT_BORDERSTYLE_ROUNDED, width: 200, height: LABEL_HEIGHT-4, font: {fontSize:16}, left: 95 } I want to use this as the base, but be able to override a few items in this base on a case-by-case basis - for example, hintText would be different for each item. What's a clean and elegant way to get a copy of this array with a few parameters modified? I realize I can change each individual item, as in: options.hintText = "new thing"; but I suspect there's a more elegant way.
