post-hoc analysis for logistic regression?

Suppose our dependent variable Y is TRUE vs FALSE, and our independent variable X is GREEN, YELLOW, and RED. We performed a logistic regression of Y~X. I wonder if it is possible and how to use the trained logistic regression to answer the following question: What is the odds ratio (and p-value) of TRUE vs FALSE for subjects whose X equals to GREEN. What is the odds ratio (and p-value) of TRUE vs FALSE for subjects whose X equals to YELLOW. What is the odds ratio (and p-value) of TRUE vs FALSE for subjects whose X equals to RED.
