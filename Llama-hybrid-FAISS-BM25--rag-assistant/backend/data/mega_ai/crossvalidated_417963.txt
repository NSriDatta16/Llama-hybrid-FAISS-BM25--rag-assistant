Transform to linear functions

I'm taking an intro data science course, and we are being asked to apply transformations to data to get linear functions to apply a linear regression. Is the basic idea as follows? Say, I have two variables $y,x$ , and when I plot them, it looks almost like $y \approx \log x$ . Do we "transform" this to a linear function by exponentiating both sides, so $exp(y) = x$ , and now define some other function like $y' = exp(y)$ , so we have a transformed linear function, $y' = x$ ? Thanks.
