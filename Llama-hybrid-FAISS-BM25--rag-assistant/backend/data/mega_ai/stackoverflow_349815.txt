Error Correction Libraries?

I'm interested in using a Reed-Solomon error correction [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction as a reference] to try to rebuild files from partial bits of a file. I'm doing this as a personal interest. I recently read about WuaLa [ http://www.wua.la/] and I'm interested in how they leverage Reed-Solomon to reconstruct files from partial files. Does anyone know of libraries that are already built that support Reed-Solomon? Could anyone point me to the math involved in doing this type of thing (keep in mind I'm a software guy not a math guy so if you can point to something more accessible that would be great). I've checked out part of the video [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xKZ4KGkQY8] on this tool but I'm still trying to wrap my head around the math involved.
