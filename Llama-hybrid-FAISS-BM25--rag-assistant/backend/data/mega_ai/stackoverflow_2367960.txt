prevent google from indexing

hi sirs what's the best way to prevent google from showing of a folder in the search engine ?, like e.g www.example.com/support , what should i do if I want the support folder to disappear in google ? the first thing I did was place a 'robots.txt' file and include this code User-agent: * Disallow: /support/etc but the results is a total disaster, am not able to use the support page anymore unless i remove the robots.txt what's the best thing to do ?
