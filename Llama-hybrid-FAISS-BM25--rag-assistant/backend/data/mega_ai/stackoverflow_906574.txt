Because of its storage format, double s cannot store every values exactly as is is entered or displayed. The human representation of numbers is usually in decimal format, while double s are based on the dual system. In a double , 120 is stored precisely because it's an integer value. But 0.05 is not. The double is approximated to the closest number to 0.05 it can represent. 0.5 is a power of 2 ( 1/2 ), so it can be stored precisely and you don't get a rounding error. To have all numbers exactly the same way you enter / display it in the decimal system, use decimal instead. decimal x, y; x = 120.0M; y = 0.05M; decimal z = x % y; // z is 0
