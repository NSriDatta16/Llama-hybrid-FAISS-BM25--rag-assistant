Given a proper open source ORM, the ORM can likely be modified to generate whatever SQL you want it to in whatever scenario you want against any database vendor. So, while no ORM out of the box likely has 100% coverage of what you can do with SQL (especially database vendor specific / non-standard SQL), there isn't really a technical reason why the ORM can't be modified to do so. The feature releases of Entity Framework and Linq are not very agile so those are potentially slower to adapt to what ORM users want. That said, Linq (not LinqToSql) has been a great addition to the ORM world.
