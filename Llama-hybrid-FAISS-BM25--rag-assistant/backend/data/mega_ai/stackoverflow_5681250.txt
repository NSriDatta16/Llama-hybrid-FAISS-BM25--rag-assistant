Drupal 7: Main menu not displaying child elements

In my main menu, I have primary links and child links. The primary links are printing just fine. However, when I make a child element (by either dragging it to the right or selecting a parent link), they aren't displayed in the menu at all. I can create a new menu, and the child elements display correctly. I also ensured that 'Show as Expanded' was selected. Are child 'Main Menu' elements not suppose to show up?
