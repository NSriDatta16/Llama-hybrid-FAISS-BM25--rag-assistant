Is this Valid PHP? Complex If statement

can I do something like if($x != (y&&z&&r&&w)) Or do I have to write it like this if($x!=y && $x!=z && $x!=r && x!=w) Just wondering because I have lots of variables to compare and just wanted a more elegant solution. You might have a more elegant solution anyway. Here's what I'm trying to do. foreach($_POST as $key => $value){ if($key != 'category_id'){ $cp[$key] = $value; } } And I have about 6 more variables to compare in my $_POST statement and I would like to make the code pretty. It's basically a huge form that needs to format into a specific array ($cp[]) with specific keys to use my MySQL insert statement. Any fancy ideas?
