Drag and drop in as3 on specific path (ex bezier curve)

I need to implement a drag and drop functionality, where I can define and constraint the route of the draggable object. Like in http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?t=330302 , only that i have the paths designed and not calculated by a math function. So, in fact, as mouse moves I need to tell the object to follow the custom path/movieclip.
