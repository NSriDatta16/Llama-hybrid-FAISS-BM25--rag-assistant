find 's -prune comes to mind, but it's a pain to get it to work for specific paths ( icecream/cupcake/ ) rather than specific directories ( cupcake/ ). Personally, I'd just use cpio and hard-link (to avoid having to copy them) the files in the directories you want to keep to a new tree and then remove the old one: find test -path 'test/icecream/cupcake/*' -o -path 'test/mtndew/livewire/*' | cpio -padluv test-keep rm -rf test That'll also keep your existing directory structure for the directories you intend to keep.
