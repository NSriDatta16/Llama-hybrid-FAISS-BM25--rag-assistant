The generated xsd shows minOccurs=0. This is per specification: any non-primitives are optional, only primitives are required. I need a way to make WebMethod parameters required (maybe minOccurs=1 in the xsd) in the "start from Java" approach. This is not possible, unless you use primitives as previously mentioned. And actually, this is one of the reasons why Java-first sucks (yeah, developers like it but it just does not work ): its fragile, the contract may change(!), its doesn't give you all the control you need, it doesn't fit well with WS-Security , etc. So, indeed, contract-first is not pleasant, but at least, it works.
