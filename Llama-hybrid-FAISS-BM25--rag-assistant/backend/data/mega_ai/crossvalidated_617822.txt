There has been some research pertaining to the topic concerned during the $70$ s. $\rm [I]$ provides such characterization taking motivation from the Pareto law. Heuristic though it may be, it is intuitive: Let there be a tax exempt level $m, $ the actual income be $X$ and the reported income be $Y.$ Let the under reportage be $U.$ Anyone would tend to under-report if $X> m. $ So, $$Y= X-U, ~U\in(0, \max\{0, X-m\}). \tag 1\label 1$$ It is easy to infer from $\eqref 1$ that $Y> m$ when $X> m. $ Assume the expected amount of under-reporting to be proportional to $X-m, ~X> m, $ i.e. $$\mathbb E[U\mid X=x] = b(x-m) := a+bx.\tag 2\label 2$$ Let the reported income $Y=y.$ Theorem : If $\eqref 1,~\eqref 2$ hold, then the necessary and sufficient condition for $X$ to follow Pareto distribution with a finite mean is $$\mathbb E[U\mid X> y]=\alpha +\beta y, ~~ \beta >b> 0.\tag 3\label 3$$ The theorem is easy to prove: show the distribution $G(\cdot)=1-F(\cdot)$ which satisfies $\eqref 3$ that is, $$\frac{1}{G(y) }\int_y^\infty (a+bx) ~\mathrm dF(x) =\alpha + \beta x, ~~y> m\tag 4\label 4$$ is that of Pareto. $F$ is continuous as any possible point of discontinuity would be at $(a-\alpha) /(\beta-b) $ which follows from $\eqref 4$ but again from the same equation, $a+by\leq \alpha +\beta y$ from which $y> m\geq (a-\alpha) /(\beta-b) .$ Finally, define $H(y) := \int_y^\infty G(x) ~\mathrm dx. $ Solve $$\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dx} \ln H(y) = \frac{-b}{\alpha -a+(\beta-b)y}\tag 5\label 5$$ to deduce $H(\cdot)$ and hence $G(\cdot)=-H^\prime(\cdot),~\eqref 5$ follows from $\eqref 4$ using integration by parts.
