It is perfectly possible to do this in a number of different ways. You can either directly compare your two summary estimates or you can do a meta-regression with follow-up time as a moderator variables. There is an extended discussion of this with code in R on Wolfgang Viechtbauer's pages here . Note that I am assuming the two sets of trials are independent, that is to say they are not the same trial but reporting twice at the two different time points. If my assumption is false then life becomes more difficult.
