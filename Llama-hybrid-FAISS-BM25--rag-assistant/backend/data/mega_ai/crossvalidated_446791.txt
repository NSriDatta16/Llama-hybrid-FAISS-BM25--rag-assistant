Edit: So, to elucidate (I clearly didn't entertain enough the possibility $Z_t$ was not going to be a Markov chain), one reason why $Z_t$ isn't a Markovian is the following. Let $Z_{t-2} = 2$ (and $X_{t-2} = 2$ ), then it follows per construction that $Z_{t-1} = 0$ (and $X_{t-1} = 0$ ). But then at time $t$ , $X_t = 1$ . Thus $P(Z_t = 2 \mid Z_{t-1} = 0, Z_{t-2} = 2) = 0$ , and the chain now depends on the last two time-points, and it follows that $Z_t$ is not Markovian. However, the stationary distribution $(5/6, 1/12, 1/12)$ derived below is the valid stationary distribution for $Z_t$ , but $Z_t$ is not a Markov chain, and therefore the assumption $$ \pi_Z P_Z = \pi_Z $$ does not hold. Thus the answer below builds a Markovian model of $Z_t$ that has the exact stationary distribution under the requirements, but it is not the actual $Z_t$ chain. Original answer, mistaken assumption highlighted: The stationary distribution of $X_t$ is trivially going to be the vector $\pi_X = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)$ , while the stationary distribution of $Y_t$ after a bit of work is going to be $\pi_Y = (3/4, 1/4)$ . It follows that the probability of, say, $\pi_Z(0)$ must be equal to the sum of the possibilities leading to $Z_t = 0$ in stationarity. That is, $$\pi_Z(0) = \pi_X(0)\cdot \pi_Y(1) + \pi_X(0)\cdot \pi_Y(0) + \pi_X(1)\cdot \pi_Y(0) + \pi_X(2)\cdot \pi_Y(1) \\ = 1/12 + 3/12 + 3/12 + 3/12 = 5/6,$$ and since $Z_t = 2$ only if $X_t = 2, Y_t = 1$ and $Z_t = 1$ only if $X_t = 1, Y_t=1$ , it follows that $\pi_Z(1) = \pi_Z(2) = 1/12$ . Thus the stationary vector of the Markov chain $Z_t$ is $\pi_Z = (5/6, 1/12, 1/12).$ As you implicitly mention in your answer, if $Z_t = 2$ , it follows that $X_{t+1} = 0$ , so $Z_{t+1} = 0$ . Similarly, if $Z_t = 1$ , $Y_t = 1$ , so we must again have $Z_{t+1} = 0$ . We are thus left with calculating the transition probabilities given $Z_t = 0$ . For this, recall that by stationarity of Markov chains, we must have $$ \pi_Z P_Z = \pi_Z.$$ But by our arguments above, the transition matrix therefore must satisfy $$ (5/6, 1/12, 1/12) \begin{pmatrix} p_{0\rightarrow 0} & p_{0\rightarrow 1} & p_{0\rightarrow 1}\\ 1 & 0 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = (5/6, 1/12, 1/12),$$ and by calculating the l.h.s, we have $$ (5/6, 1/12, 1/12) \begin{pmatrix} p_{0\rightarrow 0} & p_{0\rightarrow 1} & p_{0\rightarrow 1}\\ 1 & 0 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = (5/6 p_{0\rightarrow 0} + 2/12, 5/6 p_{0\rightarrow 1}, 5/6 p_{0\rightarrow 2}), $$ which in particular implies, after multiplying through by 12 and rearranging, a system of 3 (decoupled) equations in 3 unknowns, $$(10p_{0\rightarrow 0}, 10p_{0\rightarrow 1}, 10p_{0\rightarrow 2}) = (8,1,1),$$ or $$ (p_{0\rightarrow 0}, p_{0\rightarrow 1}, p_{0\rightarrow 2}) = (4/5, 1/10, 1/10), $$ such that the final matrix is $$ P_Z = \begin{pmatrix} 4/5 & 1/10 & 1/10\\ 1 & 0 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$
