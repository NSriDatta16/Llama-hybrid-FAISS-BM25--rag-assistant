This is made so you don't have to statically link to a GL implementation, for example, if your code uses glBindFragDataLocation, which is available on OpenGL 3.0 and newer, it would fail to run with a cryptic linker error on OpenGL 2.1 and earlier implementations. So getting entry points dynamically allows you to select the apropiate rendering path at runtime. Also, it's required on Windows for GL functions > 1.1. GLEW does this for you, it doesn't dlopen libGL, it uses glXGetProcAddress/wglGetProcAddress/aglGetProcAddress to get GL function pointers from the driver, and it's cross platform.
