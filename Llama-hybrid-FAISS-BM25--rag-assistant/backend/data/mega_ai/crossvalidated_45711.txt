First of all, what kind of data are you analyzing? That could give you an idea of whether you should expect a spike at h=12. You are mostly correct in your reasoning about the look of an ACF for different ARMA models. However, if you had an MA(12) process like $$ Y_t=\theta_{12}\epsilon_{t-12}+\epsilon_t $$ then you could have an ACF plot that is approx. zero for h=1,...,11, nonzero for h=12, and then approx. zero afterwards. In your case, this doesn't look like anything worth modelling. Remember that if you test a hypothesis of $H_0$: the autocorrelation at lag $h$ is significantly different from zero at significance level $\alpha=0.10$, on average you expect to make a type I error 10% of the time. This is probably one of those times. If you are curious, try fitting some MA(12) models and look at some model selction criterion (AIC, AICc, BIC, etc.) and see if any model gives a better fit than $Y_t=\epsilon_t$, $\epsilon_t \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)$. I am guessing no.
