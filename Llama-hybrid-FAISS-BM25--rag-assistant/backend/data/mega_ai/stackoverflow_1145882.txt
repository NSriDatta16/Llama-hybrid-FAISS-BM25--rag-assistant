if you're not trying to do what przemaas has to say, then operate on the object that you're binding to (cause really, that's what the xtragrid is all about). If it's an xpcollection(T) that you're binding to, then any operations done on the records within it will propagate to the grid through the PropertyChanged event on the xpcollection. If you're binding to a custom collection, then just inherit it from IBindingList and/or implement INotifyPropertyChanged.
