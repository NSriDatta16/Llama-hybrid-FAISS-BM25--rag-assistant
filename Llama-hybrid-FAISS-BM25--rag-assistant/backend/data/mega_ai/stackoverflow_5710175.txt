Change textSize based on screen res/density?

I have a grid of 18 buttons, apparently this is too big as my text is getting messed up between different res/densities. 50sp looks right on 240 hdpi WVGA800, 30sp looks right on 120 ldpi QVGA and 160 mdpi HVGA. How can I adjust the sizes based on whatever screen is being used?
