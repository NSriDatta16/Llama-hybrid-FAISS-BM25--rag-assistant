How to implement a Silverlight Control for time table(scheduler)

My company is going to development drag and drop feature in Silverlight. We are very new to Silverlight and just learnt SL for a week ago. But I believe the feature that my company wants can be done in Silverlight. The control about is about the time table in which the resource will be shifted around. Here is the feature detail. We have one list box on left (resource list) and one table on the right. What we want to do is drag an item from the list onto the table then may have some data manipulation on table. I think it’s simple and but for me I don’t know how to create the table which is I think there is no built in control like this. Please take a look my screenshot below. https://i.stack.imgur.com/QCaVX.jpg My questions are: How can we approach to achieve this feature? What is the best way to implement this control? How we can handle the event such as drop, reload, bind and so on? How can we select and drag cell on table?
