 applied where the series are seasonally stationary or non-stationary. Situations where the amplitudes of frequency components change with time can be dealt with in time-frequency analysis which makes use of a time–frequency representation of a time-series or signal. Tools Tools for investigating time-series data include: Consideration of the autocorrelation function and the spectral density function (also cross-correlation functions and cross-spectral density functions) Scaled cross- and auto-correlation functions to remove contributions of slow components Performing a Fourier transform to investigate the series in the frequency domain Performing a clustering analysis Discrete, continuous or mixed spectra of time series, depending on whether the time series contains a (generalized) harmonic signal or not Use of a filter to remove unwanted noise Principal component analysis (or empirical orthogonal function analysis) Singular spectrum analysis "Structural" models: General state space models Unobserved components models Machine learning Artificial neural networks Support vector machine Fuzzy logic Gaussian process Genetic programming Gene expression programming Hidden Markov model Multi expression programming Queueing theory analysis Control chart Shewhart individuals control chart CUSUM chart EWMA chart Detrended fluctuation analysis Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling Dynamic time warping Dynamic Bayesian network Time-frequency analysis techniques: Fast Fourier transform Continuous wavelet transform Short-time Fourier transform Chirplet transform Fractional Fourier transform Chaotic analysis Correlation dimension Recurrence plots Recurrence quantification analysis Lyapunov exponents Entropy encoding Measures Time-series metrics or features that can be used for time series classification or regression analysis: Univariate linear measures Moment (mathematics) Spectral band power Spectral edge frequency Accumulated energy (signal processing) Characteristics of the autocorrelation function Hjorth parameters FFT parameters Autoregressive model parameters Mann–Kendall test Univariate non-linear measures Measures based on the correlation sum Correlation dimension Correlation integral Correlation density Correlation entropy Approximate entropy Sample entropy Fourier entropy Wavelet entropy Dispersion entropy Fluctuation dispersion entropy Rényi entropy Higher-order methods Marginal predictability Dynamical similarity index State space dissimilarity measures Lyapunov exponent Permutation methods Local flow Other univariate measures Algorithmic complexity Kolmogorov complexity estimates Hidden Markov model states Rough path signature Surrogate time series and surrogate correction Loss of recurrence (degree of non-stationarity) Bivariate linear measures Maximum linear cross-correlation Linear Coherence (signal processing) Bivariate non-linear measures Non-linear interdependence Dynamical Entrainment (physics) Measures for phase synchronization Measures for phase locking Similarity measures: Cross-correlation Dynamic time warping Hidden Markov model Edit distance Total correlation Newey–West estimator Prais–Winsten transformation Data as vectors in a metrizable space Minkowski distance Mahalanobis distance Data as time series with envelopes Global standard deviation Local standard deviation Windowed standard deviation Data interpreted as stochastic series Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient Spearman's rank correlation coefficient Data interpreted as a probability distribution function Kolmogorov–Smirnov test Cramér–von Mises criterion Visualization Time series can be visualized with two categories of chart: Overlapping Charts and Separated Charts. Overlapping Charts display all-time series on the same layout while Separated Charts presents them on different layouts (but aligned for comparison purpose) Overlapping charts Braided graphs Line charts Slope graphs GapChart Separated charts Horizon graphs Reduced line chart (small mult
