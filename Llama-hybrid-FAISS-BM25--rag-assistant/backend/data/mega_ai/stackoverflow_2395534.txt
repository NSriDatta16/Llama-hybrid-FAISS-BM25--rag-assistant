In general, the Visual Studio debugger doesn't slow things down. This must be something specific to your application. For instance, there's a recent question on SO from someone who is getting an OutOfMemoryException when debugging but not when running outside the debugger. It appears this is due to the way he's allocating memory - the technique is sensitive to the number of assemblies loaded into memory. Most programs would not be sensitive to this passive effect of the debugger. Maybe you also are suffering from some effect related to the debugger, yet not completely the debugger's "fault". Mitch Wheat suggested you might be running a virus scanner. That reminded me of a similar piece of software that took it upon itself to pay attention to Visual Studio loading and unloading assemblies. This was a piece of VPN software that provided "endpoint security". It was meant to check what programs you were running while connected to the VPN and to make sure they met the security policy. This meant being informed of every assembly that loaded. Visual Studio loads and unloads a lot of assemblies. This VPN software was so interested in that fact that it actually caused a BSOD - the only time I've seen an application cause a BSOD - because it installed a file system filter or some such, and was being notified in Kernel mode. That plus a bug of some sort was enough to bring the system down. So, in general, look for some piece of software that cares what's running on your computer. Maybe "endpoint security", maybe a virus scanner, maybe a search indexer, or whatever.
