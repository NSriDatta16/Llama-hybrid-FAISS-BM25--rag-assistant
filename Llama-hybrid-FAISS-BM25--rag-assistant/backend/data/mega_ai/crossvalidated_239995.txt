Understanding how to get inverse logit?

I was watching a youtube tutorial that looked at logistic regression. To illustrate this they showed a graph that plotted p on the y-axis, where they used the inverse of logit(p). Can anyone help me understand the algebra behind how they got from logit to inverse logit as below? Finding it quite frustrating to just see a black box output like this!
