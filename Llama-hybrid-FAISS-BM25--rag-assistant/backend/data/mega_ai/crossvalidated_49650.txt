You might start by looking at Elo rating systems used in Chess. (chess.com or letsplaychess.com have introductory articles about such systems, which began in chess but have spread to other contexts). Glickman has a lot of writing about other schemes, such as the Glicko system (Glickman's a math guy, so he likely has the technical depth you are looking for). You want to pay particular attention to how such systems handle startup conditions, because in your sports situations you never really get out of startup (except perhaps by the end of the season in baseball). There may be other answers here in the literature of paired comparisons. What you have isn't so much a time series as a sequence of paired comparisons.
