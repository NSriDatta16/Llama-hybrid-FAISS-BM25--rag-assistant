How to decide if to do dimensionality reduction before clustering?

Is there any agreement on when to reduce data dimension before clustering in order to avoid curse of dimensionality? My intuition is that if I have say 1000 points and data dimension is 10 then it is OK to cluster. But if dimension is 50 then it is not OK because data points become sparse and hard to cluster (as a result expect to obtain "too much" clusters).
