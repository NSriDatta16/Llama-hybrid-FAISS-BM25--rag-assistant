Desktop SPARQL client for Jena (TDB)?

I'm working on an app that uses Jena for storage (with the TDB backend). I'm looking for something like the equivalent of Squirrel, that lets me see what's being stored, run queries etc. This seems like an obvious thing to need, but my (perhaps badly phrased) google queries aren't turning up anything promising. Any suggestions, please? I'm on XP. Even a command line tool would be helpful.
