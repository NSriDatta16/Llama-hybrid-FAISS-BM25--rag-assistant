Javascript - Applying class to an HTML tag given an attribute/value

I am trying to apply styles to HTML tags dynamically by reading in the value of certain HTML attributes and applying a class name based on their values. For instance, if I have: I want to apply a class="h30" to that paragraph so that I can style it in my style sheet. I can't find any information on getting the value of an attribute that is not an id or class . Help?
