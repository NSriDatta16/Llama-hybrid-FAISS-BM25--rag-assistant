I really like A Guide to Econometrics by Peter Kennedy . Each topic starts with a simple explanation, usually with diagrams, followed by technical notes with some math and references. Most of the book is structured around dealing with violations of the classical linear regressions model, such as endogeneity or time series. At a higher level, and focused on micro topics, is Cameron and Trivedi's Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications , aimed at the applied researcher. It contains some Stata examples. The first is a medium-length book, the second is a much longer one. Neither one contains too many proofs.
