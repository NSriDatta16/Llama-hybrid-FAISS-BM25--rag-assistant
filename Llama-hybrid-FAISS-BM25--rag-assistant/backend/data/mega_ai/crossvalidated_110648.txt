Motivating likelihood ratio test vs Wald test for paper reviewer

I've got back reviews for a paper I've submitted, with the following problem. I have two logistic regression models, say y ~ A, and y ~ A + B, where B is a factor with several levels. I have performed a likelihood ratio test between them, and it is highly significant. My goal is to show that B has some independent information about the response and thus improves model fit "signficantly" (loaded term) above and beyond A, and I think the LRT shows this very strongly. The reviewer is not happy with this, they suggest using a different approach of comparing the "change of significance of B between two models": y ~ B vs y ~ A + B, which to me sounds like the Wald test for B in the A + B model, even though the reviewer doesn't realise it. Given that B has multiple levels and thus multiple Wald tests, it seems to me the LRT is more useful and more powerful (also no multiple testing issue). Am I right? Are there any nice (not too abstract) references I can use to back these claims?
