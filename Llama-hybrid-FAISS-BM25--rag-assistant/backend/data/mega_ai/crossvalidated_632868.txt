Is a Longitudinal Regression a type of Markov Chain?

I have always wondered about this point : Longitudinal Regression models for repeated measures essentially allow for previous response measurements for the same patient to influence future response measurements for the same patient. In a very naive sense, one could make the argument that Longitudinal Regression models the next observation based on some function of past measurements (correlation structure), thus giving it the illusion of a N-th order Markov Chain (i.e. most Markov Chains simply assume that the next state is only decided by the current state ... but Markov Chains can be constructed in which the next state is decided by the previous "n" states, i.e. N-th order). Therefore, could someone make the argument that a Longitudinal Regression Model is a Infinite State Markov Process? For some reason, I think the answer is "NO" because I have never heard the term "Memoryless Property" used in the same sentence as "Longitudinal Regression". In general, are there any statistical modelling frameworks which allow to use a Markov Regression (e.g. https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v038i08 ) but for a continuous variable instead of a discrete variable?
