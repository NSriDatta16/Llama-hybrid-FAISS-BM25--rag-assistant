The standard analysis would be some kind of linear regression. In this case, since your response variables are related but have different types, you'll get strongest results from a flexible multivariate generalized linear model. At this time, I only know of R packages for such analysis: mcglm for quasi-likelihood models and mcmcglm for a Bayesian approach. There might be others out there too. Note that the learning curve on both can be steep, especially if you don't already have a strong statistical background.
