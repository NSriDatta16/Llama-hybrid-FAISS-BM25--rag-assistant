Seems obvious to me :). In list comprehensions, the later lists can depend on the values generated in the earlier ones. The second function generates your set by calling the first when it adds a wumpus.. p 0 = [[]] p n = [[x,' ']:xs | x it isn't as clean as possible, but I always find list comprehensions bring an elegance to the problem :). Totally worth it.
