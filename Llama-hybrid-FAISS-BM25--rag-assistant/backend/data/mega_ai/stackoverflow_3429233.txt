There's no out-of-the-box support for serializing .NET forms and controls. Controls are not marked with the [Serializable] attribute. I think most of the difficulty revolves around .NET controls that are really wrappers of native Win32 controls. Persisting the native state as XML, it seems, would be infeasible. Perhaps someone has written a custom serializer; if not, you may need to roll your own. Edit: I found this discouraging accepted answer on experts exchange : You have to implement ISerializable or IXmlSerializable in order to do something like that (depending on how do you want to serialize the form). It's not trivial.
