Binding a variable binds it as data, specifically to prevent it from changing the syntax of the query. Furthermore, having a fixed syntax allows engines to analyze prepared queries once and then run them quickly for each set of values. I would encourage you not to build a hand-holding layer on top of SQL, but if you must, consider a preg_replace('/\W/', '', $field).
