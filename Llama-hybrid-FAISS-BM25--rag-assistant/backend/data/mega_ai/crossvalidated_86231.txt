I would like to illustrate an example as to modelling relating to cancer rate(As in Johnson and Albert 1999). It will touch first and third element of your interest. So the problem is predicting cancer rates in various cities. Say we have data of number of people in various cities $N_i$ and number of people who died with cancer $x_i$. Say we want to estimate cancer rates $\theta_i$. There are various ways to model them and as we see problems with each of them. We will see how heirachical bayes modelling can overcome some problem. 1. One way is to do estimation seperately but we will suffer from sparse data problem and would be an underestimate of the rates as for low $N_i$. 2. One more approach to manage the problem of sparse data would be to use same $\theta_i$ for all cities and tie the parameters but this is also a very strong assumption. 3. So what could be done is all $\theta_i$'s are similar in some way but also with city specific variations. So one could model in such a way that all $\theta_i$'s are drawn from a common distribution. Say $x_i \sim Bin(N_i,\theta_i)$ and $\theta_i \sim Beta(a,b) $ A full joint distribution would be then $p(D,\theta,\eta|N)= p(\eta)\prod_{i=1}^N Bin(x_i|N_i,\theta_i)Beta(\theta_i|\eta)$ where $\eta = (a,b)$. We need to infer $\eta$ from data. If it is clamped to a constant then information will not flow between $\theta_i$'s and they will be conditionally independent. But by treating $\eta$ as unknowns we allow cities with less data borrow statistical strength from cities with more data. The main idea is to more bayesian and setting priors on priors as to model uncertainty in hyperparameters. This allows flow of influence between $\theta_i$'s in this example.
