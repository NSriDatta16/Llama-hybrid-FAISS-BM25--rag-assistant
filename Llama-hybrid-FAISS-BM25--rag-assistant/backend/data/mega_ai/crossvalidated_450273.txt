Cannot use SVM with RBF Kernel

I'm new in R. I have an original dataset with 25771 variables and 118 samples. I already performed feature selection and split the dataset into 70 30 so i have 82 samples in my training data and 36 in my testing data. Then, I performed SMOTE resampling on my training data only and get a new dataset with 25771 features and 144 samples. By using the output of top features from feature selection result with varying number of features such as 10,20,30 until 100 have been undergoing the classifier package to perform SVM. I already performed SVM using linear and polynomial kernel and then compute the accuracy. I got 91.57% for SVM Linear using 100 features and 75% for SVM with polynomial kernel. But why it doesn't work with RBF kernel? I only get 20% of accuracy using RBF kernel. What should I do next to improve the accuracy of SVM using RBF kernel?
