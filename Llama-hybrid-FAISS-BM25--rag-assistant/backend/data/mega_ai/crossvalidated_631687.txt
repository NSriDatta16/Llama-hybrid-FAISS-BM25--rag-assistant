I have two books in my shelf that may fit here, to some extent. I don't want to imply by any means that they are the "best" or most essential ones, and they are probably not exactly what the question is asking for, but both have some relevant historical information and discussion of the matter. Alain Desrosieres: The Politics of Large Numbers: A History of Statistical Reasoning . Harvard University Press 2002. Lawrence Hubert, Howard Wainer: A Statistical Guide for the Ethically Perplexed . CRC/Chapman & Hall 2012. Here's a paper that seems to fit: Zyphur, M.J., Pierides, D.C. Statistics and Probability Have Always Been Value-Laden: An Historical Ontology of Quantitative Research Methods. J Bus Ethics 167, 1â€“18 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-019-04187-8 Also I read at some point Gigerenzer et al.s " The Empire of Chance ", but don't remember anymore how much on ethics there was in it. Or rather, it was less than I expected, but maybe still enough to be of interest.
