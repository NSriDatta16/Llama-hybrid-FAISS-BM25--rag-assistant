Most of these self-proclaimed data science tutorials on stock market price prediction are wrongly taught. I recently found this out using this video on youtube -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOcyV5Q2G5I . There are far more important variables that are needed to predict stock price than the previous price lol, for example - volume traded etc.
