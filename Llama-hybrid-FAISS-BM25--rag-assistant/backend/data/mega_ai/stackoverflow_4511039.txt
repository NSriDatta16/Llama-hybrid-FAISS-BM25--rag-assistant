Pretty typical Infragistics lossage. This can happen in general when any code is executed by the constructor that requires the Handle property to be valid. That causes the CreateHandle method to run, which in turn gets the Load event triggered. You didn't post a stack trace so there's no way to see what kind of code causes this to happen. I don't doubt it's Infragistics code. Get their latest updates, post to their support forum if you want their support. And try to move code from your Load event handler to the constructor, you only ever need Load if you have code that requires the form size to be known.
