Display a menu with categories, sub-categories and products - Magento

I have been looking to implement a menu system like the following I have 1 category, Cars, with 2 sub-categories, New and Used Iâ€™d like to display, on the drop down, the main category and then New, with all the products inside as a list and then Used, with all the products in a list. I have tried using the code in the link provided, but it seemed to include a rollover option, that expanded the menu and the products are not listed below the category. Thanks
