There is no closed-form formula for this equation. Basically, you can transform the equation: n log n = c log(n^n) = c n^n = exp(c) Then, this equation has a solution of the form: n = exp(W(c)) where W is Lambert W function (see especially "Example 2"). It was proved that W cannot be expressed using elementary operations. However, f(n)=n*log(n) is a monotonic function. You can simply use bisection (here in python): import math def nlogn(c): lower = 0.0 upper = 10e10 while True: middle = (lower+upper)/2 if lower == middle or middle == upper: return middle if middle*math.log(middle, 2) > c: upper = middle else: lower = middle
