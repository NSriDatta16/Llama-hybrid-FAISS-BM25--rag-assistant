Variable importance of Numerical features in Classification Model - Random Forest Classifier

I have few numeric features in my model. Out of 25 features, I have 7-8 numeric features in my model. One thing I observed is model gives more weightage to numerical feature compare to categorical features. Is it always behave the same way or it is because of the features? Should I convert those numeric features into categorical?
