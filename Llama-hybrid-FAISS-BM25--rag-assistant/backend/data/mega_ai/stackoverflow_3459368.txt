Can static combinable be used as a placeholder to thread_local?

C++0x adds a new storage specifier thread_local which is not yet implemented in VS10. However the Parallel Programming Library defines a Concurrency::combinable class which has a local() function which Returns a reference to the thread-private sub-computation . Are there semantics for thread_local that can't be (easily) covered by having a static variable of type combinable ? If not why was thread_local added to the core language if it can be implemented in a library?
