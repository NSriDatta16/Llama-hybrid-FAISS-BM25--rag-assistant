Rails 3 application settings

I need to keep application's settings editable by admin users through web form. I've found rails-settings gem to keep hash of simple string settings. But app settings need to keep not only string parameter but lists of another models (e.g. PaymentPeriods with name:string, etc). My question is: how to organize such app settings in the right way, so admin can have possibility to edit simple parameters and these lists. Thanks in advance. :)
