A Logical Data Diagram does not define actual data storage. It defines the Entities at a conceptual level. It's up to somebody else to figure out how to store those Logical Entities. ...so yes, an ERD would be acceptable. This kind of activity would start to bleed into Design if you began to specify actual storage requirements (which data belongs in which tables, data types, etc.) rather than just defining the Entities at the conceptual level.
