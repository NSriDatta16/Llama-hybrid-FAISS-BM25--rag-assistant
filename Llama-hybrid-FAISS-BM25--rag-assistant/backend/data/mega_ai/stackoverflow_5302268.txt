Rails model: declaratively expressing relation between attributes for presenting, computation and storage

Imagine the situation: In my rails model i use IceCube::Schedule to represent recurring calendar events pattern (e.g. "Every 2nd Monday of a month"). So i have 3 kinds of attributes in my model: for computation: schedule for storing: database column which stores schedule.to_yaml: schedule_yaml for presenting: set of attributes, that are used for input/output of schedule parameters: interval_unit, interval_amount, weekdays etc Depending on scenario, from one category of attributes computed the others: Process input: presenting attributes -> computing -> storage Processing invalid input: presenting -> validation Preparing input form: storage -> computing -> presenting Computing (next date in the sequence): storage -> computing -> storage All the parts of the system are no-brainer, except for computing. Though they may need quite a lot of code to implement the updating of the related attributes properly properly. Do you know some gem or at least some idioms to do that in an elegant way?
