Python's most efficient way to choose longest string in list?

I have a list of variable length and am trying to find a way to test if the list item currently being evaluated is the longest string contained in the list. And I am using Python 2.6.1 For example: mylist = ['abc','abcdef','abcd'] for each in mylist: if condition1: do_something() elif ___________________: #else if each is the longest string contained in mylist: do_something_else() Surely there's a simple list comprehension that's short and elegant that I'm overlooking?
