WCF WebService content type error in IIS

I have a WCF Webservice that returns a bank list from database, when I use IIS server I get the message " Cannot process the message because the content type 'text/xml; charset=utf-8' was not the expected type 'application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8'." . And when I use self hosting (application console) to run the WS, works without errors. PS: I'm calling the WS with PHP Soap. How is called: client = new SoapClient({WSDL URL HERE}, array("connection_timeout" => 60, "uri" => {SERVER}, "encoding" => "ISO-8859-1")); // With UTF-8 I get the same error. $this->result = $this->client->__soapCall({method}, array('parameters' => {array parameters})); ... ?> What can be?
