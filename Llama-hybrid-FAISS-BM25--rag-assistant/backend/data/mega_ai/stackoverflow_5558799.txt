I would be tempted to rescue the MissingTemplate in your application controller and log the Referrer header to see what's triggering this request. You never know, it might be some obscure part of your own app! If on the other hand you're confident this is being caused by a robot, have you considered adding the offending URL to your robots.txt file? For example: User-Agent: YandexImages Disallow: /your/failed/path Replacing 'your/failed/path' with the path that the robot is stumbling over. If the robot is struggling all over the place, you could just disallow access to the whole site for that particular robot: User-Agent: YandexImages Disallow: / I think this is a cleaner and lighter approach than implementing a handler specifically to suppress errors from a seemingly badly behaved bot.
