Every time you're doing a complex editing task, keep wondering if there is a more efficient way to do it. Most times, when it's something that you can describe in simple terms (like "swap paragraphs of text" or "delete everything after the X character in commented lines"), it's something you can do in just a couple of keystrokes in vim. There are some key features that are extremely useful, and you'll end using all the time. The ones I love the most are: Block selection (Ctrl-V) Macro recording (q) Virtual editing (:set ve=all) Regular expressions Piping to external Unix programs Key mappings Autocompletion (C-p, C-x C-p, C-x C-f) The operation+movement combination (this is amazingly powerful) Ask other programmers what features they find most useful and adopt the ones that fit better your brain. Steal ideas from other people's .vimrc s ( here's mine )
