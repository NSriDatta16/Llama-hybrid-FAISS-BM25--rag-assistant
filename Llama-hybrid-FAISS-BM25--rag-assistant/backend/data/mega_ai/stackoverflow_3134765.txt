In Visual Studio 2008, you can add the following line to parallelize any "for" loop. It even works with multiple nested for loops. Here is an example: #pragma omp parallel for private(i,j) for (i=0; i p[i].pbestFitness) { p[i].pbestFitness = p[i].fitness; for (j=0; j After we added the #pragma omp parallel, both cores on my Core 2 Duo were used to their maximum capacity, so total CPU usage went from 50% to 100%.
