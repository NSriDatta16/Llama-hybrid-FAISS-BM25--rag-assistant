Need advice on organizing two WPF applications within one Visual Studio solution

I have a WPF application (KaleidoscopeApplication) organized as follows: Solution (6 projects) Cryptography (DLL) Rfid (DLL) KaleidoscopeApplication (buildable "startup project") Basically, KaleidoscopeApplication contains a bunch of resources (sounds, images, etc) and your standard WPF junk (App.xaml, App.xaml.cs, other xaml and code). I need to create a new application that is very similar to Kaleidoscope, but I'm not sure of the best way to organize. This new app will need access to much of the same code and resources as Kaleidoscope. Preferably, I would like to create a new project in the solution, then simply use the "set as startup project" to pick which app I want to build. However, will I be able to access (share) the Resources folder of Kaleidoscope? I know I will be able to access much of the code if I simply add a reference to the project and include a "using Kaleidoscope". But the resources I'm not so sure about. Is this the right way to organize or am I asking for trouble in the future? Thanks in advance!
