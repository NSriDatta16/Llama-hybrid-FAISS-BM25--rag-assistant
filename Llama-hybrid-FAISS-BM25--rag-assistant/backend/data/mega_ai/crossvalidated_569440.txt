I think your first approach is on the right track. There are two changes: The distribution means are slightly different for class 0 and class 1, therefore, we need to generate them separately. Instead of re-sampling from the dataset, we can generate the training set (n = 100) and test set (n = 1000 or a large number you like) separately because we know the underlying distributions in this case. The codes below should give you an average mse = 0.164075. library(MASS) library(e1071) set.seed(123) # custom function to quickly generate dataset create_dataset
