MDPs are generally analyzed in discrete time, so basically time evolves in discrete steps. Think of it like the distinct ticks of a clock -- each of these corresponds to a timestep. In an MDP, an action as taken at each timestep. In the algorithm you posted, where do you see anything about repeating until convergence? Usually in deep q-learning a single (or fixed amount) gradient step is carried out at each timestep.
