The various dimensions ending in width are part of Latex and not primitives of the underlying Tex engine, unlike \hsize which is the Tex primitive described in Alexey's answer. \textwidth usually does not change while a Latex document is being typeset, and should normally be the width of the bounding box in which all the text inside paragraphs sit in; this will usually be the same as \hsize . \linewidth is a contextual dimension that becomes narrower in environments with indentation, such as list environments. It should be the actual width of the current paragraph and should be less than or equal to \textwidth . \pagewidth should be the width of the whole page, including margins: this should normally be larger than \textwidth . But of course with macro hackery, you can break any rule you feel like.
