Allowing access to Azure Storage nodes to select users?

Given a stored file on Azure Storage (blobs, tables or queues -- doesn't matter), is it possible to allow access to it for all, but only based on permissions? For example, I have a big storage of images, and a DB containing users and authorizations. I want user X to only be able to access images Y and Z. So, the URL will be generally inaccessible, unless you provide some sort of a temporary security token along with it. How's that possible? I know I can shut the storage from the outside world, and allow access to it only through an application checking this stuff, but this would require the application to be on Azure as well, and on-premise app won't be able to deliver any content from Azure Storage. It is from my understanding that most CDNs provide such capability, and I sure hope so Azure provides a solution for this as well! Itamar.
