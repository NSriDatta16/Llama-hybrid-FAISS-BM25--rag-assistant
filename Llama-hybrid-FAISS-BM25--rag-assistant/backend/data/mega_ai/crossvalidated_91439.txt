I guess that you did not mean that each location belongs to the three counties, so location in your database should be (1:30) and not rep(1:10, 3) . If true, then you only have one measurement per location. Then, your design as given only has one factor of interest (fixed factor county ) and it can be solved with a one -way three-level ANOVA. Though you actually measured lenghts from wings from birds, your samples here are the locations ("random", as samples are), of which you happened to measure ten in each county. However, I will follow as if you really meant to have several measured birds in each location. Then, if I understand correctly, you consider that wing lenghts from birds captured in the same location are related by some (unknown) factor affecting their wing size (e.g., same parents, same resources). And you are not interested in that but on evaluating differences in average wing length among (only those) three counties (your fixed factor). So birds from the same location are considered not independent samples (of wing length) or pseudo-replicates (for that hypothesis of yours). If above is OK, then location is a random factor nested in county . I call that a nested design, with some samples per location and ten locations per county. A proper analysis is that which considers that you only have ten independent locations to evaluate county differences and not N independent samples of wing length. For the analysis I would use: With lme4 package: lmer(wing.length ~ county + (1|location), data=df) With nlme package: lme(fixed = wing.length ~ county, random = ~1 | location, data = df) or, if under assumptions (balanced, normal errors, you know...), you can simply go to a nested ANOVA: aov(wing.length ~ county + Error(location), data=df)
