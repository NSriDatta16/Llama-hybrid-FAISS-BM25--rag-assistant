Organising project dependencies

I'm with a fairly large team and we are running into problem with the other libraries we depend on, and getting the same project files to work for every one. The problem is that many people have more than one version of the same library (eg the project users boost 1.36, and I use boost 1.39 for some of my other stuff), and every developer has these in different places (eg I use C:\lib\c++\boost_1_36). As a result right now all the developers have to add a fairly large number of entries to each projects "Additional Include Directories", and "Additional Library Directories", which is a pain, especially with trying to get new members set up correctly (eg making sure the correct static/dynamic dependencies are linked for each configuration, which is made worse by most libraries using a common name for all the .lib and .dll files, rather than say like how boost does it with the file name reflecting the configuration and auto-linking). I was thinking of making use of the macros in the project properties, with things like "$(MYSQL_HOME)\lib\opt" in the "Additional Include Directories", however I cant see a way to define my own ones (like MYSQL_HOME))
