A time series is simple a sequence of data points spaced out over time, usually with regular time intervals. A longitudinal design is rather more specific, keeping the same sample for each observation over time. An example of a time series might be unemployment measured every month using a labour force survey with a new sample each time; this would be a sequence of cross-sectional designs. But it could be anything such as your personal savings each year, which would also be longitudinal. Or it might simply follow a particular cohort of people growing older, such as the television documentary Seven Up! and the sequels every seven years after that - the latest was 49 Up in 2005, so there should be another edition next year. Longitudinal designs tend to tell you more about ways in which typical individuals change over time, but might (depending on the details of the design and whether the sample is refreshed) say less about how the population as a whole changes.
