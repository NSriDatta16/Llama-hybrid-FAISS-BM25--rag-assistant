Many forms of clustering could work. Since you asked about constructing a dendrogram, it sounds like you want hierarchical clustering . Hierarchical agglomerative clustering is a popular class of methods. You'll have to choose the linkage function, which determines how clusters are merged. UPGMA (aka average linkage) is one example. A good discussion on this topic is available here . For distance/dissimilarity-based clustering (including hierarchical clustering), you would need a distance measure that works for binary data. The Hamming distance is one example. The Hamming distance between two binary vectors is the number of elements that are not equal. In your example, the Hamming distance between two diseases would be the number of patients that are positive for one disease but not the other.
