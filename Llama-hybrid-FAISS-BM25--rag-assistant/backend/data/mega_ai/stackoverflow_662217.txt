How can I access a data from another object in JavaScript?

I want to access availJobs in jobs.scan object but I couldn't. It is not defined in jobs.attack . What can I do to access the part of jobs.scan in other objects? var jobs = new Array(); jobs.scan = function() { var availJobs = new Array(); var jobContents = dom.get("app8743457343_content"); var boldthreads = jobContents.getElementsByTagName('b'); for(var i = 0; i availJobs[0] in jobs.attack doesn't work. It's undefined . How can I set the availJobs as public and can be accessed in other objects? Thanks for all the help!! Here's the code that I put: var jobs = { availJobs: new Array(), scan: function() { var jobContents = dom.get("app8743457343_content"); var boldthreads = jobContents.getElementsByTagName('b'); for(var i = 0; i This code is definitely more elegant don't you think? I used this and it worked!
