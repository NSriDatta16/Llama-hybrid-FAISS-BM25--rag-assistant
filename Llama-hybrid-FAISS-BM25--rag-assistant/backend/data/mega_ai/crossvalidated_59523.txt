As no one has pointed it yet, I thought I would share this. There is a method called X-means, ( see this link ) which estimates proper number of clusters using Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Essentially, this would be like trying K means with different Ks, calculating BIC for each K and choosing the best K. This algorithm does that efficiently. There is also a weka implementation, details of which can be found here .
