Is it possible with concatinated data-SMS in Android?

Is the functionality for fragmentation and reassembling concatenated SMS messages built in for the sendsendDataMessage() and the sendTextMessage() ? In other words; If I put a arraybyte over 200 bytes as input to the sendDataMessage, will it be fragmented and reassembled automatically, so the getUserData() will give the same 200 bytes?
