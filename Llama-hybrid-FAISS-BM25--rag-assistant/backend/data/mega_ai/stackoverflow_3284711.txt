Edit: You may want to look at this previous question. - "I want to create a Delicious bookmarklet in Firefox that bookmarks the current page with a predefined tag." Well, an example that does exactly what you want by using a bookmarklet in your browser's toolbar is the delicious bookmarklet. It gather information from the page, displays the info in a popup, allowing you to edit it, and then stores it to your account: http://delicious.com/help/bookmarklets javascript:(function(){ f= 'http://delicious.com/save?url=' + encodeURIComponent(window.location.href) + '&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title) + '&v=5&'; a=function(){ if( !window.open( f + 'noui=1&jump=doclose', 'deliciousuiv5', 'location=yes, links=no,scrollbars=no, toolbar=no,width=550,height=550'))location.href=f + 'jump=yes' }; if(/Firefox/.test(navigator.userAgent)){ setTimeout(a,0) } else { a() } })() If you use your Yahoo ID to log in, you do have to use OAuth, but if you don't, you can use the V1 api like this (from this page , worked for me in Chrome): javascript:( function() { location.href = 'https://user:pwd@api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/add?url=' + encodeURIComponent(window.location.href) + '&description=' + encodeURIComponent(document.title) + '&tags=obvioustesttag'; } )() Make sure to search your tags for "obvioustesttag" since it doesn't show up in the chronological list immediately. Try to create a regular login or new account if you currently use YahooID to sign in, otherwise, you'll have to deal with OAuth.
