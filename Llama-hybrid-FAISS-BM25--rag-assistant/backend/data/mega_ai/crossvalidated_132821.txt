Help with cluster analysis. Is this possible?

I'm working with the productivity of various government documents. In my data I have two variables (annual frequency and time of resolution) and each document gets its position in a Cartesian plane derived from these two variables (frequency on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis). Now, I define that there are 4 possible groups (or clusters) knowing that the minimum frecuency and time are both 1: -One group of "Productive and irrelevant" documents with a frequency higher than 1 but lower than the average frequency and a time higher than 1 but lower than the average time. -One group of "Unproductive and irrelevant" documents with a frequency higher than 1 but lower than the average frequency and a time higher than the average time. -One group of "Productive and relevant" documents with a frequency higher than the average frequency and a time higher than 1 but lower than the average time. -And finally a group of "Unproductive and relevant" documents with a frequency higher than the average frequency and a time higher than the average time. There is I way with the cluster analysis, or with another approach or tool, in Stata, SPSS or R where my clusters can be made? Furthermore, there is a way through I can see what are the minimum changes that an observation must do in its variables to 'migrate' from one cluster to another? Any idea? Notes: All my variables are discrete. My complete data set is of 1800 observations.
