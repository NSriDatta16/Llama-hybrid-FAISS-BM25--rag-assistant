The CLT is a statement about fluctuations of averages. Specifically, a single sample of size $n$ will give you an expression: $$\mu_n:=\frac{X_1+\cdots+X_n}{n},$$ which gives you an estimate of the true mean (average). Here $\mu_n$ is a random variable, with some complicated distribution. The CLT states that as $n$ gets larger, $\mu_n$ will be closer and closer to the true mean $\mu$, with fluctuations that look like a normal distribution, centered on the mean with variance $\sigma^2/n$. Said another way, $\mu_n$ is approximately distributed like $N(\mu,\sigma^2/n)$. In other words, if you were to repeat your sampling a bunch of times, and plot a histogram of the $\mu_n$'s that you drew each time, you'd get something that looks like a normal distribution with the above parameters. Thus it makes perfect sense to ask questions like: what is the probability that $\mu_n>2$? In this case we'd use the CLT to approximate the distribution of $\mu_n$ as a normal distribution. This means that you could numerically verify the CLT by repeatedly drawing samples of size $n$ and computing $\mu_n$, thereby plotting a histogram and calculating probabilities from it.
