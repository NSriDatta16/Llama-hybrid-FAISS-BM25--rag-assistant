Are normal prior and posterior random variables dependent?

Consider the usual normal Bayesian model. The prior $X=\mu_0+\sigma_0\epsilon_0$, where $\epsilon_0$ follows a standard normal distribution. The data $Y=X+\sigma_1\epsilon_1$, where $\epsilon_1$ follows a standard normal distribution. We know that the posterior $(X|Y=y)$ is in the format of $a\mu_0+(1-a)y+b\epsilon_2$ for some $a$ and $b$, where $\epsilon_2$ follows a standard normal distribution. My question is: what is the relationship between $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_0$? Are they independent, or are they the same with probability one? All current books state that the distribution of $(X|Y=y)$ is $N(a\mu_0+(1-a)y,b)$. However, none of them discusses the relationship between $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_0$.
