The control market around web forms is quite a bit more mature than MVC so tools from companies like Telerik, Devexpress, Infragistics will have a more mature implementation and broader base of support. Most all of those will do the things you mentioned across major browsers. THAT SAID... Consider MVC, when you put an application into the field it will probably be there for many many years, regardless of what you may think; now there is a good chance it might still be used in 10 years so make a decision like this with an eye to the future. MVC and jQuery make a powerful combo that can afford you rich functionality often commensurate with what the third party control vendors put out. As far as design template, there are several sites like TemplateMonster which can give you a jump start.
