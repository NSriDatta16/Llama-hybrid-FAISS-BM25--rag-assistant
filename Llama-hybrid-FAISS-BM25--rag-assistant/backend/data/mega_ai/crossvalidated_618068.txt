Understanding a parameter in a bayesian Poisson model ($\beta$)

I would like to know the meaning or signification of the parameter $\beta$ in this Bayesian model. I have a Poisson model : $ s_{i} \mid \lambda_{i} \sim Poisson(\lambda_{i}t_{i})$ Where $\lambda_i\mid\beta\sim\mathcal{G}a(\lambda_i\mid 1.8,\beta)$ and $\beta\sim\mathcal{G}a(\beta\mid 0.01,1)$ I have as data the next table (which can be found in an article called Robust Empirical Bayes Analyses of Event Rates by O'Muircheartaigh & Gaver ): \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline system & fails (s_{i}) & time (t_{i}) & rates (r_{i} = \frac{s_{i}}{t_{i}}) \\ \hline 1&5&94.32&5.3\times 10^{-2}\\ 2&1&15.72&6.4\times 10^{-2}\\ 3&5&62.88&8.0\times 10^{-2}\\ 4&14&125.76&11.1\times 10^{-2}\\ 5&3&5.24&57.3\times 10^{-2}\\ 6&19&31.44&60.4\times 10^{-2}\\ 7&1&1.05&95.4\times 10^{-2}\\ 8&1&1.05&95.4\times 10^{-2}\\ 9&4&2.10&191\times 10^{-2}\\ 10&22&10.48&209.90\times 10^{-2}\\ \hline \end{array} I tought that it was a kind of priori knowledge but it seems an interpretation too much simplistic. Is something hide that I am not taking into account? Is something that is going to be revealed to me afterwards when I try to find the posterior distribution?
