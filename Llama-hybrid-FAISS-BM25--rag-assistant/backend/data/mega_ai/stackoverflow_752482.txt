Can I compile numpy & scipy as eggs for free on Windows32?

I've been asked to provide Numpy & Scipy as python egg files. Unfortunately Numpy and Scipy do not make official releases of their product in .egg form for a Win32 platform - that means if I want eggs then I have to compile them myself. At the moment my employer provides Visual Studio.Net 2003, which will compile no version of Numpy later than 1.1.1 - every version released subsequently cannot be compiled with VS2003. What I'd really like is some other compiler I can use, perhaps for free, but at a push as a free time-limited trial... I can use that to compile the eggs. Is anybody aware of another compiler that I can get and use without paying anything and will definitely compile Numpy on Windows? Please only suggest something if you know for a fact that that it will compile Numpy - no speculation! Thanks Notes: I work for an organization which is very sensitive about legal matters, so everything I do has to be totally legit. I've got to do everything according to licensed terms, and will be audited. My environment: Windows 32 Standard C Python 2.4.4
