automating of routine data collection tasks through fully automated, real‑time fusion of diverse sensor data streams for intelligence support. By automating routine exploitation workflows, Sentient allows personnel to focus on higher‑level analysis. It is designed to incorporate a range of intelligence sources, including international communications, historical intelligence archives, and reports from human operatives. Automated tools such as Sentient can boost "intelligence equities" in areas like oceanic shipping and sanctions busting by authoritarian states. Sentient improves situational awareness by using patterns in behavior and past intelligence to predict likely adversary actions. The system via anomaly‑detection and modeling can predict adversary behavior as part of real‑time automated analytics of the battlespace. Comparable systems—such as automatic target recognition (ATR)—can remove human bottlenecks in time‑sensitive analysis by forecasting future actions from past patterns. Sentient interprets incoming data in context and autonomously identifies future intelligence and collection requirements. In 2025, DNRO Christopher Scolese stated at an Intelligence and National Security Alliance and AFCEA International event that the agency aims to move from manually tasking individual satellites to AI-enabled constellations that can interpret plain-language user queries and autonomously coordinate sensors to deliver integrated intelligence reports. Features Sentient employs tipping and queueing—part of an AI‑driven orchestration layer—to dynamically retask reconnaissance satellites to observe specific targets. Tipping and queueing refers to the automated process of using information from one satellite, sensor, or data source to direct others to observe a specific area, enabling real-time tracking through coordinated handoffs between systems. Sentient hands off tracking duties across satellite constellations (collections of satellites) and associated Earth-based stations (surface listening and communications systems that receive data from the satellites). By 2024, the NRO had announced plans to field a mix of small and large reconnaissance satellites across orbital regimes—from low, medium and geosynchronous orbits—to increase how often any part of Earth can be observed and improve space‑based coverage of high‑value targets. Fusing the diverse information and data sourced from its constellation—spanning orbital imagery, signal intercepts, and other feeds, Sentient builds a unified, actionable common operational picture. In that fused big picture, Sentient applies algorithms to spot unexpected or non-traditional observables that human analysts may miss. Using forecasting models to predict adversary courses of action—from force movements to emerging threats—Sentient then adjusts satellite retasking in near real‑time. The cycle requires minimal human intervention and intelligence analysts are freed to focus on interpretation and decision‑making rather than data wrangling and sifting. A declassified 2019 NRO document shows Sentient collects complex information buried in noisy data and extracts the relevant pieces, freeing analysts to refocus on situational understanding via predictive analytics and automated tasking. The NRO fielded CubeSats—small, cube‑form satellites—to validate resilient, distributed remote sensing. It also prioritized on-demand wide-area monitoring via new phenomenological models to detect and geolocate targets, enhanced collection against weak signals and low-reflectance objects in dense clutter and co-channel interference environments, and advanced phased array technologies to improve overall performance. The NRO's Aerospace Data Facilities (ADF)—Colorado, East, and Southwest—provide ground support for intelligence collection. Data sources Andrew Krepinevich details the commercial providers contracted to fuel Sentient's analytics—namely Maxar Technologies, Planet, and BlackSky. Maxar has claimed it "provides
