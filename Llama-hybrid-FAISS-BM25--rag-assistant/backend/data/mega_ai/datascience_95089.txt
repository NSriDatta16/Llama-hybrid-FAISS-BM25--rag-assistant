Assuming independence between 2 samples from the same subject

I have a question regarding a clinical experiment that I'm handling. I'm using a deep learning framework to classify activity based on some physiological data. Some of the subjects in the experiment attended multiple experimental sessions. However, these sessions are several months apart. At first, I pooled the data per-subject, regardless of time. However, some physiological parameters can change over several months, e.g., individuals losing/gaining weight, taking up smoking etc. Therefore, given the above, how would it be wrong to regard these each session as a separate subject, or should I stick with pooling them per-subject? Thanks!
