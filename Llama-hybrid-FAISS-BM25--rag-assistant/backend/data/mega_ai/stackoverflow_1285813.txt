Access 2007, VBA, a tiny project for a school, and the Trust Center

A friend asked for my help putting together an Access database for a small department at a university. It tracks medical info on some animals. The problem is that to make the application easy enough to use, we had to write some VBA code to glue different forms together. When we open the database (or a new, updated version of the database), we get the little VBA Macro Trust thingie, and we're having a hard time figuring out how to get rid of that warning. I'm an open-source developer and my organization's sysadmin, so it's usually not a problem for me to sign rpm packages with the CA Cert I maintain... My friend's department uses Windows PCs with Novell, but their computer support department has stated that they don't provide any support for user-created applications (i.e. providing a certificate signed by the departmental CA) nor will they provide administrator access to the computers so that we can change the trust settings. They also don't have the skills or expertise to code the application for the users. (Thanks, chaps, mighty helpful.) Additionally, in our entire University, users are explicitly instructed not to ever, ever click a 'yes, I trust this' button. Re-educating users for the sake of this little access database that she's put together is a problem, since about 20 people will be using it to look up information. Since I'm helping her, my inclination would be to do it in C# with a embedded database file stored on a shared drive, but that also falls under "user created applications" and I wouldn't be able to run an installer since no one has administrative rights. Is there any way to work around the need to bypass the trust setting for macros every time someone opens this file? I thought that if we didn't use macros at all and just used VBA it would work, but that's apparently not the case.
