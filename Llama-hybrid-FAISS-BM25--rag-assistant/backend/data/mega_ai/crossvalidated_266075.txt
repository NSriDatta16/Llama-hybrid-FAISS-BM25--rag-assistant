What is the difference between patch-wise training and fully convolutional training in FCNs?

In the paper of fully convolutional neural network , the authors mention both patch wise training and fully convolutional training. My understanding for the training set construction is as follows: Given an M*M image, extract sub-images with N*N , where ( N ). The selected sub-images are overlapped with eath other. For each batch in the training process, it can include all the sub-images for a given image or multiple images. Is my understanding correct? Then what are the difference between patch-wise training and fully convolutional training? I include the related section as a reference.
