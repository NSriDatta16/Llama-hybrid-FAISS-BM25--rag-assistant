Plone 4.0.4 and Postgresql Encoding

Im using Plone 4.0.4, Postgresql 9.0.3 and RelStorage 1.5.0b2. Currently Im using "da_DK.ISO8859-1" encoding in PostgreSQL - would "da_DK.UTF-8" be better since Plone is using UTF-8 internally? PS both "Encoding, Collation and Ctype" are set in Postgresql. Thanks. Nikolaj G.
