I found that there was a correlation of -0.5109730443013045 between the number drawn and its frequency, and a p-value of 0.090274 for that correlation. For a binomial test for a number being odd or even, I got a p-value of 0.00621804354. When I adjusted the odd numbers for the difference in means (that is, added (even mean-odd mean) to the frequencies of odd numbers), I found a correlation of -0.753098254512706 for the numbers versus frequencies, for a p-value of 0.0047. As other answers have discussed, this is HARKing (hypothesizing after the results are known). There are lots of different patterns you could have noticed, so given any alpha, the probability that at least one has a p-value less than alpha is significantly greater than the probability for each one individually. Besides the possibility of cherry-picking the hypothesis to fit the data, there is the possibility of cherry-picking the data: if you see lots of lotteries, and only discuss the ones with unusual results, or you stop collecting data from a lottery once that data seems anomalous, and don't continue collecting data to see whether it reverts to the mean, the apparent p-value can misrepresent the true improbability of the results. 0.090274 is a large p-value in general, and in the context of HARKing, it's well within the range of what we could expect by chance. It's enough to draw attention to it, but not enough to come to a solid conclusion. 0.00621804354, on the other hand, is quite small. With it being less that one-eighth of the standard alpha of 0.05, a relevant question to ask is "Are there eight other hypotheses that would be as, or more, noticeable?" It's on the borderline (and keep in mind that you need to account for the bias that the pattern that you actually say feels more salient than ones that you didn't see). When you add in the fact that there are surely more than 161 lotteries, seeing a p-value of 1/161 hardly eliminates the possibility that this is due to just chance. The p-value of 0.0047, or 1/213, for the adjusted correlation is a bit lower, but it's also more contrived, so we need to adjust our "How many hypotheses are there that would be as, or more, noticeable?" number upwards. So it's enough that it would be understandable to investigate whether there's something causing a bias, but there's no way to know without empirical investigation, and sometimes things happen just by chance. That's the whole point of a lottery, after all. If you were to win a lottery, you probably wouldn't say "The p-value of me winning is less than 0.05, so obviously the lottery's rigged."
