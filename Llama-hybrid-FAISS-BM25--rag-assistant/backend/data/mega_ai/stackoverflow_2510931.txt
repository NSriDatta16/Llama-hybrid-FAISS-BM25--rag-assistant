There is a defined order how to specify the character encoding in HTML : [â€¦] conforming user agents must observe the following priorities when determining a document's character encoding (from highest priority to lowest): An HTTP "charset" parameter in a "Content-Type" field. A META declaration with "http-equiv" set to "Content-Type" and a value set for "charset". The charset attribute set on an element that designates an external resource. If no character encoding declaration is present, HTTP defines ISO 8859-1 as default character encoding . You can either use that as default character encoding for HTML too or simply refuse to process the response. For XHTML you additionally have the XML declaration as source for the encoding : In an XML document, the character encoding of the document is specified on the XML declaration (e.g., ). In order to portably present documents with specific character encodings, the best approach is to ensure that the web server provides the correct headers. If this is not possible, a document that wants to set its character encoding explicitly must include both the XML declaration an encoding declaration and a meta http-equiv statement (e.g., ). In XHTML-conforming user agents, the value of the encoding declaration of the XML declaration takes precedence. If no character encoding declaration, XML defines UTF-8 and UTF-16 as default character encoding : Unless an encoding is determined by a higher-level protocol, it is also a fatal error if an XML entity contains no encoding declaration and its content is not legal UTF-8 or UTF-16. So, to sum up, the order is: An HTTP "charset" parameter in a "Content-Type" field. XML declaration with encoding attribute. A META declaration with "http-equiv" set to "Content-Type" and a value set for "charset". If no character encoding declaration is present, you may assume ISO 8859-1 as default encoding for HTML and must assume UTF-8 or UTF-16 as default encoding for XHTML.
