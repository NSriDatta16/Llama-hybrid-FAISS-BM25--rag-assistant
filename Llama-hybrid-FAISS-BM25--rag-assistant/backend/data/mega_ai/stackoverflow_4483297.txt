The original I need to find the p tags and if the text contains "MY_IDENTIFIER" then do some manipulations with that text and replace the text with some text. Here I know how to find the paragraph tags with text using regex. I can loop the matches and can do manipulations with the text as required. I would like to know how to replace the matched item with another text. In the above example, I have "MY_IDENTIFIER" on 2nd, 6th, 9th and 10th paragraphs. Let's say i would like to replace the 2nd paragraph text as 2nd paragraph text and 6th paragraph text as 6th paragraph text and so on... The code I have so far ... Imports System.Text.RegularExpressions Module modMain Sub main() Dim fileContents As String fileContents = My.Computer.FileSystem.ReadAllText("C:\temp\a.html") Dim paras As MatchCollection = Regex.Matches(fileContents, " (.+?MY_IDENTIFIER.+?) ") Dim TxtFound As String For Each oMatch As Match In paras TxtFound = oMatch.Groups(1).Value 'do some manipulations with txtfound '... 'replace the txtfound with some other text Next 'Save the file again End Sub End module Any help appreciated.
