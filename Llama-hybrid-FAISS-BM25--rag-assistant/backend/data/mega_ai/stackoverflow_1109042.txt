8.3 introduced this change: (From the commit log on the wiki ) 2007-06-03 13:05 tgl Create a GUC parameter temp_tablespaces that allows selection of the tablespace(s) in which to store temp tables and temporary files. This is a list to allow spreading the load across multiple tablespaces (a random list element is chosen each time a temp object is to be created). Temp files are not stored in per-database pgsql_tmp/ directories anymore, but per-tablespace directories. Release notes give credit to "Jaime Casanova, Albert Cervera, Bernd Helmle" There is a report to the pgsql-performance list that might be related. The original poster identified that changing their kernel at the same time was more likely the cause , however a post from Tom Lane includes: "So I suspect that the slowdown you saw comes from making a larger number of catalog updates in 8.3;" Your comment that the 8.2 config was copied for 8.3... the default autovacuum setting changed from off to on. Maybe your temp tables were being vacuumed in 8.3 but not in 8.2?
