Color cells in WPF DataGrid dynamically

I populate the contents of a WPF DataGrid with dynamic data that is the result of a search. Now I would like to highlight those cells of the DataGrid, that contain data which was matched during the search. Some hints about how this could be achieved are given here . Is there more elegant solution to this problem?
