Using Pandas to_numeric() in Azure Machine Learning Studio

I am facing an issue that Azure Machine Learning Studio fails to find the to_numeric method in pandas. After reading a .csv in AMLS I try to process it in a python script. The line that is throwing me an error is: dataframe1['Monthly Debt'] = pd.to_numeric(dataframe1['Monthly Debt']) pd of course is pandas, dataframe1 is my working dataframe. The error thrown is: AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'to_numeric' Of course everything works on my local python. Do you have any idea what AMLS might be talking about?
