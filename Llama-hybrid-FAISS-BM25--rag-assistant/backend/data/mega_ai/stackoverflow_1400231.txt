I've used DayPilot Pro in the past - and it did a decent job. I think we had originally started out with the Lite version - but at some point needed to upgrade to the Pro version to pick up a feature that we needed. It's not as pretty as some of the other scheduling controls (Infragistics, Telerik, etc) - but it did the job well enough for the price. If given another project that did scheduling, I wouldn't have a problem using this again.
