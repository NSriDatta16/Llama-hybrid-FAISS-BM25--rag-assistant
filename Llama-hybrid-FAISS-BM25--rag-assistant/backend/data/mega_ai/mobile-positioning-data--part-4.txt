isualised in a real-time environment. Disadvantages of mobile positioning data Mobile positioning data has also some weaknesses, such as the fact that even this data will not represent the total population since there are also people without mobile phones (young children, the elderly, certain socio-economic groups). In addition, the usage habits of mobile phone users can be very different, which, in the end, influences the resulting dataset. Furthermore, when using passive mobile positioning data, there is no information regarding the background of the users: their characteristics, socio-economic indicators, purpose of the trip, type of accommodation and means of transport used etc. More detailed information on these characteristics can be gathered with additional questionnaires in the case of active mobile positioning data, the collection of which generally requires special permissions (consent from people being positioned) anyway. However, the obligation of asking for permission means that the sample of actively positioned people is usually small. The spatial accuracy of passive mobile positioning depends on the geographical division of the mobile network, which is not equally distributed in space. This means that passive mobile positioning is spatially more precise in densely populated urban areas and near highways due to a larger number of cell towers, but in the countryside, for example, the accuracy is lower. Moreover, the accuracy of passive mobile positioning is limited to the coverage area of network cells, which can range from a few hundred metres to multiple kilometres. Privacy concerns Mobile positioning technology in general might create fears that people's locations and activities are being monitored from away. Many of the concerns related to positioning data are in the privacy and surveillance fields and those issues need to be addressed and discussed very carefully. In the field of MPD, many different measures are in place to safeguard users' privacy, such as data pseduonymisation/anonymisation, whereby a subscriber's personal identity code can be modified or data can be aggregated to give anonymity to the subjects. Alongside that, sampling (decreasing the possibility for a person to be included in a dataset) and obfuscation (masking or hiding original data) could be used as alternatives or employed for further increasing the level of privacy protection. == References ==
