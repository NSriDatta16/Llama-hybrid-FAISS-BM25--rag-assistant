Compare Multiple Time Series in Matlab

I have a multi-variate time series which represent the heading (-2*PI - +2*PI) of a set of virtual agents over time. What I would like to have is some form of correlation function which describes the relationship among the variation of heading of agents over time, so that given another multi-variate time series of another set of agents, I can state whether their motion pattern was similar to the 1st set or not. I'm working with Matlab and read about cross-correlation, cross-variance, but with my limited knowledge in statistics I'm still unable to determine how I could come up with somekind of a function which maps to the given graph. I would appreciate any guidance to direct me in the correct path. Edit: Both sets of agents that I talk about here are equal in number, and all environmental conditions are the same, except that the two sets have two different motion patterns.
