Should the repository be able to throw exceptions or should I keep it dumb? Yes - the repository should be able to throw exceptions. Keeping something 'dumb' doesn't mean it's not comletely self-aware :) The caveat that 'exceptions should be exceptional' still applies - you might find this " Creating More Exceptional Exceptions " article of interest and it's also of relevance to your question. If I chose to throw exceptions from it, should the service layer then catch it and throw an exception with a more friendly message before it goes to the Controller? Generally, I've not re-thrown exceptions although there's merit in doing that. A pragmatic half-way-house would be to do that for exception types which you want to handle gracefully for some reason. If you're using something like the Ms Ent Libs Application Logging Block you can set a policy (via config) that allows you to control what happens when exceptions occur - re-throwing them or otherwise; so that would be a useful approach to stop hard-coding yourself into a specific result. Also this might be of interest: Are exceptions really for exceptional errors?
