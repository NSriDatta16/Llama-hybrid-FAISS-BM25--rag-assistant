The distribution you are describing is a mixture of Bernoulli distributions with the likelihood function $$ p(\delta|\rho,\beta_0,\beta_1) = \rho \, \beta_0^{\delta} (1-\beta_0)^{1-\delta} + (1 - \rho) \, \beta_1^{\delta} (1-\beta_1)^{1-\delta} $$ It does not have a closed-form solution, you need to use an optimization algorithm like E-M for maximum a posteriori solution, MCMC for Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior, or other approach.
