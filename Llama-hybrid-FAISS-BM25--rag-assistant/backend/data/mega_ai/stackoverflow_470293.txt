If you're willing to use trunk, you can take advantage of the brand new annotate() QuerySet method added just a week or so ago, which solves this exact problem: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/aggregation/ If you want to stick with Django 1.0, you can achieve this in a slightly less elegant way using the select argument of the extra() QuerySet method. There's an example of exactly what you are talking about using extra() here: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#extra-select-none-where-none-params-none-tables-none-order-by-none-select-params-none Finally, if you need this to be really high performance you can denormalise the count in to a separate column. I've got some examples of how to do this in the unit testing part of my presentation here: http://www.slideshare.net/simon/advanced-django
