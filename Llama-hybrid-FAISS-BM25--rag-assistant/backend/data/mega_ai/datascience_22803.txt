Feature scaling will certainly effect clustering results. Exactly what scaling to use is an open question however, since clustering is really an exploratory procedure rather than something with a ground truth you can check against. Ultimately you want to use your knowledge of the data to determine how to relatively scale features. In practice clustering is going to work best with numeric features, so if you have a mix of feature types you may want to look at embedding methods such as GLRM as a preprocessing step.
