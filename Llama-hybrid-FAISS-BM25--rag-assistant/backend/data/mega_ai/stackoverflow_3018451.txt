App_Browsers ignored

I'm using Mobile Device Browser File ( http://mdbf.codeplex.com/ ) for my ASP.NET MVC 2 application. Locally, with VS 2010 web server, everything works fine : I use Firefox with User Agent Switcher, and it is detected as a mobile device. However, when I upload the application to my hosting provider, it isn't working anymore. As it is a shared hosting provider, I can't do many things to "debug"... Anyone knows if there is special permissions to put on the App_Browsers folder, or anything I could test ?
