Q1: My guess would be to edit the inline template, hide the Agent column and set it by default to the logged in user. Q2: GET arguments are passed to the form by default. If you want to make some fields not non-editable I think you need to alter the template to check for presence of those arguments and then hide the fields (or not). Alternatively you could pass different form to the ModelAdmin view (also after checking for the presence of GET options). Tomus
