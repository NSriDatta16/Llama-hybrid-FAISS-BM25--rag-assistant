Interpreting the RGB or HEX value from a description of the color using NLP

We do have models that predict the basic color from its description, by basic color I mean red, blue, black etc. But I would like to develop a model that can spit out the RGB or HEX colors by a description of it, an example being, "yellow that is glossy and sorta dark" should give the respective value for the same. Another example would be, "Clear green plastic". This is relative to 3d modelling where I input this text and change the material of the object on the screen.
