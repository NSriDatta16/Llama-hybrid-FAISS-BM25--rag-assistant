ANN Classifier for extracted discrete image features

I have a features extraction algorithm that works well to extract features from images. I want to develop an ANN to classify those images based on those features. I have extracted features in a csv file as columns and rows. I know we can use CNN to extract and classify images but my scerio is only the second half (features classification). Thanks
