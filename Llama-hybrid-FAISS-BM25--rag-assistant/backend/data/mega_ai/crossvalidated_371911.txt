Partial spline. Reference

I have a well done and perfectly working protocol to smooth my experimental data. I do the following: I have a variable of size 1000. Iteratively I choose random 100 points and spline them using the cubic algorithm. After this I have a number of splines, the result of this 'smoothing' is an average spline. The problem is that it is absolutely self-made protocol. Could you help me with a reference for a such approach?
