Is correlation between parameters a problem when fitting a Bayesian model using MCMC?

Assuming some Bayesian model, for example: $$y \sim N(X\beta, \sigma)$$ where this model has: Response vector : $$ y = \pmatrix{y_{1} \\ y_{2} \\ \vdots \\ y_{n}} $$ Predictor matrix : $$ \pmatrix{ x_{11} & x_{12} & \ldots & x_{1p} \\ x_{21} & x_{22} & \ldots & x_{2p} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \ldots & x_{np} \\ } $$ Parameter set : $$ \beta = \pmatrix{\beta_{0} \\ \beta_{1} \\ \vdots \\ \beta_{p}}, \text{ and } \sigma $$ Prior distributions : $$ p(\beta_{i}|\theta_{\beta_{i}}), \text{ for } i = 1,\dots,p \text{ and } p(\sigma|\theta_{\sigma}) $$ where $\theta_{\alpha}$ denotes the set of hyperparameters corresponding to the probability distribution for parameter $\alpha$. Now, multicollinearity amongst the predictor variables in $X$ can lead to parameter estimate issues. Also, correlation within the sample draws for a given parameter can lead to unreliable posterior distributions (i.e. $ p(\beta_{i}^{t}|\theta_{\beta_{i}},\beta_{i}^{t-1},\ldots,\beta_{i}^{1}) \ne p(\beta_{i}^{t}|\theta_{\beta_{i}}) $). However, is correlation between parameters problematic (i.e. $ p(\beta_{i}|\theta_{\beta_{i}},\beta_{j}) \ne p(\beta_{i}|\theta_{\beta_{i}}), \text{ } i \ne j $)? By problematic, I mean both in terms of causing algorithmic problems and interpretability problems, insofar as the two can be separated. It seems to me that, ultimately, correlation between parameters could be problematic in practice (particularly when the goal of the analysis is to focus on the marginalized distributions of a subset of all parameters) due to prolonged time required for the MCMC procedure to efficiently explore the support of all the parameters. However, in theory, regardless of how long this may take, if the chain(s) mix(es) sufficiently well (which is a necessary condition for any MCMC Bayesian analysis, I guess), then the joint posterior distribution will be sufficient to extract marginalized distributions through integration of nuisance parameters. In other words, the issue is an issue of runtime and the feasibility thereof. Without optimizations and speed-up tricks, correlation between parameters can lead to longer runtimes to achieve the true joint posterior distribution, but both algorithmic robustness and interpretability will be unaffected assuming a given MCMC routine is provided with enough time to sufficiently explore the parameter spaces.
