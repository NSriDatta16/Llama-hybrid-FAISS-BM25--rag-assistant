ADO.NET (Sql Compact + MySQL + IBM db2 expressC)

I'm developing an app which will have a central database users can add entries to. The database will have to be on a server somewhere but I want the users to be able to add entries offline. The app will sync to the main db when connection is available. So, I supose I need 2 databases - the main one sitting on a server (preferably linux) and a small one on each client machine to use as a buffer when offline. The app will be coded in c# for windows. I'm having trouble deciding what databases to use and whether I can leverage any replication technology to make this easier. Also, I don't want to pay for anything ;) So I guess my questions are... Will I have any trouble writing code in ADO.NET to move data from something like SQL Compact Edition to MySQL? Are there any replication solutions which will move stuff from local to main database for me I've recently discovered IBM's db2 expressC but I'm not sure if it's serverless as well as server installed. Does anyone know? Firebird can be server or serverless. Can I replicate between them. Is the server mode capable of heavy use?
