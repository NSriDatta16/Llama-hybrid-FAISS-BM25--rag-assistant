Is this method of resampling time-series known in the literature? Does it have a name?

I was recently looking for ways to resample time series, in ways that Approximately preserve the auto-correlation of long memory processes. Preserve the domain of the observations (for instance a resampled times series of integers is still a times series of integers). May affect some scales only, if required. I came up with the following permutation scheme for a time series of length $2^N$: Bin the time series by pairs of consecutive observations (there are $2^{N-1}$ such bins). Flip each of them ( i.e. index from 1:2 to 2:1 ) independently with probability $1/2$. Bin the obtained time series by consecutive $4$ observations (thre are $2^{N-2}$ such bins). Reverse each of them ( i.e. index from 1:2:3:4 to 4:3:2:1 ) independelty with probability $1/2$. Repeat the procedure with bins of size $8$, $16$, ..., $2^{N-1}$ always reversing the bins with probability $1/2$. This design was purely empirical and I am looking for work that would have already been published on this kind of permutation. I am also open to suggestions for other permutations or resampling schemes.
