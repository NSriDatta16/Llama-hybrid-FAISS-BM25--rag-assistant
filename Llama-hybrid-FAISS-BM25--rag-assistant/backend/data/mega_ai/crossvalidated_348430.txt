What is the reason for not including an intercept term in AR and ARMA models?

In econometric literature it is usually argued that in case of estimating an equation, an intercept term must be always included regardless of its statistical importance because removing the constant cause other regression parameters be biased (for example see Brooks, introductory econometrics for finance). Now my question is given this reasoning, why in models like AR (autoregressive regression) and ARMA (Autoregressiveâ€“moving-average model) which deal with time series data, an intercept term is not usually included?
