When to use C#/C++

Which areas of programming are each language best suited for? I like both C++ and C# but i prefer to use C# because of .NET. My question is when will you use C++ and when do you use C#? So if you make a financial application for a company you will use C#? ( It's easy to design a form and connect to a database without downloading 3rd party libraries, and if you make advanced algorithms you would use C++ for it's speed? This is my idea. I just watched video's @ http://www.academicearth.org , and it seems that universities prefer to use C++ for Machine Learning for example. What do you guys think of it? and what is the industry view on this.
