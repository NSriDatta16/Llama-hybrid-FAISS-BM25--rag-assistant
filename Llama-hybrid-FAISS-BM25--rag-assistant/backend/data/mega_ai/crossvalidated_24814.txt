This is an example of detecting a change in intercept (B0 in your notation ) or sometimes referred to a level or step shift. This often occurs in time series data where a variable in the model is impacted by a 0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1 ..... phenomenon at or around some unknown arbitrary point. It is referred to as Intervention Detection see as the break point (intervention) is found (detected) by trial and error aka a search process. If your data is not time series it is possible to use a time series package that identifies Interventions while specifying a frequency of "1" and disableing any ARMA structure thus yielding a model that you require.I your data is time series as might be expected then you need to consider Intervention Detection in he presence of ARIMA structure and PDL's (ADL's) in the user-suggested input/causal series. If you wished to post your data I would demonstrate this to you and the list. Additionally you might look at Outlier detection for generic time series and/or www.forecastingsolutions.com/publications/Introducing_cart.pdf
