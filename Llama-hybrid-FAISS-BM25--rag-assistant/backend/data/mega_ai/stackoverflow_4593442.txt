Java agent, instrumentation and array creation

I need to write an agent for my java application, that does some specific stuff on every array creation. So far I was unable to find any way to run my code on this event. java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer does not get "array classes", so no way to hook into "constructor of array". And "array classes are never modifiable" no JVMTI event corresponds to this Any suggestions?
