Proper definition of AR()-ARCH() time series model

This is how I would define it, if anyone has any objections please let me know! AR(m)-ARCH(m) time series is an ARCH(m) process in which the variance at time t is conditional on the previous m times such that: $Var(a_t|z_{t-1},...,z_{t-m})=\sigma^2_t=\omega+\alpha_1a_{t-1}^2+...+\alpha_ma_{t-m}^2$. ie , the mean is modeled by AR(m) and the variances as ARCH(m)
