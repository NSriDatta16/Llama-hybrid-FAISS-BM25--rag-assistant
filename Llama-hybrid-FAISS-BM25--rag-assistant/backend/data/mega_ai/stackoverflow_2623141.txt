The performance consideration all depends on the scale of your model and usage. While the consideration for storage space in these modern times is almost a non-issue, you might need to think about performance: Database engines tend to store data in chunks called pages. Sql Server has 8k pages, Oracle 2k and MySql 16k page size by default? Not that big for any of these systems. Whenever you perform an operation on a bit of data (the field and row) its entire page is fetched from the db and put into memory. When your data is smaller (tiny int vs. int) then you can fit more individual rows and data items into a page and therefore your likelihood of having to fetch more pages goes down and the overall performance speeds up. So yes, using the smallest possible representation of your data will definitely have an impact on performance because it allows the db engine to be more efficient.
