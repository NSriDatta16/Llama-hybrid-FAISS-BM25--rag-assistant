Rails 3 Cookie Based Sessions Question

With Rails 3, the default session storage mechanism is cookie_store. I assume that this means that the contents within the session hash are serialized, encoded and stored within a cookie in the browser? Does this mean that nothing (or very little) of the session is stored in the server? I've had a few issues where I had a cookie overflow error and I'm assuming because I kept on adding to my user instance (which was also linked/fetched from the cookie). u = session[:user] u.add_this lots_of_data so eventually I got a cookie overflow error. Am I correct about this? Are sessions fully stored within cookies in Rails 3 (by default)?
