Basic courses like Andrew ng Machine Learning on Coursera or the Introduction to Statistical Learning (free) book would be my recommandations for a first step in Data Science / Machine Learning. They both cover basic statistical concepts and main modelling traps and are enough to start your first projects. Then I would suggest you to find a domain of application, learn about it and put your knowledge into work. Depending on what you want to achieve you will have plenty of occasions to dive into specific fields if needed (a given library, advanced statistics, domain oriented tools like for NLP or computer vision...).
