Interpretation of coefficients in a poorly performing GLM

Suppose that I have trained a logistic regression model on a certain dataset, and I wish to interpret the coefficients of this model. Does it make any difference on the validity of the interpretation if the model is poor? What I mean by this is that imagine that we measure the performance of the model by a ROC curve and we get a low value (but still better than 0.5) for the area under the curve. This model is not terribly accurate, but does the performance of it influence the interpretation of the coefficients?
