Random effects are used to capture correlations in the data, namely, within the same level of the corresponding grouping factors. The parameters that quantify the strength of these correlations are the variance components (i.e., the variances and covariances between the random effects). It is often the case in real data that these correlations are rather small in magnitude. Hence, some of these variance components are practically zero, which is on the boundary of their corresponding parameter space. This is one of the main reasons why you experience convergence problems under the frequentist approach. Under the Bayesian approach, you typically specify a prior for the variance-covariance matrix of the random effects that provides some "information" not present in the data.
