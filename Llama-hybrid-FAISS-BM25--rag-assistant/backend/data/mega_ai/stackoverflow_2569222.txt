How to implement mib module in net-snmp with python?

in the faq, i read this "..the agent can also support MIB modules implemented in perl or (from 5.4) python." I have built net-snmp with python support, but it's not clear yet how to actually implement my own MIB module with python now. The python scripts i see in the python directory are related to implementing an snmp client, not an snmp agent. Probably i just miss the point somewhere. Can someone give me a hint on how to get started with this? Thanks, Tom
