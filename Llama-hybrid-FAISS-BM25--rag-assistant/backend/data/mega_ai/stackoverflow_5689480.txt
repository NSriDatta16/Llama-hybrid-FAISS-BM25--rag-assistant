How to prevent code from running on certain pages?

I'm programming in PHP and having some issues with having both a login bar (which appears in the left column) and a signup form both work on the same page (this is due to form tokens; a problem for another day). I therefore wish to prevent the login bar from showing up on the signup page, and so all I need is a conditional that prevents a specific file from being included if I'm on that page. What is the best way of going about this? Thanks, Paragon
