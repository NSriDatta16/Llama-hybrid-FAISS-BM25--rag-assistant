Offline iPad Web App - Database/Wordpress Question

I'm building an iPad web app that will be a showcase of products. It will include images and pdfs of over 100 products so the size will be fairly large. I have read that the offline data storage for the iPad is only 5mb, which could be an issue since Wordpress alone is 10mb. I may have to use a custom CMS to limit the application size. Most of all I need a helping hand with the client-side database. HTML5 is supposed to have a feature to take advantage of user cache, but all of the articles I have found just talk about it and don't show examples. Any ideas? Thanks,
