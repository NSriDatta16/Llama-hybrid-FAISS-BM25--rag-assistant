IE8 fancybox content denied

When i did everything for the login/registration in magento i just got into biggest problem on IE. I didnt realized that IE could deny the iframe content on fancybox. Here is the screenshot which shows what IE displayed. How can i force the fancybox to load site data into IE8 fancybox iframe. Using magento and ssl is enabled. So is that could be a problem why IE says the page is denied on iframe. This is the fancybox code i used for registration w49("a#header-register").fancybox({ 'transitionIn' : 'elastic', 'transitionOut' : 'elastic', 'speedIn' : 800, 'speedOut' : 400, 'width' : 740, 'height' : 400, 'type' : 'iframe', 'overlayShow' : true }); Please some one tell em a solution.
