Sampling Hidden Markov Model

I am studying hidden Markov models, but I have some doubts about the inference phase. If I have any observations and I want to know the three parameters that characterize the model, can I use one of the MCMC techniques directly on the observations or do I have to first use the Viterbi algorithm or the forward-backward algorithm on the observations and then use one of MCMC techniques to know the three parameters?
