Running a query in Page Load a bad idea?

I'm running an ASP.NET app in which I have added an insert/update query to the [global] Page_Load. So, each time the user hits any page on the site, it updates the database with their activity (session ID, time, page they hit). I haven't implemented it yet, but this was the only suggestion given to me as to how to keep track of how many people are currently on my site. Is this going to kill my database and/or IIS in the long run? We figure that the site averages between 30,000 and 50,000 users at one time. I can't have my site constantly locking up over a database hit with every single page hit for every single user. I'm concerned that's what will happen, however this is the first time I have attempted a solution like this so I may just be overly paranoid.
