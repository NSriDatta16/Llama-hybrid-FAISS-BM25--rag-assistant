A convolutional neural network is a form of neural network with an additional convolutional layer, typically used in image & audio analysis. The convolutional layer is essentially a filtering stage defined by the kernel which is used. For example, a convolutional layer could have a kernel which extracts edges from an image towards the goal of learning which objects are in a scene.
