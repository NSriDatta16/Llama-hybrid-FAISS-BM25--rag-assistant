Side note: The supplied code will not loop 1,000,000 times. The following will: for( $id=1 ; $id Also, with regards to your need to have this script run constantly to load content into a database, I would suggest the following: I presume that you are using an SQL Table to hold the URLs to be crawled, Add a field with a timestamp called 'loadAttempted', Limit the PHP Script to try and perform the action to maybe 5 times, Record the Time the Script attempt to crawl the URL into the 'loadAttempted' field, Have each loop of the Script perform a search for any URLs where 'loadAttempted' is empty, or where it is greater than X minutes ago, Add a CRON Job to trigger the Script This would mean that, up to every minute, the script will be triggered and will try and load 5 URLs. If a URL takes an abnormally long period of time to load (which would mean that the script timed out whilst trying to crawl it) it will cycle back around and be tried again. You could also use this, or variants on the idea, to get stats for pages which are slower than the rest and/or the average loadtime for the URLs. Also, if you are wanting to have this running constantly, I would suggest that limiting the PHP script to try and run the getDataFromWeb() function a smaller number of times (like 5)
