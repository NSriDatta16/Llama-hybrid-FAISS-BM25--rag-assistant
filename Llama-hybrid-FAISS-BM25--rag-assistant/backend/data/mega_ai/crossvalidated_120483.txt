I've noticed that compared with what I'd call mainstream statistical science econometricians seem reluctant to use graphs, either schematic or data-based. The coverage of regression, which is naturally even more central in econometrics than elsewhere, is a major case in point. Modern introductions to regression by statisticians emphasise throughout the value of plotting the data and plotting the results of regression, including diagnostic plots, whereas the treatment in econometrics texts is distinctly more formal. Leading texts in econometrics don't include many graphs and don't promote their value strongly. It's difficult to analyse this without the risk of seeming undiplomatic or worse, but I'd guess at some combination of the following as contributory. Desire for rigour. Econometricians tend to be suspicious or hostile to learning from the data and strongly prefer decisions to be based on formal tests (whenever they don't come out of a theorem). This is linked to a preference for models to be based on "theory" (although this can mean just that a predictor was mentioned previously in a paper by some economist not talking about data). Publication practices. Papers for economics or econometrics journals are heavy with highly stylised tables of coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics and P-values. Adding graphs does not even seem to be thought about in many cases and if offered would possibly be suggested for cutting by reviewers. These practices have become embedded over a generation or more to the extent that they have become automatic, with rigid conventions over starring significance levels, etc. Graphics for complex models. Tacitly graphs are ignored whenever it does not seem as if there is a graph that matches a complex model with many predictors, etc., etc. (which indeed is often difficult to decide). Naturally, what I am suggesting is a difference of means, as it were, and I recognise much variability in both cases. But as a non-economist who has much occasion to observe what economists do, it seems to me that even introductory econometrics texts cover a great deal of formal territory in a rather stiff way. They are also correspondingly weak on what one author called "plain data analysis".
