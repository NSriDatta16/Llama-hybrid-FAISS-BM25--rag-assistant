This seems like a good reference: http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/01/10/cross-browser-html5-drag-and-drop/ Basically, dragLeave is not an indicator that no drop happened. It is an indicator that a draggable object was dragged out of another object. You don't need it. [Edit: Basically, dragleave is firing because the item you're dragging is from your desktop. The object it is in before you drop it is basically your desktop. If you drag any file from your desktop over any droptarget, it will fire the dragleave to indicate it's no longer "in" the previous object (your desktop), and now is in the new object ("dropzone"). If you had several dropzones, each time you dragged it over, then out of one of these, the dragleave would fire. You should just use the drop event to tell if a drop happened.]
