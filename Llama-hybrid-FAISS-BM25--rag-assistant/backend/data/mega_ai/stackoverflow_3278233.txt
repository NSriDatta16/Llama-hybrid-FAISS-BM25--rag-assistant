Creating a draggable elastic ball?

I created a custom view loading an image of a small ball. So that the onDraw method would look like this: public void onDraw(Canvas canvas) { canvas.drawBitmap(...); } Later, I added an onTouch listener to be able to listen to touch events to enable the ball to be dragged around. public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) { int eventaction = event.getAction(); int X = (int)event.getX(); int Y = (int)event.getY(); switch (eventaction ) { case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE: // touch drag with the ball // move the balls the same as the finger ball.setX(X-25); ball.setY(Y-25); break; } // redraw the canvas invalidate(); return true; } Now, I am trying to make the ball move ONLY along a curve and if its not moved beyond a fixed point, make it swing back to its original position. So there are two problems I am currently facing: Fixing the movement path of the ball Flinging it back by animating it. One problem I am observing is if I use ball.startAnimation , and if the ball was slightly out of focus, the ball appears sliced. Any suggestions please?
