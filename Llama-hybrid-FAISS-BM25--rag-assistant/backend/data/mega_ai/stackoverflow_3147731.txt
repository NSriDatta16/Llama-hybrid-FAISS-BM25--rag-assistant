I want to use a customized template file for magento homepage. I used the following code in the layout/local.xml file of my theme as described in this tutorial New Layout page/home.phtml 1 But the template path hint shows page/3columns.phtml. Anybody please specify the exact way to set a one template to the homepage and another to the products page.Also want to remove the Cart and compare boxes only from the sidebar of the homepage and show it in other pages.I am using magento 1.4.1
