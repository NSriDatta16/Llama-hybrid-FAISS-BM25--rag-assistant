Probabilities in logistic regression

I'm learning about logistic regression from the Andrew Ng Machine Learning course. In the course it is stated that the hypothesis is the probability of the output $y=1$ for a given input $x$ . That is, $$h_\theta(x)=P(y=1|x;\theta).$$ It is assumed that $h_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\theta^T x}}$ , i.e. the sigmoid function. What I am confused about is how we know this? Is this a definition?
