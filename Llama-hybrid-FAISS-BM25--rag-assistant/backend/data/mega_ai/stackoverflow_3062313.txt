The best way to structure this database?

At the moment I'm doing this: gems(id, name, colour, level, effects, source) id is the primary key and is not auto-increment. A typical row of data would look like this: id => 40153 name => Veiled Ametrine colour => Orange level => 80 effects => +12 sp, +10 hit source => Ametrine (Some of you gamers might see what I'm doing here :) ) But I realise this could be sorted a lot better. I have studied database relationships and secondary keys in my A-Level computing class but never got as far as to set one up properly. I just need help with how this database should be organised, like what tables should have what data with what secondary and foreign keys? I was thinking maybe 3 tables: gem , effects , source . Which then have relationships to each other? Can anyone shed some light on this? Is a complex way like I'm proposing really the way to go or should I just carry on with what I'm doing? Cheers.
