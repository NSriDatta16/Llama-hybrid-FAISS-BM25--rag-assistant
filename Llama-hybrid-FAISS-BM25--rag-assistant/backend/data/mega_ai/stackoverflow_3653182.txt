Best way to show huge text in WPF?

I need to show a really huge amount of text data in WPF code. First i tried to use TextBox (and of course it was too slow in rendering). Now i'm using FlowDocument --and its awesome--but recently i have had another request: text shouldnt be hyphenated. Supposedly it is not ( document.IsHyphenationEnabled = false ) but i still don't see my precious horizontal scroll bar. if i magnify scale text is ... hyphenated. public string TextToShow { set { Paragraph paragraph = new Paragraph(); paragraph.Inlines.Add(value); FlowDocument document = new FlowDocument(paragraph); document.IsHyphenationEnabled = false; flowReader.Document = document; flowReader.IsScrollViewEnabled = true; flowReader.ViewingMode = FlowDocumentReaderViewingMode.Scroll; flowReader.IsPrintEnabled = true; flowReader.IsPageViewEnabled = false; flowReader.IsTwoPageViewEnabled = false; } } That's how i create FlowDocument - and here comes part of my WPF control: Nothing criminal =)) I'd like to know how to tame this beast - googled nothing helpful. Or you have some alternative way to show megabytes of text, or textbox have some virtualization features which i need just to enable. Anyway i'll be happy to hear your response!
