HTHTHT is a perfectly valid sequence of coin tosses, it is not more probable the HHHHHH, or HHTHTH etc. The fact that it doesn’t “look” random, does not make it non-random. Check the Thinking, Fast and Slow book by Daniel Kahneman, who discusses this kind of biases. Moreover, even if the process is deterministic, then if you picked the random “flip” from the sequence, the probability of seeing heads would be 1/2, since exactly half of the flips would be heads. The frequentist “long run” argument is not about observing actual long run sequence of events, but it is an interpretation of probability. When frequentist thinks of some process as of random variable, she considers what would be the “long run” stochastic process behind it. This is an interpretation, not the statement that it actually behaves like this. For example, a sequence of coin flips is a deterministic process that can be described in terms of physics, there is nothing “random” or “i.i.d.” about it, but interpreting it like this makes a nice, simple statistical model.
