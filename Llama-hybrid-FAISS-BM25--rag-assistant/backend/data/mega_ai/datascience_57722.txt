Both reasons are about virtual environments and the devops culture which integrates development and operational activities together. I would rather use the terminology "test environment" than sandboxing to describe this function. Docker is an useful for tool for data science. Other reasons might include that is facilitates collaboration between different parties because everyone is using the same image (your point on dependencies and libraries issues) and it facilitates sharing and managing your application/code/workflow with anyone independent on the OS they use. Basically it is helpful to share code, its management with third parties, and users requests regarding library dependencies etc. I don't know of interesting research papers but I think the question is a bit similar to asking with there are interesting research papers on Python or R.
