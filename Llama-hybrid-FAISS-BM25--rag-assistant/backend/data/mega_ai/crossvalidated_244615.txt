Bayesian decision rule

Imagine the task where I'm getting some observations of the person moving, and need to determine whether the guy is walking/running/standing. If I want to apply the bayes decision rule: $p(x|w_j)p(w_j) > p(x|w_k)p(w_k), k = 1,..., C; k \neq j$ In our example we have 3 classes, so $C=3$. We then try to estimate the $p(x|w_j)$ by finding the parameters of normal distribution (as one of the approaches.) One thing I don't understand, what would be the probabilities $p(w_j)$? I can't say what is the probability of the person in standing class or walking, I guess all the $p(w_j) = 1/3, j=1,2,3$. Am I right?
