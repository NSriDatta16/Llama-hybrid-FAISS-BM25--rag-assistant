How to handle Regression data thats not linear

I'm new to stats and am using Python 2.7 to fit a regression model (Random Forest). When I plot the percentile plot of the prices before and after a log transformation, I get Percentile plot (Left: No transformation. Right: Log transformed) I notice that the plot became more linear, except at the beginning where it's a little strange. What will you do under such circumstances, and what may have caused that abnormality? When I plot only the prices that have higher values (> 400000), the plot becomes Is it sufficiently linear now? What does a linear plot imply? How should I treat values under 400000 which I have excluded from being used to fit the regression model? How do you decide whether to log transform the variables too? By doing a similar percentile plot? Quantile-normal plot (Log transformation of y variable) Left: Training Set. Right: Test Set Quantile-normal plot ( No transformation of y variable) Left: Training Set. Right: Test Set Why does log transformation not do anything?
