Anonymous objects are faster than named objects. But calling more functions is more expensive, and to a degree which eclipses any savings you might get from using anonymous functions. Each function called adds to the call stack, which introduces a small but non-trivial amount of overhead. But unless you're writing encryption/decryption routines or something similarly sensitive to performance, as many others have noted it's always better to optimize for elegant, easy-to-read code over fast code. Assuming you are writing well-architected code, then issues of speed should be the responsibility of those writing the interpreters/compilers.
