Multiple setup projects for different languages and brand names

I need to rebrand my application, that means create another application resource file with different strings, slash screen and icons. My application is also localized for a second language, i have another resource file with all application string which is translated, that creates me additional, satellite dll. I need to build 4 setup project 2 for each language and 2 for each brand name. What will the elegant solution for this? Is there any way to create additional application resource file same way I did with language translation and how I include a satellite (resource in a second language dll) in my setup project and not including resources in the original, neutral language. Thank you.
