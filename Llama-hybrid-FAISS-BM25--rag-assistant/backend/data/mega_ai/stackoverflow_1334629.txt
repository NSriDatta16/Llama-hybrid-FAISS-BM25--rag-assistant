I've never used that particular mootools script (may I recommend SWFObject? ^^), but it seems that its not streaming the SWF, and I vagely remember that as a normal behaviour when using JS script for Flash embedding. I'm not sure there is an actual solution, but one workaround, if you reaaaly need the infoLoader events of your main movie (I personally have never used them) would be to use a small loader.swf to load your main.swf inside it.
