You may define a class method (in any class you want) to store your data: class Xyzzy def self.items @items ||= {} end end # .... if Xyzzy.items.include? :fubar Xyzzy.items[:asd] = 1 end But you should decide when you want this 'cache' to be cleared. If you want it only for one request, define a before_filter which will call Xyzzy.items.clear The class objects are global. You may also use a standard global variable, but that would be less elegant. :)
