As also pointed out in the comment above, PCA finds new directions by using linear combinations of existing ones. Let's say, after standardisation your data looks like it's distributed along the line $x=y$ with a small noise. Then, PCA gives you $\phi=[1,1]/\sqrt{2}$ as the first PC, because it is the new direction that the data variance is maximised. The second PC will cover smaller variance and will be orthogonal to this one, i.e. unit vector pointing in the direction of the line $x=-y$ .
