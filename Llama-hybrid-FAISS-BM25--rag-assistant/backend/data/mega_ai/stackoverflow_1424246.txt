Removing frames

I am trying to reorganize a site. There are some frame pages which I would like to remove as the same result can be achieved with less overhead. However, the frame below: &RunDate= " scrolling="auto" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"> I would like to remove but I have tried to use an include but I get the error message that the file cannot be found? Why does it work within a frame but not as an include? I also tried with an iframe and got the same result. Curious to know why it works as a frame. I tried a virual include: &RunDate = "--> to no avail. Thanks, R.
