It's complicated because there are two mechanisms. If you're extending SimpleTagSupport, you get getJspBody() method. It returns a JspFragment that you can invoke(Writer writer) to have the body content written to the writer. You should use SimpleTagSupport unless you have a specific reason to use BodyTagSupport (like legacy tag support) as it is - well - simpler. If you are using classic tags, you extend BodyTagSupport and so get access to a getBodyContent() method. That gets you a BodyContent object that you can retrieve the body content from.
