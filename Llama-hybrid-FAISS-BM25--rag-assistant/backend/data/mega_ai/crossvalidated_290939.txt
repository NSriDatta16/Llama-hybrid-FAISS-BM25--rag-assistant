Is it possible to get "spurious cointegration"?

If two time series $X$ and $Y$ exhibit a cointegration relationship while theory would suggest that this absolutely makes no sense, can we speak of "spurious cointegration" (like we sometimes speak of "spurious correlation", in a different context)? One could then argue that the empirical results contradict theory for the sample period but that it does not mean the two time series are necessarily related in the long run ($\neq$ "real" cointegration). Is this reasoning valid?
