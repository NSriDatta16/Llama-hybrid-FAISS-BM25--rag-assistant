I need a fast key substitution algorithm for java

Given a string with replacement keys in it, how can I most efficiently replace these keys with runtime values, using Java ? I need to do this often, fast, and on reasonably long strings (say, on average, 1-2kb). The form of the keys is my choice, since I'm providing the templates here too. Here's an example (please don't get hung up on it being XML; I want to do this, if possible, cheaper than using XSL or DOM operations). I'd want to replace all @[^@]*?@ patterns in this with property values from bean properties, true Property properties, and some other sources. The key here is fast . Any ideas? @CHANNEL_TYPE@ @ADDRESS@ @URI@ The naive implementation is to use String.replaceAll() but I can't help but think that's less than ideal. If I can avoid adding new third-party dependencies, so much the better.
