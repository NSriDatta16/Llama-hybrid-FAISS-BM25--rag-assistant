iphone data synchronization

I'm new to iphone development. I currently have an app on windows mobile that uses a local database on the device (sqlce) and the app is able to synchronize the data between the device and a remote database through a web service using microsoft sync framework. Is this requirement feasible on an iphone app? Id like to build a version of my app on the iphone. I see that the iphone can use sqlite for storage on the device. But does the sdk have something for data synchronization?
