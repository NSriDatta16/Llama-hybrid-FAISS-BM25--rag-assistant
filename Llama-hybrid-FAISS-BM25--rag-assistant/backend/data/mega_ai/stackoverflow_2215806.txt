You want to embed the images and XML file in the SWF. [Embed(source="../assets/mytiles.bmp")] var MyTiles:Class; // When you need the Bitmap: var myTiles:Bitmap = new MyTiles(); You'll need to use mxmlc, which comes with the Flex SDK. More info: Embed Almost Anything in Your SWF , Adobe Flex 3 Help: Embedding Asset Types Edit: Using the Flex SDK with Flash CS4 describes how to set up Flash CS4 so you can use Flex features like the Embed tag. I don't think CS3 has an equivalent feature; you'll need to do the compiling manually or with an external IDE like FlashDevelop in that case.
