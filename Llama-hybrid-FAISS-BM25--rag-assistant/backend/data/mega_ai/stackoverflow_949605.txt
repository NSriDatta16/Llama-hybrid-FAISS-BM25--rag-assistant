sql server 2005 - select records from tbl A contained WITHIN a text field of tbl B

I'm trying to work out a SQL Select in MS SQL 2005, to do the following: TABLE_A contains a list of keywords... asparagus, beetroot, beans, egg plant etc (x200). TABLE_B contains a record with some long free text (approx 4000 chars)... I know what record within TABLE_B I am selecting (byID). However I need to get a shortlist of records from TABLE_A that are contained WITHIN the text of the record in TABLE_B . I'm wondering if SQLs CONTAINS function is uselful... but maybe not. This needs to be a super quick query. Cheers
