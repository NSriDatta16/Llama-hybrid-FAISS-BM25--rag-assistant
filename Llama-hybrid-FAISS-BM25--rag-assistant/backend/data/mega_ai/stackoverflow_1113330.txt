This is basically a re-write of the answer given by pcampbell but using functions that I've found port to other SQL product more easily: CAST rather than CONVERT etc: SELECT CAST(REVERSE(CAST(REVERSE(CAST(Num AS NVARCHAR(9))) + '000000000' AS NCHAR(9))) AS NVARCHAR(9)) AS value_padded FROM Numbers;
