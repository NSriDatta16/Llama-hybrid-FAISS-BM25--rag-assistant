Patterns aren't really "tech" in the traditional sense. Using patterns means applying your specific knowledge of a domain to a problem keeping in mind the patterns which apply to that domain. They are useful to exactly the extent that you have a base of experience to put them in context. The repository pattern, for example, is maybe not the best starting place for constructing a database architecture based on a pattern. Have you got a simpler pattern implemented such as Table Module or (in the specific case of data access) Active Record ? If not then perhaps you should start there. These patterns focus on a fairly limited, basic way of organizing data and operations. Repository is more like a meta-pattern that then builds on top of these patterns, organizing a complex domain-data boundary into a simpler collection-like interface.
