SQL Server 2005 Installation on Windows 2000 Server

We want to install sql server 2005 on Windo ws 2000 Server. We are able to install database service engine, analysis services engine and integration services. But we are unable to install workstation components like SSMS. Does anybody faced this problem? What is the fix for this? Thanks, Raghu
