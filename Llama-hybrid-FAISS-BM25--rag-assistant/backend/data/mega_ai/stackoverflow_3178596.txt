How to add images to iphone simulator v4

I've always been able to get images into iphone simulator 3 by the usual methods described on this site (i.e. dragging image into iphone simulator). However, having upgarded to the new xcode 3.2.3, although I can still save images to the simulator, I can't actually see them there when I go to the library on the simulator. Thankfully - it works when I build for the iPad simulator. Has anyone else go this problem or is my install of the new xcode screwy?
