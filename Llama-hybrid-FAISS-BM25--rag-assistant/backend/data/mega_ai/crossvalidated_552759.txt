Statistic to describe variability of a time series value

This statistics newbie could use some help with time series statistics. I am looking at sunlight (irradiance) over the course of a day. One day got cloudy, so the values went down, mid-afternoon. The curve looks like this: The next day, was clear, so the curve has only 1 clear apex: Is there a statistic to describe each day as "steady" or "changeable"?
