How are the numbers of a filter decided in a Convolutional neural network?

I know how a filter in a Convolutional Neural Network "scans" the input image and multiplies the values of the kernel with the corresponding receptive field in the input image and adds it all up to get a new pixel in the output activation map. But I unsure how the numbers in a filter is decided. Is the kernel a patch from the image that is chosen? Like a 5x5 patch of the image that the network must decide to be good to be used as a filter? Or are they random numbers that backpropagation will soon change to fit best with the data? And would these numbers in the filter be considered as the weights of the network?
