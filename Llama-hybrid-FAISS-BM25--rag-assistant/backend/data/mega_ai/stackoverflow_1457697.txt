This is a normal result as the number of users increases you will load the server with higher numbers of requests per second. Any server will take longer to deal with more requests per second, meaning the average page response time increases. Requests per second is a measure of the load being applied to the application and average page response time is a measure of the applications performance where high number=slow response. You will be better off using a stepped number of users or a warmup period where the load is applied gradually to the server. Also, with 1000 virtual users on a single test machine, the CPU of the test machine will be absolutely maxed out. That will most likely be the thing that is skewing the results of your testing. Playing with the number of virtual users you will find that there will be a point where the requests per second are maxed out. Adding or taking away virtual users will result in less requests per second from the app.
