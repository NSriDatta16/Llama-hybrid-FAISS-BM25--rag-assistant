Use PHP's DOMDocument class to normalize an HTML fragment: $dom= new DOMDocument(); $dom->loadHTML(' Hello World'); $xpath = new DOMXPath($dom); $body = $xpath->query('/html/body'); echo($dom->saveXml($body->item(0))); This question is similar to an earlier question and I've copied and pasted one solution here. If the HTML is submitted by users you'll also need to filter out potential Javascript attack vectors like onmouseover="do_something_evil()" or ... . Tools like HTML Purifier were designed to catch and solve these problems and are far more comprehensive than any code that I could post.
