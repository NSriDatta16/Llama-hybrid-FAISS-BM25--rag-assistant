Reading text file into an array of lines in C

Using C I would like to read in the contents of a text file in such a way as to have when all is said and done an array of strings with the nth string representing the nth line of the text file. The lines of the file can be arbitrarily long. What's an elegant way of accomplishing this? I know of some neat tricks to read a text file directly into a single appropriately sized buffer, but breaking it down into lines makes it trickier (at least as far as I can tell). Thanks very much!
