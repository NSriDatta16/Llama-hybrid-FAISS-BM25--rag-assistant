Http Request Life Cycle

I have recently started my job as web application backend developer. I am bit stuck in understanding lifecycle of a Http request. What I understood is Every Http request first contacts a DNS server which resolves the request URL domain to a IP address. After fetching the Webserver IP address request is forwarded to it(via PUT request). A webserver like apache handles this request and forwards this to application which has to handle this. After this I am lost with How response is sent by the application to the user who requested it and will Apcache involved in this? Can I see the entire flow in my browser with some debugging tools? Can someone refer some links to understand this in depth?
