You've got the following options: cookies, database, querystring, page variables, and server cache to try to handle the stateless nature of the web. Each has its own tradeoff, but pragmatically speaking I currently use session that gets stored in the db. This scales well for server farms, helps to keep your pagesize small, and is easy to implement.
