I would use something like a PCA if your feature space has a numeric component. If on the other hand it has a all binary and n-ary data, I would use something like multi-dimensional scaling or stochastic neighborhood embedding. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling This approach would require you to try many embeddings and find the one that reduces the stress optimally. Another approach is to transform the entire dataset to a manifold and then you can use something like IsoMap. Without further indication of the type of data it is difficult to suggest anything else.
