Dendrograms using clustergram vs traditional ways in Matlab

By comparing the dendrograms produced by the clustergram object and the "manual" approach i.e. pdist -> linkage -> dendrogram I found they are different, but cannot find an explanation for that difference. Clustergram documentation says that the default distance used is 'Euclidean' and the default linkage method is 'Average' , same parameters I used for pdist and linkage functions. I thought it might be related to the standardization performed by clustergram , so I used z-score for standardizing first my matrix and then each column separately, but the dendrograms are still different as compared with the one produced by clustergram . Can somebody explain the reason behind that difference, and how can I use the "manual" approach for getting the same dendrogram? Many thanks in advance. Edit: I compared the results obtained by the "manual" approach with the SPSS results and they are the same. Also, I tested all different ' data processing' options with clustergram but the dendrogram keeps being different.
