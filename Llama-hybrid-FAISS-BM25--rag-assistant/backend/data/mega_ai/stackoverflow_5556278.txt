What I would do is make a query with totals turned on. Do an inner-join of [Class Type] and [Class Date] (btw. if you rename those tables without spaces in their names your queries and code will look a lot cleaner), Group by the primary key for [Class Type] , and on [Class Date].[date] ; and then on [Class Date].[Test Score] , change the GroupBy to Avg. Save the resulting query In a second query, put all the other data you want from [Student] , [Class Type] and [Class Date] ; and inner-join it to the first query on [Class Type] 's primary key Save the resulting query Build your report based on the second query, group it by date, show the footer and put the Avg value in the group footer. (you can do sub total's for report groups, but I haven't found a way to do averages nicely)
