Several things you should be doing: Strictly whitelist your accepted values, according to type, format, range, etc Explicitly blacklist certain characters (even though this is usually bypassable), IF your whitelist cannot be extremely tight. Encode the values before output, if youre using Anti-XSS you already know that a simple HtmlEncode is not enough Set the src property through the DOM - and not by generating HTML fragment Use the dynamic value only as a querystring parameter, and not for arbitrary sites; i.e. hardcode the name of the server, target page, etc. Is your site over SSL? If so, using a frame may cause inconsistencies with SSL UI... Using named frames in general, can allow Frame Spoofing; if on a secure site, this may be a relevant attack vector (for use with phishing etc.)
