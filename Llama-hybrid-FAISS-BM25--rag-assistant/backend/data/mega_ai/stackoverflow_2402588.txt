My quick guess is, you haven't added Q_OBJECT macro to dragwidget.h header, the moc file for DragWidget class wasn't generated and the connect failed with "no such slot as draw()" error. It might be also a good idea to add "CONFIG += console" to .pro file - you'll see all warning messages (like the one about connect error), so tracking such mistakes would be easier. You might also check return value of connect.
