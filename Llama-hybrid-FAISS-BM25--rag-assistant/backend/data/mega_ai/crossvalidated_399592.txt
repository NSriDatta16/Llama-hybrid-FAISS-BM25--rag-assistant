Intuition For AR it depends on what you're going to use the model for, see details below. It doesn't make sense to estimate the MA part of the ARMA. Remember, if a series follows a unit root every shock persists, forever. Said another way, an error from today or a hundred years ago has the same impact on the series. Since you can't really estimate a MA( $\infty$ ), best to leave out the MA. Details Let's focus on a AR(1) model to gain intuition. Let's assume the data is I(1) (i.e. non-stationary). What happens if you estimate a AR(1)? Will the model be any good? To answer these question you have to know what you want to use the model for. Generally, in time series, you use a model for forecasting or inference. Forecasting Yes, we can use the model. We still have consistent coefficient estimates, i.e. the coefficient will be roughly 1. So long as the coefficients are good, our forecasts are good. Word of warning, the process is explosive. This can be seen best by estimating prediction intervals. PI's will not have the usual sideways parabola-shape, rather they will have a sideways absolute value-shape Inference Generally no, you can't use the model. Deriving the variance of coefficient estimates is tricky in the presents of a unit root. Intuitively, however, a non-stationary process has no tendency to revert to its mean, implying an infinite variance. Said another way, variance increases to infinity as the number of observation increases, a bad asymptotic result. Further, with a infinite variance, we simply can't reject any null hypotheses. What about MA? Let's look at the MA representation of a unit root. We know that a simple AR(1), $y_t = \beta y_{t-1} + u_t$ , can be written as a MA( $\infty$ ), $y_t = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \beta^ju_{t-j}$ . When $\beta , we're ok, the impact of a shock will eventually die off. Even if $\beta = .9$ , $.9^{30}$ is small. However, when $\beta = 1$ , there is a big problem! Specifically, shocks never die off. Said another way, a shock today or a hundred years ago would have the same impact on the series, e.g. $1^{30} = 1$ . This makes a MA representation of a unit root process intractable.
