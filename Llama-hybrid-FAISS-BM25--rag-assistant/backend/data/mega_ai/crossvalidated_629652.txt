I had already found the answer on my own, but I didn't realize it. It seems right to share it anyway. I thought we needed to proceed differently and write other things. However, I thank everyone for their attention. I voted on everyone's answers The user Math-fun came close to what I was looking for and was kind in his explanation, but his answer wasn't what I was looking for. To solve the exercise I didn't have to count the number of goals and obtain for example p2 = 3/5 (as in the user's answer), but I had to count how many observations are less than or equal to 0, 1, and 2? So for example I didn't need p2= 3/5, but p2= 5/5 The solution to the exercise is this: If the goals scored are I know: Observation
