Are you by chance missing WebRole.cs and WebWorker.cs files in your roles? If they have been created by Visual Studio, are they pointing to valid non-Dev-Storage account? I don't know the new setting in v1.3 SDK, but in v1.2 SDK it was called DiagnosticsConnectionString in ServiceConfiguration.cscfg file in your CloudService project If both check out, please post your WebRole and WorkerRole files?
