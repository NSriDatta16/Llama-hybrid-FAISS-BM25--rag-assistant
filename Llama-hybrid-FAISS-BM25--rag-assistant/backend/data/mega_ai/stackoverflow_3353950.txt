Silverlight canvas scrollbars

I have read that placing a canvas inside a scrollviewer won't work because the canvas does not report its size. I have been experimenting with different containers (borders, grids, canvases and scrollviewers) and could really do with a simple explanation of how scrollviewers behave within nested containers. e.g. If I have a container hierarchy of UserControl>Grid1>Canvas1>ScrollViewer>Grid2>Canvas2 should scrollbars appear around Grid2 when Canvas2 becomes wider than Canvas1? (or indeed wider than UserControl) If not, how should I organise my containers so I can add loads of uielements to Canvas2 and have scrollbars appear as necessary. (My usercontrol width and height are set to 100%)
