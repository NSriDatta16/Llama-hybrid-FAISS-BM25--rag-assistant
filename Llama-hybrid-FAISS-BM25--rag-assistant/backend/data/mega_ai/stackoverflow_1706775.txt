Java RegEx - Regular expression to split a paragraph with start and end

I am new to java regex.Please help me. Consider the below paragraph, Paragraph : Name abc sadghsagh hsajdjah Name ggggggggg !!! Name ggg dfdfddfdf Name !!! Name hhhh sahdgashdg Name asjdhjasdh sadasldkalskd asdjhakjsdhja !!! i need to split the above paragraph as blocks of text starting with Name and ending with !!! . Here I dont want to use !!! as the only delimiter to split the paragraph.I need to include the starting sequence (Name) also in my regex. ie., my result api should looks like SplitAsBlocks("Paragraph","startswith Name","endswith !!!") How to achieve this ,please anyone help me ... Now i want the same output as Brito given ...but here i have added Name after "hsajdjah".Here it split the text as beow : Name ggggggggg !!! but i need Name abc sadghsagh hsajdjah Name ggggggggg !!! that is i have to match up Name which is at the starting of the line ,not in the middle . please suggest me ... Bart ...see the below input case for your code ... i need to split the following using ur API with parameter start => Name and end => ! But the output varies ..i have only 3 blocks starts with Name and ends with ! . i have attached the output also . String myInput = "Name hhhhh class0"+ "\n"+ "HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"+ "\n"+ "!"+ "\n"+ "Name TTTTT TTTT"+ "\n"+ "GGGGGG UUUUU IIII"+ "\n"+ "!"+ "\n"+ "Name JJJJJ WWWW"+ "\n"+ "IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII"+ "\n"+ "!"+ "\n"+ "RRRRRRRRRRR TTTTTTTT"+ "\n"+ "HHHHHH"+ "\n"+ "JJJJJ 1 Name class1"+ "\n"+ "LLLLL 5 Name class5"+ "\n"+ "!"+ "\n"+ "OOOOOO HHHH FFFFFF"+ "\n"+ "service 0 Name class12"+ "\n"+ "!"+ "\n"+ "JJJJJ YYYYYY 3/0"+ "\n"+ "KKKKKKK"+ "\n"+ "UUU UUU UUUUU"+ "\n"+ "QQQQQQQ"+ "\n"+ "!"; String[] tokens = tokenize(myInput, "Name", "!"); int n = 0; for(String t : tokens) { System.out.println("---------------------------\n"+(++n)+"\n"+t); } OutPut : --------------------------- 1 Name hhhhh class0 HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ! --------------------------- 2 Name TTTTT TTTT GGGGGG UUUUU IIII ! --------------------------- 3 Name JJJJJ WWWW IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII ! --------------------------- 4 Name class1 LLLLL 5 Name class5 ! --------------------------- 5 Name class12 !
