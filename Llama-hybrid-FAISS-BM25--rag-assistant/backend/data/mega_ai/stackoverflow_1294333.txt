While this doesn't answer your question necessary, it may help to solve it - I've been a long time fan of the LINQ to SQL and Entities tools by Huagati. The re-sync aspect alone has saved me so much time, it's well worth the $50 (for the standard version) IMO. http://www.huagati.com/dbmltools/ Hope it helps... Edit: In order to update the LINQ to SQL classes, you can either do it manually (bllurgh) or, you can remove them from the designer and drag-and-drop them from the Data Connections node in the Server Explorer.
