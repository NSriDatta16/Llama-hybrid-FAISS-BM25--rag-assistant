If your XML is correctly encoded, you shouldn't have a problem. My guess is that your XML isn't correct to start with. Rather than working round that, I'd strongly encourage you to fix everything to produce and consume the correct values. In particular, your retString should already have the correct Unicode values. If it doesn't, you're going to run into problems whatever you do. If it does have the right values, you should be able to just convert it into bytes using the UTF-8 charset, and feed those to the socket - so long as the XML declares itself as being in UTF-8 to start with. (It will default to UTF-8 if you don't specify anything else, so long as it doesn't start with a UTF-16 byte order mark.) I suggest you have a look at my Debugging Unicode Problems article: check the data at every step, not just by printing out the string but by looking at the individual codepoints within it. Do that at both the Java and .NET sides.
