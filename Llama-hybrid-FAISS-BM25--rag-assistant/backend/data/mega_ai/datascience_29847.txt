Is there libraries to analyze sequence with python You can take a look at here . You can also use TensorFlow if your task is sequence classification, but based on comments you have referred that your task is unsupervised. Actually, LSTMs can be used for unsupervised tasks too depending on what you want. Take a look at here . And is it right way to use Hidden Markov Models to cluster sequences? Markov hidden models are those that your current state does not depend on all previous states. If you your task has longterm dependencies, you can use LSTM networks. If your data does not have longterm dependencies you can use simple RNNs .
