AIC: can MAP estimate be used instead of ML estimate?

Is it reasonable to use an information criterion such as AIC in which the maximized likelihood function is replaced by the maximized posterior function? I know there are other criteria designed specifically for a bayesian setting, but I'm still curious about this adaptation of AIC.
