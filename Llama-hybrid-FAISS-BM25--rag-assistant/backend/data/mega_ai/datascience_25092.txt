XGBoost Predictions all the same

When I evaluate the model I seem to be getting a decent RMSE score but when I try to actually see the predictions when I call the model all my values are the same. xdata = xgboost.DMatrix(X_train, y_train, feature_names=all_vars) xdata_val = xgboost.DMatrix(X_valid, y_valid, feature_names=all_vars) xgb_parms['seed'] = random.randint(0,1e9) model = xgboost.train(xgb_parms, xdata) model.eval(xdata_val) ypred = model.predict(xdata_val) I believe the error is on my last step, what am I doing wrong?
