My team had the same issue. The concrete case was: using jMockit to mock static methods from a class in a unit-test suite running under TeamCity with EMMA as the coverage tool. The solution was the following: Add a tear-down method to each test which mocked static methods: @After public void tearDown() throws Exception { Mockit.tearDownMocks(ClassWithStaticMethods.class); }
