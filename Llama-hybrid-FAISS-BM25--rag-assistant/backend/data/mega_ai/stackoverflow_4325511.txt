The only connection between UA-123-1 and UA-123-2 is that they're organized under the same menu, and so permissions are managed in the same way. If two sites have nothing to do with each other, and you run up against a limit for UA-123-50 (if that is the limit), there's no drawback in beginning to move your new sites to UA-124-1. As a general organizational rule, the grouping of UA-123 is just organizational, not technological, since GA sends the data only to the full account specified (UA-123-4). So, sites tagged with UA-123-4 will never share data with sites tagged UA-123-1. As a matter of course, I try to keep related sites in the same UA account, and separate them with -1, -2, etc. One other important fact is that if you ever want to give someone Admin access to a particular part of your account, you can't. That is, to grant someone Admin access, they are given full access to everything under UA-123. The only level at which collisions of data can occur is at UA-123-1. If you put UA-123-1 on two separate sites (without filtering), both of the sites' data will appear in that account. So, there's no harm in creating many different accounts on the same login; I myself have dozens.
