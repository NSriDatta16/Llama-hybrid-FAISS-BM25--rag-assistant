Groovy Eclipse Plugin Organize Imports

I've been using the newest version of the groovy eclipse plugin (for eclipse 3.4) and I noticed that when I run organize imports on the file, it actually removes some of the imports that I need. It seems to remove the ones in my project, not java.* imports. Any ideas why? thanks, Jeff
