Non Techie User Ad hoc LINQ query builder

I am looking for a third party component which allows a non technical user to create simple adhoc LINQ queries by dragging and dropping the available fields and run it against a data model that I will be populating using Entity Framework. I've used http://devtools.korzh.com/eq/dotnet/ component previously to generate adhoc SQL queries but I want something similar for LINQ. I am looking for only simple query generator, the most complex queries will include group by on couple of columns with summation on say revenue field(Or any measure field). Do any of you guys know of any visually appealing tool already available in the market? If not then may be suggest an approach on how I can build it myself! Many Thanks Mithun
