Michael doesn't seem to be a user anymore, but I'll answer this anyway. Basically adding code to illustrate to Niko's answer, and being a little more specific. The way to apply transform.xsl to the output of combine_start.xsl [ObHalfLife2Reference] is: If I understand you to be saying that the output of combine_start.xsl is empty, then that's not a Cocoon issue but an XSLT issue... your combine_start.xsl is not working correctly. Given that start.xml is an index of files to feed into transform.xsl, the cinclude transformer is probably what you are looking for, rather than implementing a stylesheet to slurp them in. On the other hand if the contents of start.xml will never change, then as mentioned above, would be more efficient.
