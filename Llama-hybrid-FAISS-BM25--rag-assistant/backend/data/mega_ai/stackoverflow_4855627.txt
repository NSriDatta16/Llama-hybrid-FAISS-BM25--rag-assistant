Java MimetypesFileTypeMap always returning application/octet-stream on Android emulator

I am trying to determine the Mime/Media Type of files stored on an Android device (actually a virtual device I'm using with the emulator). I found this resource Get the MIME Type from a File which recommends the javax.activation.MimetypesFileTypeMap , however when I run the following code I get application/octet-stream for all file types: MimetypesFileTypeMap map = new MimetypesFileTypeMap(); File dir = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); File[] files = dir.listFiles(); String mimeType; for( int i = 0; i I have tested this with files having the following extensions: jpg, txt, doc, xslx and pdf and they all return the same thing. Is there something I have to do to initialize the map? Can this library not find the list of supported mime-types on Android? Is there a better way to get the mime type of a file on Android?
