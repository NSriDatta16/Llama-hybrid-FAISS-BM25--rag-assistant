Design support for templated UserControl

I have created a real simple templated UserControl using the following tutorial: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/36574bf6(VS.80).aspx I can now add this control to my mvc 2.0 application using: This is my awesome content! Test However, when I go to the designer, I get an exception: Type 'System.Web.UI.UserControl' does not have a public property named 'Content'. How can I fix this? I don't even need to use the drag-and-drop designer, just rendering the control will do fine. Thanks!
