Del.icio.us and GMail sold me on tags as opposed to other methods of organizing things. GMail's implementation is particularly intuitive: tags are like folders, but a single item can be in multiple folders (something Outlook hasn't figured out yet). Del.icio.us taught me the second concept: tags are like sets and applying unions and intersections can really narrow down what you are looking for. So, yes, IMO, tags are useful for navigation. Speaking of tags, if anyone is reading this who has the reputation to add tags... I really like the "Hidden Features of (WhateverTechOrLanguage)" articles. There is a "hidden-feature" tag, but it isn't applied to every one of those articles. If I had the reputation, I'd do it, but I didn't want add an "answer" telling them to tag. I know that as soon as I get 50 points of "Whoofie" I can at least add a comment asking them to tag it, but...
