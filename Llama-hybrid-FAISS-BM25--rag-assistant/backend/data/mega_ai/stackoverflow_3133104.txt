As per ... http://docs.jboss.org/jbossas/docs/Installation_And_Getting_Started_Guide/5/html/ch01.html#d0e525 1.5.3. jbossall-client.jar The client/jbossall-client.jar library that used to bundle the majority of jboss client libraries, is now referencing them instead through the Class-Path manifest entry. This allows swapping included libraries (e.g. jboss-javaee.jar) without having to re-package jbossall-client.jar. On the other hand, it requires that you have jbossall-client.jar together with the other client/*.jar libraries, so they can be found. Look at this post for a solution to: The newer versions of JBoss (I'm using 5.1.0 GA) very annoyingly have all the client jars split into at least 47 separate jars! Which is a bit rude when you consider the total number of jars they expect you to copy into your tomcat/lib dir is a whopping 93.
