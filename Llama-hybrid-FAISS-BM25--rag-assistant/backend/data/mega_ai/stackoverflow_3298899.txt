Reliable / Popular data visualization toolkit for the web

I'm looking for a reliable toolkit in any web-neutral[A] language, actively maintained / developed, stable that allows me to build graphs, charts, display data dynamically, allow drag-n-drop of datasets and refreshes automatically. Carlos Scheidegger recommended - http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ which looks great! But I'm looking to see what others are there and what ppl are using... [A] What I mean is something like js / jquery, etc. which can be generated by any web language like php, python, perl, etc
