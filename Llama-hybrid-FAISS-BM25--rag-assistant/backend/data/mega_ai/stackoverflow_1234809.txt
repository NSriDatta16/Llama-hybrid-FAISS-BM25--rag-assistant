Lazy... or philosophically sound? Lazy... and arrogant. By coding in a way that makes mistakes show up quickly, you protect the app against your own mistakes just as much as against the mistakes of others. Everyone makes more mistakes than they think. Of course, rather than adding more code to detect whether the config file and the parameter checking match, it would be much better if the parameter checking were based on the config file so that there's only one place where new values are added and an inconsistency is not possible.
