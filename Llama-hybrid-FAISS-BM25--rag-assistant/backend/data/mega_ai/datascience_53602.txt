Saving a different model for every epoch Keras

As part of a project I am currently running a CNN for classifying images. Right now I am training with 50 epochs. I have noticed that after around 20-30 epochs I reach the highest accuracy and then the loss starts to increase significantly. I thought about using Early Stopping but my model loss has a lot of zig-zagging so I think it would be difficult to find the right patience argument to use. I think it would be easier to just save a model for every epoch so I can manually select the one with the highest accuracy. Is this possible in Keras?
