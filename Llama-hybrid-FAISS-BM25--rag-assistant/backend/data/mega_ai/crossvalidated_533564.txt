Mixed design nightmare

I hope you can steer me in the right direction. I'm helping a colleague analysing a dataset that consists of: one dependent variable ( value ) measured 3 times ( observation ) by 3 people ( evaluator ) on the 2 sides ( side - right/left) of an individual (~150 individuals) several independent variables: one continuous ( age ), and 2 discrete ( sex , ancestry ). the data also has NA has some evaluators skipped over a few individuals in one or more of the observation points. His main questions concern the reproducibility of measurements and effect of independent variables: for reproducibility I used intraclass correlation coefficients with relative success; to look at the effect of independent variables, I would normally use some form of a linear model (ANOVA/ANCOVA). However, I'm worried about the lack of independence between observations, basically the first assumption of a lot of these tests. I tried looking at mixed models (e.g. using 1 between subjects factor ( sex ) and 2 within subjects factors ( evaluator & observation ) ), but I couldn't find good examples of this application (particularly using R), and mixed models seem to focus on evaluating the impact of these within subject factors, when in fact I mostly just want to control for these and focus on the effect of the independent factors. Questions : (1) Could I assume independence? (2) What would be an appropriate design model (@RobertLong 's correction)? (3 - slightly off topic) Any R pointers are welcome. Update Following Robert Long's answer, I'm now working with a mixed model that looks like this lme(value ~ sex * side + age + ancestry + evaluator, data = L, random = ~1|individual, method = "ML", na.action = na.exclude) (using Andy Field's book) However, now I have more questions: (1) How to follow up (especially considering that I want to understand the effect of sex while controlling for the effect of ´evaluator´. Would contrast be a good option? (2) Reading on this, I realised that lack of independence will also be an issue for the ICC I calculated. Could I calculate them from the mixed model? (Based on this: Computing repeatability of effects from an lmer model )
