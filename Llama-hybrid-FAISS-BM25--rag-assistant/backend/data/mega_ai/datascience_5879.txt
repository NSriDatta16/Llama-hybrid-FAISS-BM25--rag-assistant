Start with neural nets. They are the basic building blocks of Deep Learning. Neural Nets for Newbies video is a well-explained introduction. CS-449 from Willamette University is an free and approachable class in neural networks. That should lay the foundation for more advanced Deep Learning material. Deep Learning by Bengio, Goodfellow, and Courville is a quality book on the subject.
