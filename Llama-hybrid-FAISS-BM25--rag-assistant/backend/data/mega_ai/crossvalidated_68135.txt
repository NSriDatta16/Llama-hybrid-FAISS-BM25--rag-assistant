Is this question related to your question here ? Do you want to assess the effect of treatment on disease, with matched (paired) individuals? Anyway, the difference between conditional logistic regression and GEE is the interpretation. If you want to get subject specific estimate, you can use conditional logistic regression (e.g. clogit in R ), otherwise for population average estimate, you can use GEE (e.g. R package gee ). Note that the reason to use multilevel models is the correlation within paired data.
