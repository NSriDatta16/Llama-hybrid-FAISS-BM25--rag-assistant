The trouble here is that in this example TreeMap is acting like an interface. You can treat it as such by overriding all its methods to forwarding. It's not like there is much state in an empty TreeMap . However, that is a fragile approach as new methods (or ones you've missed) wont be handled. Perhaps your class does not need to be a Map . You could create an interface appropriate for your code, but an asMap / asSortedMap / asNavigableMap for use with libraries and non-specific code.
