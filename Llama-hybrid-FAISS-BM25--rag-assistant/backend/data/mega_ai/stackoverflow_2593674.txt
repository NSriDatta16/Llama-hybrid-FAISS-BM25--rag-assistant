I don't think event listeners are necessarily the way to go. You use an event listener to do something upon detection of something else. ie) listening for a mouse down on a ui component = detect mouse down, do drag operation. Given your example I think you just need to chain your functions together. It looks like your addUser function saves the user to the same source as your list users gets data from, so in your position I would call the listUsers httpService at the end of the add user result to refresh your data populating the datagrid. httpListService.send() I don't see your result handler for httpListService but that's where you update the data in your dataGrid. good luck, and please post back with any complications.
