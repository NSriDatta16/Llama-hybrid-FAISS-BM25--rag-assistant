Serialization is another method of persistent storage. You can create a class that implements Serializable with a field for each piece of data you want to store. Then you can write the entire class out to a file, and you can read it back in later. I believe the Serializable interface outputs the class into some sort of binary/hex representation. There are other ways to to do serialization without using the standard Java serialization, like you can use a JSON library.
