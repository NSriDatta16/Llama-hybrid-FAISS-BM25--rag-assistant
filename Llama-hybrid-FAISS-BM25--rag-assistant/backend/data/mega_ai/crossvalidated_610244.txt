Random Forest--prioritizing response variables

Is there a way to prioritize response variables in a random forest model, ideally in R? For example, suppose I want to predict tree height based on elevation, aspect, slope, and tree canopy cover. In theory, if I have areas of no vegetation, and I only use elevation, aspect, and slope, so no variable that would signify the presence of trees, I can still predict a tree height. And if I add tree canopy cover to my model, where larger values of tree cover would mean greater tree heights, then I might still have areas of no trees where the model predicts a tree height. So is there a way to make the variable tree canopy cover more important in the random forest model? Ideally, I would like for areas where canopy cover = 0 the model to predict tree height = 0. And the higher the canopy cover, the higher the tree height. I could just use the variable canopy cover to predict canopy height but I know that all the other variables also play a role in the tree height. I found information on applying weights to a random forest model, but in those cases the weight is applied to the predicted variable. For example if tree height was a categorical variable of three classes, by using weights, I could tell the model how many observations to use from each class. But I would like to apply weights on my response variables. There are two other resources that refer to case.weights() but I am still not sure how to proceed. Handling case weight in the Random Forest packages in R https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75150837/assigning-weights-to-variables-in-random-forest-model-in-r I am mainly using randomForest and ranger packages in R but I am open to other packages, too.
