Got this from my question at the EpiServer CMS forum: http://world.episerver.com/Forum/Pages/thread.aspx?id=27574&pageIndex=1 RE:Custom Page Providers Post by: Johan Bj√∂rnfot on 03 February 2009, 13:43:28 You do not have to store any meta information in your backend storage. There is helper methods in PageProviderBase, e.g. InitializePageData (sets metadata properties) and SetPropertyValues (sets meta and/or custom proeprties) that helps you with initialization of PageData objects. So the answers to your questions: It sounds like PageProvider could fit well for your purpose. Use InitializePageData to handle MetaDatas (InitializePageData will set default values for meta properties e.g. status to published and so on). If you however want to set dome other meta data property value than the default ones e.g. status (Publish etc.) you can do that by calling SetPropertyValues afterwards. If additional data needs to be stored outside backing storage there are several options for this (custom table in db, filebased etc.). Which one to use is dependent on your environment, type of data to store etc.
