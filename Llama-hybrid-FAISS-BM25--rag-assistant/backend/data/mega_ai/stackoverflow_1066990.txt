Applying DATABASE_OPTIONS when testing Django project (or make it to use InnoDB for MySQL)

As the title says, I want to apply DATABASE_OPTIONS settings when I run my tests via ./manage.py test . In django/db/backends/creation.py , it does not consider this option at all in both create_test_db() and _create_test_db() . This breaks a test with a view that uses transaction.rollback function with InnoDB. It seems that test databases are not created with InnoDB storage engine. Is there any workaround or fix to this problem?
