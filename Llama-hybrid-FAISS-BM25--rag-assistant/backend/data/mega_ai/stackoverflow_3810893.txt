How to start a java-web-start application and wait until it exits?

I just found out that javaws -wait doesn't do what is supposed to do on Windows. It will return before the aplication finishes. This bug is more than 5 years old and closed as won't fix 6281477 , so we need a workaround. I looking for a clean solution that will: run unattended (no user intervention): currently if JNLP file is not accessible, Java will display an error window. if application fails for any reason we need a return code different from 0 It would be preferable to have a cross platform solution for this Java or Python but it would be acceptable even a Windows batch solution.
