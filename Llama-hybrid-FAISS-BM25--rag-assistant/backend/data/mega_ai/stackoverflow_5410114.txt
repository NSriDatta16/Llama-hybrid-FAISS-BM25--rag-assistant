What does "push a controller onto another controller" mean?

I have a FirstViewController which is my root navigation controller . I have a compose button and I want to display the TTMessage Composer modally on click. This works fine. The problem is that there is no navigation bar to cancel the composer, so I have to add one. This how it looks like without a navigation bar by just presenting the message composer ( TTMessageController ) modally. I found this from three20 google group: Before you present the message controller, you have to create a navigation controller, push the message controller onto it, and then present the navigation controller modally. It seems like the solution for my problem but I do not understand it. Can anyone explain it with a little bit of code? I now the navigation controller from the objects panel and I can drag it on my nib files but what does it mean in this case? And what means "push"?
