How to calculate the error bar (e.g. stdev.s) for a slope based on independent samples?

In my experiment, I prepared 6 identical samples in the beginning. At Time 1, 3 samples were sacrificed and analysed; at Time 2, the rest 3 samples were sacrificed and analysed. So I got the data as below. The slope (-0.5243) is obtained as the rate. Can I ask how to caculate the error bar of the slope? Do I need to do this experiment e.g. three times, and get three slopes to draw the error bar? I do not think I can simply get three slopes from these 6 data points. Because I can get a slope either from "Time2_repeat1 - Time1_repeat1" or "Time2_repeat2 - Time1_repeat1". Is there a particular definition for the slope, e.g. "average slope", "individual slope"? Time repeat1 repeat2 repeat3 average STDEV.S 1 0.8628 0.8675 0.8661 0.8655 0.0024 2 0.3445 0.3343 0.3448 0.3412 0.0060 Thank you Glen_b. I have attached it as below according to your words. Can I ask, 1) I use "VAR.S" for the VAR, is that correct? 2) When you say "standard error", do you mean "standard error of the mean"? If I can calculate the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) by: SEM = STDEV.S/sqrt(count(n)) Thank you.
