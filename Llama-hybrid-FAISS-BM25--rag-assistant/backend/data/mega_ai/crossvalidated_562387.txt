PCA explained variance and model inertia

I'm trying to perform a PCA to reduce the dimensionality of my data and subsequently perform a K-Means algorithm. I initially chose 4 Principal Components because they explain 70% of my variance. This, however, leads to model inertia of roughly 1500. With only 2 Principal Components -- that explain 55% of my variance -- the model inertia is only 600. How do I find the balance between these two measurements, namely explained variance and model inertia? What should I prioritize? Should I do something completely different?
