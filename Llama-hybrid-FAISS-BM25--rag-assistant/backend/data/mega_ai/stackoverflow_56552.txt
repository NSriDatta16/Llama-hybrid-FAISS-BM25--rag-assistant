You could check out a rev.7450 copy somewhere, then export your 7500 copy (to remove the .svn folders). Drag the exported copy (which is the latest copy) over the 7450 copy. All the new files should simply overwrite the older ones, leaving the .svn folders the same. Subversion will assume you just made a bunch of changes to 7450, and the next checkin will set it as 7451.
