That was your early Thanksgiving treat from Apple. They sent a docset 3.1 "update" out about 4-5 days ago and F'ed up alot of peoples documentation. It's basically unusable for me right now...I can't do anything without having do dismiss a never-ending barage of "page not found" error dialogs. It also trashed 50% of the favorites links I had on the left panel of documents. I assume these were from the docsets it now want's me to re-subscribe to but gives an error every time I try. Haven't seen alot of posts about it yet so I would bet that Apple will likely do nothing. If it were possible to get a human on the phone over there I would have some answers to go along with the frustration. Happy Thanksgiving PS. Best to turn OFF the auto-update option in documentation. If not for having that option ON I'd currently be oblivious to this issue and capable of viewing my documentation.
