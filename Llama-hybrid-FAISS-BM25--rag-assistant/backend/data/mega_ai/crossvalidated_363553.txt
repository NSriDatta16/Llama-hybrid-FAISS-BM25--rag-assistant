Matthew Honnibal, who created Spacy, answered me : The full answer is rather complicated :). I've written a few blog posts over the years to make it more accessible. The best place to start is this blog post: https://explosion.ai/blog/parsing-english-in-python Since v2, we use a more complicated machine learning strategy, following the general architecture described here: https://explosion.ai/blog/deep-learning-formula-nlp . More specifics about the model architecture can be found in this description of the NER model: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqDHBH9IjRU The transition system is mostly described by this paper: http://aclweb.org/anthology/D15-1162 , but with some modifications for sentence segmentation. I already started with the first one which I didn't completly understand yet. I will update this post through my reading progress but leave the question open if a concise question comes to your mind.
