UIImageView with stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth doesn't stretch image

I'm trying to stretch an Image in a UIImageView - but I fail miserably :) Following setup: NIB-File with a view and a UIImageView attached to this view. Wired to my class using IBOutlet UIImageView *background . Now, in my class I try the following: UIImage *bgImage = [[UIImage imageNamed:@"myImage.png"] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:0 topCapHeight:50]; [background setImage: bgImage]; bgFrame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 250, 200); background.frame = bgFrame; which should stretch the image vertically - at least, that's what I thought. Alas, it's not working... :( The image I'm using has a height of 115px (which should be enough for the stretch, I guess?)
