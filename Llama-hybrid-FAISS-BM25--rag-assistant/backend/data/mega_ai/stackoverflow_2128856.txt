This is why QTP doesn't by default use the title as part of the description of the Browser . You should note that the description of the Page doesn't have to be strict since there is only one Page per Browser at any given time (different Page s only exist in order to help organize the object repository). You may want to examine using the "open title" property in the description, since this doesn't change during navigation.
