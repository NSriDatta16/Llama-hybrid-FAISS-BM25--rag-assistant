GET when showing data POST when modifying data session when storing data between requests that doesn't need to stay after the session expires database (or other persistent storage) for data that needs to hang around between sessions Cookies; more or less never. Anything that you would put there could almost always be better stored in the session. Perhaps for persistent logins, only. Hidden fields; again, almost never, use a session and keep the data safe on the server. Sometimes used as storage points for data collected via javascript, but that's it.
