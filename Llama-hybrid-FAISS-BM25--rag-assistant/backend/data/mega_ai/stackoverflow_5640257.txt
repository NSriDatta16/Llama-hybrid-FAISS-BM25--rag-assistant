Http headers to cache a dynamic page

I have a classic html page generated with PHP. For this page (served from a same URL) we have 2 cases: The user is logged (cookie based) => the page is specific to the user (we display a box with user name + personal information.) The user is not logged in => the page is common to all the user. How can I set the header to: have the most agressive cache (with a max-age of 60). avoid mixing pages between users. Can I replace my present header: header("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate"); header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false); header("Pragma: no-cache"); With this? header('Cache-Control: public, max-age=60'); header('Vary: *'); Edit : Is it possible (how) to have it Cache-controled private in case "1" and public in case "2"
