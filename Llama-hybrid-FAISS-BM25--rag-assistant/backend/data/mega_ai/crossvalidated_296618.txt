Given sufficient width or depth (in practice depth), a neural network can learn to associate longitude/latitude pairs. it's not even very hard. That's not your problem. In fact, given the highly non-linear relation between the 4 coordinates, it makes much sense. I'm not sure why you're using only a few bits of grid coordinates - looks like 3. That's quite low. This means most GPS errors are ignored, but those that aren't are immediately severe (whole grid block off). Other forms of clustering are similarly problematic. From practical experience (came to work by bike this morning), the chief predictor is the weather. Rain = car.
