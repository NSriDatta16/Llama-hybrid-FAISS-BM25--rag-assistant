As Brian Campbell mentioned, you can use the validation_class_methods plugin. It's not recommended, but it is supported. The validation_helpers plugin gives you similar helpers that the validation_class_methods plugin gives you, for use as instance methods inside the validate method. Writing validations as instance methods is a better approach, IMO, which is why Sequel encourages it. Validations are inherently an instance level activity, not a class level activity. With the class level validations, handling things like conditional validation has to have special syntax (like :if=>proc{} ), where you can just use normal conditional ruby statements in the instance method (such as if , else , case , etc.). Obviously, if you are coming from ActiveRecord, it's a different approach. Sequel does not attempt to clone ActiveRecord's behavior, though the two libraries operate similarly in some respects.
