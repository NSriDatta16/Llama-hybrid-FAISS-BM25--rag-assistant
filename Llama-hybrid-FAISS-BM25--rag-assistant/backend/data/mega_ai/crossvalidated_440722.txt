This is a lot to tackle. Here are some initial thoughts and questions: Have you run a variance components model, that is a model with just your outcome and the nesting structure specified in lmer ? This will allow you calculate the variance partition coefficient/intraclass correlation coefficient, which tells you the degree to which variation in your outcome is between subID as such: $${}(VPC/ICC) =\frac{\sigma^2(subID)}{\sigma^2(subID)+\sigma^2(resid)}$$ If the VPC/ICC is very small (say Is there a way you might reconstruct your data so that the C variable gets exactly what you want directly out of the regression model? You are interested in the contrast between the average reaction time of C2, C3, and C4 vs C1, right? I'm not sure how your data is set-up other than it's "long" with each subject having multiple rows. What do the rows correspond to? If they correspond to the 4 C conditions, each then either being A1 or A2, could you not set them up so that they correspond to a C1 row and then an average of C2-C4 for each of A and B? Then your model would be similar except whatever you call the C2-C4 average would go in as a predictor. Barring #2, check out the multcomp() package as I linked in my comment.
