MCMC is a family of sampling methods (Gibbs, MH, etc.). The point of MCMC is that you cannot sample directly from the posterior distribution that you mentioned. The way MCMC works is a Markov Chain (the first MC in MCMC) is identified whose stationary distribution is the posterior that you are interested in. You can sample from this Markov Chain and when it converges to its equilibrium distribution, you are essentially sampling from the posterior distribution that you are interested in.
