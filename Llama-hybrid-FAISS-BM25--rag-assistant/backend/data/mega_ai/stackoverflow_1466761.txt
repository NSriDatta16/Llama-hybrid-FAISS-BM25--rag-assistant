Thanks to the help of Tuzo, I could figure out a way of working this around. I added a method to ExcelStorage class to change the while end condition. Instead of looking at the first cell for empty value, I look at all cells in the current row to be empty. If that's the case, return false to the while. This is the change to the while part of ExtractRecords: while (!IsEof(cRow, mStartColumn, RecordFieldCount)) instead of while (CellAsString(cRow, mStartColumn) != String.Empty) IsEof is a method to check the whole row to be empty: private bool IsEof(int row, int startCol, int numberOfCols) { bool isEmpty = true; string cellValue = string.Empty; for (int i = startCol; i Of course if the user leaves an empty row between two data rows the rows after that one will not be processed, but I think is a good thing to keep working on this. Thanks
