Importance of original variables after PCA

I have a data frame in R containing four variables. I ran a PCA which showed that first two principal components mostly explain much of the variance in my data. I know that principal components are linear combinations of the original variables. Now how do I find out which combination(s) of my original variables give rise to these PCs? Thanks
