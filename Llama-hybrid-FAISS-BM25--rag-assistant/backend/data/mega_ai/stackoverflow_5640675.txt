Windows Media Player Control (winforms) - capture current frame as bitmap?

I am using Windows Media Player control in a winforms app, I would like to periodically capture the playing frame into a bitmap and save it locally. Does WMP expose the current playing frame? Surely the WMP librarty should expose the current frame, but I have looked all over for it to no avail...pls help. p.s. I am looking for a more elegant approach than the hack method of capture the screen and cropping it.
