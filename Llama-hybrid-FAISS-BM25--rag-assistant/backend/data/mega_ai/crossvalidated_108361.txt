Obtaining posteriors for exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses

I'm trying to solve a Bayesian problem where I have two mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses: $H_1$ and $H_2$. Given Baye's formula: $$P(H|D) = \frac{P(H)P(D|H)}{P(D)}$$ (where $D$ is my data) I've read that one way to obtain the posteriors $P(H_1|D)$ and $P(H_2|D)$, is to create a table like this one: P(H) (prior) | P(D|H) (Likelihood) | ____________________________________________________ H1 | P(H1) | L(H1) | P(H1)*L(H1) H2 | P(H2) | L(H2) | P(H2)*L(H2) Then summing the values in the third column I get the normalization constant $P(D)$ as: $$P(D) = P(H_1)L(H_1) + P(H_2)L(H_2)$$ which yields for each hypothesis the posteriors as: $$P(H_1|D) = \frac{P(H_1)L(H_1)}{P(H_1)L(H_1) + P(H_2)L(H_2)}$$ $$P(H_2|D) = \frac{P(H_2)L(H_2)}{P(H_1)L(H_1) + P(H_2)L(H_2)}$$ My knowledge in statistics is not much and I haven't been able to confirm this anywhere else. Could someone tell me if this is correct?
