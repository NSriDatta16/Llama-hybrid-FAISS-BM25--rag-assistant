Switch google adsense ad (mobile vs regular) based on user agent

I'm optimizing a site so that on a mobile browser it only shows the mobile adsense ad, and on desktop it only shows the regular one. Problem is the google code leaves a white space where these ads are on the page. I want to know if there is an easy way to programmatically insert the ad (JS) based on the user agent. Thanks.
