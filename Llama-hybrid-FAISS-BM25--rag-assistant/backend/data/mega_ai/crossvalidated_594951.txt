Whether this inference is Bayesian-like depends far too much on the unspecified meaning of "like". Silly or not, this aspect of the question is unanswerable in this format. Bayesian inference is not synonymous with any use of previously-existing beliefs while evaluating evidence. Bayesian inference is a form of probabilistic inference that requires specifying probability distributions, including a prior , which is absent from this inference about eating cereal. As for an event itself being Bayesian, I agree with Christian Hennig's answer : Making reference to the headline, in any case it's not the event that could be Bayesian, but rather your reasoning about it.
