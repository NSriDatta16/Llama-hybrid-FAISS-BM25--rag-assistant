You can use the multi-argument constructors of the URI class. From the URI javadoc: The multi-argument constructors quote illegal characters as required by the components in which they appear. The percent character ('%') is always quoted by these constructors. Any other characters are preserved. So if you use URI uri = new URI("http", "www.google.com?q=a b"); Then you get http:www.google.com?q=a%20b which isn't quite right, but it's a little closer. If you know that your string will not have URL fragments (e.g. http://example.com/page#anchor ), then you can use the following code to get what you want: String s = "http://www.google.com?q=a b"; String[] parts = s.split(":",2); URI uri = new URI(parts[0], parts[1], null); To be safe, you should scan the string for # characters, but this should get you started.
