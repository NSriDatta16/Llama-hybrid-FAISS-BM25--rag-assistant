Help with Wikibooks WikiDraw Obj-C application

I decided to start learning some Obj-C. And I thought that Wikibooks wikidraw application would be a good place to start (after some very basic "Hello World" programs). I've followed the chapters and now I'm at the end of "WikiDraws view class". So now I'm supposed to be able to compile and run. Of course it dosen't work. I got a lot of errors at first but i have fixed most of them, only 6 remaining. This is one of them: - (void) mouseDragged:(NSPoint) pt { NSPoint np; np.x = pt.x - _anchor.x; np.y = pt.y - _anchor.y; if ( _dragState == 0) { // dragging of object [self offsetLocationByX:np.x byY:np.y]; } else if ( _dragState >= 1 && _dragState [self setBounds:nb]; } } - (NSRect) newBoundsFromBounds:(NSRect) old forHandle:(int) whichOne withDelta:(NSPoint) p { // figure out the desired bounds from the old one, the handle being dragged and the new point. NSRect nb = old; switch( whichOne ) { .......... So at NSRect nb = [self newBoundsFromBounds:... I get an error message, "Invailid initializer" and "WKDShape may not respond to '-newBoundsFromBounds:forHandle:withDelta:"- . What should I do? I'm new to coding but eager to learn. /Carl-Philip
