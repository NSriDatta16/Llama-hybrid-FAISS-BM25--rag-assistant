I guess yours is a randomized trial. If it is not, then the whole intention-to-treat (ITT) vs as-treated (AT) vs per-protocol (PP) Mexican standoff is meaningless (eg McCoy, 2017 ). Accordingly, if they were not randomized, you could exclude them and still consider the corresponding analysis as an ITT one. Otherwise, if they were unluckily randomized, then you should include them in the ITT analysis. You can always skip them in the PP analysis. The bottomline is indeed that if you exclude them and call the corresponding analysis ITT, you will most likely find someone in a journal or an organization who will recommend you not to, and any discrepancy would undermine the whole trial.
