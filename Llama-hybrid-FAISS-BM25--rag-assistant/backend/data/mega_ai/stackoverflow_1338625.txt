I found a survey from June 2009 that answer your question: Survey of Agent Based Modelling and Simulation Tools Au. R.J. Allan Abstract Agent Based Modelling and Simulation is a computationally demanding technique based on discrete event simulation and having its origins in genetic algorithms. It is a powerful technique for simulating dynamic complex systems and observing “emergent” behaviour. The most common uses of ABMS are in social simulation and optimisation problems, such as traffic flow and supply chains. We will investigate other uses in computational science and engineering. ABMS has been adapted to run on novel architectures such as GPGPU (e.g. nVidia using CUDA). Argonne National Laboratory have a Web site on Exascale ABMS and have run models on the IBM BlueGene with funding from the SciDAC Programme. We plan to organise a workshop on ABMS methodolgies and applications in summer of 2009. Keywords agent based modelling, Archaeology http://epubs.cclrc.ac.uk/bitstream/3637/ABMS.pdf
