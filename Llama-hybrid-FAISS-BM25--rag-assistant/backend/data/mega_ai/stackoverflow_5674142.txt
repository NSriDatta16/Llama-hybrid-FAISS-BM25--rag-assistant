dijit.Tree: How to update tree after pasteItem call?

I have a custom implementation of a tree model for a file explorer tree. This tree should also support drag n drop, so I wrote the pasteItem method of my tree as follows: pasteItem: function(childItem, oldParentItem, newParentItem, bCopy){ var oldParentItemFiles = new Array(); for(var idx in oldParentItem.files) { if(oldParentItem.files[idx].name != childItem.name) { oldParentItemFiles.push(oldParentItem.files[idx]); } } newParentItem.files.push(childItem); childItem.parent = newParentItem; } I debugged the function and as far as I could see the variables are modified correctly. However, the function is properly called and runs without an error, also the drag-n-drop dialog is shown but the tree does not change. Is there something like a render() method that I have to call after?
