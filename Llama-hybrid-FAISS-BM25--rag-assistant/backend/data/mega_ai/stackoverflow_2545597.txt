You should look at your Crash Logs. Open Organizer, select your device, then the "Crash Log" tab. Scroll down to find your app's logs. The should be symbolicated, so you can see the stack trace. Without actually debugging your app, it's really hard to say more. Are you using an #ifdef DEBUG macros? Are you using more than one thread? If you have a bunch of NSLog statements that slow down execution in debug mode, this can introduce subtle timing differences that can impact multi-threaded apps. Did you try a 'make clean' on your debug version? Sometimes obscure bugs can be hidden when parts of your project are rebuilt while other parts are unchanged.
