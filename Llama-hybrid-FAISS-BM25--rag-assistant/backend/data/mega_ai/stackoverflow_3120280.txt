Even if everyone on the team is a good English speaker (which is not a given), they may not necessarily know the English equivalent of all the business terminology. I think it's a project-specific decision what to allow, but I would generally tolerate and in some cases encourage business terms (e.g. entity names) in the local language, but not technical terms (i.e. not Largeur/Hauteur instead of Width/Height). For example in the financial world in France, everyone knows what is meant by OPCVM and FCP - if you attempt English translations you might end up with more misunderstandings than you do by allowing mixed languages.
