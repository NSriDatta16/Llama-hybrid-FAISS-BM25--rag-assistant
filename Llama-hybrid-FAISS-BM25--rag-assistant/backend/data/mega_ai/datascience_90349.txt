Terminology to distinguish between ML methods and optimization methods (PSO, ACO..)

I am currently writing a scientific thesis which consists of two parts. In the first part I am building ML models with neural networks, support vectors etc. and the second part is about finding global minima for optimization objectives with optimization methods like Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, Simulated Annealing etc. When writing about the parts in the introductory part, I would write machine learning methods when referring to the first part and metaheuristic optimization methods when referring to the second part. Is it possible to distinguish them like this?
