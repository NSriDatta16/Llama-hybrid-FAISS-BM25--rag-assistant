Split data on different users: multi-criteria optimization?

I have data for binary classification (red/non-red). The data comes from different users with ids 1-N. Data from different ids have a) different distributions of red examples and also b) different number of examples. The first table illustrates this. id # red 1 100 .3 2 200 .1 3 100 .166 ================== total: 400 weighted avg: 0.165 I need to split the the dataset - create two samples containing all the data. Each of the samples should: a) contain data from distinct ids, b) have ratio of 1:M in number of examples (1:3 for example), and c) have the same distribution of red examples (= same as the weighted average of all examples). The desired result (M=3) could look like this: ids sample # weighted avg of red 1,2 1 300 0.1667 3 2 100 0.166 What algorithms could solve this? I have limited knowledge of optimization algorithms but I think this is called multi-criteria optimization (we optimize for two things: example count and red ratio). However, the theory is vast and I don't know where to start.
