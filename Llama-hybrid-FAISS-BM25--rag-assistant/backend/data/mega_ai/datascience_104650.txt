Your problem is not well defined. I suppose you want to estimate/predict the growth based on some explanatory variables, so $y(X)$ . First you need to define what $y$ actually is, an (absolute) amount or a growth rate? You can for instance formulate a linear model like: $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + X + u$$ to measure the absolute amount of $y$ contingent on some $X$ . Alternatively, you can also look at how $y$ changes, when $X$ changes by using a $log$ transformation on either $y$ or $X$ . See this for more details. To apply such models, you would generally use linear regression . However, if you are simply up to making a prediction (and you are not necessarily interested in interpreting regression coefficients in order to find average marginal effects of $X$ on $y$ ), you can use many different model types in sklearn . It is standard to include several explanatory variables ( $X$ ), so this is not an issue. See the various sklearn examples, such as this one . If you are simply up to prediction, you may start with a random forest regression (since this is most robust and often works well). First, split your data into a train and test set . Second, run a random forest on the train set, Third, test your model based on the test set.
