As there is no generally accepted / unique way to specify (uninformative) priors, and as different priors will lead to a different credible intervals, it seems obvious that the coverage of Bayesian CIs is not fixed, but will depend on the prior that you choose, in relation to the "true" parameter values. It will generally also depend on the data, in particular on the size of the data - in a low data situation, the prior dominates the CI, with the mentioned consequences of a strong prior influence on the coverage. When moving to large data / asymptotics, the Bayesian CI and the frequentist CI will usually become increasingly similar, including their coverage properties.
