Essentially you want to record the mouse position, then absolutely position the element based on where the mouse is, and on mouse up serialise the coordinates and save them. You could either send them to the server via ajax, or (depending on context), save them into the users local storage. That would have the benefit of avoiding a server round trip if the use case is fairly trivial. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable is a nice example of how this would work without having to do the difficult parts!
