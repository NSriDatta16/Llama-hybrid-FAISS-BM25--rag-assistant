$9.5/5- A union of the form union { member-specification } ; is called an anonymous union; it defines an unnamed object of unnamed type . My guess that it should be static so that the object can be initialized as per the rule of global static objects. If it is not static and the object does not have a name, then how does one initialize it? EDIT2: On rethinking... Members of anonymous unions have internal linkage. Further by default global names have external linkage unless they have internal linkage. If the name of the anonymous union has external linkage, it is not possible for the members of the anonymous union to have internal linkage. Therefore anonymous unions are declared with 'static' storage class specifier so that the anonymous name itself has internal linkage.
