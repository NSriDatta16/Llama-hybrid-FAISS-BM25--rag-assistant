Azure And Silverlight: Error - Could not download silverlight application

I am trying to get started with Azure so that we can port an existing Silverlight app to Azure. Problem: On running the Windows Azure project that contains Silverlight web app in web role, a blank page is displayed in browser due to error 2104: Could not download Silverlight application. Check web server settings Things that I have tried .xap mime type is registered for the Default Web Site in IIS7. Even the applicationHost.config file contains the right entries. I have restarted the storage and compute emulators and performed IIS reset. I also tried to put the following code in the silverlight app web.config But this caused a compile error. Something tot he effect of not being able to attach the debugger to iis worker... Any ideas how I can fix this issue?
