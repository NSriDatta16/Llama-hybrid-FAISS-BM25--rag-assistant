No, it is not possible to duplicate this behavior. The way to achieve the same effect is to use a callback in your code, so you can do something like: myPrompt('Hello, mate, whats yer name?', function(answer) { alert(answer); }); EDIT : Based on your code, why not do this? $ = function(i) {return document.getElementById(i);} _prompt = function(prompt, callback) { $('prompt').style.display = ''; $('q').value = ''; $('ok').onclick = function() { callback($('q').value); } } _prompt('Name?', function(answer) { alert(answer); }); If you change alert(answer); to say... gAnswer = answer; (notice no var declaration) you would be creating a global variable named gAnswer that you could access anywhere else in the javascript code, assuming the prompt was already answered. If you're concerned of global variables polluting your space you could wrap it all in a closure, but it should be fine otherwise.
