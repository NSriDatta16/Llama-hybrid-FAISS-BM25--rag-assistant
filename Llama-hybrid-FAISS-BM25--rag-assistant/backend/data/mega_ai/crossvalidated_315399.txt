One way of thinking about this is to consider model averaging with AIC based weights proportional to $\exp(-AIC/2)$, which would be normalized to sum to 1. That illustrates that even at AIC difference of 2 the seemingly less well fitting model still gets a non-negligible weight. Thus, selecting a single model is very problematic due to the considerable model uncertainty and should typically not be done. Model averaging is usually a much better approach.
