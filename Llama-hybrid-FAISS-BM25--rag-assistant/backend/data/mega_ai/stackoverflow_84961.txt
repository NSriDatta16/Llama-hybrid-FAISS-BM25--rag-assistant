Basically, the compiler will reorder the components of your record types, unless you use the pragma PACK or the pragma PRESERVE_LAYOUT commands with your record types. Also, the compiler will pad objects to maintain the alignment of record components. Components follow: Integer: 8, 16, or 32 bit twos-complement signed numbers Float: 32-bit IEEE format Long_Float: 64-bit IEEE format Fixed-Point: 8, 16, or 32 bit; however, the range and delta specified can affect being 16 or 32 Enumerations: Integer, usually first element is represented by 0 Booleans: Enumeration object, 8 bits long, The LSB stores the value: 0 = false, 1 = true Characters: Enumeration object, 8 bits long, unsigned 0 through 127 Access Types: 32 bits, 32-bit value of 0 represents NULL Arrays: stored contiguously in row-major order, size depends on base type. The array is padded to ensure all elements have the proper alignment for their types.
