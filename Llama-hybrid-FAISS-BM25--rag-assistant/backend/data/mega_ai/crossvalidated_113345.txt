No. of respondents in the treatment group - no. of respondents in control group / Total no. of people in the treatment group This formula doesn't take into account impact control respondents have on the control total population make doesn't account for the population in the control group fully. Think about having a test population with great response but population less than 1000 vs control with significantly slightly higher response with 1 million population. Check this link out that has some simple functions broken out to do these sorts of things. http://excelmasterseries.com/D-_Loads/New_Manuals/Confidence_Intervals_in_Excel.pdf Average Spend per customer in the treatment group - average spend per customer in the control group. This would be correct but you still want to use right formulas to account for population sizes of test and control. The incremental response * the total no. of people in the control group Multiple ways to look at this one. A total sales number can be used if the population sizes are considered to be similar for test and control. Otherwise same process as above. Your formula actually would be used in more of a hypothetical, "what-if" analysis. If anyone wants to learn more about this there are some stat MOOC courses out there that would be great intros.
