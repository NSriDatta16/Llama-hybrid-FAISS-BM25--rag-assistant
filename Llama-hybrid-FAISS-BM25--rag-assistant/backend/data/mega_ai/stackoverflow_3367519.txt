Sharing settings between applications

I have multiple .NET assemblies that all need to share common user settings, such as preferences, user names, etc. One is a WPF application, another is a console application, and the third is an Office Add-in. All of these settings are user-scope. Only the WPF application needs to be able to change settings. The rest just read them. Ideally, I'd like to use the .NET configuration framework. I'm not sure how to do this though. If I add Settings to the WPF application, how can the other applications find the user.config file? Is it just easier to create a class library and use IsolatedFileStorage and serialize my settings? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
