All event-based behavior in Magento should be handled within the event/observer methods (more information can be found here ).... for instance to call your own actions on a customer login would subscribe to the customer_login or customer_logout events. If you are trying to subscribe to an event on customer save in the admin area it would be the adminhtml_customer_save_after event. A full list of these for 1.4.2 can be found here . Another word of caution - overloading controllers is something I would do sparingly. Most of what you're trying to do can be accomplished by making your own controllers and using the Zend forward() method to forward to your desired controller method (you mentioned loginPostAction() in Mage_Customer_AccountController) after getting your functionality in ahead of time.
