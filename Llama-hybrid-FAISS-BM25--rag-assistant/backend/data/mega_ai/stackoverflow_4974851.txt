This tag should only be used for programming-related questions involving USB, and not hardware-related questions. USB is an acronym for Universal Serial Bus, a standard for a serial host-to-device protocol defined by the USB Implementors Forum. Today, it is the most commonly used method for connecting computers to peripherals such as keyboards, printers, phones, and data storage devices. Versions USB 1 (Full Speed) -- Released in January 1996, USB 1 specified data rates of 1.5 Mbit/s (Low-Bandwidth) and 12 Mbit/s (Full-Bandwidth). USB 2 (High Speed) -- USB 2.0: Released in April 2000. Added higher maximum signaling rate of 480 Mbit/s (effective throughput up to 35 MB/s or 280 Mbit/s) (now called "Hi-Speed"). USB 3 (Super Speed) -- USB 3.0 was released in November 2008. The standard claims a theoretical "maximum" transmission speed of up to 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s). USB 3.1 (Super Speed Plus) -- USB 3.1 was released in July 2013. The standard claims a theoretical "maximum" transmission speed of up to 10 Gbps USB 3.2 (Dual lane Super Speed Plus) -- USB 3.2 was released in September 2017. The standard mainly adds dual lane support on top of USB 3.1. Dual lane can give up to 20 Gbps of speed i.e. 2x of USB 3.1 References USB.org USB (Wikipedia) LifeWire Webopedia
