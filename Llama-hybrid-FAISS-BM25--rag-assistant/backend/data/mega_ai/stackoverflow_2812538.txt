I managed to convince the team Im part of to switch from CVS to Mercurial. Can you believe we were still using CVS? Neither could I when I started. I became almost somewhat of a preacher, a royal pain in the butt. Everytime CVS screw up or caused some sort of discomfort (being brutally slow, for example) I held a little speech of how much better it could be. Soon enough they accepted the possibility that there were alternatives (none of them actually knew there were alternatives to CVS!) and began to say things like "if there indeed are alternatives, anything must be better than this". Thats when I made my move and simply ran some scripts converting the CVS repository into a Mercurial one and uploaded it to the company server. Once they saw it in action, they were sold. Not that I planned anything during this little migration black ops, but in retrospect I would give the following advice to anyone attempting something similar: Let people know there are (better) alternatives, it is entirely possible to work outside your comfort zone. Lead by example, if you want something done, do it yourself. Show the alternative in action. No one is going to make the jump unless you jump first, especially not if they are already hesitating.
