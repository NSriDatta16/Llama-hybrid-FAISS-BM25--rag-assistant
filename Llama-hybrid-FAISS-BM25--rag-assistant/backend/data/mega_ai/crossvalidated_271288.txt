How do big companies apply machine learning?

I was wondering how recommendation on youtube work for example? How are the algorithms applied, because every user gets different recommendations depending on his location, his past liked videos etc... So it would seem like a training model is applied to every single user but I know that can't be possible so how are these recommendations so user-specific without applying a unique training model to every single user?
