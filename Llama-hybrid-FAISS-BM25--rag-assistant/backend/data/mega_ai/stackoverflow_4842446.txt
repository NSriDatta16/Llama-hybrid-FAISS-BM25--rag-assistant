How about: ECMA-48 - Control Functions for Coded Character Sets, 5th edition (June 1991) - A standard defining the color control codes, that is apparently supported also by xterm. SGR 38 and 48 were originally reserved by ECMA-48, but were fleshed out a few years later in a joint ITU, IEC, and ISO standard, which comes in several parts and which (amongst a whole lot of other things) documents the SGR 38/48 control sequences for direct colour and indexed colour : Information technology — Open Document Architecture (ODA) and interchange format: Document structures . T.412. International Telecommunication Union. Information technology — Open Document Architecture (ODA) and interchange format: Character content architectures . T.416. International Telecommunication Union. Information technology— Open Document Architecture (ODA) and Interchange Format: Character content architectures . ISO/IEC 8613-6:1994. International Organization for Standardization. There's a column for xterm in this table on the Wikipedia page for ANSI escape codes
