SharePoint... is a Web Services interface for my app worth it?

I'm hoping to hear from a cross-section of folks who have SharePoint installed at their site. I'm trying to decide whether to have users just use the web-based interface to check-out and edit my application's files, then rely on them being sophisticated enough to know to go back to the SharePoint web interface and perform a check-in. My presumption was that for the average organization out there using SharePoint, this would be incomprehensible to a good percentage of users. So, I began working on using SharePoint web services from within my application, so that users could open files, edit them, then check them in (optionally) at file close time -- all from within my app. However, my initial estimate of the development time to accomplish this fell short. So now I'm at the point of wanting to do some cost/benefit analysis. How quickly and naturally do most users "get" the check-out/edit locally/check-in cycle of SharePoint?
