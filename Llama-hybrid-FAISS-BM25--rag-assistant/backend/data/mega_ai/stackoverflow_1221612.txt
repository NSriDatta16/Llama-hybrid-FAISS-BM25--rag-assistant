Your question and comment do not make things very clear however I have revised my answer. A working demo of cloning an element, renaming the id and initializing the draggable is show here . You cant clone the element if you have already initialized the draggable as the new element when dragged will drag the old element as show here $("#draggable").clone() .attr('id', 'newDrag') $('#draggable, #newDrag').draggable();
