There's RubyDocTest , but I'd encourage you to look at something like RSpec or another modern BDD/TDD framework. It's pretty easy to write tests there too, and you get access to complex and/or custom assertions that you can't really get in a doctest. For instance, here's a simple set of tests for a baseball scoring app: describe BaseballScorer do before :each do @s = Scorer.new(Game.new) end it "should score a 0-0 game when no runs are hit" do @s.home.score.should == @s.away.score.should == @s.total_runs end it "should record runs that are hit" do @s.game.run_hit(:away) @s.away.runs.should == @s.away.score.should == 1 end # ...
