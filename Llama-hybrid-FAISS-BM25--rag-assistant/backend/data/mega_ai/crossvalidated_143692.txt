Plotting QDA projections in R

When doing discriminant analysis using LDA or PCA it is straightforward to plot the projections of the data points by using the two strongest factors. This can be done in R by using the x component of the pca object or the x component of the prediction lda object. My question is: Is it possible to project points in 2D using the QDA transformation? If yes, how would we do this in R and ggplot2?
