C++ code coverage tool for weird target platform

Anyone knows c++ code coverage tool usable under the following conditions: Target platform is PowerPC CPU inside Nintendo WII dev.kit, that runs custom embedded OS. The only way to exchange data with the PC is to use custom proprietary API (sorry for my NDA). Compiler is not Microsoft, not GCC, not even command line. Namely it's Metrowerks IDE (running on Windows, of course). Thanks in advance!
