Hoeffding's inequality equivalently states that when the variables are bounded, the sample average converges exponentially quickly to the actual mean. Outlier detection is generally about identifying things as being in low probability areas - Hoeffding's inequality is not sufficient here as it only deals with the average. Markov's and Chebyshev's inequality could be used for outlier detection, although the assumptions are very weak - thus, the bounds may not be that useful when comparing to more accurate models of the actual data.
