Besides using Pearson correlation, you can also use rank correlation such as Spearman or Kendall correlation. You can also display the scatterplot of the ranks whose distribution (called the empirical copula) is an estimator of the underlying copula encoding the `true' dependence between your time series. In pseudo Python (rather transparent in R): n = len(X) #== len(Y) Xrk = scipy.stats.rankdata(X)/n Yrk = scipy.stats.rankdata(Y)/n plot(Xrk,Yrk) If the points are distributed on the diagonal, then strong (perfect) comovements, if points are distributed uniformly on $[0,1]^2$ variables are independent (stronger than uncorrelated).
