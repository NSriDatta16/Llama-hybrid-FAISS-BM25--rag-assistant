Comparing Rails with PHP isn't very fair on PHP. After all, Rails is a platform, while PHP is a language. If you compare PHP with Ruby, as a language, well, I personally think Ruby is better. PHP (to me) feels like something that has organically grown from a list of server directives. Ruby seems more cohesive, and as his creator says, it is thought to be enjoyed by the programmer. Similarly, I can't compare Ruby on Rails with other PHP frameworks, because I haven't worked with any (I'm experienced with Drupal and Wordpress only). To me, what sets Ruby on Rails apart (although I hear that others are using these ideas now) is: The "convention over configuration" idea. On rails, most of the things that would usually be "up to the programmer", like the naming conventions, or where to put initialization code, are set pretty much in stone. This alone helps increase the code quality - different libraries from different teams around the world follow the same set of conventions. The idea of beauty. Rails programmers get itchy if they see a method longer than 10 lines. They like it when their programs look like plain English. The code produced this way is the best one I've ever seen. It is short, concise, and complete. The test discipline. Seriously, the rails guys take testing to heart. If you find a library or plugin on rails, chances are that it will come with tests embedded on it. And any medium sized project will not accept a patch from you if it doesn't come with tests. Ruby itself (the language) is a language with specs . The strive for excellence. The rails community is always eager to improve. And they are not afraid of making backwards-incompatible changes, if that makes code better (see for example the drastic change in the ActiveRecord interface, from rails 2.x to 3.x). You will notice that I haven't spoken very much about technical features. That's because to me what makes rails great isn't "technical", but "behavioral". The language chosen, or the platform itself, are reflections of a kind of mindset. And that mindset, to me, is rails best feature. In my opinion, any programmer that gets exposed to this way of thinking will produce better code. If he programs in PHP, he'll just produce better PHP. The only pre-requisites are that he enjoys programming at least a little bit, and he has an inquisitive mind. This is not for code-monkeys that work just to put food on the table. Would he get the same from other PHP frameworks? I have no idea. Maybe. If you are concerned about the costs of a complete fresh start, then keep doing what you already know (PHP) to bring money in, but start a small project (maybe an internal one) on Rails. Your PHP code will be gradually better. ... until your developers tell you that they are sick of PHP and they want to do Ruby only :)
