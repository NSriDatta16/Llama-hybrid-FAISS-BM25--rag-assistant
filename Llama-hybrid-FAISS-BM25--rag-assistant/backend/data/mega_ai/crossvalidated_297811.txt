How do I test the hypothesis that one parameter increases while another does not decrease?

The Problem Setting Prose Description I have a feature that I might roll out on my website. I only want to do this, however, if this feature increases the average amount that a customer spends while not negatively impacting the conversion rate. This is because I believe the feature cannot positively impact conversion rate but could possibly decrease it. Mathematical Description We run an AB test, where group A receives the new version of the website and group B receives the old version of the website. We define the parameter $s_A$ to be the average spending of a customer in group A and $s_B$ to be the average spending of a customer in group B. Likewise, we define $c_A$ to be the conversion rate of customers in group A and $c_B$ to be the conversion rate of customers in group B. Let us also assume that we have independent estimators of all of these parameters $\hat{s}_A, \hat{s}_B, \hat{c}_A, \hat{c}_B$. Lastly, we want to make decision 1 if $s_A > s_B$ and $c_A \ge c_B$ and decision 0 otherwise. My Question Is it sufficient to set two alpha values, one to test $s_A > s_B$ and one to test $c_A
