I would say that you're generally correct, but not entirely accurate. You use a HashMap for data retrieval, but not always randomly. You use an ArrayList for iteration but you can also use it for lookups via the index. More generally, you use a Map implementation when you need to efficiently retrieve items by lookup, i.e. retrieving something based on the key - such as dictionaries, caches, repositories, etc. You use a List implementation when you just want a data structure where you can iterate over your data, usually when you want them in a predetermined and/or predictable order. In other words, you use Map s as an indexing data structure, and you use List s as you would usually use arrays.
