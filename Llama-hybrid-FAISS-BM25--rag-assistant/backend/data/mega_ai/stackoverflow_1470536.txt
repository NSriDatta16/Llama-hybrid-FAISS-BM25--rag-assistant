What folder should my application write its launchd file?

I am trying to write a small Cocoa application that helps me manage my time, I want it check on startup if already has a launchd entry and if not, add itself an entry. What is the correct folder to write the launchd file, and/or is there a special cocoa method to retrieve what the correct folder is (ie in the same way you retrieve the users document folder) or do you just assume one of the following hard coded locations? The man pages list the following possible URL's I probably want to use ~/Library/LaunchAgents? ~/Library/LaunchAgents Per-user agents provided by the user. /Library/LaunchAgents Per-user agents provided by the administrator. /Library/LaunchDaemons System-wide daemons provided by the administrator. /System/Library/LaunchAgents Per-user agents provided by Mac OS X. /System/Library/LaunchDaemons System-wide daemons provided by Mac OS X.
