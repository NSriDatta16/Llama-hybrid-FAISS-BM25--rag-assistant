Why does Random Forest variable importance not sum to 100%?

The randomForest package in R has the importance() function to get both node impurity and mean premutation importance for variables. Why, when calculating mean permutation importance, do the results not sum to 100%? Here's a simple reproducible example: library(randomForest) data(iris) iris.rf Thanks
