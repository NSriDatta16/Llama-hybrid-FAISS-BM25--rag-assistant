Assume that you spend an equal amount of time in either lane on average after switching before the traffic moves again. The fraction of time spent on each side is given by the ratio of the probabilities of switching from the other side to that one - in this case, 60%:80% or 3:4 right to left. So the fraction of time spent in the left lane is 4/7.
