Average treatment effect (ATE) estimation via matching method while outcomes of control population are constant

I want to estimate the average effect of a treatment that was given with a selection bias. To do this, I'd like to use a matching method. Basically, this method involves finding, for each treated person, their equivalent untreated person, and then measuring the difference in outcomes between the two. This should help correct the selection bias. However, I'm in a special case where the outcome for untreated individuals is constant, specifically 0, because the treatment is the only way to get a result . For example, if I want to measure the hair regrowth rate after a hair transplant, the treatment is the transplant, and the outcome is the regrowth rate. It turns out that my study population has experienced selection bias (because those who can afford the transplant likely have better living conditions, etc.). On the other hand, my control population hasn't had a transplant, so their regrowth rate is 0 by default. My question is, does the matching method make sense in a case where the outcome variance is 0 in the control population ? Intuitively, this bothers me, but I can't prove it statistically. If someone could provide an explanation and recommend specific methods to handle this specific case (when control outcome is constant), I'd appreciate it. I've searched the literature, but haven't found anything yet.
