Partial least squares (PLS)

I am relatively new to Orange, trying to utilise it for linear regression, in particular partial least squares (PLS) . My statistics knowledge is in the moment not good enough to know whether I could compose an equivalent by combinding PCA with ordinary linear regression, but I would anyhow have expected a dedicated PLS widget - or as an option in the Linear regression widget. I even found a description of PLS functionality in Orange2 here , but this is not available (or moved to where I don't find it) in Orange3. Well, I have a python/numpy PLS implementation that I could probably adapt into a python script block, but is this necessary? Please tell me that it's just a mouse-click/import away.
