javascript 'mailto' command

What is used to bold the text in a 'mailto' javascript? After some research i found that %0A is used to insert a new line. This is my javascript: location.href="mailto:" + "?subject=" + "Sub:{!Trigger_Event__c.Title__c}" + "&body="+ "Title:{!Trigger_Event__c.Title__c}"+"%0AOrganization:" + "{!Trigger_Event__c.Account__c}"; I need to bold the 'Headline' in the script. Kindly provide your inputs.. Thanks in advance.
