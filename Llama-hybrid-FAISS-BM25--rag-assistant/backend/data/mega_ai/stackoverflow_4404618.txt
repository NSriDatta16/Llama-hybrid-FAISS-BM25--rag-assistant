I's say it's not a myth - but certainly rare in my experience. It also depends what you call a component, and what level of grainularity you're looking at. Every user and business unit where I work uses Microsoft Office and Exchange - so they are highly reusable. Anyone will re-use something if they think they'll gain from it. the big trick is getting them to see that. You're also up against human nature - not trusting things they don't understand, and so on. I've certainly seen examples where a truly re-usable business component is identified as being needed / desirable: but then actually getting it built is a big problem: Who's going to own it? Who's going to pay for it? As part of an "all of government" drive, we have a technical component that allows us to integrate with a centrally provided Identity and Access Management service. This allows members of the public to have one account (username and password, etc) that they can use to log into any government provided online service (where they use the central IAM service). Because our system (combined with the centrally provided bit) offer business related functionality I think this is an example of your mythical re-useable component. The solution allows us to delegate management of users within an organisation to admins within that organisation - thus providing business value (less management overhead) across multiple business units.
