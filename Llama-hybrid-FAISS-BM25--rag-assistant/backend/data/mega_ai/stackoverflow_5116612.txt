Thanks for the input. I think I'm going to try out using buckets for different timeframes. So, i'll create 3 stores corresponding to say 1sec, 1min, 15min, and then manage the aggregation through a manual job running every so often which will compact/average out the values, delete of stuff that's not needed, etc...
