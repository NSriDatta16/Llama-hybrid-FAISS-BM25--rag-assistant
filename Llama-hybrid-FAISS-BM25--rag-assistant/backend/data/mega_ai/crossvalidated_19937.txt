On the one hand, jthetzel is correct. But on the other hand, asking your question here is like going to the annual conference of neurosurgeons to say "My patient has a headache, what do I do?" Of course the answer from a bunch of neurosurgeons will be "You need a neurosurgeon!" ;-) Modern-day SQL implementations are full suites of applications that go well beyond mere database management. So I take issue with the suggestion that analytics is not one of SQL's strengths. Microsoft SQL Server, for example, includes a full range of Analysis Services. This includes a variety of data mining solutions that can be used for predictive forecasting. Any major enterprise SQL suite is going to have something similar. Is "one size fits all" canned-algorithm data mining of this sort a substitute for an expert statistician who will analyze the unique situation of your business? Of course not. Not remotely. But can it get you a first pass of some useful predictive modeling and leverage the skills you already have to accomplish a decent beginning on the task? Yes, it can.
