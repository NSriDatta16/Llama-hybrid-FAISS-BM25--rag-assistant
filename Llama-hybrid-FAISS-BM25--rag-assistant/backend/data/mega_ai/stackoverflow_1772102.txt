c# Drag and Drop from my custom app to notepad

I have a custom app which needs to support Drag and Drop. On Dragging the grid in my app, in its DoDragDrop method I have provided the object to be dropped in a serialized format. When the drop is to one of my apps, it is able to deserailize the string and create the object. What I want to do is allow the source app to be able to drop into NotePad/TextPad as well. I can see that I can drag and drop files from windows explorer to Notepad , but am not able to drag and drop plain text to NotePad. Guess it checks the DataFormat in the DragEnter event and dis-allows strings but allows files to be dropped into it. Is there a way to change yr format in the source app so that it provides a temp file / a string. Is it possible to provide the data in 2 formats so that the target drop can accept whichever format it is happy with? thanks in advance!
