The answers above are correct, but I think it's worth mentioning why you would want to do it from a functionality perspective. If you have a page that is being included by a frameset from a different domain, any version of IE 6 or newer will block the cookies for your page unless the p3p header is present. The idea is that your page, if it placed in a frameset hosted by a different domain, is considered "third party" content. The fear is that you may trying to stick sneaky ad tracking or other cookies in a person's browser without their knowledge. The p3p header is a way of pinning your organization down as saying "we won't do anything sneaky with them 3rd party cookies". The user can set their browser to block your cookies if you don't set that header, and as of IE6 that is the default setting.
