Storing a "Users Online" list for a chat application (php/ajax)

I have several chat rooms. Currently, I store the list of chat users in a php variable. If a user enters or leaves the room, the user's name is added/removed from that list. To make this storage persistent, I use memcached. To update the status of the chat room and send the user list to all users in the chat room, I use periodical ajax requests that fetch the user list into the browsers of the users who are in the chat. It works okay. But I doubt that sending the whole list of chat users to everybody every XX seconds is a good idea if there are a couple of hundred people in the chat. How are chat rooms usually dealing with this problem?
