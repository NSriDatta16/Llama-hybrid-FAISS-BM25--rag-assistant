Your development organization clearly doesn't understand the complexity or best practices of writing installers. I had 7 years of setup under my belt before I started using MSI and it took me 6 months to really get comfortable with out MSI worked and a full year to fully "get it". If it was me I'd first attack this whole concept of you deploying files to both the C: and D: drive and why you have all these custom actions. This is screaming antipattern. I'd want to verify the need for each custom action and understand the reason behind this whole C: and D: thing. Personally, my gut tells me that for what you are doing you don't really want an MSI installer; you just want a .BAT file or similar. So basically, you've been sent on a suicide mission and I wish you luck.
