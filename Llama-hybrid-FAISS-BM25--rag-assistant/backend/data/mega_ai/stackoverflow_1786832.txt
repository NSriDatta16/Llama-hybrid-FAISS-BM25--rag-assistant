How to instantiate a descendant UserControl?

Here is the scenario. I have a bunch of UserControls that all inherit from MyBaseControl. I would like to instantiate a UserControl based on its name. For instance: void foo(string NameOfControl) { MyBaseControl ctl = null; ctl = CreateObject(NameOfControl); // I am making stuff up here, // CreateObject does not exist } How do i instantiate this UserControl based on its name. I could have a gigantic switch statement and that smells bad. All the UserControls, including their Base class, are in the same project and all have the same namespace.
