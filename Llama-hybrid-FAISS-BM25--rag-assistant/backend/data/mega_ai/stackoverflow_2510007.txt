The service in question will run on an internal server with good physical as well as network security. As long as that is true from now till eternity (or the next patch, which ever comes first) storing a cached password in ram as plain-text is fine. If you where storing the entire password DB in ram (say your persistent storage is too slow) I think storing them as secure strings would be better, but since you are only storing a few passwords for at most 1 minute, I see no problem.
