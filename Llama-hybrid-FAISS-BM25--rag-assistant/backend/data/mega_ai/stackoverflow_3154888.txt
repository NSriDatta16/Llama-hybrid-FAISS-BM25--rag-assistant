Magento product images messed up

I run magento and host 2 stores, for simplicity call them: Store A located at www.storea.com Store B located at www.storeb.com Currently I have a bit of an issue with my product images and with the cache. When I add a new product to display on store B (so I enter the admin backend through Store A) the image is uploaded to storea.com/media/ etc. etc. but storeb.com is trying to find the image at storeb.com/media etc. I tried changing the base_media_url for storeb.com to point to storea.com because all of it's images are being uploaded there, but now this is where the product image cache issue comes in. Store A isn't caching images for store B and so the images are still not found (so I'm in no better situation than before). For example, storea.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1 (1 is the ID for storea.com) has all the images for Store A as you would expect, but storeb.com is trying to access files from the product image cache at storea.com/media/catalog/product/cache/2 (2 is the ID for storeb.com) but store A isn't caching image files for store B. I know the images are being uploaded to storea.com/media because if I go one directory above the product image cache folder I can see all the 'uncached' versions of the images. TL;DR In short, I need a way to either: 1: Have the images I upload for Storeb.com (from the backend in storea.com) upload to storeb.com/media/catalog etc. rather than storea.com/media/catalog OR 2 Make sure storea.com is able to cache ALL files in it's media/catalog/product folder and not just ones for its OWN store but for other stores as well.
