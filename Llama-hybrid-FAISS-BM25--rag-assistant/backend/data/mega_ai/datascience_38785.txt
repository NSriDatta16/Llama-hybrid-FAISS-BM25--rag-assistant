Magnification factor in image classification

If a CNN is trained on images focusing on an object, will it also recognize when multiple such objects are present in the image? For example can a network trained on single flower images also identify image having many such flowers in a bunch? Is the answer same if situation is reversed? That is, can a CNN trained on bunch of flower images also identify single flower image?
