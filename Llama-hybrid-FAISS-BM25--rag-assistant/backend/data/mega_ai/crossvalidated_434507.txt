How to sample pairs in order to create a significant result

I develop a similarity function for genes in general. I would like to find the correlation of the similarity values of the developed function to a ground truth. For the ground truth, I use a model organism and I have 2000 genes with distinct Gene Ontology (GO) terms. For a pair of genes I can find the similarity of the two genes based on the GO terms for example using GAPGOM tool. However as the genes are too many the possible number of pairs (2000 choose 2) is too big (millions) so I can't wait calculating the GAPGOM similarity for all pairs. Thus, I would like your advice on how to sample pairs and then calculate the GAPGOM similarity but still leaving the result significant. I have already asked in biostars .
