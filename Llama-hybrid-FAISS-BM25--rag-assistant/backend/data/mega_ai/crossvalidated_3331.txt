Is it possible to do time-series clustering based on curve shape?

I have sales data for a series of outlets, and want to categorise them based on the shape of their curves over time. The data looks roughly like this (but obviously isn't random, and has some missing data): n.quarters I would like to know how I can cluster based on the shape of the curves in R. I had considered the following approach: Create a new column by linearly transforming each store's var0 to a value between 0.0 and 1.0 for the entire time series. Cluster these transformed curves using the kml package in R. I have two questions: Is this a reasonable exploratory approach? How can I transform my data into the longitudinal data format that kml will understand? Any R snippets would be much appreciated!
