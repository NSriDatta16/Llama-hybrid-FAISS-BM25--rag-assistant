Plain text vs Database Storage

I need to store a large string that represents music notation in text format. This string could be anywhere between a few lines to several hundred. I need to store meta data about the string (eg artist, instrument etc) in a database. I'm wondering, would it be better to store the large text string in a flat file or in the database? I think if I store it in the database it might be easier to monitor concurrency issues etc... but then in a flat file it would be easier to scale.
