Does jQuery encourage laziness and dis-organized UI designs?

When I see a question such as: How do I exclude elements whose ID ends in a certain suffix using jQuery I cannot help but thinking: does jquery encourage too much of this sort of ad hoc (and processor intensive) querying of the DOM? Shouldn't we be organizing our UI's better so that these sorts of queries are kept to a minimum, if not entirely eliminated.
