Specman 6.1 docs don't show a reduce pseudo-method. For your specific example, you can acheive what you want with: bitmap = pack(packing.low, x) You may find the "reduce" psuedo-method in your version of Specman by searching "List Pseudo-Methods" in your docs. Section "Math and Logic Pseudo-Methods" shows methods and_all(), average(), or_all(), product(), and sum(). I know this is not the meta-solution, but its better than a kick in the teeth.
