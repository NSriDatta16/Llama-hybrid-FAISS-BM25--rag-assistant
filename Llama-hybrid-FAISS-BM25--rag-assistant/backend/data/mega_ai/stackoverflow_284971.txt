Vb6 Performing an operation based on each line of a text file

I have a text file with a series of commands each one is on a diferent line what I need to do is go through the text file line by line and for each line perform a set of operations. How would I loop through line by line? Example: Text file contains: johndoe.log Apples and organes.log monkies and zebras.log script would grab line 1(johndoe.log) create a new text file named johndoe.log go to line two create a new text file named apples and organes.log etc... until the text file is complete I know how to do everything except the loop that performs an operation on each line of the text file :( and I know its oranges, typoed and went with it.
