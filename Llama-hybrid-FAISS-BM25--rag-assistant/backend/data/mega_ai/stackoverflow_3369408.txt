Jquery Sortable withset placeholder forever

I hope someone can help me. My Problem: I have 2 sortable UL's. and When i drag a li from k2 into k1, the k2 ul collapse (coz there is one li missing now). Is it possible to say -> When draggable start, insert a non draggable clone into the k2? and If drag successful -> Put LI into k1 if not -> Put LI Back to the k2 and remove the clone
