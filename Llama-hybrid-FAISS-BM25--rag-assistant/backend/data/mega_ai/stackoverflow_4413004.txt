Why do WPF apps look like web pages?

I apologize for my newbie question by why do WPF apps look like web pages? I am new to gui and still shopping for a book to learn gui programming. The push seems to be in the direction of WPF but all the screenshots of WPF applications that I've seen look like cheap web pages. Frankly I'd be ashamed to sell an app that looked like a web page. I realize that WPF is built on XML technology but can you not build normal looking WPF apps in Visual Studio (via button("widget")) drag-n-drop? In other words an app that does not look like a web page? How can WPF be a replacement for WinForms or the like when it doesn't provide the same standard application look?
