What do you mean by "it applies the styles correctly"? Are you talking about the class="verystylish" ? If that's it, then it doesn't mean styles are getting applied at all, but that the new paragraph element has that class. You're not writing anything to the window except for that . Don't you have to write the whole code of the page, including , and tags?
