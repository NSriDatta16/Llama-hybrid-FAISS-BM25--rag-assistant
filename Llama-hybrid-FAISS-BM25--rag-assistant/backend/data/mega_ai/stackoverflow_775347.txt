The following statement is not true: Files that were added to a branch and then changed on the branch don't get added when doing a merge across number of revisions That would imply merging is totally broken. When you do the merge, you need to make sure that you do merge the revision that created the file, otherwise you'll get those warnings about no target. The other thing to watch out for is if you do a merge into a working copy, then decide you're not happy with it and revert everything, the newly added files will still be in the working copy, so if you merge again, the unversioned files will prevent the merge of new files there, so you will miss them. So running "svn status" and removing unversioned files will ensure the merge works properly. The comment about adding an empty file should not be done, because then the new file has no history of where it came from. In other words, it's not a copy, so "svn log" will not show its history. And finally, if the file were a gigabyte photo, you wouldn't want to merge it into a new file, because then the repository would have two copies of the exact same context. Merging and copying with history saves repository storage (at least until rep-sharing is put in).
