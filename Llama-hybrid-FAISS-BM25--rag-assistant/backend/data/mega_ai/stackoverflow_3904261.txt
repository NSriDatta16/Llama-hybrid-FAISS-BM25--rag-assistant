This is not possible, as the browser needs to understand your javascript when it arrives, hence a human can understand it too. To make our web app more efficient we decided to compress(YUI for JS and CSS) and put all the main resources in the HTML page inline(HTML, CSS and JS) a shell script does that automatically during the deployment. As an unexpected result, if you view the source of our app, you get a pretty unreadable ~250kb string. This won't stop the guy that really want to get your code, but it will discourage many.
