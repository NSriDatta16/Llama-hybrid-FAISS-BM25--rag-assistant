jQuery Validate Numeric After Pasting

I know how to validate a field for numeric values, but how can you validate the field if invalid characters have been pasted into the field. Often we have a numeric field, and then an action button, and the numeric field may not fire a blur event when the action button is clicked. How can you force (re)validation in this case? Do you do it again in the click event of the action button, or there there a more elegant solution?
