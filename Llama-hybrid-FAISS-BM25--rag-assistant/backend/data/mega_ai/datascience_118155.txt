Creating variations of prompts for ChatGPT

I am developing a fine tune model to emulate a tech support chatbot based on my given information. I am struggling to create a large dataset (aiming for 1000 prompt/completion pairs), does anyone have good recommendations for nlp text augmentation tools to use? I have tried nlpaug which does synonym replacement, but I am looking for something more nuanced - that will provide intelligent variations of a given prompt. Any advice is appreciated!
