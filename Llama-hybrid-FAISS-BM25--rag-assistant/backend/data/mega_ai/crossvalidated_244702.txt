Is there a test for the timing of non-stationarity?

I am wondering whether a test exists that identifies at which point in time a time series becomes non-stationary. For instance, a time series might fulfill all requirements for weak stationariy in the first year and then explodes. I am working on data for which it would be interesting to know at which point in time the time series is "exploding". Cheers Ralf
