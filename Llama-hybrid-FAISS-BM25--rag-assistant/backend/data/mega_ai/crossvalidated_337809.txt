I am quite new to Neural Networks and I am also dealing with some similar problems on the same topic however because I am working based on same author's papers on Next Basket Recommendation i would suggest you to read their previous papers that you can find in this link and this link . The DREAM model is the third approach they have applied on the same datasets for the same purpose and they got the best results, however you might get some more information where the idea came from first in the referenced papers. The first suggestion from blacksoil should be the right one to help you but i am also struggling on the implementation of this encoding layer.
