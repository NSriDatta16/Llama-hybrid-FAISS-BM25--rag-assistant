Well, you don't strictly need the sp_add_category , sp_update_job or sp_add_jobschedule calls. We do an on-demand package execution in our app using SQL Agent with the following call sequence: - sp_add_job - sp_add_jobstep - sp_add_jobserver - sp_start_job Getting the job status is a little tricky if you can't access the msdb..sysjobXXX tables, but our jobs start & run just fine. EDIT:: Other than xp_cmdshell, I'm not aware of another way to launch the the SSIS handlers from withinSQL Server. Anyone with permissions on the server can start the dtexec or dtutil executables; then you can use batch files, job scheduler etc.
