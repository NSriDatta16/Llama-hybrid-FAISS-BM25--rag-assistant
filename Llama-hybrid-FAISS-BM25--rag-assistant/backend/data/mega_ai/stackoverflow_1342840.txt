The per-process memory limit is 2GB (unless you use the Windows /3GB switch ). However, you are probably running into memory fragmentation. When the memory gets fragmented (visualize with VMMap ), you will not be able to allocate a large contiguous block. Your options are: Allocate in smaller blocks (preferred) Find some way to defragment the memory Upgrade to a 64-bit OS (you can still compile 32-bit code, but you will have up to 4GB for user mode memory - remember to turn on the large memory aware compiler flag; if you compile 64-bit code, it won't run at all on a 32-bit OS, but the memory limit is much higher than 4GB) If you need that much memory for loading a file, you might be able to memory map the file You might be able to allocate the largest blocks earlier than the smaller blocks.
