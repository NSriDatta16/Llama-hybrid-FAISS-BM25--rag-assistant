It may not be related to hyperparams per say. I think it has more to do with the nature of how xgboost is trained. XGBoost for regression tries to reduce the variance at every node. May when you have variables with such less values it just round of them to 0 and it has nothing to learn. It may have to do more with precision which XGBoost work.
