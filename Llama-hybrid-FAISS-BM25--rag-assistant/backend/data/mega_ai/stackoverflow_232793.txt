#pragma is used to do something implementation-specific in C, i.e. be pragmatic for the current context rather than ideologically dogmatic. The one I regularly use is #pragma pack(1) where I'm trying to squeeze more out of my memory space on embedded solutions, with arrays of structures that would otherwise end up with 8 byte alignment. Pity we don't have a #dogma yet. That would be fun ;)
