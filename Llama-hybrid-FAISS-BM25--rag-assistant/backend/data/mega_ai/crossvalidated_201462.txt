Logistic regression "1 not defined because of singularities"

I'm fitting a logistic regression model with patient_group (0,1) as response variable and the explanatory variable being an interaction between two SNPs. When running summary for the model, the alert 'Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities)' is shown, and I guess it is due to the fact that the combination AACT has 0 observations. My question is whether the statistics are still valid, or is there a better way to analyse this kind of data? (The SNPs are located close to each other and are most likely strongly linked.) > table(data$SNP1, data$SNP2) CC CT TT 27 9 AT 83 14 AA 47 0 > model summary(model) Call: glm(formula = patient_group ~ SNP1 * SNP2, family = "binomial", data = data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.2735 -0.9072 -0.7679 1.4742 1.8365 Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std.
