If both methods have the same number of parameters, then pick the one that comes closest as assessed by the smallest sum-of-squares of the residuals. If the two models fit different numbers of parameters, then you need to look at more than the sum-of-squares of the residuals. The equation with more parameters will almost always fit better, so you've got to ask if the improvement in sum-of-squares is large enough given the number of extra parameters. There are two approaches one can use to compare the fits of two models, accounting for the fact that you'll almost always get better fit if you fit more parameters: The extra sum of squares F test (it doesn't have a standard name). This will compute a P value testing the null hypothesis that the model with fewer parameters is correct. Use AIC -Aikaike's Information Criteria - (or BIC, Bayesian Information Criteria) which are information criteria. These methods compute the relative likelihood that each model is correct (given that those are the only choices). I've written about both approaches , without much math for biologists.
