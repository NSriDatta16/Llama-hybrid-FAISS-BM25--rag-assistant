JQuery Ajax not calling the page but everything else is working

I am trying to use JQuery to call a page which will delete a record from the database. The page (part_supplierDelete.php) works correctly when I test it manually. The JS & JQuery bellow all work except for the call to the page. When the deletePartSupplier() method is called the confirm dialog pops up and if you click ok the correct div is removed. But the record is not being deleted and it appears that the page is not being called at all. Any idea what I am doing wrong? I have tried with Chrome, FireFox, and IE 8. function deletePartSupplier( part_supplier_id ) { var answer = confirm( "This action cannot be undone. Are you sure you want to remove this supplier from the part?" ); if( answer ) { $.post( "part_supplierDelete.php?part_supplier_id=".concat(part_supplier_id), removeElement( "PSID".concat(part_supplier_id) ) ); } } function removeElement(divNum) { var d = document.getElementById('PartSupplierGroup'); var olddiv = document.getElementById(divNum); d.removeChild(olddiv); } * ---------- EDIT ----------- The page is showing up in the raw access log that it is being called. But it is not deleting the record like it should. I can follow the link in the access log and then it deletes the row like it should have. Here is the access log: /v3/part_supplierDelete.php?part_supplier_id=18 Http Code: 200 Http Version: HTTP/1.1 Size in Bytes: 2 Referer: /v3/partEdit.php?part_id=5 Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/8.0.552.237 Safari/534.10
