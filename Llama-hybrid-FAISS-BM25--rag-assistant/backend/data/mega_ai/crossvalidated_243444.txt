As mentioned by @fcop, there is no formula (analytical solution) for the $\beta$. Here is an example on how the coefficients are calculated using iterative methods. (Comparing to R glm function) x=as.matrix(mtcars[,c("wt","hp")]) y=mtcars$am logistic_loss The coeffcients are pretty close but not exact the same, see this post for explaination. R using GLM and manual solve logistic regression have different (close but not exactly the same) results
