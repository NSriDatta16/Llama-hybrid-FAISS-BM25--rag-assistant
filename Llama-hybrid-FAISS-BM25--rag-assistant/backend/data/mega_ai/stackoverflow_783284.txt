If you still are interested in adding a GCC pass, you can start reading up GCC Wiki material just about that: http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/WritingANewPass and "Implementing Passes" from http://www.airs.com/dnovillo/200711-GCC-Internals/ on how to, well, add a pass. The intermediate representation you are interested in is called GIMPLE. Some introduction is at http://www.airs.com/dnovillo/200711-GCC-Internals/200711-GCC-Internals-3-IR.pdf Other information at http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GettingStarted
