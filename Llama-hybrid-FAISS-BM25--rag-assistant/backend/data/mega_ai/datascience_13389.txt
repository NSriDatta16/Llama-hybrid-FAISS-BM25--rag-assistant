I used Binary classification for sentiment analysis of texts. I converted sentences into vectors by taking appropriate vectorizer and classified using OneVsRest classifier. On another approach, my words were converted into vectors and there, I used a CNN based approach to classify. Both when tested on my datasets were giving comparable results as of now. If you have vectors, there are already really good approaches available for binary classification which you can try. On Binary Classification with Singleâ€“Layer Convolutional Neural Networks is a good read for you for classification using CNNs for starters. This is one of the first blogs I read to gain more knowledge about this and doesn't require much of pre-requisites to understand(I am assuming you know the basics about convolution and Neural Networks).
