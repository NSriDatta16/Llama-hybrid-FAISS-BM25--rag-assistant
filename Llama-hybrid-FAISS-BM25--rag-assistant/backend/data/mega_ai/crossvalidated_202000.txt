Using PC1 in subsequent analysis when all loadings are close to $+1$

I did a PCA on some data as a data reduction technique. I had 8 original items. The results showed a single component accounted for most of the variance in the data, with all items loading onto a single component with loadings all $>.8$. What I would like to do now is to use this component as an outcome in a regression analysis. My confusion is over what to use as the variable itself. Do I extract the component somehow (akin to factor scores in a CFA)? or do I just go back to raw items and create an index (by averaging raw items, for example).
