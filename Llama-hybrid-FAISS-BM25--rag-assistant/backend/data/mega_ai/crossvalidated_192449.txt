Bayesians normally choose priors that make their mathematically challenging lives easier to bear. This means Gaussian priors, unless the model absolutely forbids it. Remember that you need a bivariate prior in your situation, since you have to model the correlation between slope and location, as well as their marginal behaviours. The multivariate normal is your ticket. A Gaussian prior on the parameters meshes nicely with the (doubtless) Gaussian measurement error that your regression model already has. By the way, I don't associate slopes with scale parameters, since slopes can be negative and scale parameters cannot. Now the gaussian distribution is not an uninformative prior, but if you really have no prior information, perhaps you should go frequentist. Or use a Gaussian with a very large variance. I don't know a modern reference to Bayesian inference. At the risk of using a bazooka to shoot a rabbit, you could look up Rasmussen and Williams, which is available online . The first section of chapter 2 goes through Bayesian regression in some detail.
