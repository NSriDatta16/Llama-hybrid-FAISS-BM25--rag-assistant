As an overarching framework, indeed MLE is much better. It shows when you really want to use LSE, and when you want to use other estimators, such as LAE, Poisson regression, logistic regression, WLS, GLS, etc. It also leads naturally and seamlessly to Bayesian methods. All quantitative disciplines would be much better off to replace LSE with MLE. These days, there is not much to motivate LSE other than "we've always done it this way." Back in the 19th century, computational considerations were important and justified LSE, but certainly not any more. Some like to appeal to the Gauss-Markov Theorem to justify LSE, but that theorem is nearly vacuous. It states that LSE is best among estimators that are unbiased and linear functions of the data, but since the class of linear, unbiased estimators is so limited, that theorem is akin to stating that LSE is the biggest fish in a tiny puddle.
