Design matrix for getting desired contrasts in 3x3 design with 2 controls

We have nine conditions in our study (two category factors each with three levels; A : a1, a2, a3 ; S : s, c1, c2 ). I did two-way ANOVA; however, we are interested in a more nuanced question. c1 and c2 are control variables controlling different (and independent) aspects of s. We want to compare s and controls (s-c1 and s-c2). More importantly, we are interested in the “specific” responses to a1, a2, and a3 after we subtract the effects of c1 and c2. I am trying to make a design matrix to get desired comparisons/contrasts; however, I am a little lost on how to proceed. I considered Treatment-coding A with no intercept and Sum coding S. (Probably non-essential) details on the analysis: We actually do the analysis on each time point and sensors. We are interested in which sensors read responses to c1, c2, A (s-c1 and s-c2), and which sensors read a1-specific responses, a2-specific responses and a3-specific responses. We do permutation cluster tests (Maris & Oostenveld, 2007; a brief overview ) on each sensor with the statistic time series (each statistics comes from a single time point).
