Unbiased estimator for AR($p$) model

Consider an AR($p$) model (assuming zero mean for simplicity): $$ x_t = \varphi_1 x_{t-1} + \dotsc + \varphi_p x_{t-p} + \varepsilon_t $$ The OLS estimator (equivalent to the conditional maximum likelihood estimator) for $\mathbf{\varphi} := (\varphi_1,\dotsc,\varphi_p)$ is known to be biased, as noted in a recent thread . (Curiously, I could neither find the bias mentioned in Hamilton "Time Series Analysis" nor in a few other time series textbooks. However, it can be found in various lecture notes and academic articles, e.g. this .) I was not able to find out whether the exact maximum likelihood estimator of AR($p$) is biased or not; hence my first question. Question 1: Is exact maximum likelihood estimator of AR($p$) model's autoregressive parameters $\varphi_1,\dotsc,\varphi_p$ biased? (Let us assume the AR($p$) process is stationary. Otherwise the estimator is not even consistent, since it is restricted in the stationary region; see, e.g., Hamilton "Time Series Analysis" , p. 123.) Also, Question 2: Are there any reasonably simple unbiased estimators?
