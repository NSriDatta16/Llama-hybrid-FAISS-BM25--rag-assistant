3-d game programming

what programming language/languages do they use to produce games lik Bioware's Dragon Age Origins and some other 3-d games like Call of Duty? If I would like to do 3d-game programming, where do I start? Are there even simple tutorials for this? I would like to do 3-d game programming for PC games:)
