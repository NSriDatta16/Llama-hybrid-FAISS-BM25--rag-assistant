The easiest way to accomlish this is as follow: 1. Start XCode 2. From Xcode run the app on the iPhone and have it show excast screen you need 3. in XCode start Organiser tool Organiser tool will allow you to capture screen directly from the connected iPhone and will even give you an option to have this saved as default.png directly as part of your project. Worked great for me
