What is this time series model and how to produce it in R?

I know that $Y_{t} = a + bY_{t-1} + \epsilon$ is named as autoregression model. I am dealing with the model like: $Y_{t} = a + bY_{t-1} + cX_{t} + dX_{t-1} + \epsilon$. I could not find any useful information when I searched "multivariate autoregression". Could anyone tell me the model name and how to do it in R?
