Finding correlations in longitudinal data analysis

We are doing research on video lecture watching. We offer a course which lasts four 5 weeks, and there are 9 or 10 videos in each week. We organize group-watching activities. A group usually is composed of 4-5 people, and we have 3 groups. In each group, each participant watched all videos of that week on his/her own device with our software (so we could collect data). We collected data on how they navigated the videos. Right after each week's video watching session, we asked each person to rate the difficulty level of the whole weeks' lecture with 5 point Likert scale. After 5 weeks, we get a dataset which includes the number of pauses per user per week and the difficulty rating per user per week. The data set is organised as follows: For the Likert-scale questionnaire, the data is like group, person, video.difficultyOfTheWeek, week apricot, A, 5, 1 apricot, B, 3, 1 apricot, C, 4, 1 apple, A, 3, 1 apple, B, 2, 1 apple, C, 2, 1 orange, A, 4, 4 orange, B, 3, 4 orange, C, 4, 4 We also have pause data similar as follows: group, person, numOfPauses, week, totalLengthOfVideoInTheWeekInMinute apricot, A, 15, 1, 125 apricot, B, 23, 1, 125 apricot, C, 24, 1, 125 apple, A, 13, 1, 125 apple, B, 12, 1, 125 apple, C, 8, 1, 125 orange, A, 11, 4, 156 orange, B, 4, 4, 156 orange, C, 9, 4, 156 What I want to do for the next step is to answer the following question. Does the number of pauses correlate with the perceived difficulty? I tried to normalize the number of pauses. I composed a new data set by introducing a new variable "pauseFrequency", which is computed by dividing the number of pauses with the total length of the video of that week (same for all users in that week). group, person, difficulty, week, pauseFrequency apricot, A, 5, 1, 15/125 apricot, B, 3, 1, 23/125 apricot, C, 4, 1, 24/125 apple, A, 3, 1, 13/125 apple, B, 2, 1, 12/125 apple, C, 2, 1, 8/125 orange, A, 4, 4, 11/156 orange, B, 3, 4, 4/156 orange, C, 4, 4, 9/156 Then the problem seems to be easy. It seems that I just need to make correlation test with the difficulty column and the pauseFrequency column. I did it. I actually treat all difficulty/frequency pairs in the same way, no matter they are from the same group or from in the same week or whatever. I treat them as individual observation. I am using R for analysis, then I did a Kendall's Rank Correlation test like the following: cor.test(pauseFrequency,video.difficulty,method="kendall") This of course has generated a result, but I am not confident this is correct.I have two concerns: My measures are actually longitudinal and repeated, each user in each group is measured 5 times. The "task" for each week is actually different. Although they watched videos of the same course for 5 weeks, but each week they watch a different series of videos (with different content and lengths) The observations are actually not independent. How can I compensate for this non-independence in my data analysis?
