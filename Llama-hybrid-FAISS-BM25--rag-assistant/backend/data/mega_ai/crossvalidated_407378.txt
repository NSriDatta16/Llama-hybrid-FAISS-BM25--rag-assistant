Linear Mixed Model Failing to Converge

I am attempting to run a Multilevel Mediation in R with overtime data (4 time points, 50 participants). I was hoping to create two new columns for each outcome and predictor variable, a baseline column (to be able to look at their scores before the experiment) and an average column of time 2-4. To do this, I spread my data from long to wide, created a baseline column and calculated an average column for my time 2-4, leaving me with two new columns. My first problem that I ran into was that it was impossible to gather it back into long without filling in the values, so I used a full_join to accomplish this. This essentially filled in all 4 time points in the T2-4 column with that average that was created above. I did the same thing for the baseline column. For example: subject_id stress_T2-4 A1 5.76 A1 5.76 A1 5.76 A1 5.76 A2 3.75 A2 3.75 Once everything was joined, I then tried to run my models using the lmer function in the "lme4" package. To do the mediation with the overtime data, I am following the typical mixed models approach of building up the models slowly, like so: Intercept only model of y ~ 1 Random intercept model y ~ 1 + random participant/time effects Random intercept model y ~ 1 + random participant/time effects + X fixed effect predicting Y Random intercept model y ~ 1 + random participant/time effects + X fixed predicting M Random intercept model y ~ 1 + random participant/time effects + X fixed + M fixed predicting Y I am trying to use the new variable I created representing the t2-4 as the outcome (y) but when I do this I get three convergence errors. I am fairly new to mixed models so I am a little lost on how to interpret these errors: Warning messages: 1: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt$par, ctrl = control$checkConv, : Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 1.86262 (tol = 0.002, component 1) 2: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt$par, ctrl = control$checkConv, : Model is nearly unidentifiable: very large eigenvalue - Rescale variables? 3: In as_lmerModLT(model, devfun) : Model may not have converged with 1 eigenvalue close to zero: 1.3e-11 Q1: Am I going about separating time points and then generating averages correctly? Q2: Am I getting these convergence errors because of the repeated averages in the rows? Q3: Any suggestions for how I could be doing this better?
