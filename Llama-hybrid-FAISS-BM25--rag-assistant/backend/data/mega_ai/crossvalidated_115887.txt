The role of an agent based model is primarly one of theory not as an empirical description of reality; it is a "story" of why certain results could happen not a "description" of things we have seen. The purpose of a theory is to give a possible explanation of why certain things happen. Ideally your model is extremely simple and still produce the feature you are looking to explain. A good example is Schelling's segregation model . The fact that small changes in parameters can lead to large changes in outcomes can be part of the story, but you need to be substantively interested in both the parameter and the outcome, and after being initially surprised, the reader should gain from your model an idea of why such instability happens. Moreover, after you have written your theory you (or some other group) still needs to go into the field and test whether your theory corresponds to reality. If your simulation is too complex, such that it no longer tells a story that is understandable for humans, then that is a problem. You either need to simplify your simulation, typically by making sure you really focuss on one outcome and one mechanism and trim everything out of your model that is not related to that outcome or mechanism. Alternatively, you could look for a analytical solution. Even if you are not succesful in finding such a analytical solution, the process of looking for one may be enough to give you inspiration on how to simplify or interpret the model.
