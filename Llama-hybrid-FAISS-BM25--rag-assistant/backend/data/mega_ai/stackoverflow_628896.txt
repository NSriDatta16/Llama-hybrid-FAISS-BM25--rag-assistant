The screenshots in Bug Genie look a little advanced for the average user. Not sure if this is a web app or desktop app, but I'd try to set up something that's just a few easy clicks and kinda a description of what they were doing when the bug occurred. If possible, giving them an option of automatically sending log files and machine specs would be nice, but that's dependent on whether or not that's available. We use FogBugz as our bug tracking software, and have made a submit error dialog that allows the user to send a message along with the stacktrace. Obviously if this is a web app that's probably not an option, but try to get as much automated information as you can get
