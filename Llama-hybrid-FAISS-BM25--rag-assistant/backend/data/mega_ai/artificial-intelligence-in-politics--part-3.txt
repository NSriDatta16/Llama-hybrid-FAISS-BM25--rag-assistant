l analytics through Cambridge Analytica's psychographic targeting system, categorizing voters into eight distinct groups including a "Deterrence" category designed to suppress turnout among likely Clinton supporters. The campaign integrated social media manipulation with automated content generation, demonstrating AI's potential for political influence at unprecedented scale and precision. The Cambridge Analytica scandal that broke in March 2018 exposed the extent of AI-powered political manipulation and data harvesting, triggering global conversations about digital privacy and democratic integrity. The revelations demonstrated how advanced AI techniques could be weaponized for political purposes, leading to increased regulatory scrutiny and public awareness of AI's political implications. Generative AI campaigns (2024-) The emergence of generative AI systems like ChatGPT in 2022 accelerated both capabilities and concerns about AI's political impact. During 2024, election cycles around the world saw widespread use of AI for campaign content creation, voter targeting, and real-time sentiment analysis. Twenty major tech companies pledged to combat AI misuse in elections, reflecting industry recognition of the technology's potential for democratic harm. Potential benefits of AI in politics Artificial intelligence is increasingly utilized in the political sphere, with some people saying it's offering various potential benefits to democratic processes. AI tools can facilitate improved communication between citizens and public administration. Some say that technologies present an opportunity to enhance the democratic process, enabling citizens to gain a better understanding of political issues and participate more easily in democratic discourse. Politicians have been utilizing AI to promote strategies and foster closer communication with citizens, potentially increasing democratic participation and educating the public on policy matters. For example, the Danish Synthetic Party is led by an AI responsible for its political program, and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen used Chat GPT in a parliamentary speech to highlight AI's potential. Supporters of Artificial Intelligence have said that AI applications like chatbots or learning machine tools can foster a more direct and persuasive contact with people, educate citizens on democratic principles and policy matters, and motivate them to express their opinions to governments and politicians The integration of AI can also make political campaigns more efficient and cost-effective, allowing for quick execution and the ability to capture citizen queries and predict their needs for more targeted engagement. Challenges and dangers of AI in politics AI in Elections Artificial intelligence is increasingly impacting elections globally, with growing concerns that powerful generative AI systems and deepfakes will destabilize democracies. These technologies make it easy for anyone with a smartphone and a imagination to create fake, yet convincing, content aimed at fooling voters. AI deepfakes tied to elections in Europe and Asia have spread through social media throughout 2025, serving as a warning for future elections in other nations. Recent examples include AI-generated audio recordings of Slovakia's liberal party leader discussing vote rigging and raising beer prices, a video of Moldova's pro-Western president throwing support behind a Russian-friendly party, and a robocall impersonating U.S. President Joe Biden urging voters to abstain from a primary election As the public becomes more aware that video and audio can be convincingly faked, some may exploit this by denouncing authentic media as deepfakes. The deployment of AI in the political area falls into a high-risk category due to its potential problems. AI tools, when deployed on social media, can generate misleading content at a speed and scale that outpaces governmental oversight and society's ability to manage the consequences
