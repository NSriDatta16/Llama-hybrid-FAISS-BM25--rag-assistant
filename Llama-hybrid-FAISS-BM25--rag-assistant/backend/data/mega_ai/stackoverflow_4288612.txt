I don't think there's a way to limit to n results in a predicate, only at the fetch request level. Aside from referencing the last n items in a relationship as you mentioned, you might try a boolean attribute "lastN" and flip them on/off when you curate the order of the list (say, during user-initiated sort or drag-and-drop reordering). Alternatively, you could create a separate fetch request for each searched thing that sorts by your sort key, ordered descending, and is limited (via -setFetchLimit: ) to n results. Tracking this as a relationship or an attribute is somewhat "messy" whereas the fetch limit is more expensive (because of multiple round trips). If your reordering is done by one-off user actions, it might be better performance-wise to use the relationship or attribute approach since the work is amortized rather than done all at once in a series of fetches. I haven't found a better way myself and will follow this one closely. :-)
