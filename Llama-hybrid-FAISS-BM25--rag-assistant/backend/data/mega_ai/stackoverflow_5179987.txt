It's called programming ;). Start by dividing the task in simpler sub-tasks and implement those. For example, in your case, I'd design the program like this: Download and parse the HTML document Extract all text content (pay special attention to and elements) Merge the text content to one long string Solve the problem of finding sentences in a string (likely, just parse until you find a stop character in ".!?" and then start a new sentence) Discard false positives (Like empty sentences, number-only sentences etc.)
