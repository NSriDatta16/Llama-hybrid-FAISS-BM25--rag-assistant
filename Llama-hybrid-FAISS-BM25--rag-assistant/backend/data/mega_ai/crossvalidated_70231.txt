If your data are paired (as they seem to be, since you are supposed to use paired t-tests) the Kruskal Wallis is not appropriate as it is for independent data. I think a Friedman test is better suited to your question (see Wikipedia article ) On the table - you certainly can use chi-square here, but since you have a dependent variable (egg observed) and an independent variable (treatment) it might be better to use logistic regression. But, it appears that your data are not independent since the trees were in clusters; therefore, a nonlinear mixed model might be even better (if trees in clusters are likely to be similar, as seems likely); there are also other methods for dealing with clustered samples
