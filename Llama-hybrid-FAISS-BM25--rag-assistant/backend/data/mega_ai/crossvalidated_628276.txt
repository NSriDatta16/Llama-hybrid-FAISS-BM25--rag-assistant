Logistic Regression Transformation, Standardization

I am log-transforming my predictor variables to meet the linearity on the logit assumption for logistic regression. In so doing, I am adding a constant to ensure the minimum value is 1 . My question is, if I then standardize my columns (e.g., min-max scaling), I will again end up with zeros that I will have to add a constant to, to ensure I can do more logistic regresison diagnostics like testing linearity on the logit, etc. Is there any other way around having to add a constant twice, as described above?
