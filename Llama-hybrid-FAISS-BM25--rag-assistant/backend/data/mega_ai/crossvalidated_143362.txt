In Time series analysis, there is a methodology called intervention analysis originally developed by Box and Tiao in 1975. The intervention analysis can be done using transfer function modeling within arima framework. Below is the common type of intervention shapes from the article cited above. I think the one you are after is figure (f) below. You might have to modify transfer function to fit the shape of your specific curve. One you modify the curve and fit the model using Arima/transfer function framework, then you could do significance testing on your hypothesized curve shape. Another excellent book for transfer function modeling is Forecasting with Dynamic Regression Models by Pankratz . Based on your edit to the question, it appears that you have a pulse input and a rapid decline in your response and settles to a new level for a while. I would go with figure (e). On a side note, Box is an amazing applied statistician and was able to think about a problem and visually present it in a highly readable paper (even non statistician like me could understand it) and could be applied to a problem even 50 years later.
