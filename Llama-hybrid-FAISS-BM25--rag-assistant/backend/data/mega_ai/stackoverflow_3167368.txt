How to use NSIS with Maven2 and continuous integration?

I want to include an installer created by NSIS into a Java project organized with Maven2. How can I incorporate this so that the installer is automatically built each time I use maven to create a distribution? I've tried the following: http://mojo.codehaus.org/nsis-maven-plugin/plugin-info.html The only way I could include the plugin was by pulling down a copy of the source in svn and building my own snapshot of the codehaus plugin code. Now it tells me I need to enter the location of makensis. Problem being, the continuous integration server is running on linux. Am I SOL?
