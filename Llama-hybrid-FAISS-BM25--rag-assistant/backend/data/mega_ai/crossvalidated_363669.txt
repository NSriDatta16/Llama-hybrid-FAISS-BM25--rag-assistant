K-nearest neighbor supervised or unsupervised machine learning?

I've read in several papers that K-nearest neighbor can be supervised or unsupervised learning. Is Knn always unsupervised when one use it for clustering and supervised when one used it for classification? I've to know if there is a unsupervised Knn in classification as well. Thanks in advance!
