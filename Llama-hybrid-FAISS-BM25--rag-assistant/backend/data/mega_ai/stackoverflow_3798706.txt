EDIT: I point out a syntax gotcha in my answer, which you still have to fix before your program will work correctly, but for now the real problem lies in your first few lines: Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); int grade = 0; // initial value to satify loop condition double averageGrade = 0.0; int max = keyboard.nextInt(); int min = max; int next = keyboard.nextInt(); Your program is executing something but it's saying nothing, and printing the error only when you stop, all because of a mistake in your program's implementation. It's not a syntax error, however; it's just that you forgot something important here. Wcrousse in his answer explains what's happening. There is a syntax issue are multiple similar syntax issues somewhere in your code that are actually legal syntax, which is why your IDE and the compiler aren't complaining. However, they're more often really a very common mistake that causes unintended behavior. Pay particular attention to your semicolons, and try looking through your code again. Or, use your debugger as Gabe suggests, that'll give you a better idea what's happening.
