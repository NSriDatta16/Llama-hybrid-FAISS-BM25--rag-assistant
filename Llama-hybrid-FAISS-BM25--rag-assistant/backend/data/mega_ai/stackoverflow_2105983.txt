From a UI perspective, when an alert view is present, it should demand the user's full attention. Perhaps you might consider disabling the Cancel button (as well as any other visible non-alert-view widgets) when there is an alert view present, and adding a button title to the UIAlertView instance which performs the same task. This would provide a clearer user interface and should also neatly solve your memory issue.
