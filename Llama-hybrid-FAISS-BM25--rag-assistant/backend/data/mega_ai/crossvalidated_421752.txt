How to convert beta from logistic regression into cohen's d?

Is there a way to transform a coefficient from a logistic regression into a cohen's d value? I am trying to calculate the cohen's d for a study with a binary DV while controlling for another variable. I can calculate cohen's d from the log odd ratio, but that does not control for the other variables, which I have included as controls in the logistic regression. This is for an internal meta-analysis where we combine across 12 studies with binary and scale DVs. Let me know if you have any suggestions.
