Air in synthetic DICOM

I'm generating a synthetic DICOM image with the Insight Toolkit (using itk::GDCMImageIO) and I've found two problems: VolView fails loading my DICOM (with the message: Sorry, the file cannot be read). ITK-Snap opens and shows it OK. I'm trying to use this image in a Stryker surgical navigator. The problem is that the image is loaded ok, but then the padding pixels are shown in a certain gray level, showing a box (actually the bounding box) of the image. If I load non synthetic DICOMs this doesn't happen. This is what gdcminfo is showing: MediaStorage is 1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.7 [Secondary Capture Image Storage] TransferSyntax is 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 [Explicit VR Little Endian] NumberOfDimensions: 2 Dimensions: (33,159,1) Origin: (0,0,0) Spacing: (1,1,1) DirectionCosines: (1,0,0,0,1,0) Rescale Intercept/Slope: (0,1) SamplesPerPixel :1 BitsAllocated :16 BitsStored :16 HighBit :15 PixelRepresentation:0 ScalarType found :UINT16 PhotometricInterpretation: MONOCHROME2 PlanarConfiguration: 0 TransferSyntax: 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 Orientation Label: AXIAL I'm using unsigned short as pixel type in itk::Image object and I'm setting all the padding pixels to 0 (zero), as is suggested by the DICOM standard for unsigned scalar images. gdcminfo does not show it, but I'm also setting the Pixel Padding (0028,0120) field to zero. I would really appreciate any hint about this problem. Thanks in advance, Federico
