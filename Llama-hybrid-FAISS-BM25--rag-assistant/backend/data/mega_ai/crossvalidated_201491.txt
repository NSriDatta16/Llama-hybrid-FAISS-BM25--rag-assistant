How do you learn GLove word vectors?

$X_{ik} = \# $ times work $i$ occurs in the context of work $k$. $X_i$ is the number of times word $i$ occurs. $P_{ik} = \frac{X_{ik}}{X_i}$. It's not clear to me what equation 3 solves and why the solution to (4) is $F=exp$. Glove Paper: http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf
