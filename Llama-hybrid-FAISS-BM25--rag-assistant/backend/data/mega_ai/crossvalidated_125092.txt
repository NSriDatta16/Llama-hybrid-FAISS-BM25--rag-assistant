Number of variables for decision trees

I have a data with just 5 independent variables and a response. I am dealing with a classification problem. Will decision trees perform well or the number of variables have to be higher to get something really useful out of the tree based methods? What is the appropriate number of variables that may encourage one to use decision trees?
