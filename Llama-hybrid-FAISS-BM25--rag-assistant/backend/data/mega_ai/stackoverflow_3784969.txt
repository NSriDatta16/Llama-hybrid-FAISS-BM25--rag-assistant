What folder structure do you use

Whether you structure your PHP application yourself or use a framework (MVC or other), what folder structure do you find most logical and you've been finding that you've been sticking to. I still haven't developed a folder structure that I'm committed to, but I noticed that all my projects even the 2 page ones at least have a webroot folder (for files like htaccess, index, css, havascript) and another folder for the above the web root stuff where I try to keep as much of the files as possible. Pretty basic. Hoping to hear what others are doing to keep their programs organized.
