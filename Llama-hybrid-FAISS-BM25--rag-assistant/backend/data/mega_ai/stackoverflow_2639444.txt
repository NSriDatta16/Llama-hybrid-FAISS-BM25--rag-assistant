O(n log n) == "linearithmic" Seems to have been coined by Robert Sedgewick in the book Algorithms In C . Also called quasilinear or loglinear. However, linearithmic has the added bonus of not being an overloaded term (quasilinear is used in economics and differential equations, while loglinear is used in economics and regression analysis).
