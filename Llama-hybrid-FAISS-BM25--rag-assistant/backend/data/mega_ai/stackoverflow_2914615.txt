What's the most efficient way to create routes on google maps from gps files?

I want to display my bicycle routes on Google maps. All the coordinates are recorded by my GPS and stored in .gpx file format. I'd like to know what's the best approach/file formats/storage/loading the coordinates on Google Maps. This is a good example but it doesn't seem to be working.
