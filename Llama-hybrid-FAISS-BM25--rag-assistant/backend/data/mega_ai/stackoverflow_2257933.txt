Your DataStorage is like the StudentRegistration is used in the sample code. // TIP: It can be handy to place the student in some order in the Map // (therefore using the sorted map). private SortedMap students = new TreeMap(); // QUESTION: Why not use argument name 'student'? public void addStudentMember(Student aAcc) { students.put(aAcc.getUser(),aAcc); } // Updated implementation public void addStudent(Student student) { students.put(student.getAccID(), student); } // QUESTION: Would a method name 'getNumberOfStudents' not be better? public int getStudentRows() For me it is a little unclear why Student extends from Account . The account identification, is that an unique-id, through the hole system? Do staff (users) and student (users) all have that as unique identification? Where / who creates them? If not the system self, it can never be guranteed that they also enter correctly into your system. Even when checking on uniqueness within your system, helps. But who say not someone else (by accedent) used someone else his/her unique id? (How are the student and staff (accounts) created? If these id's are indeed unique, why not use those for placing the student into a SortedMap? If the sorting is not important. Why not just use a List of students? Is the name parameter unique (by which you place the student in the Map)? Programming is little more then learning a programming language. As once understanding the OO-language Java it is good to read some more general programming books. In your specific case I would say start with Domain Driven Design . And then continue with books like these Test Driven Development , Refactoring to Patterns and Design Patterns .
