Input fields rendered very differently in different browsers

Okay, so I am in the process of designing a website which has a login form at the top-right corner of a webpage. I set the size attribute of its input fields and I am getting some interesting results. Below is a group of screenshots that I threw together. I even stacked them for you all. I am even throwing in a jsFiddle for you all. So four things: I aligned them based on the bottom right hand corner of the password input field in the stacked image. Don't ask why. I design with borders on everything until the layout is correct, then I remove them and add the colors and images and whatnot. The IE 9 screenshot is based on Adobe's BrowserLab since I am working on a Mac. Note that the WebKit-based browsers (Safari and Chrome) render the same size. I could not find anything to reveal what is happening after a series of searches. Maybe it's because it's hard to word a question like this into simple search terms (or at least for me)â€¦ With all of this said, my question is why is are the input fields rendered so differently, and most importantly, how can I remedy this (without JavaScript or the dependence on User Agents preferably)?
