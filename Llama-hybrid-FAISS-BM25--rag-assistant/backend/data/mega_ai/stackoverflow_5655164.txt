Can anyone indicate any other language with a system similar to Haskell? Several languages have immutable variables (i.e. variables in the mathematical sense) by default: Haskell (obviously), Clean, Erlang, ML. Others encourage this behavior via 'const' or 'val' declarations (Scala, C). In many functional languages mutable values may only be introduced via explicit 'ref' or 'var' declarations.
