How to predict the class membership using the multinomial logistic regression?

I have the three classes and the true regression coefficients for two predictors and one intercept for each class as R=3 #three class beta=matrix(c(-1.5,1,1.5, -0.5,1,-1.5, 0,0,0), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = T)# Third class is the reference category[all coefficients are zero]. I have the followoing predictors with five subjects structure(list(X1 = c(-0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 0.5, -0.5), X2 = c(0.797644486414738, 1.43023656974306, 1.57799081483507, 0.391320317833996, -1.31154404820595 ), X3 = c(0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5)), row.names = c(NA, 5L), class = "data.frame") X1 X2 X3 1 -0.5 0.7976445 0.5 2 0.5 1.4302366 0.5 3 -0.5 1.5779908 -0.5 4 0.5 0.3913203 -0.5 5 -0.5 -1.3115440 -0.5 How can I determine the class membership for each row/id?
