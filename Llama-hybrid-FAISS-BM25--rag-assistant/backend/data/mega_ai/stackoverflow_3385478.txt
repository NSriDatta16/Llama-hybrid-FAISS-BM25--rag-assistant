Open source for Java EE presentation framework

I am going to create a Java EE based project, in which lots of GUI work is involved, like creating tree and drag and drop of objects (like routers and switch) kind of thinks. I would like to know if there is any open source available, with whom I can do rapid Java EE GUI development.
