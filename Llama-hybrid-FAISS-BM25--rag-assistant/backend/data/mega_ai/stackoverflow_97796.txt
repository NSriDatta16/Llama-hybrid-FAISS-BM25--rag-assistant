I'm guessing you're using RGB with byte values (0 to 255) as that's very common everywhere. For brighter, average the RGB values with the RGB of white. Or, to have some control over how much brightening, mix in them in some proportion. Let f vary from 0.0 to 1.0, then: Rnew = (1-f)*R + f*255 Gnew = (1-f)*G + f*255 Bnew = (1-f)*B + f*255 For darker, use the RGB of black - which, being all zeros, makes the math easier. I leave out details such as converting the result back into bytes, which probably you'd want to do.
