Whether it's good practice I can't say, but it strikes me as odd. Having XML fields in your SQL database are at least queryable (SQL Server 2000 or later, MySQL and others) but more often than not is a last resort for metadata. JSON is usually the carrier between JavaScript and your back end, not the storage itself unless you have a JSON back end document orientated database such as CouchDB or SOLR as JSON lends itself perfectly for storing documents. Not to say I don't agree with using JSON as a simple (that is, not serializing references) data serializer over XML, but I won't go into a JSON vs XML rant just for the sake of it :). If you're not using JSON for its portability between 2 languages, and you're positive you will never query the data from SQL you will be better off with the default serialization from .NET.
