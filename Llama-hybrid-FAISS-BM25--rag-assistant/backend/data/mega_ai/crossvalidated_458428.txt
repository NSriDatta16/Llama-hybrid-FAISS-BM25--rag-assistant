There are several shrinkage priors in the Bayesian context. For instance, the Horseshoe prior, the LASSO prior, and some others. See Hierarchical Shrinkage Priors for Regression Models For an implementation in STAN, see for instance: https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/bayesian-logistic-regression-with-horseshoe-prior/7484 Another option is to use the Polya-Gamma sampler from: Bayesian Inference for Logistic Models Using Pólya–Gamma Latent Variables This can be coupled with several shrinkage priors using another hierarchical level (as explained in the paper).
