Toward's Data Science has great articles and tutorials for a lot of things. Here's a good resource for you to review: https://towardsdatascience.com/explaining-feature-importance-by-example-of-a-random-forest-d9166011959e It's always best practice to use your training set when building out your models and whatnot. If you have data with classes that only have 1 element of data per each class, then you can use the whole dataset instead of breaking it into training and test sets. This is because you could expect the trained network to be 100% accurate in its predictions and there would be no need to be concerned with issues such as bias and variance in the resulting model. Read that article to its entirety because you have to pay attention to your data and what it's doing in order to correctly identify the best features.
