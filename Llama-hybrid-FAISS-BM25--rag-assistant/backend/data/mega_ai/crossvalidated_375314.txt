In a GARCH model for a time series $x_t$ we have \begin{aligned} x_t&\sim i.i.D(\mu_t,\sigma_t^2), \\ \mu_t&=... \text{ (conditional mean of } x_t \text{ given past information)} \\ \sigma_t^2&=\omega +\sum _{i=1}^{q}\alpha _{i}\epsilon _{t-i}^{2}+\sum _{i=1}^{p}\beta _{i}\sigma _{t-i}^{2} \text{ (conditional variance of } x_t \text{ given past information)} \end{aligned} where $D$ is some distribution parameterized by the conditional mean $\mu_t$ and conditional variance $\sigma_t^2$ , and $\epsilon_t:=x_t-\mu_t$ is an additive error term, a random variable itself. Meanwhile, $\sigma_t^2$ is the conditional variance of $x_t$ and simultaneously of $\epsilon_t$ , hence, a parameter (an unknown constant). You are right that $\mathbb{E}(\epsilon_t^2)=\sigma_t^2$ , but that does not make for $\epsilon_t^2=\sigma_t^2$ . When we are estimating the model, we treat $\sigma_t^2$ as an unknown parameter and estimate it along with the other parameters such as $\omega$ , $\alpha$ s and $\beta$ s. We are not putting in any numbers in for $\sigma_t^2$ in estimation because conditional variances are unobservable and are never a variable in our dataset (just like the other model parameters).
