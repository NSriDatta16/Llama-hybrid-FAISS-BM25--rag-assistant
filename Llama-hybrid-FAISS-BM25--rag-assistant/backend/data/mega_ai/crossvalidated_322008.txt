First, I would add a display of the model. After the model.compile(...) add: model.summary() This will give you a good picture of the data flow through the layers. Second, I would move the Dropout(...) layer right after the Embedding layer. If you are going to randomly drop samples then do it as early as possible to avoid doing unnecessary training. Then, your Dense(...) layer should use activation='softmax' Lastly, your model.compile should specify loss='categorical_crossentropy' since you want classification to 14 categories (not two which is binary classification). I would also suggest you add a: metrics=['accuracy'] to the model.compile .
