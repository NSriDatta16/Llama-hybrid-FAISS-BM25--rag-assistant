You should think from the perspective emulator not your hard drive. Your shared folder emulates SD card, emulator and Visual Studio do not know anything about that. Previous answer was correct, use "Output File Folder" and put the path "\Storage Card\". And run your app in Visual Studio - application will be deployed to a emulator 'storage card' which behind the scene is your shared folder.
