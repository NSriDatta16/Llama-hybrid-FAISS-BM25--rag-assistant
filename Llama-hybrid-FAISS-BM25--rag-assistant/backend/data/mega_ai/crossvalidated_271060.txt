No, it is not the same. Usually, DFM refers to a particular DLM where you assume the observables are dependent on an state vector of reduced dimension with no other structure: think of a PCA in which the principal components are allowed to evolve over time. DLM on the other hand refers to the situation in which the state elements may be related, have tendencies, seasonal effects, etc.
