A non-i.i.d observations in a Bayesian inference problem

Suppose we have a simple Bayesian network which has two variables $x$ and $y$, $x$ is the parent of $y$. We sample $M$ $x$s independently based on $P(x)$, named $x_1,\ldots,x_M$, and for every $x_i$, we sample $N$ $y$s independently based on $P(y|x)$, named $y_{i1},\ldots,y_{iN}$. In this way we have $MN$ observations $(x_i,y_{ij}),i=1,\ldots,M,j=1,\ldots,N$. Such observations are not i.i.d observations. Is there a term to call this type of observations? Are there any papers or materials to research the Bayesian inference problem based on such type of observations? (with more complex models and perhaps hidden variables)
