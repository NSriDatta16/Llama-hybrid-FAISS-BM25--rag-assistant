It sounds to me that you might be talking about performing sentiment analysis (if not, the previous two answers are very good, but skip to the last paragraph below). If that is the case, you I have some suggestions for you. I would recommend you to start from reading the draft of the introductory book "Sentiment analysis and opinion mining" by Bing Liu. The draft in a PDF document format is available for free here . More details about the new upcoming book of this author, as well as comprehensive information on the topic of aspect-based sentiment analysis, with references and links to data sets, are available at this page . Another interesting resource is a survey book "Opinion mining and sentiment analysis by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee. The book is available in print and as a downloadable PDF e-book in a published version or an author-formatted version , which are almost identical in terms of contents. Finally, speaking about software tools for NLP , in general, in addition to NLTK and other already recommended tools, I highly recommend you to evaluate the Stanford NLP Group 's open source software ( http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/software ). Should you need a more scalable solution in the future, you might want to take a look at another interesting set of open source libraries - parallel framework for machine learning GraphLab ( http://select.cs.cmu.edu/code/graphlab ). It is especially suitable for very large volume of data , as it implements MapReduce model and, thus, supports multicore and multiprocessor parallel processing .
