How can I get the probability of a predicted outcome conditional on the posterior in bayesian regression?

Assume that I am running the following regression: $\hat{y_t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_t$ where as $\hat{y_t}$ is a continuous variable. Lets assume a gaussian likelihood and nonconjugate priors such as $\beta_0 \sim N(0, 1)$ and $\beta_1 \sim Beta(1,1)$ Let's assume I have a dataset spanning from timestep $0$ to $t$ and call this dataset $h_t$ . Let's assume I obtain the posterior by some numerical method such as MCMC; let's denote these posterior estimates of our parameters as $\theta$ . Now, I am interested in obtaining the probability of observing a SPECIFIC outcome $z$ given some input $x_t$ ; thus, what I am interested in obtaining is the following: $p(y_{t+1} = z | x_{t+1}) = \int p(\theta|h_t)p(y_{t+1} = z | \theta, x_{t+1}) d\theta$ I believe that this expression is equal to zero since we have continuous outcomes; this should lead to $p(y_{t+1} = z | \theta, x_{t+1}) = 0$ ; thus we have to define intervals to properly define this expression as the following, let's assume three intervals, $z , $0 and $10 . Then, we can define, for example: $p(y_{t+1} \in z_{interval_1} | \theta, x_{t+1}) = \int p(\theta|h_t)p(y_{t+1} \in z_{interval} | \theta, x_{t+1}) d\theta$ where $z_{interval_1}$ denotes one of the intervals. Is this line of reasoning correct?
