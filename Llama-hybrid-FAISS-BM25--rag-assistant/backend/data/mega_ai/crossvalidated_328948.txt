Let's start with the elephant in the room: I don't think any statistical method can ensure a completely valid causal inference from your experimental design - you can definitely extract useful information, but if non-response and attitude towards diversity are correlated in both groups, your conclusions will always be limited and you should be aware of that. Using a large number of other predictors (GPA, etc.) might easily only make your analysis more fragile - be very wary of analyzing subgroups separately, you might be just chasing noise. You might improve your chances if you are able to collect attitude towards diversity before the intervention in both groups. Also I think your use of Likert is incorrect and likely to bias your inference (see below for more detail). With that cleared, what can be your best chance to extract useful information? The answer by L.B. Balzer seems to have a good overview of the frequentist approach, I would however place my bets on a Bayesian approach, where an interesting approach is given in Si et al. (including code at the end). The bonus part being that if you go Bayes, you don't have to worry that much about too many predictors, multiple comparisons etc. and you get more interpretable results (you can say things as "if the model is (approximately) correct, the probability of a n effect > X is Y%"). An aside on Likert items and scales : I think using a single Likert item (question) to measure something as complex as attitude towards diversity will be hihgly misleading. In particular, it is difficult to make sure everyone understand's the same thing from a single question - diversity is a loaded word! That's why it is preferable to use Likert scales (items and scales are often confounded, but those are distinct things). A Likert scale is a combination of multiple Likert items linked to the same construct you want to measure, sometimes in positive sometimes in negative sense. E.g. for your case some of the items might be: Some people on the campus are too different from me and it makes me feel uncomfortable I enjoy meeting people with different social background, sexual or gender identity I think the community in the campus is too homogenous Then you reverse the negatively coded questions and take the average of responses to the individual items -> this average is then your variable of interest. In addition to reducing noise from misunderstanding of some of the questions, the average tends to be almost normally distributed, so you don't have to do any complicated ordered logit or something. Some source for further discussion of this . I've heard (but not verified) this approach was in the original publication by Likert, but people tend to forget. Note that it is hard to design good Likert scales - there might be some well tested and validated set of items already available for diversity!
