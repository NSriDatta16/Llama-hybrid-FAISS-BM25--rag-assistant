What is the best way to set up a PHP development environment on a Mac?

When I do PHP, I use XAMPP to set up a development environment on Windows , then upload to Linux servers, works very well. I'm now passing on a PHP project to a person who has a Mac so he needs a local PHP dev environment. I noticed XAMPP has a version for Mac which I will recommend. But knowing that Mac is always a bit different , has anyone used any other easy PHP environment setup tool for the Mac, or I could even imagine that Mac solves this issue more elegantly by e.g. having a web server ready to go upon first boot etc. What is the best way to set up a PHP development environment on a Mac?
