Getting a reference to the xgboost object You should first get the XGBClassifier or XGBRegressor element from the pipeline. You could do this either by getting the n-th element or by specifying the name. clf = XGBClassifier() pipe = Pipeline([('other', other_element), ('xgboost', clf)]) To get the XGBClassifier you could either: use clf if you still have a reference to it index the pipeline by name: pipe.named_steps['xgboost'] index the pipeline by location: pipe.steps[1] Getting the importance Secondly, it seems that importance is not implemented for the sklearn implementation of xgboost. See this github issue . A solution to add this to your XGBClassifier or XGBRegressor is also offered over their. It boils down to adding the methods to the class yourself.
