Why don't you simply store the images on the file system, and only store their references on the database. That's a lot more elegant, and won't consume loads of your database. Also, you won't have to use any kind of binary functions to read them from the DB, saving memory and loading time. Is there a very specific reason why you wanna store it on the DB? Cheers
