They may be different because both the methods are very different from each other. While logistic regression tries to predict the outcome using each feature independently, the tree models try to do using combination of features. One way would be to see their performance on a totally unseen dataset. The better model performs very similar to the training dataset. Other would be to actually see if you features need a tree model or not. This would require domain knowledge. Another way would be to perform PCA on your features so that you're sure that you have independent features. Now you can feed them into a logistic regression model.
