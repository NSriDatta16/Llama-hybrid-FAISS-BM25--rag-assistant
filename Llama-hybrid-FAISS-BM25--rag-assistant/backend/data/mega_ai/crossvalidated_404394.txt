Why the dependent variable as a time series in GAM should be log transformed?

I found in Section 3.1 of this paper (see ), the author used log(y) due to "the context of a concentration time series". A book (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990) is cited, however I cannot get this book. So I asked this question: why we should log transform the y , when it is a time series?
