I don't think I have any good answers for you. But will throw out some ideas: (1) I wouldn't use the phrase "time series". The phrase "longitudinal data" or "repeat measures", will give you better google search results. (2) Collapsing the data on the subject level and then comparing responses seem like a good idea to me. This assumes time isn't significant. If time likely is significant longitudinal or repeat measures approach might be better = mixed-effects models. Given the missing data GEE models less likely to be useful. (3) If you're thinking of going the mixed-effect model route the following posting might be useful. Mixed-effects models can be tricky. With the likert-scale type outcome not sure how I would do it. Likert scale question divided into different group. How to calculate mean of different group?
