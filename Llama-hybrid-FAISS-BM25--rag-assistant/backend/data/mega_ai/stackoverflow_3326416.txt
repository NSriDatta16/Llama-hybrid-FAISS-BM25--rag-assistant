can I add the variable a or will a be nonexistant since its not part of the base class foo? What the other answers haven't quite said yet: your variable isn't a foo , you have a foo* . It's a pointer to some other area of memory of indeterminate size. So you're not restricted to storage size of a foo so yes you can have any amount of extra storage. If you allocated your variable as a foo with foo storage you can't shoehorn in more, i.e. foo anyFoo; ((bar*)(&anyFoo))->bar(); won't work.
