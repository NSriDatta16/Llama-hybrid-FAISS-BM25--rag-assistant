I see no reason why this scheme would not work: Two files contain storage mechanisms (or some other feature). They specify inheritance but contain no business logic: ProductDataAccess.cs ProductWeb.cs One file contains the business logic: ProductBusinessLogic.cs Now create two projects: WebProject contains ProductWeb.cs and ProductBusinessLogic.cs. DataProject contains ProductDataAccess.cs and ProductBusinessLogic.cs Both projects make use of the same business logic.
