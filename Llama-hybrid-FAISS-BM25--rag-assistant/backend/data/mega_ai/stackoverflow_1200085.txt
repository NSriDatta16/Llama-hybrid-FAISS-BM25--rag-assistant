how to search for a word in a book programmatically?

I need to develop an application that can search through a book and list out all the pages and lines that contain a given keyword. For books that are split up in some other way, such as a bible which is split up by chapter and verse; they would be able to search for all verses that contain a certain keyword. Or alternatively, search within certain chapters and verses for a keyword. What format should I store the book into? Should it be stored into a SQL database? What format would be easiest for searching as opposed to easiest for storage?
