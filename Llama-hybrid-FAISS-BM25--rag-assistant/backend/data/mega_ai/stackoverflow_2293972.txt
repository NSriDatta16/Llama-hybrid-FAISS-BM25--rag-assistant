Are you trying to FORCE the users to use your application (e.g. by selling these routers via an ISP), or are you expecting users to co-operate (e.g. inside a organisation's WAN)? If the latter, it may be sufficient to set the DHCP server inside the router to serve the address of an HTTP proxy. That will get picked up by most OS/browsers. The proxy can then be used to control web-traffic - which pages they can see, and which ones are redirected to your own web-app. If the user is considered an adversary, it would be trivial for them to override the proxy settings. In a LAN/WAN situation, you need to make sure nothing is connecting them to the outside world, except through the proxy.
