Sanitizing video embedding code in Rails. What's a good solution?

What's your preferred method of sanitizing embed code entered in a form? In other words, is there an easy way of ONLY allowing users to embed video from YouTube and Vimeo for example? Do you use the Sanitize helper? If there is a proven solution to this I'd prefer to use it rather than reinventing the wheel. Thank you for reading my question.
