What is the average asymptotic depth of a simple unbalanced search tree?

For a balanced search tree, it is O(log(N)) for all cases. For unbalanced search trees, the worst case is O(N), e.g., insert 1, 2, 3, 4,.. and best case complexity is when it is balanced, e.g., insert 6, 4, 8, 3, 5 7. How do we define the average case complexity for unbalanced search tree?
