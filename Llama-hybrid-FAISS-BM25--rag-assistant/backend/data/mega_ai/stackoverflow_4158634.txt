You might be conflating the concepts of a tree and a map. A Java Map provides an interface that allows you to map a bunch of objects using (usually) another type of object as the key. In your case, it appears you'll be using Longs as keys. The concrete Map can be either a HashMap or a TreeMap, each of which has its own advantages -- HashMap retrieval is usually faster, but TreeMap has the advantage of sorted keys. But you can't force TreeMap to create a particular tree structure. It'll manage its tree shape itself. To represent your tree items you'll need some kind of tree node object, supporting operations like addChild, getChildren, getParent. If you build your tree using tree node objects, then you can easily add those objects to a map and retrieve them by id.
