There is an R package named RecordLinkage that describes the algorithm in the documentation. I don't think it actually makes clear how the weights are calculated (and neither does Contiero et al.'s paper). There is a term they refer to as the "average frequency of values" which I am trying to clarify. It appears that it might actually be the average proportion of values (which is just the reciprocal of the number of distinct values in a field, and is how I've implemented it). EpiLink actually works surprisingly well (assuming I'm correct about the above, and it doesn't perform better than my experiments show). There is an approach due to Winkler that seems to perform better when using the Jaro-Winkler measure on suitable data (Contiero at el. advocate the Dice coefficient). I have something that seems to perform better than both. I can be emailed at d_g_smtih147@gmial.com if you remove the underscores and correct the 2 obvious typos first.
