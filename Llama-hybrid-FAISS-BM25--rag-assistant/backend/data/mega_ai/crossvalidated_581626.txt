Random Forest math pure Investigation

i am here to ask u for some material. To put you in context: I am a math pure student and i want to make an article in Random Forest (or a thesis adding other supervised learning algorithms if it is possible, idk) but i am doing it alone. So, i am asking for articles and books on the subject, but more theorical than practice because i have a lot of these books (i think it is because the job demand in data science). Something like Leo breiman articles or "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman. Thanks a lot for help, sincerely a frustrated student.
