Well I've found a solution. It goes like this: Drag a UISCrollView in IB's main window (where we have the File's Owner and First Responder objects). Rescale it to the size of the initial view Drag and drop everything from the original view to the scroll view. Link the scroll view's referencing outlet to the file's owner view property. Delete the old view from IB's main window.
