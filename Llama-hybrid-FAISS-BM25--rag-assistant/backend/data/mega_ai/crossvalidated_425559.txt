Given an input $x$ , scikit-learn's random forest implementation estimates the probability of each class, as described in the documentation here . Class probabilities are computed for each tree as the frequency of class labels among training points in the same leaf node as $x$ . The class probabilities are averaged across trees to produce a final distribution over classes. This distribution can be accessed using the predict_proba() and predict_log_proba() methods. To produce a point estimate, the predict() method predicts the class of $x$ as the class with the highest probability.
