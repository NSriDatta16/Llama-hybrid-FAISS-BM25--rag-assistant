Does colinearity between independent factors weaken my model?

I understand if a linear regression model is used colinearity is a major problem and thus my model can be weak. However, what is the case if I got a trained model with high R-squared from other algorithms such as random forest, SVM, or CART? Does colinearity between explanatory variables weaken my model?
