If the keys are NSNumbers and you know they're sequential, and you want to remove the lower values, then: int limit=20; //set to whatever you want int excess = limit - [dict count]; if (excess > 0) { for (int i = 1; i If your keys are NSStrings then just create the NSString with the corresponding format. If your keys are not sequential, then you would have to either have a parallel dictionary with the date of storage for each entry, so you would know when each entry was stored and you can remove the oldest, or you need to use something else entirely (if you are storing sequential integers as keys, wouldn't it be easier to use NSMutableArray?)
