Well...DBAPI is that frontend: This API has been defined to encourage similarity between the Python modules that are used to access databases. By doing this, we hope to achieve a consistency leading to more easily understood modules, code that is generally more portable across databases, and a broader reach of database connectivity from Python. It has always worked great for me atleast, care to elaborate the problems you are facing?
