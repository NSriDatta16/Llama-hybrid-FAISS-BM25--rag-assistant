Classification of a free text field to determine which product

I have a problem. I have a free text field and I would like to use NLP to determine which product should be selected. This involves concepts such as weight, speed, size and so on. Here is an example: If the weight is over 50 kg, take product A. If less than the upper weight, take product B. I also have the labelled data for the corresponding free text fields. Free text Product Weight Size (see above) A 110 50x58x98 What is the best approach to solve such a problem? Is there any literature on this subject? Is there also any blog/paper/jupyter notebook or anything else where someone implemented a similar classifciation.
