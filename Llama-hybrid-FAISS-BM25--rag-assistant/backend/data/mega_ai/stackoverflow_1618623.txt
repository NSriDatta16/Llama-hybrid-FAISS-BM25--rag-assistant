I would guess that you have the security settings set in a way so that the assemblies certificates get verified. So it likely tries to access the web to verify some certificate and then waits for a timeout (30 sec is a VERY typical timeout number). You can verify this if you look at what happens in that 30 seconds. For my guess to be true there should be little CPU use and little HDD accesses in those 90 seconds. If you have high CPU use or bound by your HDD then it's something else. BTW: Another option would be if your HDD is completely full and the assemblies are EXTREMELY fragmented (but 90 secs would be more than I ever heard of in that case).
