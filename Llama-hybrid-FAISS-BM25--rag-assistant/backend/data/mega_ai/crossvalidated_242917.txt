Time Series: Examples for Drift, Drift + Trend, Trend

I started using R and applying the vars package in R. According to the documentation, there are the options to select none , constant , trend , or both . I analyzed my time series and were able to plot the graphs, as shown below. However, some feedback on selecting the appropriate VAR model would be great. The concept of a "trend" ( this post is good ) is clear, but visually detecting "constant", also known as "drift", or a time series with "non-zero mean", if I'm correct, seems little unclear. 1 2
