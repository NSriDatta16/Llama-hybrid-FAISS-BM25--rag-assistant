Calculated Projected "End Date" for Event

In reviewing average event duration (such as a service call), I notice that the most recent event average duration appears to be falling; appears to be a trend in event time reduction. However, only events that have been completed/closed are displayed since the line is created by counting the total days between event creation and event completion. The more difficult the event, the longer it takes to complete. The trend is an accurate representation of the data today - but it will shift over time as more of the complex events with longer duration times are completed. A review of events not yet completed shows the rise of incomplete events beginning in Q4 2015 and continuing to a crossover point in Q2 2018 where more events are open than are closed. How can I project/forecast the event duration for the, as yet, incomplete events to ensure the viewer does not incorrectly assume the process is improving? Average duration of all completed events prior to the Q4 2015 date is 202.9 days; Average duration of all completed events in the data set is 167 days.
