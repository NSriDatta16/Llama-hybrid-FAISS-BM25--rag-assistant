The "indicator to identify the deterministic pulses" is found by filtering the series for any autoregressive properties ; any level shifts , any local time trends , any "one-time pulses". The "cleansed series" can then be evaluated for the occurrence ( if any ) when thie phenomenon started. Please review some of my postings regarding INTERVENTION DETECTION , specifically the search for "SEASONAL PULSES" . You might review http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf and any and all material at http://www.autobox.com (particularly the AFS University material) for additional insights and help in this challenging area of time series analysis/prediction and signal analysis. For transparency purposes I should mention that I am one of the authors of AUTOBOX which speaks directly to the issue you raise. Hope this helps !
