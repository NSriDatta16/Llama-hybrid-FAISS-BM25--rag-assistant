Resizable page with min-width and position absolute?

I'm working on a resizable page with a sidemenu to the right, and it almost works as supposed on this simple example: http://pastehtml.com/view/1do8cy9.html The problem though is that position auto and min-width dont react as expected. If you drag the browserwindow smaller than 500px (as the min-width is set to), the red sidemenu continues over the green content.. How do I make the sidebar stop when it reaches the min-width, fx 500px?
