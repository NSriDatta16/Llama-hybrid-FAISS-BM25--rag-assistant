Binomial logistic regression with multiple Likert-scale (ordinal) predictors

My colleague wants to perform binomial logistic regression with data that include: binomial (T/F) response variable 35 different Likert-scale (1-5) predictor variables to choose between. N = 300 They are trying to do the analyses in R. At first I considered suggesting glm as follows: glm(Y ~ X1 + X2 ..., data = dataset.name, family = binomial) However, I don't think it's appropriate to treat the likert-scale predictors as continuous or as categorical data using factor() . These predictors are truly ordinal data. Although a number of R packages exist that can fit one or more types of ordinal regression models, the most comprehensive among these seems to be the VGAM package. However, I'm not sure how to incorporate a binomial response in a VGAM model. Perhaps this isn't possible? Perhaps another package would be better? Question: What would be the appropriate way to perform a binomial logistic regression in R incorporating ordinal-scale predictor variables?
