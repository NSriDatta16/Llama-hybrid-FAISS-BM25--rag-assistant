How to find the installation directory of a third-party application, such as Google Earth, using C#?

I have the following code fragment that starts a Google Earth process using a hardcoded path: var process = new Process { StartInfo = { //TODO: Get location of google earth executable from registry FileName = @"C:\Program Files\Google\Google Earth\googleearth.exe", Arguments = "\"" + kmlPath + "\"" } }; process.Start(); I want to programmatically fetch the installation location of googleearth.exe from somewhere (most likely the registry).
