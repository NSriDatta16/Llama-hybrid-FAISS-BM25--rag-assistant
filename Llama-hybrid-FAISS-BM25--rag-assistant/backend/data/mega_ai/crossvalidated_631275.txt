weird lasso prediction when using lambda 1se

I have performed a leave-one out cross-validated prediction using a lasso regression (with both lambda min and lambda 1se). My sample size is 52 and I have a bit more than 20 predictors. While lambda min give me acceptable results, the lambda 1se gives me weird results: The correlation between predicted and actual data is negative, the range of predicted value is very small. On each crossvalidation iteration the lambda 1se is always higher than lambda min and the deviance from the ideal model is almways 0% with lambda 1se (while it is 59% with lambda min on average on the 52 iterations). Given I have about the same pattern of results using ridge or elastic net regression I believe this the right results but I am just unsure what is the reason of this result?
