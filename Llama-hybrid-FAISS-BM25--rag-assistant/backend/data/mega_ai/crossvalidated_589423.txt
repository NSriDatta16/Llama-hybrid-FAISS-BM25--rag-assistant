Although ordinal regression is a generally useful choice for ordered outcomes, in this particular case a binary regression could also be considered. In each of the 3 trials per individual there is a binary choice: local versus non-local. In R you can model this situation with binary regression, coding the outcomes in a two-column integer matrix of c(successes, failures) with a row for each individual. That would also allow for individuals who didn't finish all 3 trials. See the Details of the R help page for family . I suspect that STATA allows for similar coding. My impression is that would provide the same result as ordinal logistic regression here, but I haven't thought that through carefully. A potential advantage of using binary regression is that it's (perhaps unfortunately) more likely to be familiar to your audience than ordinal regression and thus easier to explain. A binary regression could also be used to evaluate changes in outcome probabilities as a function of trial number, although it might be unlikely in this study. You could separate out each trial with a 0/1 outcome and annotation of the individual and trial number, treat the individuals as random effects in a mixed model, and include trial number as a covariate.
