What is the l1-normalization of some data?

From this page and in this paper (first paragraph of chapter 2.1) there is the term of " $l_1$ -normalization" or absolute normalization of a vector (i.e. some data). The scope is to turn the data into a distribution (PMF) that sums up to 1. The definition on the page is: It may be defined as the normalization technique that modifies the dataset values in a way that in each row the sum of the absolute values will always be up to 1. It is also called Least Absolute Deviations. For example $v=[1,2,3]^T$ . Does the $l_1$ -normalization simply mean: $$ l_1(v_i)=\frac{|v_i|}{\sum_{j=1}^n |v_j|} \Leftrightarrow l_1(v)=[\frac{1}{6},\frac{2}{6},\frac{3}{6}]^T $$ ? Also, is this "better" in terms of keeping the original proportions than the min-max or softmax normalization?
