If you considered this a ranking problem, look here . If you want to look at the cutting edge methodologies used in the business, you could dig in the forum of the home-depot competition . The subject is the same: finding the best next product, but the competition is not yet finished. For nearly similar subject, you could also look at the github page of the crowd flower winner . In that case, the most efficient method is a particularly well chosen set of features combined with an ensemble selection. In the Allstate competition, the second is a random forest well calibrated. Generally, random forest and gradient boost are considered reliable model. If you want to try more "fancy" algorithm, you could try bayesian model or neural network . But I considered the first not handy with big dataset (> 100K individuals, >60 features) and the second painful to parameterise, and advise so to use mainly for unsupervised task.
