Import orders file on magento enterprise or community (product with customs options)

We need to import some orders file on magento enterprise. In our file, products contains customs Options. We tried to make an extension but we have some problems to import Customs options. The import of standard product is successful but not for the product with customs options. For customs option, missing "info_buyRequest" valu in database. The technical support of magento we responded "the import process currently can't handle importing products with custom options". Magento use custom options when ordering a product with customs options on website. What features do magento use to fill in the fields "info_buyRequest" and "Product_options" when ordering? Have you see a extension pack for import file order with product contains customs options? Thanks for your help.
