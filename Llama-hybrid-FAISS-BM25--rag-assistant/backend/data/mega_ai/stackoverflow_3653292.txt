Sorry to say this, but this class won't be working as HashMap or even simple dictionary. First of all, value returned from GetHashCode() is not unique. Two different objects, e.g. two strings, can possibly return same hash code value. The idea to use hash code as the array index then simply leads to record loss in case of hash code clashing. I would suggest reading about GetHashCode() method and how to implement it from MSDN. Some obvious example is if you get hash code of all possible Int64 values starting at 0, the hash code will surely be clashed at some point. Another thing is, the for-loop lookup is slow. You should consider using binary search for look up. To do so, you must maintained your key-value pair sorted by the key at any time, which imply that you should use List instead of array for the storage variable so when adding new key-value pair you can insert it at the appropriate index. After all, make sure that when you are coding for real hash map, you realized that hash code can be the same for different keys, and never do the look up with for-loop from 0 to len-1.
