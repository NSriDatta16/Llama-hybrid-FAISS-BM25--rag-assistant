The convolution filter in CNN is a generalized linear model (GLM) for the underlying data patch. What is the intuition behind this statement?

Lin's Network in Network paper ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4400v3.pdf ) posits that the convolution filter in a CNN is akin to a GLM. How is the filter acting like a GLM on the matrix? Thanks!
