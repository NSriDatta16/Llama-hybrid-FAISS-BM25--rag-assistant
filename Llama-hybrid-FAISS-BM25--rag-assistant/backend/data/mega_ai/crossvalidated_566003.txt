Is logistic regression or a random forest model better suited for this particular data?

I am developing two separate models. I chose to use logistic regression to analyze both models. I am not familiar with random forest models, so I wanted to make sure my reasoning for choosing logistic regression over random forest was sound. Model 1: For this dataset, all independent variables are continuous (canopy cover, tree density, and housing density). The dependent variable is the presence or absence of a particular species of lizard. I chose to use logistic regression because (1) I would like an interpretable model. I want to understand which factors have an impact on lizard presence, (2) I'd like to be able to produce probabilities (odds ratios) and an ROC curve, so I can understand how various thresholds affect the true and false positive rates, and (3) the independent variables have a linear relationship with the log odds of the outcome. Overall, my goal is to understand how various environmental factors affect lizard occurrence. I don't feel a random forest would provide me with that information in an interpretable format. Model 2: For this model, I have four categorical variables (sky cover, year, observer, and season). The dependent variable is the same as the first model: lizard presence or absence, except I am not interested in predicting lizard absence or presence. The purpose of this model is to determine what factors affect detection. For example, does a sunny sky affect the probability a lizard is detected? As with the first model, I'd like this model to be easily interpretable, which is why I chose logistic regression for this as well. However, I've read that random forest may be more suitable for categorical data. Still, I only want to determine which factors affect detection, and I think logistic regression is better suited for that. Are either of these explanations ill-informed? Would random forest or another type of model be better?
