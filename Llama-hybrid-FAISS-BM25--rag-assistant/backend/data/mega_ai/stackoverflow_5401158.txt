Calculating the Median with Mysql

I'm having trouble with calculating the median of a list of values, not the average. I found this article Simple way to calculate median with MySQL It has a reference to the following query which I don't understand properly. SELECT x.val from data x, data y GROUP BY x.val HAVING SUM(SIGN(1-SIGN(y.val-x.val))) = (COUNT(*)+1)/2 If I have a time column and I want to calculate the median value, what do the x and y columns refer to?
