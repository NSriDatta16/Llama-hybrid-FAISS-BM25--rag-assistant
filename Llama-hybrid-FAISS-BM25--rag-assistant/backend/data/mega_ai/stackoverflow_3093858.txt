What are the disadvantages/problems of including scripts in the body of page rather than in the head element?

There's already an entry posted regarding the pros/cons of putting javascript inside the element vs. right before the close body tag ( ). However I've seen sometimes developers put JavaScript code in arbitrary locations in an HTML page. It seems to be mainly due to laziness. What are the disadvantages of embedding JavaScript code in arbitrary locations of a page? There are a number of obvious disadvantages such as no caching, less reuse, etc. What other disadvantages can you think of in this regards? Thanks in asdvance.
