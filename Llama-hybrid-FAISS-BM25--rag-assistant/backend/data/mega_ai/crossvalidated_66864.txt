Averaging precision and recall when using cross validation

I have performed classification using multiple classifiers for a 2-classes labelled data, and I used 5-fold cross validation. For each fold I calculated tp, tn, fp, and fn. Then I calculated the accuracy, precision, recall and F-score for each test. My question is, when I want to average the results, I took the average of accuracies, but can I average precision, recall and the F-score as well? Or would this be mathematically wrong? P.S. The datasets used in each fold are well balanced in terms of the number of instances per class. Thanks.
