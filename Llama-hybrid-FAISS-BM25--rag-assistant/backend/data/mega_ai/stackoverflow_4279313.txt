yes, formally an rvalue conversion of indeterminate value is UB (except for unsigned char , originally i wrote "and variants" but as i recall the formal caters to 1's complement signed char where possibly minus 0 could be used as trap value) i'm too lazy to do the standard paragraph lookup for you, and also to lazy to care about downvotes for that however, in practice only a problem on (1) archaic architectures, and perhaps (2) 64-bit systems. EDIT : oops, i now seem to recall a blog posting and associated Defect Report about formal UB for accessing indeterminate char. so perhaps i'll have to actually check the standard, + search DRs. argh, it will have to be later then, now coffee! EDIT2 : Johannes Schaub was kind enough to provide this link to SO question where that UB for accessing char was discussed. So, that's where I remembered it from! Thanks, Johannes. cheers & hth.,
