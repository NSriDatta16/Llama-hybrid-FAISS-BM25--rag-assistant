The prototype property of function objects is automatically created, is simply an empty object with the {DontEnum} and {DontDelete} property attributes, you can see how function objects are created in the specification: 13.2 Creating Function Objects Pay attention to the steps 9, 10 and 11: 9) Create a new object as would be constructed by the expression new Object() . 10) Set the constructor property of Result(9) to F. This property is given attributes { DontEnum } . 11) Set the prototype property of F to Result(9). This property is given attributes as specified in 15.3.5.2 . You can see that this is true by: function f(){ //... } f.hasOwnProperty('prototype'); // true, property exist on f f.propertyIsEnumerable('prototype'); // false, because the { DontEnum } attribute delete f.prototype; // false, because the { DontDelete } attribute
