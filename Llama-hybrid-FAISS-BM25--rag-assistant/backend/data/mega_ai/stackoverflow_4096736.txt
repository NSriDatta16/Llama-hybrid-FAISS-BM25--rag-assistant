You could try: window.location.href = window.location.protocol + "//" + window.location.host + window.location.pathname + window.location.search This will input the same URL minus the hash/fragment. I'm assuming CRM 5 still uses a fragment which would prevent the page from refreshing if you just did a window.location.href = window.location.href. Caveats: If there is dirty data on the form, you're going to get a dirty data warning.
