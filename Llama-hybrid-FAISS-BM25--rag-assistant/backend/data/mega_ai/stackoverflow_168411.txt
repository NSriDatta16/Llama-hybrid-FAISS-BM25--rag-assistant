No, but I'm an organization of 1 - the last time I worked in a large organization, we were not required, but encouraged to. If I were in an enviroment with other people, I would probably lock my workstation now when I left it. While certainly people with physical access can add hardware keyloggers, locking it does add an additional level of security. Depending on the type of organization you are, I think the risks are more from internal organizational snooping than over-the-wire attacks.
