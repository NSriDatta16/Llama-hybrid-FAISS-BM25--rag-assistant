You need to read about the triplet loss function. The triplet loss function gets result embeddings from a network, that processes three images by a network (two similar and one non-similar) for one step: After that the loss is computed as: $$Loss = \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \big[ \Vert f_i^a - f_i^p \Vert_2^2 - \Vert f_i^a - f_i^n \Vert_2^2 + \alpha \big]_+$$ For more details read the paper from the triplet loss authors. Also, this may help PSNR , but this is not deep learning.
