You need to be able to evaluate the target density pointwise to run MH. Suppose you want to obtain samples $x^{(s)} \sim \pi(x)$ and propose from a local random walk $q(x) = \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma)$. Then in order to accept/reject a step $x \to x^\star$ in a Metropolis-Hastings manner you need to evaluate: $$1 \wedge \frac{\pi(x^\star)}{\pi(x)}$$ up to a multiplicative constant (since that'd be present in both the numerator and denumerator and thus drop out). If you cannot evaluate $\pi(x)$ you cannot apply many MCMC methods. There are ways to do away with this requirement, but they carry no statistical guarantees and are rather advanced.
