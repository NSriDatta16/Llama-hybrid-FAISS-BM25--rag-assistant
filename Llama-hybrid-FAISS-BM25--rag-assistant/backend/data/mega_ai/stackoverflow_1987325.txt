reorganizing a series of 19 bytes into every single combination of any length

There are these 19 bytes (I am looking for combinations not the number of combinations) 17 00 00 00 A4 EA DB 13 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 A3 D3 02 CC I need any possible unique combination which matches these "rules": at least 4 bytes long the order of the bytes can't change(so 17 A3 D3 02 CC is ok but A3 D3 02 CC 17 isn't, because in the original string 17 was at the being but A3 D3 02 CC was at the end) Let me try giving you examples of possible combinations: 17 00 00 00 A4 EA DB 13 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 A3 D3 02 17 00 00 00 A4 EA DB 13 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 A3 D3 17 00 00 00 A4 EA DB 13 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 A3 all the way to 17 00 00 00 17 A3 D3 02 CC 17 00 A3 D3 02 CC 00 A3 D3 02 CC 17 A4 02 CC See the bytes stay in the same order for example the first byte 17 can only in the first byte's place I don't want combination like A4 17 02 CC Because now 17 has changed order compared to A4
