Do you really want to implement and carefully test separate readers for each of the 14 different PixelFormats? I know that so far you've only encountered 2 of them, but I guarantee there are video cards out there with almost all of the other 12. As one easy example, set your monitor to 256 colors... You say that you want to maximize performance, but writing the bitmap to a file on disk, even with memory mapping, is going to take more time on average than the time it'd take to just convert it to a device-independent bitmap in memory. Plus if you convert the 64-bit bitmap to a 32-bit bitmap, the resulting file will take half as long to write, so it could actually be faster.
