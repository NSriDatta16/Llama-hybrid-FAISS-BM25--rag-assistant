PHP link to template page with database content

I am setting up a webpage for a student organization with bios for the officers along with pictures and whatnot. the first page simply is html and css. it has a picture, name under it and a link to the full bio where it links to "bio.php?id=" and then the id in my SQL database for that person. now i am trying to make the php page to allow a simple template php page using the user's id. unfortunately when i do everything that I think is right, I get an odd error. here is my code " . $sql . " " . mysql_error()); WHILE($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { $name = $row['Name']; $position = $row['Position']; $major = $row['Major']; $hometown = $row['Hometown']; $awards = $row['Awards']; $bio = $row['Description']; $act = $row['Activities']; $pic = $row['Picture']; $misc = $row['other']; ?> This is what i see on my webpage: " . $sql . " " . mysql_error()); WHILE($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { $name = $row['Name']; $page_id= $id; $position = $row['Position']; $major = $row['Major']; $hometown = $row['Hometown']; $awards = $row['Awards']; $bio = $row['Description']; $act = $row['Activities']; $pic = $row['Picture']; $misc = $row['other']; ?> and thats all. any ideas what i am doing wrong?
