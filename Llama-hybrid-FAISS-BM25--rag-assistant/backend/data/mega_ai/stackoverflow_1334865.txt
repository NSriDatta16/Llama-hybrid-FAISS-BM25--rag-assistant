How does one avoid a large number (between 20 and 30) of embedded "if" statements in Ruby?

I've got a massive script with about 20 embedded if statements (Yay!) that is used to parse through a data file. And in a sense, that's correct because the script should not continue operating if any of those evaluations fail. But my gut says there's a more elegant way to accomplish the same thing. I'm familiar with the statemachine plugin for rails, but that seems to be overkill (it seems to be overkill). Any chance there's a slightly more elegant way to reduce the number of embedded 'ifs' either through a workflow, or some other way?
