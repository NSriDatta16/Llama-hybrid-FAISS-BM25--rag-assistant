SPSS Statistics indeed does not provide pooled results for linear regression summary statistics such as the Model F test or the R 2 in current versions. For a pooled R 2 you could just average the R 2 values for the individual imputation results. The IBM SPSS Statistical Algorithms manual chapter on Multiple Imputation: Pooling Algorthms gives formulas for combining quantities from imputed analyses to form F tests for linear combinations of parameter estimates.
