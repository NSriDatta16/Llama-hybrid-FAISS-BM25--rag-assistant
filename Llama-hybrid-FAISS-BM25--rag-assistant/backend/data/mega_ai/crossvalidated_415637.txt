Yes, it makes sense. Classical PCA is highly sensitive to outliers. By using robust PCA, you can identify these outliers and get rid of them. About Classical PCA: PCA is sensitive to outliers PCA does not require distributional assumptions PCA only considers orthogonal transformations (rotations) of the original variables) Dimension reduction can only be achieved if the original variables were correlated. Otherwise, PCA is only re-ordering them according to their variance!!! PCA is not scale invariant. Often (but not always) scaling is preferred.
