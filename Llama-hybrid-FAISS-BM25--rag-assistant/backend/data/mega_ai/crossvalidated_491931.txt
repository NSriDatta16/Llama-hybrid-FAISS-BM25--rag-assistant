How to deal with different proportions of positive samples in train vs. test data for logistic regression?

I want to train a logistic regression model with random effects. In training data there is only 0.5% of positive individuals, whereas in test set there is around 5% of positives. I want to train a random effect model, so I can not just drop some observations because this is a longitudinal study. Is there any possibility to adjust fitted model or so, such that it would be independent of proportions of positives and negatives in training set?
