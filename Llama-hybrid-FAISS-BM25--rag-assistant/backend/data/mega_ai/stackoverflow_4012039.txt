so here's the thing, using generators will just about create a link for "everything" in your site. So if you have, let's say a card site, and you have like a hundred thousand card items, each with it's own link and all, you'll likely see the same amount of links. If you want that, then xml sitemap generators are the way to go. But if you want it a little bit personalized, you can do these: List all major sections of your sites. This is easy to do considering that most MVCs are using the "clean URLs" sort of thing. kinda like "site.com/items/phones" Create an XML document, depending on the language you're using. At the minimum, you should have a document like this: http://dragonflysco.com/catalog/finishings/19 For more advanced structure, check this: http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=183668
