So, I'm a complete novice at database development, but you could do something like this: Create a 'Before' insert trigger on your document_index_table. The trigger does something like this: declare numRows integer; select count(*) from user_control_db.usr_information where usr_id = NEW.usr_id into num_rows; if (numRows > 0) then call NonExistentProc(); end if; I believe that this would accomplish what you wanted. It'll produce an error like "PROCEDURE documentdb.NonExistenProc does not exist" and skip the insert if there isn't at least one row that has the matching usr id in the user control db. Again, I'm a novice at this DB stuff so there might be a more elegant way, but this worked for my single test case. Hope that helps.
