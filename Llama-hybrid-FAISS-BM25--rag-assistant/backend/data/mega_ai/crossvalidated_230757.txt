It really depends on your assumptions about independence. If order doesn't matter, a straight chi-square is appropriate, but if order does matter: If you assume the probability of a category depends only on a fixed number of previous values, you'd be looking at a Markov chain. i.e., that there is an underlying transition matrix with a [(number of categories)^(number of previous values it depends on) by (number of categories, the result) ] matrix. https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/86340/how-can-i-compare-two-markov-processes If you assume the probability of a category depends on ALL previous values, you would be looking at a categorical time series. I would look at https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/848/time-series-similarity-measures That said, what I described is most useful if you want to understand the model (the generative approach, Generative vs. discriminative ). But from what I'm hearing, you might want the discriminative approach: to compare the error rate of your model with a benchmark. You would be aiming to say "On this dataset, my model does better than this benchmark/state-of-the-art model. It's a good model. Use it." You can use simple error rate, or cross validation, or a number of more sophisticated methods. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_diagnostic
