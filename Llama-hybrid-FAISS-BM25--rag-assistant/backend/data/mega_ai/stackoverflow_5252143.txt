To tidy up data table one can just use: ALTER TABLE table_name_here ORDER BY primary_key_here; which could run faster than OPTIMIZE TABLE . This will de-fragment the data file. After extensive changes to a table, this may also improve performance of statements that use the table, sometimes significantly. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/optimize-table.html
