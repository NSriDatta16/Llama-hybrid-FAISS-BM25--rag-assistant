improve performance in ajax request

i´m doing an ajax request using jQuery and asp.net on this way: $.ajaxSetup({ type: "POST", contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", dataType: "json" }); $.ajax({ url: "/WebServices/CompareDates", data: "{allClients: '" + allClients + "'}", success: function(msg) { SuccessCompareDate(msg.d); } }); This ajax request is do each 1 second, using javascript setInterval. I´m getting the response on average 700ms. But, i need this response in maximum 150ms. I already use WebMethod instead of webservice but don´t works well too. In the server is everything ok. In the c# webservice too and it just returns a boolean value. I need performance. Someone can help me? Thanks..
