Neural network to output non-binary values?

I've been looking at face detection lately, and a lot of the literature states their outputs have a range. How is this possible? I've created my own network and it only seems to be outputting either -1 or 1. Is this because I'm using the Tanh activation function? I want the values to output from, say, 0 to 1 in a range, rather than a binary output, so I can see how "strong" it thinks the output is actually a face. Thanks.
