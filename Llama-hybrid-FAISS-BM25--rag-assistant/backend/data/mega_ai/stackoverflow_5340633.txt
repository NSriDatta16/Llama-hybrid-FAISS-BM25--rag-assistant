Htaccess redirect depending on the value of variable

I have some difficulties with such an easy problem. On our site we've got a paginator, wich works with GET-variable "p" (p=1 - is the first page, p=2 - second and so on). I do not want the script to consider the value 1 of this variable (p=1). So I've got the query string like: http://www.mysite.ru/mypage/some_page2?p=1 and want to redirect user via htaccess to page: http://www.mysite.ru/mypage/some_page2 It would be nice, if htaccess rule handle not only value "1", but also "","bla-bla-bla" like http://www.mysite.ru/mypage/some_page2?p=$#^&*_not_right_value http://www.mysite.ru/mypage/some_page2?p= Thank you for your attention. UPD: The working solution for my case: RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^p=1$ RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /$1? [R,L]
