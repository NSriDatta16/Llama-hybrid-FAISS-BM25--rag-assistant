Have you looked into setting an onresize event handler that will adjust your mask dimensions when the window is resized? If you are using Prototype, you can set up such a handler unobtrusively like this: Event.observe(document.onresize ? document : window, "resize", function() {//dostuff}); courtesy of the Roberto Cosenza blog
