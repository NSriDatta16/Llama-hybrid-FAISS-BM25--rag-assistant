You could enter each variable name in the EXCLUDE_SYMBOL option. How many different variable names are there? Unless you created a similar pattern in each variable name ie. Vehicle varCar, varScooter; and then EXCLUDE_SYMBOL = var* within your config file. Just ensure no method or class name will match your pattern. I haven't come across an elegant solution for this problem though.
