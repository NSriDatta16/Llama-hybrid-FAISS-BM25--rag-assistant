Creating a time series with jfreechart

Right now I want to create a time series graph in jfreechart. However the examples online only have charts using classes like "Day", "Month", and so on. So I want to essentially create a XY line chart. However the problem I'm having is that Jfreechart doesn't connect the data points in the order in which they were added. Also it doesn't connect the points in the order of the "X Values". So basically I get a "Z" in my jfreechart. So my question is, is there a way to change the setting for the jfreechart so that it connects the data points based on the "X values"?
