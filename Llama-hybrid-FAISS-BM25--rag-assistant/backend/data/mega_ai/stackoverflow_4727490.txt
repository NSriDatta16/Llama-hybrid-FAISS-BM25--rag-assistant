Note: The actions below require administrative privileges. For steps utilizing the command prompt it must be launched via "Run as administrator" on Windows Vista / Windows 7. Associate *.pl files with perl Run the following commands at a shell prompt: assoc .pl=PerlScript ftype PerlScript=C:\bin\perl.exe "%1" %* Replace C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe with the path to your Perl installation. This enables you to run myscript.pl instead of perl myscript.pl . Default install locations are: ActivePerl: C:\Perl Strawberry Perl: C:\Strawberry Add .PL to your PATHEXT environment variable. This makes Windows consider *.pl files to be executable when searching your PATH. It enables you to run myscript instead of myscript.pl . You can set it for the current cmd session set PATHEXT=%PATHEXT%;.PL To set it permanently (under Windows Vista or Windows 7) setx PATHEXT %PATHEXT%;.PL Under Windows XP you have to use the GUI: Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties. Click the Advanced tab. Click Environment variables. Select PATHEXT, then click Edit. Append ;.PL to the current value. Make I/O redirection work I/O redirection (e.g. program | myscript ) doesn't work for programs started via a file association. There is a registry patch to correct the problem. Start Registry Editor. Locate and then click the following key in the registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value: Value name: InheritConsoleHandles Data type: REG_DWORD Radix: Decimal Value data: 1 Quit Registry Editor. Warning: In principle, this should only be necessary on Windows XP. In my experience it's also necessary in Windows 7. In Windows 10 this is actively harmfulâ€”programs execute but produce nothing on stdout/stderr. The registry key needs to be set to 0 instead of 1. See also: STDIN/STDOUT Redirection May Not Work If Started from a File Association Perl Scripts on Windows 10 run from Explorer but not Command Prompt If patching the registry isn't an option running program | perl -S myscript.pl is a less annoying work-around for scripts in your PATH. Add a drop handler Adding a drop handler for Perl allows you to run a Perl script via drag & drop; e.g. dragging a file over the file icon in Windows Explorer and dropping it there. Run the following script to add the necessary entries to the registry: use Win32::TieRegistry; $Registry->Delimiter("/"); $perlKey = $Registry-> {"HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/Perl/"}; $perlKey-> {"shellex/"} = { "DropHandler/" => { "/" => "{86C86720-42A0-1069-A2E8-08002B30309D}" }};
