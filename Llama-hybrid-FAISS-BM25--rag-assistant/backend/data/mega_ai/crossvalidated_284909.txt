What model is appropriate for predicting time series trends?

I have a tme series that when particularly anomalies the overall trend will be either higher or lower than before it started picking up these anomalies. I don't need to predict exactly what value it will have, just the trend. What model is appropriate for this kind of situation? I have never run across this before. EDIT: Additional Info Of What I am looking for Let's call the variable I am interested in is $f$, which at some time $t$, takes on the value $f_t$. I want to know if $f_{t+\delta t}$ is higher or lower than $f_t$ based on anomalies/outliers I pick up from another variable, called $x$. So I supposed the model looks something like $f_{t+\delta t}(x_t)=x_t+x_{t-1}+..$ But this feels awkward to me, what kind of model(s) should I consider?
