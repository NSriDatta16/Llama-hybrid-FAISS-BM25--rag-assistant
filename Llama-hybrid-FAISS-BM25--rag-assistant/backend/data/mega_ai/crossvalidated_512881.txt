I believe this is a very philosophical question and I doubt Bayesian theory is applicable to it. What do we mean by a "probability" of a dragon in the garage, a teapot between Earth and Mars, or extraterrestrial life? They either exist or not, and it is not a realisation of a random variable. To drive the idea to the extreme, let's take an example from mathematics. Let's define: \begin{align} F &\equiv \text{"Goldbach's conjecture is false", and} \\ n &\equiv \text{"an even number that cannot be partitioned as two primes"} \end{align} As soon as we find a single $n$ satisfying the above definition, Goldbach falls. End of discussion. Or, in "probability" terms: $$ P(F | n) = 1 $$ It is straightforward to show that the above implies: \begin{align} P(F) &= P(n) + P(F|\bar n) P(\bar n), ~ ~ \text{or} \\ P(F|\bar n) &= \frac {P(F) - P(n)} {1 - P(n)} \end{align} Now, if the evidence is hard to find, the conditional and unconditional "probability" of Goldbach being wrong become identical: $$ P(n) \rightarrow 0 \Leftrightarrow P(F|\bar n) \rightarrow P(F) $$ or, in other words, the absence of evidence doesn't affect the probability of whatever we try to prove. This is, however, conditioned on the rarity of evidence. Since we have examined the numbers up to $10^{18}$ and haven't found an $n$ to disprove Goldbach, such numbers, if exist, are likely rare. Therefore, we can keep believing Goldbach. However, as I noted above, Goldbach's conjecture is not a random variable. It is either true or not, so talking probabilities makes no sense here. We can, at best, talk about our subjective belief in its correctness. In general, it is hard to define when the evidence is rare. The only criterion I can imagine is to make honest and serious effort to find it, and fail. E.g. make many precise experiments which still lead to no proof. But, as a counterexample, take the Michelson-Morley experiment : Here, we (actually the physicists) took the absence of evidence as a serious evidence of absence of the aether, eventually leading to special relativity. So, in conclusion, I'm skeptical regarding the practical relevance of your quote. And, btw, according to Quote Investigator , it is much older than Martin Rees.
