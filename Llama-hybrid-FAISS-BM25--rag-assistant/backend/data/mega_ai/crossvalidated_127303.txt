This line of thought needs to take into account that we are not discussing "unconditional" probabilities here (whatever that means: any probability which we assign will be conditional on some assumptions and models, and even if we don't state them, they won't go away). Instead, we are observing a sequence of events conditional on there being someone to observe them , namely us. This is the Anthropic Principle . The problem with, e.g., Bayesian approaches to this is that we have little to no idea about the "unconditional" (in this context; see above) probabilities involved: even if P("the universe offers conditions that support life"|"life develops") = 1 (this is a tautology), we still have no idea about P("the universe offers conditions that support life") or P("life develops"), since this universe is all we have to work with. (Your friendly neighborhood physicist may have a different take on my last sentence.)
