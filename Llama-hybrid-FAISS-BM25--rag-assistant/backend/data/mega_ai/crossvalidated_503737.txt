I would have to hear more about the specific features you are using to say for sure. Sounds like you could do this, but you want to be careful, because the errors/uncertainty will likely compound the further you try to forecast into the future. In general, the act of using forecasted values in your training data is called semi-supervised learning , so that's something to look into. But I think for your problem you may be better off looking into models specifically designed for time series forecasting, like RNNs and LSTMs . Hope that helps some!
