How to convert a time series data which can be fed to a Machine Leanring model for unsupervised learning?

I am very new to time series data. I am working with server data and want to classify if the bunch of server times are healthy or not. My data looks like this in pandas +-------+-----------+------------+----------------+-------+ | ID | timestamp | IP_address | event_type | usage | +-------+-----------+------------+----------------+-------+ | 12xcv | 456 | 123573 | server_load | 56.0 | | 12xcv | 457 | 123573 | server_process | 59.0 | | 12xcv | 459 | 123573 | unload | 43.0 | | 23vbz | 461 | 123573 | server_load | 78.0 | | 23vbz | 461 | 123573 | unload | 78.0 | +-------+-----------+------------+----------------+-------+ My questions are: I want to use unsupervised clustering algorithm. How do I convert this data so that I can use something like k-means with two clusters such that one cluster denotes healthy and other denotes unhealthy. What other unsupervised methods exists for classification in time series data?
