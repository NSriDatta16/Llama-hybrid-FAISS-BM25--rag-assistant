The video is talking about deterministic vs. stochastic trends , not models . The highlight is very important. Both your models are stochastic, however, in the model 1 the trend is deterministic. The model 2 doesn't have a trend. Your question text is incorrect. The model 2 in your question is AR(1) without a constant, while in the video the model is a random walk (Brownian motion): $$x_t=\alpha+x_{t-1}+e_t$$ This model indeed has a stochastic trend. It's stochastic because it's $\alpha t$ only in average. Each realization of a Brownian motion will deviate from $\alpha t$ because of the random term $e_t$, which is easy to see by differencing: $$\Delta x_t=x_t-x_{t-1}=\alpha+e_t$$ $$x_t=x_0+\sum_{t=1}^t\Delta x_t=x_0+\alpha t +\sum_{t=1}^t e_t$$
