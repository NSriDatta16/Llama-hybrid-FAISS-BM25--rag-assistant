In my opinion best practice would dictate the following: Use an ORM for your data access layer. This should ideally be in a a separate project so it can be changed if need be. Should use MVC. If you use WebForms then you will surely find that your business logic and the display logic gets mixed together. Learn database design separate and apart from learning to write code. Keep reviewing object oriented design fundamentals. Take time to learn design patterns. Not to become a slave to "The Gang of Four" but so that you can take advantage of proven patterns to solve common problems.
