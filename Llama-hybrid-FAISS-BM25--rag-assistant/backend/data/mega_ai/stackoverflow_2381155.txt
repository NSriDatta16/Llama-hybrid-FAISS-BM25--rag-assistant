I believe you are calling the SaveLayout() from the wrong place. Layout should only be saved when changes are made to the DXGrid itself and has nothing to do with the panel. You can achive that by handling the GridView_ShowCustomizationForm Sample code Private Sub GridView_ShowCustomizationForm(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles GridView.ShowCustomizationForm Dim gView As DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridView = CType(sender, DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridView) AddHandler gView.CustomizationForm.FormClosing, AddressOf SaveGridSettings End Sub Private Sub SaveGridSettings() Grid.MainView.SaveLayoutToXml("c:\Settings.xml") End Sub
