I would try making your network inputs scale invariant. In other words preprocessing the objects you find in the test image to segment out individual candidate letter objects and resize them to be the same size as your training set. From your description your not doing this. I'm not familiar with AForge so maybe this is implied in your question. My experience with neural networks was that preprocessing the input data usually leads to much better results if there's a known good way to do this. Here it would seem that there is.
