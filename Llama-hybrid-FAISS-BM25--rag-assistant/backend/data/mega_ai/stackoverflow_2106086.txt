Well I am a CS Grad and currently using Microsoft Technologies and I completely agree with @GreenMatt, it is not good to go for a course centred around particular Platform / tools but not the core concepts Any way if this is your choice have a look at Sheffield Hallam University, being parter organisation and training centre for Microsoft, it also offers some degree courses based arround Microsoft such as the following Microsoft Dynamics Programmes(MBA) Dynamics Programme as a whole One more thing, these tools and technologies are evolving so quickly and more and more are coming in every other day, Consider this.. 6 months ago I was using "Hard coded queries to get data from DB" about 3 months ago I started using Designer generated Data Sets and Table Adapters Now the new project has been approved with use of "LINQ to SQL" for Data Acess Layer. All 3 are from Microsoft, along with 2 dozen other technologies Honestly, by the time you will be out of schools, for professionals you will sound like talking about history of programming !!!! You will learn twice as more tools each month than you will learn at school per semester, but won't be able to develop that very "skills set" and "art for programming", if you miss / avoid "data structures", "Algorithms", "Discrete Mathematics" and "Object oriented Programming Concepts" or similar Subjects. So moral of the story Strong concepts and skills / approach towards problem solving will help you always, never the tools. Hope it helps
