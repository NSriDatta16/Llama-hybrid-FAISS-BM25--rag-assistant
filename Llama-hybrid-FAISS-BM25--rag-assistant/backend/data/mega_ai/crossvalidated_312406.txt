One possibility would be to forecast each video's views using exponential smoothing. Potentially include seasonality if there is evidence of intra-weekly seasonality. Also include a trend. Consider modeling and forecasting cumulative views. This will probably increase very quickly at the beginning, and then the increase will taper off. So it would make sense to include a dampened trend. Alternatively, you could look at regression with ARIMA errors, where you could include "bump functions" to model a video's "lifecycle". Or Bass diffusion models , which explicitly model market growth and saturation. In addition, you can probably improve your forecasts by leveraging the hierarchical structure. Forecast each video separately, as above. Also forecast the entire channel's views. Then combine the forecasts using the optimal combination approach ( see here ). This even allows you to use different forecasting methods for the different videos. I have repeatedly found that this approach improves forecasts on all levels of a hierarchy.
