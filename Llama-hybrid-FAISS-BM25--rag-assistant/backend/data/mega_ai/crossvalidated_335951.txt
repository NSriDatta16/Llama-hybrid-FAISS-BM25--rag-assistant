Recall (population) variance is a measure of variability around a (population) mean. Your dataset contains several sets of two samples from each RV, for which you know the variances are equal. We first must estimate the sample mean, and then use that mean to estimate the sample variance. The problem is, we have to 'spend' some observations to estimate the mean and then 'spend' further observations to estimate the sample variance. At minimum, you'd need two points to calculate an average, and at least one more point to estimate the squared deviation of each point from the sample average.
