Zend Framework: Re-use WHERE clause returned from Zend_Db_Select::getPart()

I have a SELECT object which contains a WHERE. I can return the WHERE using getPart(Zend_Db_Select::WHERE) , this returns something like this: array 0 => string "(clienttype = 'agent')" 1 => string "AND (nextpayment This array seems pretty useless as I cannot do this with it $client->update(array("paymentstatus" => "lapsed"), $where); Or even put it into another SELECT object. Is there a way of getting a more useful representation of the WHERE statement from the SELECT object? Thanks EDIT The best I have come up with so far is $where = new Zend_Db_Expr(implode(" ", $select->getPart(Zend_Db_Select::WHERE)));
