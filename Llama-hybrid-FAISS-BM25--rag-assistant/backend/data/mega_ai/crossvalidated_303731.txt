IIRC, parcelling is a pragmatic approach to latent variable analysis wherein the construct of a factor score is done by simply taking a sum score. If that's what you understand parcelling to be, it is fully possible to create such a sum score from a matrix of means and covariances. You simply sum the means and multiply by the number of factors to obtain the sum score. It's variance, consequently, is calculated by using the law of total variance (minding the multiplicative constant of $p$ where necessary). $$\text{var} \left(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^n \text{var} (X_i) +\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \text{cov} (X_i, X_j)$$ The covariance between the sum score and an indicator can be derived similarly, $$\text{cov} \left(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i, X_j \right) = \text{var}(X_j) + \text{cov}_{i \ne j}(X_i, X_j)$$ This is a pragmatic and easy way to create the variable you are after under the constraints you mention. It is not really appropriate to use an approach which you believe to be subpar because the software cannot support what you are trying to do (such as using raw data as input to path modeling). You should drop AMOS in favor of M-plus or lavaan which can do this path modeling with raw data input files.
