There are several problems with this code. First, you have a buffer overflow, because char *p = new char[1] allocates only one character for storage. This is exceeded when i > 0 . Next, your first loop will keep going until it reaches a point in unallocated memory (undefined behavior) that has a value of zero. This just happens to be after the third value in your case. You probably wanted something more like *(p+i-1) == 0 to give "the last character read meets some condition." Finally, you're allocating memory with new[] and not properly deallocating it with a matching delete[] . Consider using std::cin and std::string for much safer and correct code: #include #include int main(int, char**) { std::string s; std::cout > s; std::cout
