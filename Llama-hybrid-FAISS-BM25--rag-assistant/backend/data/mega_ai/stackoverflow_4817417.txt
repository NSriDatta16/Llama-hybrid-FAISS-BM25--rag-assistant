Yes they do, because List can has the properties and method to fulfill all those interfaces. You don't know what interface someone is going to have declared as a parameter or return value, so the more interfaces list implements, the more versatile it can be. Your code will compile because upcasting ( var a1 = (I1)a; ) fails at runtime not compile time. I can do var a1 = (int)a and have it compile.
