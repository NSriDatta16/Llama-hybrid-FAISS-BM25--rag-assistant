gy and Internet Brands tried to combine their products but failed to do so, and after a December 1999 lawsuit they made a settlement agreement in May 2001. In 2008, Versata sued Internet Brands claiming they had violated the settlement agreement by making presentations to potential clients stating they had a license from Versata to use and sell Versata technical solutions; and doing so had cost Versata business with Chrysler. Internet Brands' countersuit argued that Versata had misappropriated trade secrets and asked the jury to use Versata’s business relationship with Toyota—including revenue from Toyota contracts—as a benchmark to calculate damages. The jury agreed and used that data to determine a $2 million damages award in favor of Internet Brands’ subsidiary, AutoData Solutions. Versata appealed the decision, and in January 2014 the court upheld the $2 million award to Internet Brands. Patent challenges and litigation following the AIA in 2012–2013 In 2012 and 2013, Versata filed at least seven patent infringement lawsuits against companies over patents originating from Trilogy's Selling Chain software suite. While these lawsuits were ongoing, three major legal developments influenced their outcomes: September 2012: Provisions of the America Invents Act (AIA) went into effect, including the introduction of post-grant review (PGR) and covered business method (CBM) review. These procedures allowed defendants to challenge patents at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) before trial, making it easier to invalidate certain types of patents, particularly in the software and business method domains. September 2012–June 2013: The PTAB conducted a CBM review of Versata’s U.S. Patent No. 6,553,350 ('350), which was at issue in its earlier lawsuit against SAP. The PTAB ruled that the patent was unpatentable as an abstract idea. March–June 2014: The United States Supreme Court decided Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, establishing a two-step test for determining whether a patent claim is directed to patent-eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101. In the Callidus case, Versata sued Callidus and Callidus countersued asserting their own patents against Versata. The countersuit initiated a CBM review at the PTAB for the Versata patents. Ultimately the dispute was settled with both parties signing a Reseller Agreement. The Volusion and Planisware cases were dismissed following the PTAB’s 2013 invalidation of the ’350 patent. No public settlements or judgments were reported. In the NetBrain Technologies and Infoblox cases, the court adopted a magistrate judge's recommendation to dismiss the claims with prejudice. The judge concluded that the patents asserted were directed to abstract ideas and thus unpatentable under the framework later formalized in Alice. In Zoho, the defendant first argued that the asserted patent ('740) was an abstract idea under the Alice framework. The court disagreed, allowing the case to proceed. Zoho then filed a separate motion claiming the patent was invalid due to indefiniteness under 35 U.S.C. § 112, arguing that the term “space-constrained display” lacked clear meaning. The court granted this motion and ruled the patent invalid. The case was dismissed, and Versata was ordered to pay Zoho’s costs. The Dorado Software case was stayed while the Supreme Court considered Alice. After the ruling, the parties stipulated to dismiss the claims without prejudice, meaning Versata could potentially refile the case. International insolvency and IP rights with Think3 In September 2010, ESW Capital acquired Think3, an American company with subsidiaries in other countries: an Italian location mostly to negotiate with creditors and collect local revenue; a Japanese location that was considered an asset in the acquisition; an Indian location with software developers who reported they held some IP rights shared with the company. The company had $23 million in debt, about 70% of which was an Italian tax liability
