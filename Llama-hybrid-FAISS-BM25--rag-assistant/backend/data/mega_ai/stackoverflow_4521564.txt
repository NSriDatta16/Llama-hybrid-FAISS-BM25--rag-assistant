Hudson and Maven tests run twice

Parsing POMs Discovered a new module be.howest:someproject someproject It seems to find a new module on the first time I make a hudson job. Well, nothing really to worry, but it seems to execute everything twice, and I don't really know why. Another thing is: it gives this odd error (at least to me): [WARNING] Removing: cobertura from forked lifecycle, to prevent recursive invocation. [WARNING] Removing: findbugs from forked lifecycle, to prevent recursive invocation. To me this looks like it tried to execute twice, but why is escaping me. Also, it has a module under the build, which is something i'm not very familiar with, but I wouldn't bother too much (and consider it normal) if it didn't do my tests twice. right now it is running two phases: clean and test . I changed it to clean package , because I included javadoc in the package lifecycle, but nothing has changed. Hudson console log : http://pastebin.com/2GRmc2yP Pom.xml : http://pastebin.com/HL9Qd821
