I'm guessing what you posted is not the whole page, so I'm just wondering if you are aware of the fact that your javascript stuff, as well as css and other includes should go into the element. // JS code Also, whenever there's something wrong with your page, try making it a habit to always check the validity of your markup at the W3C validator site: http://validator.w3.org/ . If the markup is valid, your problem likely lies in javascript code. UPDATE: After some thought, one thing comes to mind. XHTML is case sensitive! Which means that all your jQuery selectors need to match the casing on your ID's and class names. HTML (without the x) is NOT case sensitive so $("#Test") and $("#test") are the same, but in XHTML they are completely different. What was likely happening is that without specifying the doctype, browser was falling back to HTML, so you didn't have to pay attention to casing.
