You could fit a model, a long AR for instance, which can be seen as a filter which "whitens" the data: the residuals would be close to the innovations. Since you mention PCA you might want to notice also that spectral analysis does something similar. It decomposes a time series in harmonic components mutually uncorrelated; but this is a different thing than what I think you are after.
