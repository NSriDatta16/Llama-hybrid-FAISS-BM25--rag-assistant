Yes, I've coded some path hooks (for one of the obvious purposes: access modules living in other forms of storage besides the filesystem and zipfiles), but never on an open-source project (and actually never needed to support modulefinder in them). What difficulties are you encountering? While I can't share my original code I think I can share the know-how developed with it (though offhand I can't recall any special difficulties -- it has been a while). As for "popular", I guess they will be in direct proportion to the need to site modules "elsewhere" (e.g. in some form of DB), though of course general "usermode file systems" built e.g. using fuse , macfuse and dokan may also allow this (and offer other advantages in terms of generality -- not sure how performance compares).
