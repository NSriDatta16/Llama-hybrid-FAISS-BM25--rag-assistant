open source faceted search / guided navigation for ecommerce sites with .net apis

i am looking for open source libraries which provide high performance faceted search / guided navigation for ecommerce sites our ecommerce platform is entirely built on .net and so i would prefer libraries which do provide .net apis performance is of utmost importance here... i checked out sphinx as well as solr but looking for better options as far as performance goes as per blogs sphinx takes an average of 5 - 6 seconds to perform the first level of faceted search which is unacceptable in a real ecommerce environment
