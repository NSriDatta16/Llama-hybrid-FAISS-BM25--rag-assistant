PCA. Maximisation of explained variance for plane.

I understand the PCA method in a following way: 0) I have a cloud of dots in ND space 1) I should find a vector which gives me a maximal variance when dots are projected on this vector. 2) I should find the second vector orthogonal to the first, which will explain the maximal possible variance. And so on.. My question is - if I would use the plane, defined by first and second principal components, will it be the plane, which explains the maximum possible variance?
