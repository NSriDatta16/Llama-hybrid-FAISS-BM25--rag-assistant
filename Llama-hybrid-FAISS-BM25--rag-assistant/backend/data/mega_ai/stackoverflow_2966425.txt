The best example you can use is from the Google I/O 2011 Android App. They implement all those design patterns in their app. You can find the code at the following link: http://code.google.com/p/iosched/source/browse/android/res/layout/fragment_dashboard.xml?r=27a82ff10b436da5914a3961df245ff8f66b6252 The 2011 version uses a custom layout called 'DashboardLayout' in a fragment which gets shared in phone and tablet specific layouts. The logic in DashboardLayout is responsible for all the auto layout magic!
