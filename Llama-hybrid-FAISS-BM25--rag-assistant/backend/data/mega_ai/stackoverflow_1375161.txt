Code Coverage in VS2008 on .net runtime callable wrappers

I have a .DLL which contains .NET Runtime callable wrappers for COM/DCOM objects. I have written a testing suite in C# in VS 2008 which calls our server functions which are in the abovementioned .DLL. When code coverage was turned on and testing suite ran, code coverage test results did not yield any statistics and displayed zeroes for both Not Covered and Covered blocks. Does anyone know why that would be the case? Anyone knows how to get code coverage on .dll which are .net callable wrappers?
