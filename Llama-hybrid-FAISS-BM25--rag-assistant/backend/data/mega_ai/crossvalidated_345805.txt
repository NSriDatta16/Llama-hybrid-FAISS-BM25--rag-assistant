Is it valid to average the credible intervals from many simulations to obtain an average credible interval?

I am currently doing a Bayesian analysis where as output, I obtain a a point estimate. Each point estimate has an associated credible interval. Now, I am hoping to do the analysis 1000 times, then average these 1000 results. I understand that it is valid to average over the 1000 point estimates. However, is it valid to average over the cutoff points for my credible interval? For example, assume that $p_1$ is the first point estimate with the credible interval of $\left(L_1,U_1\right)$ Then, we have: $$ p_1,\ldots, p_{1000} $$ as the set of point estimates and $$ \left(L_1, U_1\right), \ldots, \left(L_{1000}, U_{1000}\right) $$ the credible intervals. Is it then fair to take the average over these 1000 intervals as: $$ L^{avg} = \frac{1}{1000}\sum_{i=1}^{1000}L_i $$ and $$ U^{avg} = \frac{1}{1000}\sum_{i=1}^{1000}U_i $$ so as to obtain the new credible interval of $\left(L^{avg}, U^{avg}\right)$ associated with $p^{avg} = \sum_{i=1}^{1000}p_i$?
