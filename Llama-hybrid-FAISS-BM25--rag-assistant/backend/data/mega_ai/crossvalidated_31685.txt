A credible region is just a region where the integral of the posterior density over the region is a specified probability e.g. 0.95. One way to form a Bayesian hypothesis test is to see whether or not the null hypothesized value(s) of the parameter(s) fall in the credible region. In this way we can have a similar 1-1 correspondence between hypothesis tests and credible regions just like the frequentists do with confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. But this is not the only way to do hypothesis testing.
