Wrap at the first whitespace character before the 72nd position, or at the 72nd position if there isn't one. In Eudora when I used to use it, the convention was to leave a space at the end of the line indicating that it was wrapped, so it would signal the receiving client to re-flow the paragraph wherever it needed based on the width of the client's window. I'm not sure that this is the case in current email clients.
