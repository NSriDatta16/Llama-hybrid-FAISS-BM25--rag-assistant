question about MSE mean square error

The following is taken literally from Wikipedia's mean squared error in the mean subheading : "Suppose we have a random sample of size $n$ from a population, $X_1$ , ... , $X_n$ . Suppose the sample units were chosen with replacement. That is, the $n$ units are selected one at a time, and previously selected units are still eligible for selection for all $n$ draws. The usual estimator for the $\mu$ is the sample average $\bar{x}$ = $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i $ which has an expected value equal to the true mean $\mu$ (so it is unbiased) and a mean square error of $MSE (\bar{X}) = E[(\bar{x}-\mu)^2] = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ where $\sigma^2$ is the population variance. For a Gaussian distribution this is the best unbiased estimator (that is, it has the lowest MSE among all unbiased estimators), but not, say, for a Uniform distribution (continuous) uniform distribution." My question is, I don't quite understand the very last sentence of the Mean subheading, "For a Gaussian distribution this is the best unbiased estimator (that is, it has the lowest MSE among all unbiased estimators), but not, say, for a Uniform distribution (continuous) uniform distribution." Could someone please explain and give an example of the last paragraph?
