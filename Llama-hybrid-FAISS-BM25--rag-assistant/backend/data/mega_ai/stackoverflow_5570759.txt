Using subversion you can easily each work in your own branch and then just merge from and reintegrate to the trunk. More information can be found here You can't commit when you do not have internet access using subversion, unless you use something like git as a local (to your machine) source control, and use git-svn to push/pull to/from your main subversion repository when you are back in coverage
