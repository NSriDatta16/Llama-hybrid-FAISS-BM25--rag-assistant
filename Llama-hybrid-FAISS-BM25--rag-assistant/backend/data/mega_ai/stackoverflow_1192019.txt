Do aggregate MySQL functions always return a single row?

I'm sorry if this is really basic, but: I feel at some point I didn't have this issue, and now I am, so either I was doing something totally different before or my syntax has skipped a step. I have, for example, a query that I need to return all rows with certain data along with another column that has the total of one of those columns. If things worked as I expected them, it would look like: SELECT order_id, cost, part_id, SUM(cost) AS total FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN xxx AND yyy And I would get all the rows with my orders, with the total tacked on to the end of each one. I know the total would be the same each time, but that's expected. Right now to get that to work I'm using: SELECT order_id, cost, part_id, (SELECT SUM(cost) FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN xxx AND yyy) AS total FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN xxx AND yyy Essentially running the same query twice, once for the total, once for the other data. But if I wanted, say, the SUM and, I dunno, the average cost, I'd then be doing the same query 3 times, and that seems really wrong, which is why I'm thinking I'm making some really basic mistake. Any help is really appreciated.
