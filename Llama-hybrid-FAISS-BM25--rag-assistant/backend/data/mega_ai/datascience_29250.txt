Idea from Lev Manovich, shown on video shows how most effectively plotting picture data to chart is made by showing the images as the dots in the chart. When something interesting behavior is on one point, you can observe the image right away. There was an example about plotting time series data on x-y space and from the form of daily curve there was a anomality in one day. Directly zooming on the pictures on that revealed a fire taken place in the landscape. From average value black and white plots you would not get that kind of immediate observations.
