You can do ordinal logistic with 11 categories, as long as there is sufficient N in each category. The rule of thumb is that the category with the smallest N should have 10 per independent variable. As far as I know, you can't directly compare the fits with some statistic that is output from both runs; what I often do is to make plots of the predicted values from each model: A scatter plot of one vs. the other, a box plot of the differences between them and sometimes a mean difference plot (this may be less familiar; it is a creation of John Tukey's. Plot the mean of the two on the x axis and the difference on the y axis) Note : You do not need more than one observation per level of $Y$ if the ordering of $Y$ is used in the analysis (which is the case for the usual proportional odds model). You only need multiple observations if you are treating $Y$ categories as nominal (polytomous). The proportional odds model generalizes the Wilcoxon and Spearman tests which do not require ties in $Y$. The only time you need to collapse $Y$ categories in ordinal logistic regression is when you are assessing the proportional odds assumption.
