Approach to labelling new data for training

Overview: Imagine an application that identifies cats and dogs from their phone camera. User's take a photo of their pet and it tells them if it is a dog or a cat. The data is then sent to the server. I don't want to go through all the new cat and dog photos labelling whether each one is a cat or dog. So how should I split the new data into categories to be trained on. The neural network may have identified inaccurately. What is a sure fire approach to labelling new data to be trained? Imagine the user doesn't know whether their pet is a cat or a dog!
