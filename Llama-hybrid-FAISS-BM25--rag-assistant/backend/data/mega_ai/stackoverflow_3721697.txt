I agree with Trey. You could consider Kanban or Scrumban. But what do you do when you are a true development Team post production and cannot follow Kanban for some strange organisational reason? I was a Scrum Master of a Team which was in a similar situation as you. Now let me get this clear, when you say "1st line" do the users directly contact your Product owner or your Team? If yes, I just think there needs to be a different Scrum Team which could handle this. We had a Operations Support Scrum Team which usually did this. Note this Team may also do release and deployment activities. Also have a different Development Scrum Team member join the Operations Support Scrum Team every Sprint for support activities. An important point is that a once a Sprint has started for a Development Scrum Team it is not recommended to start adding Production Issues Backlogs during the current Sprint. It may take away the value of the current Sprint and demoralize the Team members. It is the POs responsibility to keep the Sprint Backlog List stable, and she may have to fight the battle against the business for doing this at times. The SM should certainly do what it takes to protect the Team from outside influences and help the PO in ensuring the Sprint Backlog is stable. Now the flip side to this is sometimes Management may need to cancel a Sprint if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This could occur if the company changes direction or if market or technology conditions change or if there are too many production issues cropping up. In general, a Sprint should be cancelled if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances. However, because of the short duration of Sprints, it rarely makes sense to do so. So to summarize: Form an Operations Support Scrum Team and let them be the first line support who would work on Production Support Backlogs. Rotate turns for developers to join the Operations Support Scrum Team each Sprint to help work on Production Support Backlogs. If the Sprint goal becomes obsolete for a Scrum Team PO could cancel the Sprint and start a new one with new Sprint Backlogs.
