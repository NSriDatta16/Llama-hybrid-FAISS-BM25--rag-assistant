Classification problem: estimate the number of people in a household through account transactions

I want to estimate how many people are in a household by looking at account transactions. It would be also interesting to understand if in the household there are children. I thought that a possible way to proceed could be to compare the living expenses with that of the average individual according to the national statistics. Moreover I could also perform text analytics to retrieve informations about what products people bought (in order to understand if they spent money to buy children products). As model I could maybe use a random forest for classification (but please correct me if I'm wrong). Are there better way to solve this problem?
