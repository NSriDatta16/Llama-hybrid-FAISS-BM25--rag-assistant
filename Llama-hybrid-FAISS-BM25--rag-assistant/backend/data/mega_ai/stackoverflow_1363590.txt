Improve db4o linq query

I got a problem with this linq query: from PersistedFileInfo fi in m_Database from PersistedCommit commit in m_Database where commit.FileIDs.Contains( fi.ID ) where fi.Path == select new Commit( m_Storage, commit ); As you can see, every PersistedCommit contains a Collection called FileIDs which connects it to its PersistedFileInfo s. I want to select all previous commits of a specific fileInfo (which is identified by its path). I have about 800 PersistedFileInfo s and 10 PersistedCommit s. The query takes about 1.5 seconds - which is in my opition far too long. The contructor of the Commit -object saves only the two given arguments - so there is no timeloss, here. My question: Can this query be rewritten to perform better - or is it a db4o problem (use a SODA query instead)?
