I don't think that there is a method to archive this. But perhaps this workaround might help. I have to admit I never tested this, it's only an idea how you might solve your problem. You could try this. Create the new announcement with an admin user or with RunWithElevatedPrivileges(). After that use the RunWithElevatedPrivileges() method again and set the "created by" field to the user who should be the actual creator of the announcement. By this way only the "edited by" field should show the "wrong" user. I know this is not a very elegant solution but it might work. ;)
