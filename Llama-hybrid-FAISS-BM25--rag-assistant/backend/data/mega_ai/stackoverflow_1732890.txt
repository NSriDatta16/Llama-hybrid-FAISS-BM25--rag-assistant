Smooth movement of icon displayed on a Panel

I'm coding an app where I display a System.Drawing.Icon object on a System.Windows.Forms.Panel using a code that goes something like so: Graphics g = _panel.CreateGraphics(); g.DrawIcon(this.NodeIcon, _rectangle); I have code to move the icon around using drag-n-drop. My problem is that when the user move the icon around, it is anything but smooth. The icon looks distorted until the user stops moving the icon. I have tried to find information on this around the net but I can't get it to be smooth. I have little previous experience of this particular kind of coding (using graphics) so I am a rookie to this. If any kind soul could help me with some hints it would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!
