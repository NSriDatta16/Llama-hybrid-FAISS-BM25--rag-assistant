My memory tells me Access had an 'Upsizing wizard' option to port the db into SQL. This would allow you to use SQL server instead of a single Ms Access file. see http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q237980 The problem with using an Acess db is that the file is locked when you open it. This means multiusers would have a big problem if more than one person wants to write/read it. XML is also not an good option because its just a single file and would also have problems with multiple users. XML is also SLOW and takes up a lot of memory. If your data will grow this wouldn't be a good option. An actual SQL database does not suffer this problem and will allows multiple users. As for controls for your UI. I am not aware of any standard controls that would do what you want. You probably would do best to make your own custom control. Looking at your sketch, it looks alot like a GANTT chart (ie Ms Project)
