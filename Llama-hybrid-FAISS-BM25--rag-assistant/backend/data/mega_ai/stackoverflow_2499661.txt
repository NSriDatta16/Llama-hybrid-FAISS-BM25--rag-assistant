How to let parent control know that its child got focus?

imagine that I have a Form with 9 controls (TabbedStuffControl) in a 3x3 tile, and these controls contain TabControls containing another control (StuffControl) with ListBoxes and TextBoxes. I'd like to know a proper way to let TabbedStuffControl that its child has received a focus? e.g. user clicks into a textbox of StuffControl or drags something to listbox of StuffControl. Eventually the Form should know which TabbedStuffControl is active Do I need to hook up GotFocus event of TextBoxes and ListBoxes and TabControls, then dispatch another event to finally let Form know who got focus? I think that there should be a simpler way - that somehow TabbedStuffControl knows that its child got focus, so there would be only one place in code that I'll hook up. Thanks.
