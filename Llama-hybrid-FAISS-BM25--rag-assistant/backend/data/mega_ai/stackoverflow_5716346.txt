RPC on android causes GC_EXPLICIT

I need to synchronize my local sqlite database with a remote mysql database. I'm testing different XMLRPC and JSONRPC projects to do so. I send a packet containing all entries that arn't synced yet for each table. When these RPC projects are parsing the data logcat is filled with GC_EXPLICIT . GC_EXPLICIT means that the garbage collector has been explicitly asked to collect, instead of being triggered by high water marks in the heap. Happens all over the place, but most likely when a thread is being killed or when a binder communication is taken down. ~ Robert I tried to modify a XMLRPC project to perform my desired actions right after an entry is read from the packet and then use the same object variable to instantiate the next entry. This however does not solve the collect requests to the garbage collector. Any idea? tips? suggestions?
