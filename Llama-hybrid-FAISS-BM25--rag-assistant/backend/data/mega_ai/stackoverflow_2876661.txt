Elegant way to debug n-tier from Visual Studio

Just wondering if there is any easy way to start a debugging session that lauches the server and the client by simply pressing F5. As it stands I have to F5 to debug the server, then find the client project and right click->Debug, which is a bit fiddly. Any tips to get this to work more smoothly?
