There is no way of sending data to the browser such that a user could not retrieve it if they wanted, since that information has to be sent back as part of a HTTP response. HTTP is plain text, and anyone even remotely interested in what you're sending can easily obtain the full response. Just because (your average) browser doesn't necessarily display some things, doesn't mean you can't get to them. Anything else would make it impossible.
