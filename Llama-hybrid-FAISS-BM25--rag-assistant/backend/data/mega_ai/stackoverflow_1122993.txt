Are you wanting the child information to overwirte what is in the parent grid, show up as nested rows under the parent row, or the easiest way, show another grid below that grid and then on selection of the parent grid row, populate the bottom grid with the subset information? Take a look at http://www.asp.net/learn/data-access/tutorial-10-cs.aspx Instead of sticking the info in the details view, just use another gridview. Clarify your desired output and I can perhaps point you in a better direction. UPDATE: I believe this article which has detailed code will give you exactly what you are looking for, although there might be an easier way or a more elegant solution, this will at least get you up and running for now. http://www.aspboy.com/Categories/GridArticles/Hierarchical_GridView_With_Clickable_Rows.aspx
