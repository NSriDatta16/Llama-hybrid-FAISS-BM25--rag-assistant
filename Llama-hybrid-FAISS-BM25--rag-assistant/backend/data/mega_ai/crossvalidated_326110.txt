How xgboost uses weight in the algorithm

Is passing weight as a parameter to the xgb.DMatrix same as multiplying our predictor (say y) by the weight ? In more detail, I have a dataset which has the number an accident with 3 possible values, 0, 1, 2. And I want to weight it by the number of days per year the user has been driving, which has values like 1/365, 2/365 ... 364/365, and 365/365. y = [0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0,1] weight = [1/365, 31/365, 60/365, 20/365, 3/365, 50/365, 32/365 ] My question is, if I convert y to y/weight, and pass to xgboost without any weight, is it same as just passing y with weight ? Note that my objective = count:poisson
