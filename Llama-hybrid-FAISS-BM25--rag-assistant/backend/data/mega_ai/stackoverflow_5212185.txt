Haskell HDBC-Sqlite3 always returns SqlByteString values

I am using HDBC sqlite3 haskell driver to access local sqlite3 database which PRAGMA encoding is UTF-8 And as result, for example for SELECT id, title FROM some_table I'm always getting the result like this: [[SqlByteString "1", SqlByteString "\210\129\123\211"], ... ] That's weird! Yes, title contains 'national' symbols and yes, I'm sure that id has type of INTEGER . So the questions are: Why 1 unicode symbol are threated as 2 ascii-like symbols? Why integer columns results bytestring values?
