Poor multiclass classification using Caret in R

I have 5 continuous variables with 211 rows of data and each row is assigned a region, there are 7 possible regions in total. I wish to build a machine learning model that classifies an unseen row of 5 numerical variables and classifies it as one of the 7 regions. I have tried building a decision tree classifier as well as a Naive Bayes classifier but the accuracy for both models are really poor, 53% for both models. I believe I have configured both models correctly but I cannot improve the accuracy. In summary is this telling me that both model are not appropriate for the task at hand (multiclass classification)? For a reproducible example, here is a link to a dput of my variables and below is the code I am using for both models. #data preparation for decision tree classification x
