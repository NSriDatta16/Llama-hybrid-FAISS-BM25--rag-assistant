Sum of residuals squared

How can I write the sum of squared residuals as a function of the sample mean and variance of $y$, given that the regression equation is: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1(x-\bar{x}) + \epsilon$ where $\bar{x}$ is the average of the $x$'s. I want to calculate the sum of the squared residuals using only the 1st and 2nd sample moments of $x$ and $y$.
