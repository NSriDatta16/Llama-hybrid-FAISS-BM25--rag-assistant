How to make input not to lose focus when clicking on scrollbar in suggestion list

I'm testing TagDragon jQuery plugin, it's exactly what I need, but is has one annoying "feature", when I click the scrollbar in the suggestion list, it hides it's results. On the other hand jQuery autocomplete plugin doesn't lose the focus on the input field and that's why it doesn't hide its results. But that plugin doesn't provide the functionality I need, so I can't just replace tagdragon. I've studied jQuery autocomplete code and I can't understand how they keep the focus on the input field, I just can't find the code responsible for that! So the question of the day is: How to keep the focus on the input when using the scrollbar in the result suggest list? P.S. Also I have a question of how jQuery autocomplete plugin does it, because it looks like magic to me after studding the code for an hour.
