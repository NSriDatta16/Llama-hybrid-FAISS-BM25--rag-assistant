Yes. HTTP is insecure. Yes, plain text in the database is insecure. Encrypted is slightly more "secure" - it'll deter someone who casually looks through - but anyone with access to the server also has access to the script doing the encrypting / decrypting. I'd say yes. Encryption in your case won't do a thing against a dedicated attacker, but it'll prevent some sysadmin idly browsing through from immediately having the data without having to make the deliberate step to break in. I hope you're not storing credit card or other sensitive data, particularly if covered by privacy laws in your jurisdiction. Storing that sort of stuff on a shared server will probably get you sued. If nothing else, storage of credit card data in this manner will be a violation of your merchant account - if they get wind of it, Visa and MasterCard will become unavailable to you.
