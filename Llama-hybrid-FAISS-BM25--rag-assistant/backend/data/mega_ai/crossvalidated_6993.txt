I think that the glmmADMB package is exactely what you are looking for. install.packages("glmmADMB", repos="http://r-forge.r-project.org") But in a bayesian point of view you can use the MCMCglmm package or the BUGS/JAGS software, they are very flexible and you can fit this kind of model. (and the syntax is close to the R one) EDIT thanks to @randel If you want to install the glmmADMB and R2admb packages it is better to do: install.packages("glmmADMB", repos="http://glmmadmb.r-forge.r-project.org/repos"‌​) install.packages("R2admb")
