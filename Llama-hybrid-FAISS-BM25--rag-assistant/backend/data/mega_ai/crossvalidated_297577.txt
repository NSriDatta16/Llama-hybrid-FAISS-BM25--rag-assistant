By mean squared error do you mean the Brier score? And for elastic net the plot should be 3-dimensional since there are 2 simultaneous penalty parameters. Don't force $\alpha$ to be 0 or 1. To answer your question, the lasso is spending information trying to be parsimonious, while a quadratic penalty is not trying to select features but is just trying to predict accurately. It is a fools errand to expect that a typical problem will result in a parsimonious model that is highly discriminating. In addition, the lasso is not stable, i.e., if you were to repeat the experiment the list of selected features would vary quite a lot. For optimum prediction use ridge logistic regression. Elastic net is a nice compromise between that and lasso.
