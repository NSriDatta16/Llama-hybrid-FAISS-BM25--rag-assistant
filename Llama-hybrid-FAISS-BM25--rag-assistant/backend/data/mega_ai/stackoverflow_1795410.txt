can NLTK/pyNLTK work "per language" (i.e. non-english), and how?

How can I tell NLTK to treat the text in a particular language? Once in a while I write a specialized NLP routine to do POS tagging, tokenizing and etc. on a non-english (but still hindo-European) text domain. This question seem to address only different corpora, not the change in code/settings: POS tagging in German Alternatively,are there any specialized Hebrew/Spanish/Polish NLP modules for python?
