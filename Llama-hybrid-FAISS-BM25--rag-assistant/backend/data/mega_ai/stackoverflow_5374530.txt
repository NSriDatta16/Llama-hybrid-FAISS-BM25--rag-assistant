sending mail with swift mailer (php) to gforge email gateway, equal signs (=) at the end of lines

Now, i have another problem with gForge. I have a form in our intranet to create new trackers in our gforge system. We use Kohana and the Swift Mailer to send smtp emails. This is what i get (i send the mail as bcc to myself): Received: from 192.168.150.250 (192.168.150.250) by local (192.168.50.10) with Microsoft SMTP Server id 15.1.280.1; Wed, 16 Mar 2011 08:51:40 +0100 Message-ID: Date: Wed, 16 Mar 2011 08:51:38 +0100 Subject: Test_Issue Jieha (tracker-17) From: To: BCC: Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8" Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable Return-Path: test@website.de X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AuthSource: local X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AuthAs: Anonymous MIME-Version: 1.0 priority:4 assignees: wollmannc stardate: 03/16/2011 end date: 03/17/2011 Von user: Name: Christian email: meine@email.de Bemerkung: mein bemerkungstext testinput: mein input So everything looks fine. But Gforge is telling me: Received: from local (192.168.200.19) by local (192.168.50.10) with Microsoft SMTP Server id 15.1.280.1; Wed, 16 Mar 2011 08:51:42 +0100 Received: from gforge.local (centos5 [127.0.0.1]) by gforge.local (Postfix) with ESMTP id 5DBDED48174 for ; Wed, 16 Mar 2011 08:51:42 +0100 (CET) Received: (from nobody@localhost) by gforge.local (8.13.8/8.13.8/Submit) id p2G7pgvZ004723; Wed, 16 Mar 2011 08:51:42 +0100 Date: Wed, 16 Mar 2011 08:51:42 +0100 From: Message-ID: X-Authentication-Warning: gforge.local: nobody set sender to "GForge" using -f To: Reply-To: GForge Subject: =?utf-8?B?RmVobyIGJlaWgQmVhcmJlaXRlbiBkZXIgRW1haWw=?= Content-Type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Return-Path: noreply@gforge.local X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AuthSource: local X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AuthAs: Anonymous MIME-Version: 1.0 Ihre Email konnte nicht verarbeitet werden.

The application says: a start date is required, a close date is required". Note the equal signs at the end of some lines. I think that is the maximum line length of "quoted printable" or does the smtp also limit the lines? But why do i get the right mail through BCC? That should be the same mail that gforge gets, right?! Is Gforge doing something with incoming mails? I'm confused :-( I hope you can help.
