How to do regression discontinuity on panel data in R?

I am trying to analyze the impact of reopenings on consumer spending in American counties. I have a panel data containing information about the level of spending, income of the county and the state of reopening in the county (which is a factor variable between 0 and 3 0 - no measures 1 - recommend not leaving house 2 - require not leaving house with exceptions for daily exercise, grocery shopping, and 'essential' trips 3 - require not leaving house with minimal exceptions). I would like to get the average effect of the change in the respective levels of reopening on the level of spending and whether the effects vary between counties. What I want to get to know from the regression is something like: A change from 2 to 1 in reopening level is associated with a 25 % decrease in spending and the percentage decrease is 1% bigger for $1000 increase in the median household income of the county. I was thinking of using plm within model; something like regression but by using the within model I lose the ability to find out how the household income influenced the spending, as it is constant on the county level. Perhaps I could use the rdd package, but I am unsure about how to run a regression on panel data in that package.
