easy threading is not so interesting to erlang. Easy threading + Message passing and the OTP framework is what's awesome about erlang. If you need number crunching use something like ocaml, python, haskell. Erlang is all that good at number crunching. Parsing binaries is one of the things erlang is best at though, probably the best for it. Joe's book programming erlang covers everything really well, and is not so expensive used. It also talks about integrating C code and gives an example. the source is available from pragmatic programming without needing to buy the book, you can grep #include or something.
