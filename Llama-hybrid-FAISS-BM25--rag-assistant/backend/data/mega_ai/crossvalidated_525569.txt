How can I obtain degrees of freedom of LSD test that give Inf?

I am performing a LSD test after getting GLMM results. My goal is to know the differences between classes (in this case the difference between grinding methods, I assayed III methods). The GLMM output obtained was called "glmer.conc.Grinding_Kit". When I apply the LSD test: lsmeans(glmer.conc.Grinding_Kit, pairwise ~ Grinding) I obtained the next output: $lsmeans Grinding lsmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL I 5.26 0.323 Inf 4.63 5.90 II 4.62 0.323 Inf 3.99 5.25 III 4.34 0.323 Inf 3.71 4.97 Results are averaged over the levels of: Kit Results are given on the log (not the response) scale. Confidence level used: 0.95 $contrasts contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value I - II 0.641 0.137 Inf 4.688 I would like to know why I obtain Inf degrees of freedom and how can I obtain a real degree of freedom. Thank you in advance.
