emacs M-e doesn't work properly in tex-mode

I'm using emacs and auctex to write LaTeX documents. For some reason, M-e doesn't move to the end of the sentence in tex-mode as it did when I went through the tutorial. It moves to the end of the paragraph. (That is, it moves to just before the next double line break) What is wrong? Do I need to turn on/off some mode to skip to the next full stop? How do I check which modes are active?
