Looking for recommendations on a good ** beginners ** bash tutorial

I am an ETL developer by profession that just started reading The Pragmatic Programmer by Dave Thomas & Andrew Hunt. I have been meaning to learn more about bash & command line in Ubuntu for a while but reading this book made me realize how essential it is for me to start learning it. Therefore, I would love to get some recommendation from the StackOverflow community on a good beginner tutorial/reference to bash. I am looking for something that gives me a lot of example commands to play with and some exercises/challenges. Thank you all very much! Ashish
