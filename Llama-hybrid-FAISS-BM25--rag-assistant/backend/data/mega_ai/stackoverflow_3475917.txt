#pragma once has the same purpose, but include guards are intended to require a deeper analysis to ensure a file is included exactly once - e.g. // somerandomfileinmyproject.cpp #undef BOOST_ASIO_HPP #include Unless the compiler does handle such cases correctly, it still needs to open the file and pass it through the preprocessor even though it has been included before.
