I think if you use a neural network classification and train your model using back-propagation your model would find the best value for Fj. Therefore for your test set with given new Xj and Yj values your trained model will predict the Gj. This way you don't need and Fj values since your network will choose Fj value to predict the outcome which is either 0 or 1. Reinforcement Learning is used for maximising the reward from the environment, so you can use a normal neural network for predicting the Gj values hope it helped
