Convert textarea text into valid html

So there are a few paragraphs separated by line feeds "\r\n" in a textarea, say Paragraph1 "\r\n" Paragraph2 "\r\n" Paragraph3 "\r\n" what i want to achieve is to process each paragraph into tag. How do you do that? (Need a server side solution) so it looks like Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2 Paragraph 3 On top of the complexity, if you have a blockquote there Paragraph1 "\r\n" "\r\n" test "\r\n" Paragraph2 "\r\n" Paragraph3 "\r\n" should come out to look like Paragraph 1 test Paragraph 2 Paragraph 3 Thanks a lot ps: I see stackoverflow does a good job at that.
