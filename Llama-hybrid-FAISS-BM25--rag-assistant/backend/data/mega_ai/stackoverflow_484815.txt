need an alternative to the provider pattern

I'm maintaining a web application that utilizes the provider pattern as described below, for configuration purposes. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972319.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972370.aspx Everything has been working fine, but as we add functionality to our application, we are finding that our provider has become a mash up of several different functions that do not belong together. We are contemplating splitting up the configuration provider so that like functions are organized with other like functions. We're doing this because our original provider now has a handful of functions that do not need to be implemented by some modules. Instead of just throwing NotImplementedException on the extraneous functions when implementing the provider, we would like to just not include them at all. We realize that we could create multiple providers using the above MSDN method, but multiple providers would just create more entries in the web.config. It would be nice to minimize entries in the web.config, since that is starting to get big. Has anyone found another way to implement the provider model?
