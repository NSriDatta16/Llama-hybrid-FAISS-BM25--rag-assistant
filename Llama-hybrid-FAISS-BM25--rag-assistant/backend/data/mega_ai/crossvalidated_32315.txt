Some idea is like this: Y(t) = constant - [Y(t-1) +Y(t-2) +Y(t-3)] Where [Y(t-1) +Y(t-2) +Y(t-3)] means the sum of recent past orders from the warehouse. Here in this example I used past 3 observations but the number of observations summed may be optimized. Instead of constant one might use rolling average multiplied by the number of observations summed +1.
