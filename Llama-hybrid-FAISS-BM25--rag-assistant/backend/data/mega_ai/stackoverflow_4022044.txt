Am I releasing memory correctly?

I have the following helper object: LikeHelper* likeHelper = [[LikeHelper alloc]init]; likeHelper.delegate = self; [likeHelper performLike:self.messageID]; [likeHelper release];likeHelper=nil; performLike will do some NSURLConnection stuff and then tell the delegate whether or not it was successful. #pragma mark LikeHelperDelegate Methods -(void)performLikeFinished:(BOOL)isSuccessful{ if (isSuccessful) { UIAlertView *alertView; alertView = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Success!" message:@"The message has been liked" delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@"OK" otherButtonTitles:nil]; [alertView show]; [alertView release]; } else { UIAlertView *alertView; alertView = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Error!" message:@"There was a problem liking your message" delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@"OK" otherButtonTitles:nil]; [alertView show]; [alertView release]; } } Am I releasing the likeHelper in the right place?
