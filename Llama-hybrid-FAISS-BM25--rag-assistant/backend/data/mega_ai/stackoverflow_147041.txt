If you're interested in learning about the theory behind information retrieval and some of the technical details behind implementing search engines, I can recommend the book Managing Gigabytes by Ian Witten, Alistair Moffat and Tim C. Bell. (Disclosure: Alistair Moffat was my university supervisor.) Although it's a bit dated now (the first edition came out in 1994 and the second in 1999 -- what's so hard about managing gigabytes now?), the underlying theory is still sound and it's a great introduction to both indexing and the use of compression in indexing and retrieval systems.
