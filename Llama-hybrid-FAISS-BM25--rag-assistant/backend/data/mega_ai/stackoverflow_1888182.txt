Why is drop allowed even if Effects = DragDropEffects.None is set?

Dragging happens from "source" to "target". When the source calls DoDragDrop() with allowedEffects as DragDropEffects.Copy, then I'm able to cancel the drop by setting Effects = DragDropEffects.None at the target (in DragOver event). But the same situation fails when I set my allowedEffects as DragDropEffects.Move. To reproduce the situation, download the sample from http://jaimersamples.members.winisp.net/samples/dragdrop/drag.zip Change line.. (to DragDropEffects.Move) DragDrop.DoDragDrop(this.DragSource, data, DragDropEffects.Copy); Add line.. void Window1_DragOver(object sender, DragEventArgs args) { args.Effects = DragDropEffects.None; And also comment out the entire, DragSource_GiveFeedback.. void DragSource_GiveFeedback(object sender, GiveFeedbackEventArgs e) { //System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("DragSource_GiveFeedback " + e.Effects.ToString()); Is there some kind of bug in the framework, or am I just not able to see something obvious?
