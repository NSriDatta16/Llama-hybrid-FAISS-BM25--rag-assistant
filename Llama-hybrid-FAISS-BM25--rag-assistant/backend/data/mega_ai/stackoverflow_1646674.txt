How can I customize drag-and-drop between two ComponentOne TreeView components?

I have two TreeView components in .NET web page. I want to drag-and-drop nodes from one tree to the other, but not vice versa. I also want to drag-and-drop items at a certain level (the lowest level), and drop them at a certain level (the second-lowest level). I have written custom code in Flex to do similar customization for drag-and-drop, but I am a newbie with .NET, and really have no clue here. Could someone please give me some advice. This is a prototype, so I only need basic functionality, but eventually I will need these drops to perform real-time calls to the database to update the data for these move operations.
