How to do multivariate machine learning? (predicting multiple dependent variables)

I am looking to predict groups of items that someone will purchase... i.e., I have multiple, colinear dependent variables. Rather than building 7 or so independent models to predict the probability of someone buying each of the 7 items, and then combining the results, what methods should I look into to have one model that accounts for the relationships between the 7 related, dependent variables (things they can purchase). I am using R as a programming language, so any R specific advice is appreciated.
