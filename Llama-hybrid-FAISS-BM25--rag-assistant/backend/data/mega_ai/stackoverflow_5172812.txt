There are several benefits: It's faster, since comparing two integers takes (in your average compiled language) only a few instructions, while comparing strings takes O( n ) time where n is the length of the larger token. Compilers need this extra bit of speed . In C, C++ and Java, you can switch on an int but not on a string. Mistyping a token name will be a compile-time error instead of a hard-to-debug runtime error.
