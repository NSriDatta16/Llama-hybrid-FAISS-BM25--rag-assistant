Is there an advantage to rescaling a set of Likert items from 1-5 to 0-4?

I have a set of Likert type items asking respondents their attitude on different topics. For example, attitudes toward drugs/alcohol where 1=strongl disagree and 5=strongly agree to the statement "I think it is okay for someone my age to smoke marijuana." The 6 items in this particular scale are then scored using the mean of non-missing items. Is there some advantage to first rescaling the items so that the range of responses goes from 0-4 rather than 1-5? The only difference is in interpretation of the scale where the average "attitude" is 3.5 on a scale of 0-4 and 4.5 on a scale of 1-5. From an interpretation standpoint, what is easier for a lay audience? Or is there some standard of practice in terms of reporting?
