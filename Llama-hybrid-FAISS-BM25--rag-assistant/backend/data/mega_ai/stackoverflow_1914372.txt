Jquery drag and drop

Hi I am new to jQuery and trying work on a proof of concept. I have posted the example code here and my requirement is as follows. I have 2 droppables dog/sheep and I want to drop them on the shirt. I drop the sheep/dog on the shirt but as soon as drop it goes to the down-left position of the div. I tried doing $('[id$="apparel"]').append(dropElem); instead of $(this).append(dropElem); Can some one please help me in this? this is my javascript $(".items").draggable({helper: 'clone'}); $(".droparea").droppable({ accept: ".items", hoverClass: 'dropareahover', tolerance: 'touch', drop: function(ev, ui) { var dropElemId = ui.draggable.attr("id"); var dropElem = ui.draggable.html(); $(this).append(dropElem); alert("drop done"); } }); And the HTML
