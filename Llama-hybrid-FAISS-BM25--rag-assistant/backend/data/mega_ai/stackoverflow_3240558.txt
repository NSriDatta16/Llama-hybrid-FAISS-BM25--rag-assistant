With the device connected, run the app in debug mode from xCode and then exit the app. Now, disconnect the USB cable and run your app again - is it completely frozen? If you rotate the device, does your view orientation change? Once the app is terminated, plug your USB back in and go to xCode->Window->Organizer. You should see your iPad device on the left of the screen. Select it and you should see some tabs on the right for Console and Crash report. Select your app from the dropdown and look to see if any console messages have been logged, or if a crash has occured - you should get a stack trace if it did which should help. I once had a similar problem when I had NSZombieEnabled as an active argument in my executable, so that could be worth investigating too.
