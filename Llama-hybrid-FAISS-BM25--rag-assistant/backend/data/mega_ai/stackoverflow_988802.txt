Nice comment w/the WinAmp skin... I'm not sure if you've come across this resource, but MSFT has put together a pretty comprehensive set of UX guidelines here . This includes a downloadable PDF, if you're into that sort of leisure reading. While most of the guidelines apply to LOB (Line of Business) applications, you'll find some good information there about what not to do w/WPF (i.e. just because you can doesn't mean you should ). As far as having full-blown showcase GUIs, it's a little light -- it's mostly context-specific screen caps. However, I've found some good example UIs from the patterns libraries that Yahoo offers , and Infragistics has a neat site called Quince which has alot of the same information, but with a Silverlight presentation. HTH.
