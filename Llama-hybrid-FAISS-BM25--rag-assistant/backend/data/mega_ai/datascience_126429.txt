What feature selection method is ideal for a large dimensional data frame after the result of one hot encoding?

I am trying to solve a sports related multi class classification problem in Python, I aim to train a custom neural network and also a SVM. I have performed prior data cleaning and encoded my data using one-hot encoding for the non-numerical values. However due to one hot encoding the data frame is quite large now. So I wanted to perform feature selection, however after doing some research there is a wide a range of feature selection methods. What specific method should I go for? The data contains numerical input features and categorical target variables (Home Win, Away Win or Draw) which I have encoded using label encoder. The overall shape of the data including features and the target column is 2280 rows and 128 columns.
