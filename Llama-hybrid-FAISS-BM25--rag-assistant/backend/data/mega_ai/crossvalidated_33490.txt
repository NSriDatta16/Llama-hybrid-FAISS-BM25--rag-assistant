From the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository : We currently maintain 223 data sets as a service to the machine learning community. You may view all data sets through our searchable interface. Our old web site is still available, for those who prefer the old format. ... If you wish to donate a data set, please consult our donation policy. ... We have also set up a mirror site for the Repository. Also, the following MIAS dataset has been widely used and studied: When benchmarking an algorithm it is recommendable to use a standard test database (data set) for researchers to be able to directly compare the results. Most of the mammographic databases are not publicly available. The most easily accessed databases and therefore the most commonly used databases are the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database and the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). Besides, there are currently few projects developing new mammographic image databases as well as several old projects.
