Application's monitor/screen changed event?

I have a DataGrid in my WPF application. I am setting DataGrid 's maximum width relative to resolution of screen in which application currently resides in. My solution works fine when user launches the application on primary monitor but the problem comes when user drags the application to second monitor. I need an event which can tell me when the application is moved to a new monitor so that I can reset the DataGrid 's maximum width according to current monitor's resolution. How can I do that?
