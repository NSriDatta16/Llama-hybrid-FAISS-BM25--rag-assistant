If I well understand, you are comparing people that were sick and took vs those that were sick but didn't take the drug; the decision to take the drug depended on their own. Thus, simply calculating the difference between the two groups is prone to selection bias. To eradicate this bias, you should control for all factors that affect their decision to take the drug. By assuming a subset $Y$ of your $X$ variables includes such predictors, you could perform matching on all variables. However, in case of multiple variables, a propensity score analysis is more efficient. Of course, inference is limited to the population represented by the pool of people offered the drug in first place (as it would be even in case of a well-organized Randomized Controlled Trial) but, in this case, also by the region of overlap: https://ehsanx.github.io/psw/balance.html . As highlighted here, in fact: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6714558/ , "propensity scores of zero or one are indicative of deterministic exposure so that causal effects cannot be defined for these subjects" (and the paper discusses in general the issue of estimating the PS in the areas close to the extremes, i.e. 0 and 1).
