using git for images

I'm considering using GIT or our family photos. The scenario is that both me and my girlfriend uses digital cameras, upload the photos to each our own computer. But still want to organize the photos into folders for different events, and have that organization replicated between our two computers. By having the GIT repository master on our central server we can also view the images from our TV or access them through FTP if we need them while away from home. This implies a structure where the images won't change very often. Rarely they'll get moved around. The most common action will be to add folder with new images to the repository and commit it to the master branch so the images are avaliable to everyone. Now the question: How will the images be handled in Git? Will the Git repository be bloated up by maintaining an image for each version of the repository? Or will it only keep history of an image when it actually changes its content? The difference in diskspace usages should be quite large for the two given scenarios.
