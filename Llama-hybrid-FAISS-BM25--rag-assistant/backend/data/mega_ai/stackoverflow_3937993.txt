enum {..} s don't really take up any space in your program. Only objects declared as that enumerated type take up any space . Even then, it is unlikely to be more space than fits in a machine register (since they are comptaible with integer types). The only place there will ever be any storage associated with all the enumerated names and values defined for the type is during compilation. At runtime, all that information is unnessecary (and thus is not there).
