issue retrieving ajax data

I have an issue retrieving ajax data using jquery 1.3.2 / 1.4.2: It works with IE 7/8 It fails with FF 3.5/3.6, Chrome 5.0.375.70 The piece of jquery code is very basic: $.get('http://myhost/someurl',function(data) { if (data) { alert('data is: ' + data); } else { alert('no data'); } }); With all tested browsers except IE I fall into the ELSE. I compared http headers returns with IE and FF and I can't see what could cause the issue ("test" is actually the data returned by the server): [with IE] HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 22 Jun 2010 10:01:32 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10 with Suhosin-Patch X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10 Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-Length: 4 Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/html test [with FF] HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 22 Jun 2010 10:01:54 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10 with Suhosin-Patch X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10 Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=1777838b6006566fee273bd329463d57; path=/ Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-Length: 4 Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/html test I checked with wireshark and the HTTP response is well-formed (2 x "\r\n" between last header and content). Using Firefox, if I inspect the response with HTTPwatch it shows me "test" in the content. However if I look at it with firebug I see nothing. Same behaviour with Chrome degugging tool. Am I retarded? Thanks.
