Depends how simple and straightforward you want. The classic way to analyze proportion data in an ANOVA is to arcsine-square-root transform them, which does some combination (I forget exactly) of normalizing and stabilizing the variance. If you have the numbers of trials per observation (in your example, "30 of 50 died", 50 is the number of trials), then a binomial GLM is the more modern way to do the problem, and is also super-easy with any stats package (Warton and Hui [2011] feel strongly that this is the right method: "For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data") a non-parametric analysis such as Kruskal-Wallis would also be fine. it's possible that an ANOVA would be OK if your sample sizes are large and your proportions aren't too close to 0 or 1 (I assume you have more than one sample per treatment group ...) If you have a large number of all-zero or all-one responses in your data, it's likely that the data are overdispersed , i.e. that your data are not consistent with some of the assumptions (independent trials, equal probabilities) of the binomial distribution. In this case the easiest thing you can do is to use a quasilikelihood model, which allows the variance to be scaled relative to what would be expected from a simple (e.g. binomial) model. In R, this would be as simple as saying family = quasibinomial rather than family = binomial . A slightly more complex alternative is a beta-binomial model, which you could fit (e.g.) in the glmmTMB package with family = betabinomial . (It's also possible that you have zero-inflated responses, but then we're starting to get away from "simple and straightforward" ...) Warton, David I., and Francis K. C.
