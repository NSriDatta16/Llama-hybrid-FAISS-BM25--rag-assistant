The prevalence is indeed an important number. The exponential growth in cases that we saw in many countries without protective measures/lockdowns illustrates exactly why prevalance is important and that your point (1) is indeed correct. It suggests a mechanism of spread that can be approximately described by each infected person (on average) infecting a number $R_0$ of other people. All the measures most governments are taking are about reducing that number (if you get it The prevalence and the number of newly positively identified (usually through testing) cases is indeed not the same thing. Even if tests have no false positive, not everyone who is infected gets tested, so the number of positive tests is almost certainly an underestimate of the number of newly infected people. Secondly, prevalence is not just about how many are newly infected, but also how many people are still infected after being previously infected. While positive tests are thus only one useful measure, we at least know the direction of the bias of the estimate they provide: the true number of cases is very, very likely to be higher. There are various other indicators that can tell us some things about the extent to which this is the case. These include the proportion of tests that are done that return positive (if this number rises without the policy for who gets tested changing, then the more cases are likely being missed), antibody tests on a large number of randomly selected individuals of a population (there is some controversy as to whether some of these were misinterpreted/mis-analyzed, but in principle doing such studies should be useful), the number of hospitalizations and/or ICU admissions (again difficult, if the admission policy changes), and the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 or from any cause (although with a lag-time from infection to death to the numbers becoming public, which makes this difficult to use). So, I would not call it "biased evidence", but rather a lower bound (or underestimate). I would agree that it is important that the media not over-emphasize day-to-day fluctuations in inherently random outcomes (where I live, I do not think the press has done this, but this can of course vary from country to country or even from one publication/news channel to another), but over severals days or weeks general trends can be sensibly looked at. And because numbers are to an extent a lower bound (in some places where testing is less than it should be given the high prevalance probably more so than in countries that do thorough testing), it is to some extent important to look at the relative trends rather than the absolute numbers. I.e. even if in a place 50% of cases are missed, if the number of positive tests are with all else being approx. equal going up, then we at least know the number of cases is going up (= $R_0>1$ = unless something is done cases will keep exponentially increasing). The extent to which prevalence is a cause for concern about further spread depends on a lot of things: Firstly, if the true prevalence keeps risings (as indicated by, say, more positive tests), then clearly infections are still happening and not being stopped (part of it can of course be spread before/without people becoming symptomatic). Secondly, even if everyone who is infected were tested, it matters when they get the results and whether/when they take measures to stop the spread (e.g. with too much of a delay a test may not help much, or if economically people cannot afford to stay home, then a positive test may not help etc.). So, people getting told to self-isolate once a positive test comes back does not necessarily remove concerns.
