In the code the OpponentView class is one which extends any class like UIView or UIImageView etc. So you have to drag a UIView or UIImageView (based on the requirement) to the OpponentViewController's view in the IBOutlet from Library. Then change the class in the "viewIdentity" in the inspector to OpponentView . and then you can link to the file owner. So that you can solve your problem.
