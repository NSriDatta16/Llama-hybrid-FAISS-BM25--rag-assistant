In WCF, the best practice is not to have any state whenever possible, since your clients should be calling you with a "per-call" approach - each call from a client gets a new instance of your WCF service class, which is totally independent of anything else, ideally. If you need to have persistent state, store it in a persistent store - typically a database. WCF is also by default totally independent of ASP.NET and IIS, and thus cannot leverage the HttpContext, HttpSessionState and so forth objects - since it might be self-hosted in a console app which has no knowledge of IIS, HTTP context etc. The question is: what exactly do you really use from those HttpSessionState and HttpApplicationState objects? Somehow, you need to abstract that away or solve it some other way, e.g. have the client send you that information (as a parameter on your web service method call, or as a header in the message), or have the client send you a "token" of sorts which allows you to retrieve the relevant info from e.g. a database table.
