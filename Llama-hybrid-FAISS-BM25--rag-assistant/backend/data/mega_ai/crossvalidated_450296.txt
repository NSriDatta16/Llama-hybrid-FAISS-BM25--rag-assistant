Neural networks in computer vision usually operate with inputs of shape (m, n) — images—so there is nothing unusual about that. I would avoid using fully connected layers in this case and go for a fully-convolutional network. Have a look at U-Net, which has become quite a standard architecture for image-to-image tasks: https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597 Feeding it additional data of could be tricky, but fusing them in as additional channels at the bottom part of the U shape could work. Proper scaling might be necessary.
