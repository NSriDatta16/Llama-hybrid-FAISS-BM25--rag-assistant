The proper measure of scalability (not the simplest one;-) is a set of curves defining resource demanded (CPUs, memory, storage, local bandwidth, ...), and performance (e.g. latency) delivered, as the load grows (e.g. in terms of queries per second, but other measures such as total data throughput demanded may also be appropriate for some applications). Decision makers will typically demand that such accurate but complex measures be boiled down to a few key numbers (specific spots on some of the several curves), but I always try to negotiate for more-accurate as against simpler-to-understand measurements of such key metrics!-)
