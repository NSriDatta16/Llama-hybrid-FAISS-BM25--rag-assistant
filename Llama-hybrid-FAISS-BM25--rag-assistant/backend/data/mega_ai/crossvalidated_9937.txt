Finding the column index by its name in R

In a data frame, I would like to get the column's index by name. For example: x I want to know the column index for "bar". I came up with the following but it seems inelegant. Is there a more straightforward builtin that I am missing? seq(1,length(names(x)))[names(x) == "bar"] [1] 2
