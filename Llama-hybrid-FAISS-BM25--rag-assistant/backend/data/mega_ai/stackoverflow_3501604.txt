I will try, but obviously without knowing the details it is quite difficult to give a precise advice. First of all, the infrastructure guys might have asked this question from the licensing perspective (SQL server can be licensed per user or per CPU) Now back to your question. "Total audience" is important if you can predict/work out this number. This can give you the worst case scenario when all users hit the database at once (e.g. 9am when everyone logs in). If you store session information you would probably have at least 2 connections per user (1 session + 1 main DB). But this number can be (sometimes noticeably) reduced by connection pooling (depends on how you connect to the database). Use a worst case scenario - 50 system connection + 2 * number of users. Simultaneous requests/queries depend on the nature of the application. Need more details. More simultaneous requests (to your front end) will not necessarily translate to more requests on the back end. Having said all of that - for the costing purposes you need to focus on a bigger picture. SQL server license (If my memory serves me right) will cost ~128K AUD (dual Xeon). Hot/warm standby? Double the cost. Disk storage - how much storage will you need? Disks are relatively cheap but if you are going to use SAN the cost might become noticeable. Also - the more disks the better from the performance perspective.
