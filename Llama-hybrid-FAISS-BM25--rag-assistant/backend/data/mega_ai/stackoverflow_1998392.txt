Did you enable fullscreen when embedding? To enable full-screen mode, developers must add a new and tag parameter, allowFullScreen, to their HTML. This parameter defaults to false, or not allowing full screen. To allow full-screen, developers must set allowFullScreen to true in their / tags. http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/full_screen_mode.html
