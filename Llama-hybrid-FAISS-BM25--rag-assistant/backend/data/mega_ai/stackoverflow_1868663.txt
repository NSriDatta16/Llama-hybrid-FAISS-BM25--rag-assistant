How to update pixelPosition of a custom infoWindows on Google Maps V3 after dragging?

I'm creating a new mashup on top of Google Maps. It's simple enough that I chose to use V3 to provide longer life span. However, there's some special needs that Google Maps infoWindow doesn't provide. I've positioned my custom infoWindow with marker.projectionContainer.pixelPosition. I get correct position after zooming, but dragging doesn't update markers pixelPosition. How can I get difference between markers old position and new after drag? or Should I use OverlayView instead of trying to hack position from DOM? I think Maps' own infoWindows are automatically updated/parked on panels.
