Order a parent object by a child's property in LINQ

How do I order by child objects in LINQ? Classes A, B, and C. A has a collection of B and B has a collection of C. I want to order object A by the Ordinal (int) property of C. var query = from a in db.A orderby a.Bs.OrderBy(x=> x.C.Ordinal) I can't seem to figure out the orderby statement for this. EDIT: Sorry, my original statement was incorrect: A has a collection of B and B holds a C object. C is not a collection. Each A should be ordered on C's ordinal property. ANOTHER EDIT/Solution: I ended up doing an .OrderBy(b=>b.C.Ordinal) on the client for each B collection in A during display. That turned out better anyway since I can let the client order by anything they need to, instead of embedding that in my repository.
