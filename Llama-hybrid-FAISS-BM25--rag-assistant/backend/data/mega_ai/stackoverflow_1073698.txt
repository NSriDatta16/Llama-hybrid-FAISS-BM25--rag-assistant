If your data is based around this date and is primarily searched using date operations then it's a good idea to make the date the first column in the clustered index for the table. This way all of the data will be organised in a heap based on this date value and will result in fast date based queries. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa933131(SQL.80).aspx By default the primary key on a table is created as a clustered index. This may or may not be what you want. You can change the index type in SQL Server Management Studio in the table properties editor.
