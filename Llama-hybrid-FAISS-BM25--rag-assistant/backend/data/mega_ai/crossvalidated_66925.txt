How to report result from two-way repeated measures ANOVA?

I have conducted an empirical study as part of my master thesis. I have developed a software tool where cards can be sorted (affinity diagram) and in the study each test subject did a number of sorting tasks, to examine how the digital search feature improved completion time in sorting tasks. I am wondering if a Two-way, repeated measures ANOVA is appropriate to use when analyzing the data. I had two independent variables: dataset size (10, 30 or 50 cards) digital search feature ("on" or "off"). Which means I had 6 task in total, and the subject had to find 10 cards in each task, which was more or less difficult based on the dataset size and if digital search were enabled or disabled. I have two hypotheses that I want to validate: Users will be able to achieve significant performance increases in card sorting tasks when using digital search. Digital search are expected to play a small role when organizing a small set of cards. Digital search will therefore primarily outperform non digital search when organizing large sets of cards. It was a within-group study, with 14 participants (i.e. all subjects did all 6 tasks). The output is as follows (completion time in seconds): |---------------No search--------------|----------------Search----------------| | 10 cards | 30 cards | 50 cards | 10 cards | 30 cards | 50 cards | |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| | 34 | 103 | 171 | 22 | 22 | 26 | | 24 | 41 | 78 | 20 | 28 | 28 | | 37 | 60 | 141 | 19 | 23 | 24 | | 33 | 69 | 122 | 30 | 26 | 24 | | 26 | 52 | 227 | 22 | 29 | 38 | | 33 | 57 | 100 | 26 | 35 | 34 | | 33 | 87 | 148 | 25 | 25 | 26 | | 30 | 86 | 113 | 25 | 26 | 37 | | 30 | 127 | 156 | 26 | 27 | 28 | | 23 | 42 | 130 | 17 | 16 | 17 | | 22 | 75 | 112 | 22 | 34 | 36 | | 36 | 95 | 208 | 24 | 23 | 36 | | 30 | 89 | 105 | 23 | 21 | 25 | | 55 | 118 | 216 | 37 | 49 | 53 | |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| I have run a Two-way, repeated measures ANOVA test in matlab with this matlab implementation which gave the following output: 'Source' 'SS' 'df' 'MS' 'F' 'p' 'Dataset Size' [4.2174e+04] [ 2] [2.1087e+04] [ 62.2973] [1.2110e-10] 'Task type' [1.0926e+04] [ 1] [1.0926e+04] [ 31.0805] [8.9967e-05] 'Dataset Size x Task type' [1.0708e+05] [ 2] [5.3539e+04] [109.0535] [2.2704e-13] 'Dataset Size x Subj' [8.8008e+03] [26] [ 338.4936] [] [] 'Task type x Subj' [4.5699e+03] [13] [ 351.5311] [] [] 'Dataset Size x Task type x Subj' [1.2765e+04] [26] [ 490.9460] [] [] My statistical knowledge is quite limited, so I am not sure if this significance test is relevant, or how to report the output. I guess the following can be used, when arguing that both hypotheses are true? F (2, 26) = 62.297, p F (1, 13) = 31.080, p F (2, 26) = 109.053, p Bonus questions: Is a paired-sample t test appropriate to test if it took significant longer time to find 10 cards among 50 cards vs 10 cards when search were enabled (i.e. compare 4th and 6th column). I get a significant difference (t(13)=3.76, p
