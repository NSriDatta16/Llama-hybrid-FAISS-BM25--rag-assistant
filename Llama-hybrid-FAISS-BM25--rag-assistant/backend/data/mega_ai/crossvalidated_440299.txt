A few comments... What might be easiest is the chi-square approach. If you do this, however, you won't be able to say in which direction the effect occurs. You will only be able to say there appears to be a difference between intervention and control. You would also have to verify that there are more than 5 people in each cell. What might be best is to model the outcomes as a function of the intervention groups. Since your data is essentially categorical, an ordinal logistic regression sounds appropriate. Stata has this functionality if I remember correctly. EDIT: I have misread the question. A proportions test wouldn't work because you have no null hypothesis. Asking "what should my null be" is really only a question you can answer as the expert in the field, but I'm afraid whatever you'll choose will just be out of convenience rather than being a bonda fide hypothesis. I can't think of much that can be done aside from perhaps using this as pilot data to do a future experiment. You could reference it and say "from pilot data, we estimate the mean to be...".
