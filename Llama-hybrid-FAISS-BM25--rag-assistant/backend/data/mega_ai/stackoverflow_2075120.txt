Scrum says absolutely nothing about programming tasks. Up to you to work that out... Scrum doesn't necessarily have anything explicitly to do with programming - you can use it to organise magazine publication, church administration, museum exhibitions... it's a management technique not explicitly a way of managing software development. If you do extreme programming inside scrum, you just break your user stories for the iteration down into task cards, pair up and do them.
