There's a great danger in relational design when you try to create generalisations that aren't actually true, but look elegant. If you have a general table with a type field, that introduces a form of indirection that has to be resolved in your code instead, which can hurt both performance and the clarity of the code. On the other hand, such indirection can have its uses, and for certain purposes I use it quite a lot. The question you have to ask is whether Computer and Component really are aspects of the same thing, or whether you're just fudging them together because it sounds good.
