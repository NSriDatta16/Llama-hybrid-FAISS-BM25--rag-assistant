Yes, those tests are relevant. The Type test asks whether the average No-Search time is the same as the average Search time. The Size test asks the same question about the average 10-, 30- and 50-card times. The Size x Type test asks whether the average difference between the No-Search and Search times is the same for all three numbers of cards. In each case, the p-value tells you how likely you are to see differences as big as or bigger than those in your data if the true averages were truly equal. Extremely small p-values are interpreted as allowing you to reject the hypothesize equalities. However, you've analyzed the wrong variable. For variables such as time-to-completion, longer times are times are generally more variable than shorter times. Your means and standard deviations correlate .997, which is too big too ignore and is characteristic of lognormally-distributed data, so you should analyze the logs of the times. The interpretation replaces differences by ratios: instead of saying "30 cards took 69 seconds longer than 10 cards", you say "30 cards took 3 times as long as 10 cards". Someone at your thesis oral may ask whether you adjusted for non-sphericity, which the analysis you reported does not do. The adjustment may affect the results of the Size and Size x Type tests. Google for Greenhouse-Geisser and Huynh-Feldt, and note that you are not interested in testing sphericity but in adjusting for it. Yes, paired-sample t-tests are appropriate. The Type test is actually just a paired t on each subject's total over the three Size conditions for each Search condition. And a comment: When I was a grad student, the head of my department used to say that no one would ever get a degree while he was in charge if they reported anova results without first reporting the means and standard deviations. I imagine that if he were alive today he would probably want plots, as well. They can be remarkably informative.
