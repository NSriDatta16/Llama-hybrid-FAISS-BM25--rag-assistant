2d array, using calloc in C

I'm trying to create a 2D array of chars to storage lines of chars. For Example: lines[0]="Hello"; lines[1]="Your Back"; lines[2]="Bye"; Since lines has to be dynamically cause i don't know how many lines i need at first. Here is the code i have: int i; char **lines= (char**) calloc(size, sizeof(char*)); for ( i = 0; i I know that each line can't go over 200 chars. I keep getting errors like "error C2059: syntax error : 'for'" and such. Any ideas of what i did wrong?
