I'm not clear on what kind of time series your testing for when you say sporadic, but one popular option for testing if a time series is composed of time-dependent values is the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test. $H_0: \text{The series is not stationary (series values are time dependent)}$ $H_A: \text{The series is stationary, evidence of no trend (series values are not time dependent)}$ A stationary time series is a time series: whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed. https://otexts.com/fpp2/stationarity.html The site above is a good introduction or review resource for stationarity in time series.
