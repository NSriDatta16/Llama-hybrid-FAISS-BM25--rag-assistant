As some people have noted, you'll run into the problem of spots in service. This can be accounted for, though I wouldn't call it fixed, by keeping track of their average speed for the past minute/few minutes and apply that to the "gray zone." This keeps them moving forward at what can be somewhat safely assumed as their current speed, as long as they're not stopping and starting often. This fallback number can be kept up to date and swapped for the realtime number in instances where service isn't available, and then swapped out again when service comes back. You could possibly incorporate the accelerometer to make sure they're still running when the fallback number is being shown.
