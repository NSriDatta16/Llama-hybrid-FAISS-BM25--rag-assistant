Let $M=\{M_1, \dots, M_{100}\}$ be the unordered set of movies that are your favorites. Let $\mathcal F=(F_1, \dots, F_{100})$ be the ordered list of movies that a friend selected. I assume that $F_{100}$ is the highest ranked movie. You have considered the overlap $$ \text{overlap}=\sum_{i=1}^{100}\mathbb{1}(F_i\in M) $$ and the average ranking $$ \text{av. ranking}=\frac{1}{\text{overlap}}\sum_{i=1}^{100}i\cdot \mathbb{1}(F_i\in M) $$ The problem with overlap is that it does not take the ordering of the friend's movies into account and the problem with average ranking is that it penalizes large overlaps. I propose the total ranking $$ \text{total ranking}=\sum_{i=1}^{100}i\cdot \mathbb{1}(F_i\in M) $$ It takes ordering into account and it rewards large overlaps. It could also be done more generally $$ \text{generalized total ranking}=\sum_{i=1}^{100}g(i)\cdot \mathbb{1}(F_i\in M) $$ for example if you think that 100 is a bit arbitrary you could say $g(i)=900+i$ .
