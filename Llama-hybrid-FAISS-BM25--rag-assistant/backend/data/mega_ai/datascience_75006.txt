Linear Regression not working due to wrong kind of array

I try to deal with my homework. The Job is to take this Data and perform a linear regression on it. The code is published here . I am quite new to programming in Python and in data science. So I tried transforming as the interpreter suggests, but it didn't work. My first error was that there was a 2d array expected but 1d given. Then I took the pure array and put it into an empty one suggested by a StackOverflow answer now the error is that a scalar array is given but a 2d array is given. import pandas as pd from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler #Import data = pd.read_csv('uscrime.txt', sep="\t") crime = pd.concat([data], axis = 1) print(crime) from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression regression = LinearRegression() from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(crime.get("M"), crime.get("Crime"), test_size=0.2, random_state=0) X_train_new = [] X_train_new.append(X_train.values) y_train_new = [] y_train_new.append(y_train.values) regression.fit(X_train_new, y_train_new)
