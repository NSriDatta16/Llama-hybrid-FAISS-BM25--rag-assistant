UserControl Location in WPF

I am new in WPF, I created a new UserControl MyUserControl. Now I am surprised: the UserContol does not have a location. How can I read (by code) myUserControl1. Location in the parent container? I explain: I have some Dots (UserControls) that the user can drag in a panel. Actually, I am not sure what kind of Panel this will be... Perhaps Grid. Now, these dots should be linked with a Line. Actually, I have a Dot.Head and Dot.Queue properties (also Dots). So, when a Head or Queue is added, I need to dinamically create a link (Line) between them [A]-----[B]. This for this Line I search the Start and End points to set. Control XAML: Code: public partial class Stop : UserControl { private Stop head; private Stop tail; private LineGeometry headLine; private LineGeometry queueLine; public Stop() { InitializeComponent(); } public Stop Head { get { return head; } set { if (head != value) { head = value; if (head == null) { if (headLine != null) headLine = null; } else { headLine = new LineGeometry(); headLine.StartPoint = head.DotPosition; headLine.EndPoint = this.DotPosition; // ?? Add this line to the parent } } } } public Stop Tail { get { return tail; } set { tail = value; } } public Point DotPosition { get { double x = Canvas.GetLeft(this) + this.Dot.Center.X; double y = Canvas.GetTop(this) + this.Dot.Center.Y; return new Point(x, y); } set { Canvas.SetLeft(this, value.X - this.Dot.Center.X); Canvas.SetTop(this, value.Y - this.Dot.Center.Y); } } }
