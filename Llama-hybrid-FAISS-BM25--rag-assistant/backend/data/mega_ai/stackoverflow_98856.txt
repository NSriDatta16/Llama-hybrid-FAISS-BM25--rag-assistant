Can the NetBeans code formatter be made to format javadoc comments?

The NetBeans 6.1 editor doesn't seem to like to wrap comments, and the code formatter seems to ignore them. For JavaDoc comments, this behaviour seems inappropriate, as you can end up spending a lot of wasted time manually reflowing paragraphs. I was wondering if there's some magic setting to get the builtin code formatter, or the editor to wrap/reflow javadoc comments?
