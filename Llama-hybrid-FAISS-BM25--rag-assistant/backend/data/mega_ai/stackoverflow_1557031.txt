Any experience with a good drawing component/library

I am looking for a component/library I can use in an ASP.NET application that will allow the users to drag and drop shapes into a drawing area, connect them using lines, add text boxes etc. Pretty much the same thing you can do in packages like Visio, Samrt Draw etc Additional requirements: 1. Ability to save the final drawing 2. Export the drawing to common formats such as jpeg A nice feature would be the ability to define new shapes/items that could be dropped into drawings e.g. say the user was frequenlty drawing room plans they may want to create shapes representing tables, sofas, boilers etc that they can use in the drawings.
