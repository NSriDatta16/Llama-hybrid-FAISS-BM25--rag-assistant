Making java packages

My Java classes organization has gotten a little messy so I'm going over something I've skipped in my Java learning: the classpath. I can't quiet get beloved classes to compile in the packages I have created for them. Here's my folder hierarchy: . com/ david/ Greet.java greeter/ SayHello.java SayGoodbye.java Where SayHello's constructor just prints "hello" and SayGoodbye's prints "Goodbye" and Greet's main method just creates those two objects. At the top of SayHello is package com.david.greeter; and likewise with SayGoodbye and Greet's is package com.david; In the greeter folder I was able to compile both java files but if I go to the current directory (the directory that holds com) and do javac -cp "com.david.greeter.*" com/david/Greet.java it says it can't find the classes as well as saying package com.david.greeter doesn't exist. I've also tried setting the $CLASSPATH manually. I'm at my wit's end here, Stackoverflow (as I normally am when I post here). Do any of you know what I am doing wrong?
