The underlying model of CATBoost is decision trees. Outside of the domain they have been trained on, their continuation is a straight line. So there is no way for it to generate other results for values outside of the range seen during training. It also cannot learn the periodicity of your function. A polynomial kernel model (with SVM) might do a bit better, but also likely to diverge quickly outside the training domain. In general, avoid extrapolation with machine learning, if you can.
