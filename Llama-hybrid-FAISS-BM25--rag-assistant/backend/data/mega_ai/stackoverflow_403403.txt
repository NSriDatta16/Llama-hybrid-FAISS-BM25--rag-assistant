Very very A ( G , G ) important . In my opinion, wise indexing is the absolute most important thing in DB performance optimization. This is not an easy topic to cover in a single answer. Good indexing requires knowledge of queries going to happen on the database, making a large number of trade-offs and understanding the implication of a specific index in the specific DB engine. But it's very important nevertheless. EDIT: Basically, clustered indexes usually should have short lengths. They should be created on queries which reflect a range. They should not have duplicate entries. But these guidelines are very general and by no means the right thing. The right thing is to analyze the queries that are gonna be executed. Carefully benchmarking and analyzing execution plans and understanding what is the best way to do it. This requires years of experience and knowledge and by no means it's something to explain in a single paragraph. It's the primary thing that makes DB experts expert (It's not the only thing, but it's primitive to other important things, such as concurrency issues, availability, ...)!
