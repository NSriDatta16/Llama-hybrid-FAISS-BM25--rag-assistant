How to use MallocStackLogging on the device?

I've a memory issue in an iPhone app that I'd like to debug with MallocStackLogging . The error involves the gyroscope so I have to debug on the device not the simulator. I've set the MallocStackLogging environment variable and the iPhone properly records the mallock stack logs: MyApp(1856) malloc: recording malloc stacks to disk using standard recorder MyApp(1856) malloc: stack logs being written into /private/var/mobile/Applications/1FD1F8D2-5D30-4AA7-B426-C52FE20266DE/tmp/stack-logs.1856.MyApp.index MyApp(1856) malloc: Please issue: cp /private/var/mobile/Applications/1FD1F8D2-5D30-4AA7- B426-C52FE20266DE/tmp/stack-logs.1856.MyApp.e8z3IL.link /tmp/ Now how can I work with them? I can transfer them to the Mac using the Xcode Organizer. But what should I do with these two files? stack-logs.1856.MyApp.index stack-logs.1856.MyApp.e8z3IL.link I tried moving the files in /tmp on the Mac and called: $ malloc_history 1856 -all_events malloc_history cannot examine process 1856 because the process does not exist. Clearly, the malloc_history command looks for running processes on the local machine. I'm missing an option to specify the log file manually. Is there any way to get this to work either directly working with Xcode on the (non-jailbroken) device or after transferring the logs to the Mac?
