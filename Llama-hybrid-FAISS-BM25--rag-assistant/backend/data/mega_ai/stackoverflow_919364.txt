Getting to SVN from TeamCity using Windows Authentication

I am trying to setup TeamCity on my Windows XP machine. It is failing to get the code from subversion because of an authentication error. I have put my windows domain\user username and password into the TeamCity configuration - but it looks like it's trying basic authentication. What do I need to change? Here is the TeamCity SVN log (the actual server/port has been replaced with server:port): [2009-05-28 17:37:43,375] DEBUG - javasvn.output - NETWORK: SENT OPTIONS /svn/External HTTP/1.1 Host: remote.server:port User-Agent: SVN/1.5.5 SVNKit/1.2.2 ( http://svnkit.com/ ) r5405 Keep-Alive: Connection: TE, Keep-Alive TE: trailers Authorization: Basic bWVybG90L21hcmt3OiVyZnZjZGUz Content-Length: 0 Accept-Encoding: gzip Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8" DAV: http://subversion.tigris.org/xmlns/dav/svn/depth DAV: http://subversion.tigris.org/xmlns/dav/svn/log-revprops DAV: http://subversion.tigris.org/xmlns/dav/svn/mergeinfo [2009-05-28 17:37:43,453] DEBUG - javasvn.output - NETWORK: READ HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required Date: Thu, 28 May 2009 05:38:56 GMT Server: Apache WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Subversion Repositories" Content-Length: 401 Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=99 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 [2009-05-28 17:37:43,453] DEBUG - javasvn.output - NETWORK: svn: Authentication required for ' https://server:port Subversion Repositories'
