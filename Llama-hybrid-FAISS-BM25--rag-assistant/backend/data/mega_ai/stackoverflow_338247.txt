When I see a slow down, I tend to create a solution that has references to built versions (assemblies) of dependent projects rather than the project files (for any projects that I don't need to see the source code). I only open the source for projects I am working on - surely nobody needs to work on the source of 50 projects at one time. If you are already referencing the dependent assemblies rather than source, then I think it is just a matter or organizational preference (organize in a way that is easiest for you to understand and maintain).
