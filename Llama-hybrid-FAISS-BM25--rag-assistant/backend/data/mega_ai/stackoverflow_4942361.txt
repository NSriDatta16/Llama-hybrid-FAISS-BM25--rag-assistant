How to turn a list of lists to a sparse matrix in R without using lapply?

I have a list of lists resulting from a bigsplit() operation (from package biganalytics, part of the bigmemory packages). Each list represents a column in a matrix, and each list item is an index to a value of 1 in a binary matrix. What is the best way to turn this list into a sparse binary (0/1) matrix? Is using lapply() within an lapply() the only solution? How do I keep the factors naming the lists as names for the columns?
