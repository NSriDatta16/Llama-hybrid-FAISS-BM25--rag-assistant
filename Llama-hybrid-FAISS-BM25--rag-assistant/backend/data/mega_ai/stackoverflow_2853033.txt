It might not be log4j that is doing the logging, and hence your log4j config would be ignored. Spring logs using Commons Logging, which is an api that can delegate to various logging frameworks, including log4j. To decide which implementation to use, commons logging looks into the classpath. If you have added a dependency that dragged its own logging implementation into the classpath, commons logging might now use the other implementation. I recommend to set a breakpoint at a call to the logging facility, and trace the execution to see which logging implementation is used.
