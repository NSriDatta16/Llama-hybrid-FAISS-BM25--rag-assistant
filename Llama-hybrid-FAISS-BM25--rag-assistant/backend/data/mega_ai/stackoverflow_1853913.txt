Option 2 is the way to go. Storing all items and quantities in items field (option 1) means you are going against the relational nature of MySQL. You'll have to define a format and parse it with option 1, additional code you don't have write with option 2. Also, with Option 2, you'll be able to do other things easier down the line, like calculate totals, shipping amounts, etc, as well as reporting on item quanities sold (just a simple query). Of course, if I was writing this, I'd also ask myself if there is a library available to do this - why reinvent such common a functionality as shopping cart. I am not from PHP world, so I don't know what the options are, but I am sure there must be something you can reuse. So ultimately, I'd encourage you to choose option 3 - don't implement it yourself if you an avoid it :-)
