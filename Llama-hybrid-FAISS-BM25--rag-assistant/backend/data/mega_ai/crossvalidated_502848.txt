You can do something like this: library(emmeans) emt = emtrends(m, ~ MV1 * MV2, var = "T") emt # list the estimated slopes at each factor combination pairs(emt) # pairwise comparisons of these slopes You can do restricted comparisons via adding, say, by = "MV2" . You may also average these slopes over one of the factors, for example, emmeans(emt, ~ MV1) pairs(.Last.value) Note: To display the fitted lines (whose slopes are summarized in emt ), use emmip(m, MV1 - T | MV2, cov.reduce = range) # or # emmip(m, MV1 * MV2 ~ T, cov.reduce = range) (Depending on whether you want two panels with two lines each, or one panel with all four lines.) The emmip() call shown in the other answer will plot only single points, because predictions for numeric predictors are made by default only at their mean. We specified instead to use the minimum and maximum T values.
