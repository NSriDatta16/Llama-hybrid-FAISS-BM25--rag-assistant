I might be wrong but the way that I think about it is as follows: Let's say you have samples $X_1, X_2, \dotsc, X_n$ . Then, the method of the moments suggest that we should compare $m-th$ moment of sample with $m$ th moment of population $$(X_1 + X_2 + \dotsm + X_n) / n = μ$$ here, we are averaging all the samples out which seems like a good estimate of population mean $$(X_1^2 + X_2^2 + \dotsm + X_n^2) / n = σ^2$$ here, we are averaging all the sample variances out which also seems like a good estimate of population variance And so on, That is what I think is a good explanation of how method of moment works!
