I was going to advice on using memcached as a very fast, distributed RAM storage for keeping logs; but it seems that EHCache is a similar project but more java-centric. Either one is the way to go, as long as you're sure to use atomic updates (memcached supports them, don't know about EHCache). It's by far the most scalable solution. As a related datapoint, Google uses 'Chubby', a fast, RAM-based distributed lock storage as the root of several systems, among them BigTable.
