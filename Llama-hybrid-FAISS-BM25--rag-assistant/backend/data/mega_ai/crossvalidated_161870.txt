Remember that random effects are constrained such that the sum of the random effects = 0. In other words, random effects are the cluster's deviation from the fixed effect. So in your case, the fixed effect of B is likely different than 0, but when you exclude this fixed effect from the model, you are still forcing the average of all the $B|id$ to be 0.
