If you want to reorder rows and to save or use the new row order I suggest you add a column called Index or RowIndex or whatever also to the underlying datasource of your control, in this way with the Drag&Drop operation you simply change the value of that column for a given row and after everything has been done you can store or use this value for the next render or whatever else you need.
