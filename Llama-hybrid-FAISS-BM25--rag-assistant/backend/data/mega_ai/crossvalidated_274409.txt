My understanding of your setting: For observations $i=1, \ldots, n$ where $n \approx 30,000$ you have a binary variable $Y_i$ where: $$Y_i = \left\{\begin{array}{rl}1 & \text{If event occurs} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{array} \right.$$ My understanding of your question: Q: You're having trouble forecasting $Y_i$. Could you instead forecast $Z_i = 1 - Y_i$ (i.e. $Z_i = 1$ if the event doesn't occur). A: For many standard methods: logistic regression, support vector machines, linear regression, etc... trying to forecast $Y$ or trying to forecast $Z$ will be entirely equivalent in the sense your forecasting power will be entirely the same.
