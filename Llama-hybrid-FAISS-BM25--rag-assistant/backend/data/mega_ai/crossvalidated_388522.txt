It's not really clear to me why 15,000 potential cases were removed from the original sampling frame. But assuming there was good reason and assuming those 15,000 people never had a chance to respond to the survey, the survey weights should add to 35,000, not 50,000. Perhaps the original analysts did not want to bother 15,000 members again with another survey since they recently returned one so they excluded these 15,000 people from being eligible to participate in this survey based on the critical assumption that those 15,000 do not differ in any meaningful way from the other 35,000 people that were left in the original sample frame. If that was the case, then you could proceed as follows with only minor "hand-waving": Initial sampling fractions $f_h={n_h\over{N_n}}$ within each of the $h$ strata are determined by taking the total number of those sampled in a given stratum $n_h$ and dividing by the total number of people in the population/sampling frame in stratum $h$ , $N_h$ . The base weight in stratum $h$ at this point is calculated by taking ${1\over{f_h}}={N_h\over{n_h}} \equiv w_h$ . The $i$ th respondent in stratum $h$ will then be assigned this weight and we'll call it $w_{ih}$ . If there were no such thing as non-response, the sum of the weights $w_{ih}$ would add up 50,000, but if you have missing data, then that might not be the case. Then you'd want to weight for non-response. One method of doing this - and it sounds like maybe the method your organization used in this case - is to use stratified weight-class adjustment weights based on gender. Here is how this works. Within each stratum separate your sample by men and women. For the men, add up all their sample weights and divide this by the sum of all the sample weights for the male respondents. Do the same thing for women and the female non-respondents. These are then your Weighting Class Adjusted non-response weights, $\pi_{ihc}$ for person $i$ in stratum $h$ , gender-class $c$ . You can now find your final weight, $\phi_{ih}$ , for person $i$ in stratum $h$ gender-class $c$ by multiplying $w_{ih}\pi_{ihc}=\phi_{ihc}.$ The sum of all these weights should now equal 50,000 (maybe minus some small rounding error). Generally speaking your variance will increase when you weight for non-response due to an increase in variability caused by the fluctuating values of the weights. The variance estimates can be calculated most easily by any software that is capable of analyzing weighted survey data (e.g. SUDAAN, SAS, SPSS Complex Samples, etc.). The formulas for calculating this can get pretty complex, so I won't write them out here and this isn't something you really want to do by hand. Instead, use one of the survey packages for the analysis of complex sample surveys and set up the appropriate design and weighting variables. The only way your results are generalizable to the enter population of 50,000 is if one can assume the 15,000 that were excluded from the survey are not systematically different in any way measured by your survey. It sounds like the 15,000 cases might have been removed by removing all those sampled in specific strata. If you there is any chance those those missing strata are somehow different from your other strata along some dimension you are measuring in your survey, then you may not generalize your findings to all 50,000, but to only those strata from which you sampled.
