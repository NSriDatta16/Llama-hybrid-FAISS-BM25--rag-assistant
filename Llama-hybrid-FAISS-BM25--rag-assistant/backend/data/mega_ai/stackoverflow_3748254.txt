All of Magento, with its catalog management and display tools, along with themes, is designed with this scenario in mind. Generally you attach a store view with its associated catalog, pricing and inventory to a unique URL (e.g. wholesale.store.com and retail.store.com). Here are blog posts on how to do this in Magento v1.3 and v1.4 , however you could take a couple of different approaches. One option for this is to write a custom module that binds an Observer to the customer_login event, and then sets a redirect to the Store that you have associated with their Customer Group. There's nice blog post on how to use Observers in Magento, and a cheat sheet of known Events . You can search Stack Overflow for pointers on starting the development of a custom module. That should get headed in the right direction.
