I am not sure I fully got your question. But if I did, and you are asking about a multivariate time series, well you have many solutions. Take the following as an introduction more than a fully comprehensive answer. The models that, among the others, take into account linear interactions between variables that are relevant to their conditional means are VAR models . Then if you assume that residuals are not independent and there may be some dependencies in the conditional second moments of the series, then you can combine a VAR model for conditional means with a multivariate GARCH allowing you to model dependencies in the conditional second moment here for an introduction and then here . Then, if you want a very broad and comprehensive specification of a multivariate model, that may include external regressors, constraints, time-varying coefficients etc, in addition to the above mentioned specifications for conditional means and covariances, then see MARSS
