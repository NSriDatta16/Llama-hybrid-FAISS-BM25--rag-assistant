JavaFX applet uses the new Java-Plugin architecture which uses JNLP. To deploy JavaFX applets you must use both the javascript in html file and the jnlp file. When IDE's generate the jnlp and the html file, they embed default values in those files that you must ensure are correct. Make sure of the following when you load your files on the web server: Your javascript archive: key matches the name of the jar file. Your javascript code: key points to the main class of the applet Your javascript jnlp_href: key points to the proper location of the jnlp file Your jnlp file needs to the codebase referring to the location where the code resides. Below is a sample: javascript: javafx( { archive: "applet-demo.jar", width: 640, height: 75, code: "applet.demo.Main", name: "applet-demo", jnlp_href: "myapplet.jnlp" } ); myapplet.jnlp applet-demo Vladimir Vivien applet-demo
