You can deploy clover build (along with the coverage.db files generated during the instrumentation) to your servers, add a bunch of clover-specific java options to set it up and then collect the results, merge them using the clover merge tools and generate the reports. See Clover Wiki for detailed instructions. Please note that by default, clover dumps the coverage data upon process termination - you might want to do some research on how to make it happen periodically. Look into -flushpolicy and -flushinterval options.
