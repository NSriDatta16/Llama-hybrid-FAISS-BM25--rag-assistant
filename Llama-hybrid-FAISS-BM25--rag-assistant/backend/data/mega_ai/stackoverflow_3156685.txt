link jquery animations

I want to link several jquery animations one after the other but I'm having some issues. Let's presume this example: This is the first paragraph This is the second paragraph I want to turn the first one red then back to black then pass on and animate the second one the problem is i don't know how to link the two animations. I should add that I'm getting messed up in the syntax can someone give me a more explicit example $(this).animate() where do i state the second part of the animation (ie return to the original state) and where do i insert the callback function (i think thats the name for the function that activates once the first one is complete)/
