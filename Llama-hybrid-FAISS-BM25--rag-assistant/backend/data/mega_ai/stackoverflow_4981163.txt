I don’t think we will be able to help you with a fragment of code that we cannot compile or run and without knowing the rest of your application. I have tried to reproduce the problem you describe and I’m afraid it is not happening. I have posted my code here in case you want to try it too (it is effectively the same as your code). The code shows a form with a progress bar and a button. You click the button, the progress bar goes all the way up to 100% within 10 seconds. Once it reaches the end, the Debugger.Break() triggers. If you can change the above code into one that actually reproduces your problem, and you post that as a self-contained example, then we will be able to help you.
