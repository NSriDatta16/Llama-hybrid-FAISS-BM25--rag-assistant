Without knowledge about the context of both statements, stated that both statements apply to methods and classes then they make sense: A piece of code which calls a method can only handle exceptions for which it has enough information about the context. In most cases a piece of code won't have enough information, to handle all exceptions. Example: A piece of code, which calls a method SaveData() can handle a DatabaseStorageException when it knows, that it saves data to a database. On the other hand, if the piece of code is programmed in a storage agnostic manner, than catching such a specific exception is not a very good idea. In this case it is better to let the exception pop up the callstack and let some other code handle the exception, which has enough context information to handle it.
