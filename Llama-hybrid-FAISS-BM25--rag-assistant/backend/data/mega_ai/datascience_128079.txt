In order to predict after training on Standardized data, do I need the StandardScaler as well?

Is the scaler saved inside the model.keras file or I need to separately save it? I want to train an neural network, save it, and then send it to a co-worker that will do the predictions on data that I do not have access to. Is it enough to just send the .keras file or I also need to send the scaler ? Before training I Standardized the data scaler = StandardScaler() X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train) after the NN is trained I save it model.save(".../X.keras") Now I want to load it and predict on new data (or the test data) ann = load_model(".../X.keras") And evaluate the model using X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test) y_predict_NN = ann.predict(X_test_scaled) So how I get the scaler?
