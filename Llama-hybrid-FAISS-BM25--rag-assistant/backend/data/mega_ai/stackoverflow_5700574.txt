Ok, I found a way. It turns out the DragDrop event won't fire as Excel handles all drag events itself, but the DragEnter event does fire, and when it does I can open a modeless form on top of the actual drop target. This form can then receive the DragDrop event (and kills itself on the DragLeave event). It's a bit of a hack, but it seems to be working nicely.
