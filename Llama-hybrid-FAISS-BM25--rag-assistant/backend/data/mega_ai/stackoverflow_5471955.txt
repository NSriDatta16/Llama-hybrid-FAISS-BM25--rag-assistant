Bind object to winForms control element

I have a class named OrganizerNote with fields: public long id; public DateTime CreationDate; public string Title; public string Note; Also I have a class public class XMLOrganizer that has 1 field: public List Notes=new List (); For example, I have several objects: OrganizerNote n1 = new OrganizerNote(); OrganizerNote n2 = new OrganizerNote(); with some data in fields. Then I create 1 object XMLOrganizer xmlOrg = new XMLOrganizer(); xmlOrg.Notes.Add(n1); xmlOrg.Notes.Add(n2); So I need to bind each xmlOrg.Notes[0] ... xmlOrg.Notes[i] to Row[i] in datagridView control. And fields values would be in columns. How could I do so?
