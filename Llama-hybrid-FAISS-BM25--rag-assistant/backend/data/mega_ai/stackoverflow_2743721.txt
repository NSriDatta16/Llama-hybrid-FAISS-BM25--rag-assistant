This may be a bit overkill but you'd most probably benefit from learning about application foundations and scaffolding. I would start here http://sharparchitecture.net/ . Once you have the basic app set up you could use jquery along with the plugins like jquery forms jquery Validation to handle the form up to the submit. There a quite a few plugins to help with popup window. How to submit an arbitrary number of sub entities (like the classes of a student in your example) is really a question of your specific server side implementation. This can be done quite elegantly with s#arp architecture but requires some tweaking of the form before submit. Welcome to the stateless world of web forms! and good luck, David
