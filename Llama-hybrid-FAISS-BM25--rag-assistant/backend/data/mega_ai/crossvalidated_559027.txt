Yes, but be aware regression is also a machine learning method. What you're looking to learn more about are loss functions, and you want to use a quantile loss function. You can usually specify your own loss function. In sklearn for example, you might have a loss parameter for your estimator, such as in sgdregressor. See here for more info Quantile regression: Loss function
