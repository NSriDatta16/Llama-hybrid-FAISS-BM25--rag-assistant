soft SVM - degenerate case

According to " A Note on Support Vector Machine Degeneracy ", Theorem 4, if the dual problem for soft-SVM has a solution with $\alpha_i \in \{0,C\}, \forall i$, then $w=0$ for the primal problem. In " Uniqueness of the SVM solution ", there is an example which, I say, contradicts the theorem above: Data: $x_1 = 1, y_1 = +1; x_2 = -1, y_2 = -1$ $C \in (0,1/2]$ Result: $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = C$ $w=2C \neq 0$. Am I missing something?
