Interpretation of SPSS logistic regression output?

would really appreciate some help interpreting this output. Think I'm almost there, but just have a question about interpreting the sig. column: This model aims to look at factors contributing to retirement. I understand that age is significant predictor, and with increasing age, people are more likely to retire. However, when it comes to 'Hours' I'm a little confused. Am I right to interpret it as: People who work 'Hours(4)' are statistically more likely to retire than the control (p Any help would really be appreciated, thanks!
