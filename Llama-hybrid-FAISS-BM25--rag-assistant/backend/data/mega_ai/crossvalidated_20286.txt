Well I guess the following paper answers your question at least partially. The paper gives the sample size and its upper bounds for Linear as well as Logistic regression. The case where there are already , say p covariates in the model and the effect of adding some more is also treated there in case of multiple linear regression on page 3. The main test presented is to check the significance of regression i.e. whether betas are significantly different from zero or not and the sample size is given for that. http://personal.health.usf.edu/ywu/logistic.pdf
