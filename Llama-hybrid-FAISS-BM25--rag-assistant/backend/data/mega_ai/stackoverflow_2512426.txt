Maybe what heporap is trying to say is: construct the 3D VR effect in the same way you might make a slider animation. I guess a slider changes the position of an image in relation to where a mouse cursor is positioned so... Perhaps try changing the IMG tag's SRC attribute on document.onmousemove and object.onmousedown for drag/positioning effect? Maybe that sounds obvious, and I'm no maverick coder but it's a start...
