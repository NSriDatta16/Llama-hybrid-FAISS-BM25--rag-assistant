I have some coworkers who once, while being chewed out by a client for an overdue and bug-ridden project, bragged to the customer that they had written 5 times as much test code as operational code. The client was not happy, and by "not happy" I mean their skin turned green, they grew to 5 times their normal size, and their clothes popped off.
