xgboost logistic regression predictions are returning values >1 and < 0

I'm currently using xgboost to try and fit a logistic model with a binary outcome on a set of training data, but when I use the model that I get from this training data on a new set of classified test data, the predictions I'm getting back give me probabilities that are greater than 1 and less than 0. I've noticed that predictions on the training data are also prone to this problem, but on the test data I'm getting probabilities > 1.2 and What would cause predicting with the xgboost model to do this? Here's the parameters I'm passing, the line for building the model, and the line for prediction that I'm using: # Select xgboost parameters parameters = list(eta = 0.005, max_depth = 15, subsample = 0.5, colsample_bytree = 0.5, seed = 1, eval_metric = "auc", objective = "binary:logistic") # Fit a model xgb_reduced = xgboost(data = xgbtrain_reduced, parameters, nround = which.max(cvreduced$evaluation_log$test_auc_mean)) # Load a file without also loading the name of the R object that the file is storing load.to.prompt = function(file_str){ tmp = load(file_str) return(get(tmp)) } # Do prediction classifier = load.to.prompt(model.file) bst = xgb.load(classifier$rawbst) preds = data.frame(issue_id = issue_ids, td_prob = round(predict(bst, newdata = xdat), 3)) Here are some example outputs: id prob 295 1.257 240113 1.256 576589 1.254 509199 1.245 367088 1.24 479162 1.24 462561 1.225 367201 1.223 227231 1.191 433179 1.186 ... 11789 -0.073 37729 -0.073 58831 -0.073 99241 -0.073 422522 -0.073 419522 -0.082 420048 -0.082 526770 -0.082 87704 -0.089 409858 -0.089
