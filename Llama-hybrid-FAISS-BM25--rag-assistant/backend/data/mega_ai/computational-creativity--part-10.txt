l model that allows for the simulation of incubation and insight in problem-solving. The emphasis of this computational creativity project is not on performance per se (as in artificial intelligence projects) but rather on the explanation of the psychological processes leading to human creativity and the reproduction of data collected in psychology experiments. So far, this project has been successful in providing an explanation for incubation effects in simple memory experiments, insight in problem solving, and reproducing the overshadowing effect in problem solving. Debate about "general" theories of creativity Some researchers feel that creativity is a complex phenomenon whose study is further complicated by the plasticity of the language we use to describe it. We can describe not just the agent of creativity as "creative" but also the product and the method. Consequently, it could be claimed that it is unrealistic to speak of a general theory of creativity. Nonetheless, some generative principles are more general than others, leading some advocates to claim that certain computational approaches are "general theories". Stephen Thaler, for instance, proposes that certain modalities of neural networks are generative enough, and general enough, to manifest a high degree of creative capabilities. Criticism of computational creativity Traditional computers, as mainly used in the computational creativity application, do not support creativity, as they fundamentally transform a set of discrete, limited domain of input parameters into a set of discrete, limited domain of output parameters using a limited set of computational functions. As such, a computer cannot be creative, as everything in the output must have been already present in the input data or the algorithms. Related discussions and references to related work are captured in work on philosophical foundations of simulation. Mathematically, the same set of arguments against creativity has been made by Chaitin. Similar observations come from a Model Theory perspective. All this criticism emphasizes that computational creativity is useful and may look like creativity, but it is not real creativity, as nothing new is created, just transformed in well-defined algorithms. According to researchers like Mark Riedl, human creativity and computational creativity at their current state differ in several dimensions. While creativity can be viewed in the context of morality, Riedl considers the "educational, moralizing" aspect of stories as one of the challenges to developing narrative-generating AI models, which may contribute to the underlying reasoning coherence of the text. The lack of intention in AI models hinders them from making morally responsible choices, which often appear in human creativity. Michele Loi and Eleonora Vigano identified some potential threats to human creativity caused by AI development. For example, they considered the openness to "experiments of life," introduced by John Stuart Mill, an important factor in creativity. Society's overreliance on algorithms for making decisions would constrain utility functions, which may discourage people from exploring riskier solutions and decrease the diversity of exploration and thus the creativity.
