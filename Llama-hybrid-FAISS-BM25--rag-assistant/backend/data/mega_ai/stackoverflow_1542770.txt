How to create a solution that limits user storage in an app?

I can't figure out a good solution for limiting the storage amount a user may access with his files. In the application users are allowed to upload a limit amount of files. The limitation is based on total file size. I.e. a user might be allowed to store 50 Mb on the server. This number is stored in a database so that it can be easily increased/decreased. The language used is PHP, but I guess the solution isn't depended on the scripting language. Very sorry if the question is unclear. I don't really know what to ask for more than a strategy to implement. Thanks!
