Questions about neural networks ability

Is it possible to increase the number of hidden layers and decrease the number of connections without losing the learning ability? More clearly, do a 3 hidden-layer network with 2 connections between each adjacent layer and 2 hidden-layer network with 3 connections between each adjacent layer have the same or similar ability? THX.
