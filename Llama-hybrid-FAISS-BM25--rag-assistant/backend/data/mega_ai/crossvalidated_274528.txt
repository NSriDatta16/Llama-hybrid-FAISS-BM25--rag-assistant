The usual way to do posterior predictive model checks is to first create posterior predictive simulations by 1000x: Draw parameters from the posterior Calculate model predictions based on these parameters Simulate from the stochastic process assumed by the model (in your case likely binomial) Once you have these "posterior predictive simulations", which essentially cover the range of values you would expect if the model were true, you can check where the observed values fall within this distribution (some people call these values Bayesian p-values). This is explained in the vignette of the DHARMa package . You can do the calculation by hand, but the package also offers an option to read in posterior predictive simulations created by Jags, see here .
