Always choosing Repeated CV instead of fold CV

To my understanding, Repeated CV gives superior results compared to k fold CV. Is there any case where k fold CV is preferable compared to Repated CV? In particular for Neural Networks, what would be the preferable choice? I use R and caret package Regards, Ioannis
