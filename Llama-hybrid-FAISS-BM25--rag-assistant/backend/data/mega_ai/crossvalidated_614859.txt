It looks like you are correct. They make the same mistake on the formula for a 3D-CNN. These appear to be misquoted/mis-copied from their cited reference, Ji et al.'s 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Crop Classification with Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Images , who show the 2D convolutional operation as: $$y_{cd}=\sigma\left(\sum_{n=0}^N\sum_{i=0}^M\sum_{j=0}^M w_{ij,n}x_{(c+i)(d+j),n}+b\right)$$ and the 3D convolutional operation as: $$y_{cde}=\sigma\left(\sum_{n=0}\sum_{k=0}^N\sum_{i=0}^M\sum_{j=0}^M w_{kij,n}x_{(c+i)(d+j)(e+k),n}+b\right)$$
