JAXB XJC compiler disregarding mixed=true on XML Schema documents

XJC seems to be completely ignoring mixed="true" on my XML Schema elements thereby not allowing me to extract text content. From the sample XML below, I need to be able to extract "Title Text." Without mixed="true" being recognized, no accessor is created nor is it unmarshalled from XML: Title Text Here's a complete but minimized schema that demonstrates the problem: Note that in the above I have mixed="true". Despite that, the generated schema fragment doesn't contain a reference to it, nor does the generated class use the XmlMixed annotation, nor a value or contents accessor: /** * Java class for ST complex type. * * The following schema fragment specifies the expected content contained within this class. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * */ @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD) @XmlType(name = "ST") public class ST extends ED { } Why is XJC / JAXB completely disregarding my mixed content fields? I have tried both JAXB 2.1 and JAXB 2.2 but only trivial differences are present in the generated code. Note : I can't change the schema as the actual schema is a standards-compliant healthcare (HL7) schema.
