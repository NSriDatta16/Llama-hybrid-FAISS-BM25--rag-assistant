chess board in java

This is my code below import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; public class board2 { JFrame frame; JPanel squares[][] = new JPanel[8][8]; public board2() { frame = new JFrame("Simplified Chess"); frame.setSize(500, 500); frame.setLayout(new GridLayout(8, 8)); for (int i = 0; i I am trying to create a chess game sort of and I need help with putting labels on all sides of the board to label the rows and columns in either A-H or 1-8. I have no idea how to do it. Also later on I'll be adding a feature to drag and drop the pieces. Is it best to use JLabels? Anyways I would I go about putting the labels on the side? Thanks!
