I believe the key is that when the filter is convolving some part of the image (the "receptive field") each number in the filter (i.e. each weight) is first flattened into vector format . Likewise, the pixels of the image are also flattened into vector format . THEN, the dot product is calculated. Which is the exact same thing as finding the sum of the element-by-element (element-wise) multiplication. Of course, these flattened vectors can also be combined in a matrix format, as the below image shows. In this case then true matrix multiplication can be used, but it's important to note that the flattening the image pixels from each convolution and also the weights filter is the precursor. image credit: TensorFlow and Deep Learning without a PhD, Part 1 (Google Cloud Next '17)
