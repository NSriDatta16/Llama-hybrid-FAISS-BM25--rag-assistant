Do you need to store entire training set when using RBF kernel?

When you use a model that has been trained based on the RBF (Gaussian) kernel, do you need to store the entire training dataset to compute similarity features? If so, why doesn't this decrease the efficiency of RBF SVMs, since you have your data to "carry around" on top of the weights? Or do you pick the training data whose similarity functions correspond to the largest weights and only keep them? I'm still trying to figure out what SVMs are so please let me know if the question doesn't make sense.
