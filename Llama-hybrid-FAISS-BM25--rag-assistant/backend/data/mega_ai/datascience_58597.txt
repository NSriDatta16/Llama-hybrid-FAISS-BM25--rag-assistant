Why models performs better If normalize test data and train data separately?

Many threads (and courses) such as this and this one suggest that you should apply normalization to the test data using the parameters used in the training set. But other some discussions I've found like this one and this one that suggest that applying the normalization to the test set is not really required and it might depends on many factors such as the model used for training or the nature of the test data. Now, personally, I am more inclined towards applying the normalization on test data as well. But the problem is this: I am working on a neural network model where: If I apply normalization using the recommended way I get 79% accuracy, (and to be honest it's not interesting for me) If apply normalization on training and testing in a separate way, I get really good results 85% (and sometimes more) and the further steps I try to do next work better as well. So, I don't know what my neural network performs better on test unseen data if I use the second method. I really I want continue using the second method for this particular model , but I don't feel good about it and feels like it's wrong or cheating . Now, I have one last argument. The last link I provided, have one answer that says this: "..This is all dependent on size of data sets & whether both train and test are equally representative of the domain you are trying to model. If you have thousands of data points and the test set is fully representative of the training set (hard to prove) then either method will be fine..." The dataset I use is a refined version of its predecessor ( NSL-KDD dataset ). The authors said " There is no duplicate records in the proposed test sets " and that they have removed any redundant values. So I feel, this dataset is uniform and the test set actually representative according to the authors. So can I use the second approach? Ps: Sorry if this is long, it's a research ethics thing. I will follow the approach you guys recommend.
