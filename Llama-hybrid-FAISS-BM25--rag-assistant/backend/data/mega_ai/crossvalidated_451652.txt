I think the problem is not with glmer or with brms . Instead it is with performance::icc . Having used this before, it is a handy function but seems to break down once you have more complicated structures as yours. You will need to calculate your ICCs the old fashioned way, and with a cross-classified model, you have a few different ICCs. We can just use the glmer output for this, although you can do the same with brms , just make sure to square the standard deviation estimates of the random effects: > summary(model.glmer) Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) ['glmerMod'] Family: binomial ( logit ) Formula: SocialNetworkD ~ 1 + (1 | MSOA) + (1 | Sector) Data: dataICC Control: glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa") AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 5200.3 5219.2 -2597.2 5194.3 4043 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.1506 -1.0012 0.5633 0.7938 1.6456 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

Although I'm not positive about that given I'm not totally sure what assumption performance::ICC makes about the level 1 residual in a binomial/Bernoulli GLMM. I am went with the latent formuation for the variance at level 1, $\pi^2/3$ because otherwise calculating an ICC is difficult. For more information, see StasK's answer to this question . Note that the glmer variances are somewhat similar to the estimates you get from brms if you convert them to a variance with brms giving a larger estimate for sector. Obviously they are different in that brms is reporting on a distribution of variances, but if you look at the mean estimate, it's in the ballpark: Group-Level Effects: ~MSOA (Number of levels: 2339) Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS sd(Intercept) 0.28 0.11 0.04 0.48 1.01 424 552 ~Sector (Number of levels: 13) Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS sd(Intercept) 0.69 0.17 0.45 1.09 1.00 1296 1819 BTW, I saw a similar pattern of estimates of the variance when using MCMC methods from rstanarm and R2MLwiN . The MCMC procedures tend to give greater variation to sector than maximum likelihood.
