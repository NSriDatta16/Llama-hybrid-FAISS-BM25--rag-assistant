I am not sure if .NET allows loading assemblies from paths that are not relative to the main executable path. So, I think that this is not allowed: D:\myExeFolderFullPath\main.exe D:\myDLLFolderFullPath\Mydll.dll ...while this should work: D:\myExeFolderFullPath\main.exe D:\myExeFolderFullPath\myDLLFolderFullPath\Mydll.dll Update: I had a similar problem with paths when working on the mygeneration project. The only way I found to get it running was to reorganize the folder structure I described in this answer.
