NCover 1.5.8 / NCoverExplorer 1.4.0.7 manual exclusions are very flaky

I haven't yet installed my license of NCover 3, and am still running 1.5.8 on my build server. I am trying to exclude full assemblies and specific classes that I don't want included in the report, because they are artificially lowering the coverage results. In NCoverExplorer, I was playing around with the options because there is a coverage exclusions section in the Options tab where you can specify full namespaces. I've entered the fully qualified classes, and for some reason, only a handful of them get excluded, and I cannot figure out why. For example, when I add System.ComponentModel.Composition to the list, it never gets excluded! Is this just a bug in 1.5.8 that I have to live with for now, since it is a beta and also no longer supported? Although I do have a new license for the server, I'd like to be able to do some coverage at home on my personal computer. I found a really great article on using a CoverageExcludeAttribute to make NCover automatically skip those classes / methods that are marked with this attribute. Is this the best option?
