Multiple series autocorrelation without overlap between series

Data is organized in the following way: Group 1 of items A, B, C, group 2 of items D, E, F. Each item has an associate value, let's assume A(1), B(2), C(3), D(10), E(11), F(12). I want to show/ask whether items within a group are more correlated with each other than with items outside the group. This reminds me of autocorrelation in space/time like Moran's I. I thought to generate two columns for a single Pearson correlation, comparing each item to other items within its group, i.e. A:B, A:C, B:A, B:C, C:A, C:B, D:E, D:F, E:D, E:F, F:D, F:E. I'm not concerned with the influence of group size on the group's 'weight' but maybe there are other issues.
