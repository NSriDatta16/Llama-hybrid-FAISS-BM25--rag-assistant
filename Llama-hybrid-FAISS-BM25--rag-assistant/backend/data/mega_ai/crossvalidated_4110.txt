I'm new here, and perhaps "financial time series" has a specific definition... But given that I don't know it, my question for you would be what you mean: quarterly/monthly economic data, daily market prices, hourly or higher-frequency data, etc? And by "modeling", do you mean working with textbook ARIMA/ARCH solutions, or things a bit more exotic (such as dynamic linear systems), or exotic/custom experimentation? R is flexible and free, though less GUI-fied than most. It also has packages covering everything from daily stock prices to dynamic linear systems and optimization packages. (In fact, the hard part will be deciding which time series and which financial packages to use.) GRETL is free and has a reasonable GUI, though it's econometric, not really daily market oriented. I've heard of Oxmetrics, which appears to have a very complete every-possible-variant-of-ARCH package available for it. If you're talking monthly/quarterly economic data, you could also use X12-ARIMA, which is a benchmark of sorts. I've used all kinds of GUIs for programming/processing data, but for some reason RapidMiner's never really clicked with me. Something strange about its workflow that I've just never gotten.
