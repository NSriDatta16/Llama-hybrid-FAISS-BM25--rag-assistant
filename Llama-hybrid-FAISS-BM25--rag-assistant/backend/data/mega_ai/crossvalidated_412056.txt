Picking from Logistic vs Survival Model

I have a health data set for measuring the effectiveness of a drug. (Age, Gender(0,1), Morbidity(1,2,3), Dosage(0,1), Group (a,b), Effect (Not effective =0, effective = 1), and Time (days needed for drug to work if Effect = 1, Days observed until subject left the study if Effect =0), and I'm being asked to predict Effect. Obviously, Time is better if it's lower. My general recollection with survival models using right censored data is that "longer" or "bigger" Time is better. (I'm remembering my GLM class from 2005 in undergrad.) Should I be using Logistic Regression or a Survival Model? Are there other types I should consider? If I were to be predicting Time, would a linear regression model or a Tobit model be appropriate? Thank you in advance for any help. I've hosted my data here if anyone wants to poke at it.
