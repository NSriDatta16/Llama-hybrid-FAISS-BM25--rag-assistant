Accelerated C++ is your best bet. editorializing note: I've gone through an enormous amount of intro C++ books. There is so much drek out there, it's mind-blowing. I think Accelerated C++ is pretty concise and lucid. It has the disadvantage of being short, so it can't be used as monitor-lifting fodder. I didn't know about it at the time and I went through piles of other books. Jesse Liberty's C++ in 24 hours was the most useful of the books I found when I was learning. Looking back on it, that's sort of surprising, given the X in Y hours reputation.
