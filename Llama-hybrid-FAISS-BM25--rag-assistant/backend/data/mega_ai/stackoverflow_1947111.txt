Two things. First, according to your code, in the moviePlayBackDidFinish method you must first release the moviePlayer and then instantiate it again with an alloc. You must do that every time you want to play a video. MPMoviePlayerController *moviePlayer = [notification object]; [moviePlayer release] ... MPMoviePlayerController *newMoviePlayer = [[MPMoviePlayerController alloc] initWithContentURL: anURL]; The structure of your code works, but I think you should better have a look at the example provided by apple: http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/samplecode/MoviePlayer_iPhone/index.html Second, about the overlay, you are right, the overlay gets the events but you cannot put it under the movie player controls. What you have to do is to use the events you receive in your overlay to control the player. You could use touchesBegan event to pass the initial touch event and use it with the player (play, pause, stop).
