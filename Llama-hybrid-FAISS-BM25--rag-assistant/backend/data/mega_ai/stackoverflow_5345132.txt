Sys.setlocale: request to set locale ... cannot be honored

I'm using strptime(...) in a function of my package. I need to parse a string using specific local settings and used Sys.setlocale as a workaround to get english localization settings. To reduce side effects, the previous local setting is restored afterwards. The basic code fragment of the function looks as follows: #parameter settings sometext Unfortunately, a colleague of mine gets the following warning when using this function: In Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "en_GB.UTF-8") : OS reports request to set locale to "en_GB.UTF-8" cannot be honored On my computer everything works fine. Is there a better (and independent from installed R localization) way of performing this task? Generally I would like to use strptime as it allows a very flexible way of parsing datetime strings.
