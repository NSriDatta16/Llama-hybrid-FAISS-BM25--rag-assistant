The $P(A)$ you're looking for is already in the formula, in the form of $P(A|B)P(B)$. The Bayesian network has A dependent on B, and W and G both dependent on A. We can get the overall probability of A using the chain rule to compute $P(A|B)P(B)$. Then, the chain rule is applied again to get $P(W)$ and $P(G)$ from $P(W|A)P(G|A)P(A)$
