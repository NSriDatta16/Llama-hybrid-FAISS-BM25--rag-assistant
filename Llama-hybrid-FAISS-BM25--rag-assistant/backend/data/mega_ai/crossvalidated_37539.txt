I'm not sure if I agree with your statement about better interpretation for PCA when applied to iid variables. Normality helps because for normal rv's, variance is the natural measure of dispersion, but the iid condition isn't really necessary. When you don't have normal random variables, you can try Hubert et al's Robust PCA for skewed data: Hubert et al.: "Robust PCA for skewed data and its outlier map"
