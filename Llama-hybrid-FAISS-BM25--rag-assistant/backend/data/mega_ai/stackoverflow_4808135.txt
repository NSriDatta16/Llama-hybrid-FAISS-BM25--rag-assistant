When you find the queue in disabled state and you enable back the queue, I assume that the processing resumes successfully and the 'poison message' situation does not reproduce. This would indicate that the cause is transient or time related. It could be a SQL Agent job that is running and causes deadlocks with the queue processing, forcing the queue processing to rollback. Deadlocks are in my experience the most typical poison message cause. Your best forensics tool is the system event log, as the activated procedure does output errors into the ERRORLOG and hence into the system Event Log. Whenever a queue is disabled by the poison message trigger (5 consecutive rollbacks) an event notification of type QUEUE_DISABLED is fired. You can capture more forensic information in the handling this event, as it will run shortly after the moment the queue was disabled. As a side note, you can never have true 'poison message handling'. Whenever you enhance the processing to handle some error cases, the definition of the 'poison message' changes to be the message capable of disabling the new error handling .
