Unless you have a very bizarre situation, what you've described isn't really possible. PHP is evaluated on the server, while Javascript is sent to the user agent and executed by its Javascript engine (on the client side). No user agents that I know of contain a PHP engine, so there's no way to have PHP executed on the client side. Besides, unless you're use some heinous escapes, the PHP will be executed by the server anyway before the Javascript is sent to the client. In the latter example you give, the PHP gets evaluated on the server and the client is sent a Javascript file that looks exactly like: $(document).ready(function() { var foo = 'bar'; alert(foo); }); So there's no PHP contained within the Javascript; rather, you're dynamically generating (normal) Javascript via PHP. If this latter is what you intended, then yes - this works fine. The PHP engine doesn't know anything about Javascript, and just generates some text that happens to have a particular meaning to a JS-parsing client. So the presence of Javascript doesn't change anything on the PHP side, and since it's processed out, the (previous) presence of PHP doesn't change anything on the Javascript side. (If you wanted your Javascript to execute some PHP on the client, however, that's fundamentally not possible.)
