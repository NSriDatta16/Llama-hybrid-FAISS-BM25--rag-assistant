One thing that comes to mind is lack of the SQL tools in the express versions, such as the Server Explorer ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cd2cz7yy.aspx ). I am not sure if you can effectively do LINQ to SQL or LINQ to Entities without it. On that note, I strongly encourage the full version of Visual Studio 2008 Professional. I know that since you are using the express versions, you qualify for the upgrade price for Visual Studio 2008 Professional. On a side note: the Expression products are more geared for designers, not coders.
