With XSLT 2.0 you can model any data type you want to. As example: A B C With any input, output: B In XSLT 1.0 there is not Temporaly Result Tree data type. There is a Result Tree Fragment data type that does not allow node-set operator. So, the only way to go is with extensions functions: in this case node-set() from EXSLT (MSXSL has a built-in node-set() extension, also). So, in XSLT 1.0 without extensions you can have only inline data model, or by params or by external document. As example: A B C Result, with any input: B Only if you want to, I can provide you a XSLT 1.0 plus extensions example (It's not standar...)
