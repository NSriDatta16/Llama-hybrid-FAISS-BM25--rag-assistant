I applaud you for thinking of thinking of ease of use. However, looking at your example, cleaning the input like this is a bad idea. You're assuming that you, as the programmer, know what the user meant to enter when they enter something invalid. This is not possible. You're better off using the tried-and-true method of displaying a helpful, friendly message from a standard validator, such as a Regular Expression Validator. You have to assume that if the user entered the wrong thing, they either Mis-typed Didn't understand the input requirements Intentionally entered domething malicious looking for improper validation and hunting for vulnerabilities in your software in a preliminary investigation before attempting to hack it. For options 1 or 3, you're better off giving a helpful message to the user and having them re-type the input. For option 3, you'd be encouraging a potential attacker by not using best practices.
