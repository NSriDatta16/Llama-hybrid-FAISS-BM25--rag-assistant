flex doesn't seem to bind with custom actionscript object

I have a custom actionscript object defined as bindable with a number of public properties. [Bindable] public class MyObject extends Object { public var mobileNumber:String; ... In my mxml I have: My issue is that when I enter a new value in the field for mobile number and then click the save button, the value typed is not logged out... i.e.: public function write():void { var bytes:ByteArray = new ByteArray(); trace("write - mobile:" + this.mobileNumber); bytes.writeObject(this); EncryptedLocalStore.setItem(KEY, bytes); } I also tried adding in: private function init():void { BindingUtils.bindProperty(mobileNumberText, "text", obj, "mobileNumber"); } but no luck with that either. I'm probably missing something simple here, but not sure what it is. Hope you can help, thanks.
