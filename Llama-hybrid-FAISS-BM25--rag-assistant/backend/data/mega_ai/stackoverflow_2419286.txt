Is the constructor for an object invoked after object creation on heap (Java)?

When you instantiate a new object by calling constructor, i.e. Foo bar = new Foo(var); When does the code in the constructor actually gets invoked in relations to object creation heap? When the constructors modifies member variables of bar, is storage for the variables already allocated and contain default values?
