Think of it like this - Suppose you have a population of 1000 students and you want their average height ̅X. So, you go and take a sample of 20 students and measure their height and take the average (μ). Chances that μ will be true representative of the population average height (X) is low. But if you repeat the process 100 times and take the average of all the 100 averages (average of the sampling distribution) then it will be unbiased estimation of the population height i.e.true representative of the sample population. Now coming to your question - The objective of creating test set is to get an idea of error rate on unseen data to determine if the model is over-fitting. Similar to my above example, if you run just one model and use that to estimate error on test set, it might not be true representative of the actual test error. So, you run many models and calculate the average error. This error will be true representative of the actual test error and whether or not this error is large you can determine whether the model is over-fitting or not.
