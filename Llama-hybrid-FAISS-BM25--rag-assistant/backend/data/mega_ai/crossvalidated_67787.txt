I would add a more detailed description of the problem you are trying to solve as your question is very vague. What are you trying to attack with Kriging/Gaussian process regression? Any clue on the nature of your problem could really help you get a better answer. Anyway, you could basically use some of a wide array of non-parametric machine learning algorithms. For example: CART, random forest, boosted regression trees, etc. Even though you don't want to specify an explicit model, you do have a problem of the form: $Y:=X_{1}+X_{2}+X_{3}$. You can fit any of these models to your data, for example, fitting random forest in R would go something like this: fittedmodel The random forest R implementation has more parameters to play with, but in general is a model that requires little tuning so just using the defaults as I am doing here can give acceptable results. What are you doing this for? if you want to interpolate a map, you can then use this trained model on your unlabelled observations, that simply must have values for the independent variables ($X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$): interpolation Also, if you are interpolating a map, introducing the coordinates as independent variables is sometimes quite helpful.
