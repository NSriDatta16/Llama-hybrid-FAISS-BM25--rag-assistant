Java DnD - Java Component to .Net Component

I'm trying to use Java drag and drop to drag an object from a JTree into a native .NET component that is embedded in my app. This .NET component only accepts File objects, so I'm having trouble with the DnD's Transferable object. Anyone know how I can make this Transferable "look" like a file to this .Net component? p.s. I need this answer as Quickly as possible. Thanks!
