The HTML specification never specifies any content formats. That's not its job. There's plenty of standards organizations that are more qualified than the W3C to specify video formats. That's what content negotiation is for. The HTML specification doesn't specify any image formats for the element. The HTML specification doesn't specify any style sheet languages for the element. The HTML specification doesn't specify any scripting languages for the element. The HTML specification doesn't specify any object formats for the and embed elements. The HTML specification doesn't specify any audio formats for the element. Why should it specify one for the element?
