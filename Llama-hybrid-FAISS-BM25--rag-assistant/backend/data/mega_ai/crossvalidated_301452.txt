So it seems that you have two separate problems and each needs separate solutions The first is how to combine observational and RCT data the second is how to use information on multiple dosages to infer effectiveness of one particular dosage Lets see the first: There are multiple ways to combine observational and RCT data most of which can be found at this paper: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.7223/abstract the authors provide also code to do each approach and their relative merits. Keep in mind that if you choose to use Priors you would need a Bayesian approach. with regards to the second problem: Combining multiple dosages is not straight forward. If you have a big network and the interventions can be categorized in classes, e.g. based on the molecular pathway of function, then you can apply a three-level Hierarchical model, with a Random Effect within each class. In your case a class may be a particular drug of different dosages and the assumption would the exchangeability across different dosages of the same drug. see this paper for example http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301514047317 . Another approach would be to do some model-based work where you assign either a dose-responnse non-linear Emax model, but a simpler linear may work too. For example see this paper http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psp4.12091/full Finally , you could even try to some random walk, where the effect of each dosage is more likely to be similar to the effects of adjacent dosages
