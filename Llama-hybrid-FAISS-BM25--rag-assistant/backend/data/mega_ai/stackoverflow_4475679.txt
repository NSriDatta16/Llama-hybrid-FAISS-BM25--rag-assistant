Yes. In fact, Microsoft was so nice as to make this a built-in option in Visual Studio. Look up the "My Documents\Visual Studio 20XX\autoexp.cs" for some examples of how you apply the DebuggerDisplay attribute to types that are foreign to your assembly. Then, add some of your own, recompile it and replace the autoexp.dll, and restart Visual Studio. It should Just Work. For reference, see the yellow "Note" paragraph in this MSDN article Alternatively: I'm the creator of a purchasable extension to Visual Studio that enables doing this with a lot less fuss, without even needing to have to stop the debugging session.
