This one is a "must read" position and also very readable: Robert, C. & Casella, G. (2004). Monte Carlo Statistical Methods. Springer. This two introduce the topic with examples of code in R what I personally found very helpful: Robert, C. & Casella, G. (2009). Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R. Springer. Suess, E.A. & Trumbo, B.E. (2010). Introduction to Probability Simulation and Gibbs Sampling with R. Springer.
