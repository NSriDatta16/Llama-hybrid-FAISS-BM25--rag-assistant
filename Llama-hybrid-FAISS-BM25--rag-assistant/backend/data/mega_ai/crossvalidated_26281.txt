Visualization of an ensemble of sequences

What are the standard techniques of plotting a statistical ensemble of sequences? I know the chaos game representation: H. Joel Jeffrey (1992), Chaos game visualization of sequences . Computers & Graphics 16 (1): 25-33. and two-dimensional plots: H.C. Lee Hao and Shu-yu Zhang (2000). Fractals related to long dna sequences and complete genomes . Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 11:825, free pdf . J. Rodriguez-Laguna, PM, M. Ibáñez Berganza, M. Lewenstein, G. Sierra (2011). Qubism: self-similar visualization of many-body wavefunctions , arXiv:1112.3560 [quant-ph]. Are there any others? Edit: I am the most interested in finite alphabets (say, of the order of 2 to 9), with no internal structure and with sequences of any length (also infinite; but in practice 8-18 letters are fine for me). However, other approaches are welcome as well.
