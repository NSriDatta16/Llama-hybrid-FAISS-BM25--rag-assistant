'City climate twins': similarity measure for monthly temperature data

Cities are getting hotter due to climate change. I want to communicate this intuitively through a concept of 'city climate twins': ie. which other city will my city's climate resemble several decades from now? Available data: (1) monthly average temperatures for a set of global cities: present-day reference period (eg. 2000-2019). (2) monthly average temperatures for a set of global cities: future climate projections (eg. 2040-2059, high emissions scenario) See table and charts below for the data format. Take the city of interest ("City A" - eg. London). I want to take City A's future monthly temperature profile , compare it to the current monthly temperature profiles of all other citie s, and select the most similar ones . Example: "London currently has a mild climate but it's getting hotter. By 2050, projections suggest that its climate will be similar to Rome or Madrid today." Questions: Easiest option: How can I get a suitable measure (and ranking) of similarness for these temperature profiles? (preferably something I can implement easily in Python) Slightly more complex option: How could I approach this if I included more variables, eg. monthly precipitation as well as temperature? Thank you!
