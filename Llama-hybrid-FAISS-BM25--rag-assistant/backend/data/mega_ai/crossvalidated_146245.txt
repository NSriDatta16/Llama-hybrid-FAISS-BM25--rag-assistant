Your answer makes little sense. You're NOT comparing directly the ammio acid or nucleotides. You're trying to conduct a differential expression test of two experiments. The dependent variable is the abundance of each RNA sample and the values are integers. Comparing directly the ammio acid or nucleotides is more like pairwise alignment, but this has nothing to do what you're trying to do. Let's get back to the test. You could use a t-test to test for the differences, but it's not recommended. Not that it's invalid, the sample sizes in a medical research is small, so a simple t-test gives little power. We typically use other statistical tests. I don't know which one is the best because this depends on your data and assumptions. I have been using the edgeR bioconductor package which models a negative-binomial GLM. I've also seen other bioinformatic packages using F-test. Read http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/edgeR/inst/doc/edgeRUsersGuide.pdf for more details. Pay close attention to "2.7 Negative binomial models" section. Read http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC154570/pdf/gb-2003-4-4-210.pdf on why a t-test isn't recommended.
