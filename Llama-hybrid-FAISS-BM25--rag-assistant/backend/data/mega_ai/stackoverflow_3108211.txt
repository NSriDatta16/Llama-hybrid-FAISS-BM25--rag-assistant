how to both Compress and Minify content together?

i know we can compress response by declaring Response.Filter as GZip or Delfalte streams, but how i can perform both compression and minification together? declaring new class that inherits Stream, then first performing minify on content, then compress that by GZip or Deflate depending on User-Agent supported each?
