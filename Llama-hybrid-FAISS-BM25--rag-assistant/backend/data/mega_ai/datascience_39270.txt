You have to do binary classification. Here is how in Keras: Organize your dataset so that it looks like a matrix or a pandas dataframe : Outcome is going to be the label vector and the matrix without fight id and Outcome is going to be the features of the dataset. Divide the dataset in train and test, for example with scikit learn train_test_split Build a simple model with Keras model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=4, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu')) model.add(Dropout(0.2)) model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'] Train it: model.fit(train_x, train_y, epochs= 2, batch_size = 500, validation_data = (test_x, test_y))
