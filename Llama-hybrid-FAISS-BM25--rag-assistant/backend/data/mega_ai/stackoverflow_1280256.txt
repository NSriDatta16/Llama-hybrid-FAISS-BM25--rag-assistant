Well, you don't go into a lot of detail about what you did, but I can give you an optimization that can be used, if you didn't think of it... If you're using the straightforward method of trying to find factors of a number n, by using the mod operator, you don't need to check all the numbers For example: say n is 15. We loop, and try 1 first. Yep, the mod checks out, so it's a factor. We divide n by the factor to get the conjugate value, so we do (15 / 1) = 15...so 15 is a factor. We try 2 next. Nope. Then 3. Yep, which also gives us (15 / 3) = 5. And we're done, because 4 is > floor(sqrt(n)). Quick! If you didn't think of it, that might be something you could leverage to improve your times...overall you go from O(n) to O(sqrt (n)) which is pretty good (though for numbers this small, constants may still weigh heavily.)
