Find number of distinct values in a specific column in a Rails find

I am doing a find in Rails model as follows: @jobs = Job.find(:all, :conditions => ["job_id = ?", params[:id]]) The result of this query also brings back data from an associated model JobResponses (there are multiple JobResponses for each Job record). Once I have the JobResponse results I am calculating a number of different averages/medians etc for each set of Job results. One of the columns returned in the JobResponses is company_id - so therefore I might get back 10 job responses (4 from Company A, 2 from Company B, 2 from Company C and 1 each from Company D & E) - 5 distinct companies. How can I calculate/display the number of distinct companies that returned a result for JobResponses?
