Because you cannot know the exact implementation of the browser (except for closed user groups like for your business intranet) I would generally consider the RNG weak. Even if you can identify the browser you don't know if the browser itself or any other browser's agent ID is manipulated. If you can you should generate the number on the server. Even if you include a good PRNG in your JavaScript your server cannot know whether the request from the client originates from an unmodified script. If the number goes into your database and/or is used as a cryptographic tool it is no good idea to trust the data from the client at all. That is true not only for validity ( You do validate all data coming from the client, don't you? ) but also for general properties like randomness.
