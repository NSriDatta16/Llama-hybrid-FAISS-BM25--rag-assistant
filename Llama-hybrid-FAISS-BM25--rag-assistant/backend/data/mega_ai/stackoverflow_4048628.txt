Practicality, a "Relation" in relational model can be considered as a "Table" in actual RDBMS products(Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, etc), and "Tuples" in a relation can also be considered as "Rows" or "Records" in a table. The only difference between them is that Relation is a set of tuples and Table is a bag of records. As a set, relation disallows duplicate elements(tuples) and all tuples in it are unordered, but the records in table may be repeated and are always in a particular sequence for both physical storage and human-readable display. And there are two similar terms which often cause confusion and misunderstanding in database area. Please notice them: the "Relationship" in E/R model and the "Relation" in relational model is absolutely different. When converting an E/R model into a relational model, both entities and relationships in the former are represented ( with a little different structure ) as relations(tables) in the latter. And the association("reference" or "relationship" also be used) between tables, actually is known as foreign key, is still different with the relationship between entities. More precisely, you may want to distinguish a relation and a relation variable (relvar). A relation is an abstract structure which contains a set of attributes, and a relvar is the dataset status in a particular moment of this relation. The first one can be considered as the table definition with columns, and the second one is dataset in this table. (Think about Type vs Variable in C or any other procedural programming language and Class vs Object in OOP.) Following are corresponding terms between relation theory and database practice: Relation Table Tuple Record, Row Attribute Column, Field Domain of attribute Datatype of column
