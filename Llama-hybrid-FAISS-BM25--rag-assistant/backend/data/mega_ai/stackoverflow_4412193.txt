Does my usecase require XNA or can I use silverlight (Windows Phone 7)?

I'm new to .net programming in general and windows phone 7 specifically (I'm a Java guy). I'm writing an application for a windows phone 7 workshop in my university which has a semi augmented reality mode. (semi because win-pho7 does not allow the camera feed). Mainly I will need to render overlay of various images across a background (which should have been the camera feed) as a result of pitch, yaw and gps changes (which I subscribe to). I'm trying to understand whether I need to use XNA, as this seems to me as a graphics demanding task and that is what we were explained XNA is for, or I can use silverlight which seems a bit more simple to develop for with the draggabale controls and all. I hope my question makes since, if not please ask and I'll supply more clarifications. Thanks, Ittai Update: I'm mainly trying to understand if rendering around 20 2D images, which will be re-rendered based on the above events, is something silverlight can handle or does it require xna (as it is too demanding graphics wise)? If someone has experience with these issues I'd like to hear. Last update (hopefully): The main thing I'm concerned with is silverlight's ability to handle the screen refreshing, sort of speak. Seeing as this is an augmented reality application and whenever the user moves the phone I need to adjust the overlayed images , nothing complicated just move them a few pixel offsets up/down/left/right but still there is something to be done. I'm concerned that trying to apply those small but frequent changes to the images will turn out to be a problem? And seeing as these are two different implementation paths I don't think this qualifies as premature optimization. As I think you can easily understand I'd rather user silverlight I'm just not sure it can handle it. Thanks a lot for reading all the updates, Ittai
