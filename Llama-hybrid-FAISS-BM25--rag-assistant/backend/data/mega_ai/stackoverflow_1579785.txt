There are much more elegant, OO ways to write this. My recommendation would be to make less() a non-static member function of the TN class. That way, if the tree's root node is called root , you just call root.less() . Each call to less() will then call left.less() and right.less() . Since you posted example code that wouldn't even compile, I'm wondering if you're using an IDE, or even tried to compile your class using javac . I strongly recommend getting Eclipse, Netbeans, or another IDE if you're new to Java.
