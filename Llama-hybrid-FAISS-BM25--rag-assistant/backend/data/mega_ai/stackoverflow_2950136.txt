The paragraph is a block level element and will force itself to be on a new line after the last element and force the next element to be on a new line. if you want the link on the left (you have a float :left on the anchor) try floating the paragraph to the right. try div.footer p{ ... float:right; } see http://jsfiddle.net/2PXt6/1/ if you want the anchor to float to the right of the paragraph, move the anchor to be before the paragraph and put a float: right on the anchore tag. EDIT: To have the anchor on the Right have the anchor first in the html and float:right see http://jsfiddle.net/2PXt6/4/ if you do not want to change the html, float the paragraph to the left and the anchor to the left. see http://jsfiddle.net/2PXt6/5/
