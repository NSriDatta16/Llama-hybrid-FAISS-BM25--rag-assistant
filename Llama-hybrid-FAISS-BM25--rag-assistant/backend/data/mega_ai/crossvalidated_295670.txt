What you want is called Gini coefficient . While it was created to measure economic inequality, it was used as the evaluation metric of a machine learning competition in a Kaggle featuring a regression task . It shares properties with the AUC. For example, it's only concerned with the ordering of the outcomes, not their actual value. High Gini means high homogeneity between the ranks of the predictions and the actual values. In the case of a dichotomous outcome, it's equivalent to $\text{Gini}=2\cdot \text{AUC}-1$ .
