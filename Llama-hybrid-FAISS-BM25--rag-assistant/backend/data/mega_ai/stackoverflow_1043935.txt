You might also want to add this line if you are setting the max age that far out : // Summary: // Sets Cache-Control: public to specify that the response is cacheable // by clients and shared (proxy) caches. Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); I do a lot of response header manip with documents and images from a file handler that processes requests for files the are saved in the DB. Depending on your goal you can really force the browsers the cache almost all of you page for days locally ( if thats what u want/need ). edit: I also think you might be setting the max age wrong... Response.Cache.SetMaxAge(new TimeSpan(dt.Ticks - DateTime.Now.Ticks )); this line set is to 30 min cache time on the local browser [max-age=1800] As for the 2x Cache Control lines... you might want to check to see if IIS has been set to add the header automatically.
