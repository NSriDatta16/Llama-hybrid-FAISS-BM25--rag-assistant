There is no way to manipulate the values stored in sessions from the client side. That's one of the main reasons you'd use a session over a cookie - YOU control the data. With cookies, the user can manipulate the data. The only way to access/manipulate session data from the client side would be with an Ajax call or other JavaScript mechanism to call another php script, which would be doing the retrieval/manipulation of the session data via the session_ functions.
