Uninformative prior density on normal

Bayesian Data Analysis (p. 64) says, regarding a normal model : a sensible vague prior density for $\mu$ and $\sigma$, assuming prior independence of location and scale parameters, is uniform on $(\mu, \log \sigma)$, or, equivalently, $$ p(\mu, \sigma^2) \propto (\sigma^2)^{-1}. $$ Why is uniform over $p(\mu, \log \sigma)$ equivalent to $p(\mu, \sigma^2) \propto (\sigma^2)^{-1}$? Why is that a "sensible" prior?
