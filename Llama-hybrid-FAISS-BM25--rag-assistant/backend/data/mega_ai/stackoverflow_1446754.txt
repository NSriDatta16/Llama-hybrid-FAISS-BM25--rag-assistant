Any support for foreign keys in CakePHP schema shell or migrations?

I'm new to CakePHP, and I'm trying to decide between the schema shell that comes with CakePHP and the migrations tools that were written by Joel Moss and Georgi Momchilov . So far I haven't found any direct support in either of them for creating foreign key constraints. It appears that you might be able to write raw SQL in a migration to create a foreign key. Have I missed something? Is there support somewhere? Should I even be using foreign keys? I've seen a few comments related to CakePHP or Ruby on Rails saying that foreign key constraints are discouraged. Our database is only used by one application.
