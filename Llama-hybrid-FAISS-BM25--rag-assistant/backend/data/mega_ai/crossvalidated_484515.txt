If we understand the expression "the confidence interval of my evaluation" to mean "a credible range of values for each parameter I infer when I perform logistic regression on training data using the LOO cross validation technique." For a training set with $n$ values of $p$ -dimensional predictors $x_i$ and response $y_i, i=1\ldots n$ , you will perform $n$ calculations of $n$ LOO subsets each with $n-1$ points. For each LOO subset, you will calculate $\hat{\beta}^{(i)}, i=1\dots n$ From this you may find the 2.5 percentile and the 97.5 percentile for each parameter value $\beta_j$ , and report that. These numbers should agree with the frequentist confidence interval that you'd obtain by running the the logistic_regression.fit(model,data,hessian=True) function (in whatever package you are using) with a flag set to return the Hessian matrix. The diagonal elements of the Hessian are roughly equivalent to the inverse variances of the elements of $\beta.$ Then you'd report, e.g., $$ Pr\bigg( |\beta_j-\hat{\beta}_j| where $\nu=n-p-1$ is the degrees of freedom and $p$ is the number of dimensions of the independent variable. But this would require only one logistic regression calculation and no LOO, which seems not to be your interest.
