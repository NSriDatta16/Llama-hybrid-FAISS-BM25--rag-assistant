QlikView OCX problems

I have the "luck" to work with quikview, and I have to control it via the ocx component qlikOCX. I've imported the the OCX component into my (delphi 2009) IDE, and now I can simply drag an TQlikOCX object to my form and use it. Unfortunately, when I do something simple like procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject); begin QlikOCX1.DocName := 'c:\qv\mydoc.qvw'; QlikOCX1.ActiveDocument.ActiveSheet.FitZoomToWindow; end; Delphi throws an unknown EOLEException. When I run the compiled programm outside the IDE, it works. Maybe someone can give me a hint how to debug this, or even knows the TQlikOCX and the issues with it? Many thank!
