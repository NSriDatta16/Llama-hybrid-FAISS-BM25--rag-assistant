It depends what you're trying to do exactly. If you're trying to develop an applet or something in Java, you may still be able to build the site in a PHP-CMS like Drupal, Joomla or Wordpress. It would just be a matter of embedding the applet in a particular page of the site. However, if you're trying to use Java as a server-side language to process and serve content for the website, you're basically rewriting the core of the CMS anyway. In this case, you might as well just pick a good HTML/CSS page template (there's heaps of HTML/CSS, non-CMS templates available online) to build pages from and tell your Java program to return the markup from the template, but modified slightly, with a particular content div containing your generated content (maybe some database records you grabbed in the Java backend). This way your UI is taken care of and you can still do your content processing in Java. Another solution may be to write your application in Java and then develop a PHP plugin for Drupal or similar to form a bridge between the CMS and the application.
