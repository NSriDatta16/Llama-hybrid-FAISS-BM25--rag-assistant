Open Source statistical textbooks?

There have been a few questions about statistical textbooks , such as the question Free statistical textbooks . However, I am looking for textbooks that are Open Source, for example, having an Creative Commons license. The reason is that in course material in other domains, you still want to include some text about basic statistics. In this case, it would be interesting to reuse existing material, instead of rewriting that material. Therefore, what Open Source textbooks on statistics (and perhaps machine learning) are available?
