Perhaps the parameters for your running average are set wrong (sample window too small or large)? Is it just noise superimposed on your bell curve? How close is the noise frequency to that of the signal you're trying to retrieve? A picture of what you're trying to extract might help us identify a solution. You could try some sort of fitting algorithm using a least squares fit if you can make a reasonable guess of the function parameters. Those sorts of techniques often have some immunity to noise.
