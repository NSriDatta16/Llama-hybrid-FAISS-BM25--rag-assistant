How to merge cells in a column using code behind?

C#, ASP.NET, VS08, using HTML table. I want to merge cells - rowspan and colspan spans it but does not merge it. For a clear picture, drag a HTML table control on the design view select the cells of a column right click, modify, merge I would like to do this programatically in C# coding on a button click.
