Time series regression with multiple independent variables

it's been a while since i studied statistics and im a bit rusty on the topic but im looking for some advice on times series regression. I'm trying to generate a time series regression model where i have one dependent variable(y) and several independent variables(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5); all the variables are in weekly data for 20 years. Ultimately im trying to find how much all the independent variables explain y(R squared) and the contribution for each independent variable. Also im trying to retrieve the same results(how much the independent variables explain y and each of their contribution) for each year. Would I have to use a VAR model? and which method would be effective explaining the contribution part?
