SQL Audit Log Running Totals

I have a table with an audit log: BugId Timestamp Status 1 2010-06-24 10:00:00 open 2 2010-06-24 11:00:00 open 1 2010-06-25 12:00:00 closed 2 2010-06-26 13:00:00 closed I want a running total of open and closed bugs like: Timestamp # Status 2010-06-25 00:00:00 2 open 2010-06-26 00:00:00 1 open 2010-06-26 00:00:00 1 closed 2010-06-27 00:00:00 2 closed How may I do this query (or similar) in Microsoft SQL Server 2000? The output is intended to be used to feed a time series chart so I do not care if there are rows with 0 output since I will probably only select a timespan like the last month.
