You are storing the entire database in memory, as a list, and re-query it for every request as a list traversal. Frankly I doubt this 'cache' is in fact faster than just running a SQL query. Traversing list is never going to beat a database... What you should do instead is cache specific query results. Like the result set for a rowID and groupID, cached keyed by the two arguments. For refresh, rely on the built-in cache invalidation infrastructure around Query Notifications, see this article The Mysterious Notification to understand how that works. With an ASP.Net project, all you have to do is leverage the SqlCacheDependency .
