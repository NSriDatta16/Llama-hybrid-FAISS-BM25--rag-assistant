Finding unused (aka "dead") code in Delphi

Are there any tools that can determine if a function/procedure/method/entire class is used? I've seen tools that can help a knowledgeable developer track down unused fragments of code (most are for languages other than Delphi) but most have a steep learning curve and/or require considerable digging to determine if a code fragment is used or not. Delphi's smart linker purportedly does this to reduce the size of the final executable. Unfortunately what little information is given on the smart linker doesn't indicate a way to retrieve what was culled from the hurd. Admittedly, even if it is possible to find out what the smart linker is eliminating it may be very conservative with its culling.
