You are dealing with regresssion effects, not with relaxing the proportional hazards assumption by using splines, unless you add time-dependent spline terms to the model. Huber-White robust sandwich covariance estimators are not guaranteed to be more accurate than ordinary Wald covariance estimators. In binary logistic regression William Gould has shown that the variance of robust standard errors can be many times larger than the variance of Wald standard errors. So it's not clearly the case that using a robust method improves things in your situation. It is true that you might get slightly better covariance estimates with sandwich estimates if proportional hazards is violated, but then you're doing what David Freedman wrote about: getting the right standard errors on the wrong quantities. When looking at prop. hazards for splines don't look at individual coefficients. Use capabilities of the R survival package to get multiple degree of freedom measures of non-PH using cox.zph . And use a smoother to get a plot of the effect of the overall spline term collapsed to one degree of freedom, against time.
