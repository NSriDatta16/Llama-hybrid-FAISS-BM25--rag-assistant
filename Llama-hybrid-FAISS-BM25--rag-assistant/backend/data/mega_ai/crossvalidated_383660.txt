BMA - at what posterior effect probability can we say that a variable has an effect?

in the setting of a Bayesian model averaging, we are not dealing with P--value when we are assesing variable importance, but with the posterior effect probability of each variable. My question is, at what level of posterior effect probability can we say that the variable has an effect on the dependent variable? Is there any generally accepted cutoff or a rule of thumb? Hoeting, J. A., D. Madigan, A. E. Raftery, & C. T. Volinsky (1999): Bayesian model averaging: A tutorial. on page 393 (13 of this particular .pdf) claim that posterior effect probabilites of 84 %, 72 % and 78 % indicate that the evidence (for variable significance) is positive but not strong . Do you have any other references which would shed more light on this issue? Thank you.
