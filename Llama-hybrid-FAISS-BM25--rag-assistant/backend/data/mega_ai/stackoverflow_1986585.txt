dpbradley's link in #2 sounds like your best bet. Tom keeps the transactionality with the caller, if you don't want that you could make it an autonomous transaction like so: create or replace function getNextInvoiceNumber() return number is l_invoicenum number; pragma autonomous_transaction; begin update docs_numbers set last_invoice = last_invoice + 1 returning last_invoice into l_invoicenum; commit; return l_invoicenum; exception when others then rollback; raise; end;
