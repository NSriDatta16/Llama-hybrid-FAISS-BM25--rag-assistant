Challenges of email server development

Email server development is quite challenging. One of the biggest challenge is when developing web application that sends out several emails on behalf of users. Emails will all be sent out from one SMTP feed with sender address that of individual users. How do we ensure that if the users missuse the system (say send out spam messages) the server IP that sends out the email is not balck listed ? I have been advised that registering in following organisations will help. But my question is, this alone will suffice ? Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group(www.maawg.org) Email Experience Council(www.emailexperience.org) Online Trust Alliance(www.otalliance.org) Email Service Provider Coalition(www.espcoalition.org) Return Path(www.returnpath.net) Spam Arrest(www.spamarrest.com) Any other thing needs to be done during development or configuration of the service ?
