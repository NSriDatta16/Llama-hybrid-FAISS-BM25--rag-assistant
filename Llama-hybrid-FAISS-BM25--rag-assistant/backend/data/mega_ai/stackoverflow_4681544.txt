Well MD5 is fast but is strongly discouraged these days. There is a tendency to be lax about security ("I'm not bothered about security so much" - I've done it, we all do), but if you really do not need any security then go for MD5. Otherwise look at the SHA algorithms. SHA-1 is used a lot. I'm no crypto expert but I think the others have longer block sizes and are probably a bit slower. Some reading on the differences can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1 and pages linked from this. Note, an effective way of shortening a hash just for comparison purposes (eg. to check if files are the same and have not been tampered with), is to take a subset of the chars from the hash. Just make sure you take them from the same indexes each time (eg. chars 0-5; or chars 5,11, and 13 you get the idea).
