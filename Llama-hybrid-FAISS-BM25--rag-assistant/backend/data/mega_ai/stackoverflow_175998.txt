It's not a "third-party" product but anyone that I have ever seen using DB2 is using Tivoli Storage Manager to store their database backups. Most shops will set up archive logging to TSM so you only have to take the "big" backup every week or so. Since it's also an IBM product you won't have to worry about it working with all the different flavors of DB2 that you have. The downside is it's an IBM product. :) Not sure if that ($) makes a difference to you.
