Predicting online revenue next month: Time Series or Regression?

Seeking guidance on approach. I have some marketing spend data along with historic target variable revenue. If management would like to estimate online revenue over the next 3 months given a media plan (A document showing which dollars will be spent on which channels), would you use a regression or e.g. decision tree model, or would you go the time series route? Some data: eg_data I could build a linear model where revenue is a function of youtube, facebook and tv spend. However, if I have a date field, should I use it? What is the conventional approach here if management want to predict sales over the next month? If I do go the time series route can I include the spend variables? Putting the question another way, is it possible (or even advisable), to combine a regression model with a time series in some way?
