How can I forecast with multiple time series sampled at different frequencies?

I am attempting to build a time series model that can predict order volumes for a single firm in the trucking industry. I have time series data on the firm's order volumes. This data is monthly data. I expect also to have access to time series data on say 5 macroeconomic variables that I believe are in some way correlated with the order volumes I am seeking to predict. For the most part, this will be quarterly data. My question is: does all of the above data need to be standardized in terms of the time interval, or can I build the models with a combination of monthly and quarterly data? And if I do need to standardize, how do I do this? (Happy to do this in either R or Python.)
