Myself (and probably many others) are concerned about "will I still be able to compile/install apps for v3.1.3 of the iPhone OS?" And what version of xCode does it become IMPOSSIBLE to ever write v3.1.3 apps again? (Without installing a second copy of an older version of xCode.) I've read the mile-long document that Apple wrote on the subject... but it sure would be simpler to understand if they just LISTED the various versions of each... instead of writing long paragraphs. If you have: Mac OS version 10.x.x x xCode version x.x.x SDK version(s) x.x.x you can produce apps for iPhone OS x.x.x through x.x.x?
