Dictionaries in .NET use a hash table lookup scheme, so adding entries has very little, if any, effect on lookup performance. The only issue you will have might be memory usage. A dictionary of 3000 items will consume roughly 3000 times the storage used by the key plus the value types. If it's just a simple struct without huge binary blobs, 3000 is downright tiny.
