Run SHOW CREATE TABLE on each table and look for differences. The first thing that came to mind was one of the servers has InnoDB enabled and the other doesn't, so the storage engines are different. Then check out my.cnf and SHOW VARIABLES for differences. It also seems you have a different number of rows in the two databases. That can affect what indexes the planner decides to use in executing your query.
