Honeycomb and TabHost specs

I have a question about Honeycomb's backward compatibility. I have an app that supports 2.1 or higher and seems to mostly work on Honeycomb except when they start a TabActivity. In particular, when I add tabs to the TabHost, I get the following exception android.content.res.Resources$NotFoundException: Resource ID #0x0 When looking at the code that throws this exception, I see that it's the tab spec that has a label and an icon. Inside the code, in the LabelAndIconIndicatorStrategy tries to inflate the layout file R.layout.tab_indicator which doesn't appear to be available. TabHost.TabSpec spec; // Resusable TabSpec for each tab Intent intent; // Reusable Intent for each tab // Create an Intent to launch an Activity for the tab (to be reused) intent = new Intent().setClass(_gameActivity, ScoreGameActivity.class); intent.putExtra(GameChangerConstants.STREAM_ID, _stream.pk().toString()); // Initialize a TabSpec for each tab and add it to the TabHost spec = _gameTabHost.newTabSpec("score_game").setIndicator("Score", res.getDrawable(R.drawable.icon_field_gloss)).setContent(intent); _gameTabHost.addTab(spec); Is there a new way of creating tabs for honeycomb that I don't know about? I've poured over the documentation but haven't seen anything that indicates a problem with what I've done. I'd like to avoid having to use fragments at this point until we can do a more comprehensive restructuring of our UI widgets and I'd like to better understand this issue.
