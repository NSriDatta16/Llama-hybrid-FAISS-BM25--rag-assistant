Visual marker when moving rows on DataGridView

Users drag rows up and down in my DataGridView. I have the dragging logic down-pat, but I'd like there to be a dark marker indicating where the row will be placed after I let go of the mouse. Example from Microsoft Access http://img718.imageshack.us/img718/8171/accessdrag.png Example from Microsoft Access; I want to drag rows instead of columns Does anyone know how I'd go about doing this? Is this built-in, or would I have to draw my own marker (if so, how do I do that)? Thanks!
