Go to visual studio or .NET command prompt and type the command: gacutil -if "fullpathhere.dll" explore gacutil command more. -IF means install forcefully, there are other options as well. If there is no Visual Studio or .NET Framework SDK installed, then you will not have the .NET command prompt. In that case, I think you will have to turn off the UAC from Control Panel to drag-drop an Assembly into the Assembly folder.
