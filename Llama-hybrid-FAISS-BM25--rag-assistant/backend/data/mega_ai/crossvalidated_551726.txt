Age is given partly as a continuous and partly as a categorical variable

I have a dataset of the clinical information of 150 patients above 50 years old. I intend to do a logistic regression with it. (Presence of Symptom ~ Age, etc) From 50 years old to 69 years old the ages are given continuously (50,51,52...68,69); from 70 years old the ages are given categorically/binned (70-74,75-79...95-99,100+) I have 83 in the 50-69 yo group and 67 in the 70-100+ group. How to know the best manner to proceed: Transforming the continuous data in categorical or the other way around?
