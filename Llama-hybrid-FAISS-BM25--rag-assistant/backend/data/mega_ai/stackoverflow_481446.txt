throws Exception in finally blocks

Is there an elegant way to handle exceptions that are thrown in finally block? For example: try { // Use the resource. } catch( Exception ex ) { // Problem with the resource. } finally { try{ resource.close(); } catch( Exception ex ) { // Could not close the resource? } } How do you avoid the try / catch in the finally block?
