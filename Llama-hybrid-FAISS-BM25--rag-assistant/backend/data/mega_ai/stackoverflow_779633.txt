You have a choice. You can either reply with 406 and include an "entity" (e.g. HTML or text file) describing the available formats; OR if you are using HTTP 1.1, you can send the format you support even though it wasn't listed in the Accept header. (see section 10.4.7 of RFC 2616 ) "Note: HTTP/1.1 servers are allowed to return responses which are not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request. In some cases, this may even be preferable to sending a 406 response. User agents are encouraged to inspect the headers of an incoming response to determine if it is acceptable."
