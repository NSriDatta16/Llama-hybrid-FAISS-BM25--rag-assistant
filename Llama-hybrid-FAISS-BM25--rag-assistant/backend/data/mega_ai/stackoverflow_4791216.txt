It looks like you want the most common scenario – simply load an intialized custom UIView subclass into a controller. Create a new XIB, called “View XIB” in the Xcode new file wizard. In the Interface Builder select the File Owner object and on the Object Identity tab in the Object Inspector (Cmd-4) enter Controller (or however your controller class is named) into the Class field. Do the same with the view, entering the name of your view class. Ctrl+drag from the file owner to the view, you should be able to connect the view to the view outlet defined on your controller. Save, let’s say Controller.xib . In your code, initialize the controller using initWithNibName:@"Controller" bundle:nil . The initialization code should load the interface for you and set the view property to the view unpacked from the interface file. Go through some Interface Builder tutorial, IB is a very nice tool and it’s good to be familiar with it.
