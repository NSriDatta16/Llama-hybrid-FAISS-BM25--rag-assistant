Is it necessary to detrend and decycle time-series data when using machine learning methods?

For example: I want to forecast future values of a time-series based on previous values of multiple time-series' using a ANN and/or SVM. Inputs will be lagged values from each time series, and the outputs will be one-step-ahead forecasts (forecasts with further horizons will be done by "rolling" the predictions forward using previous predictions). Now, shouldn't SVMs and ANNs be able to learn trends and cycles? Would they not be able to learn things like, "with all else being equal the output of this series should be 2x the previous output?" Or, if I provide a categorical variable for month, "since it's January, divide the prediction I would've made by 2?" Would attempting to decycle and detrend the data result in imposing more bias than necessary?
