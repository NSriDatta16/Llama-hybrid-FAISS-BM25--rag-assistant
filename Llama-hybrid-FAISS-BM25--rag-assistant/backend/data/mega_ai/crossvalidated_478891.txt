Confidence intervals are hard to explain. Before looking at your data , you can say that --- if you are going to draw a sample from a normal population with unknown mean and unknown standard deviation --- there is a 95% probability that the calculated confidence interval from some future experiment: $$\left[\overline{X}-t_{n-1;1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{s_n}{\sqrt{n}},\overline{X}+t_{n-1;1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{s_n}{\sqrt{n}}\right]$$ encompasses the true value of the mean ( $\alpha=0.05$ , $t_{n-1;1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is the $1-\alpha/2$ percentile of a $t$ Student variable with $n-1$ degrees of freedom, $s_n=\sqrt{\sum(x_i-\overline{x})^2/(n-1)})$ . See here ). An example in R: > library(mvtnorm) > set.seed(1234) > sigma mean X str(X) num [1:23, 1:5000] 2.59 3.35 1.37 8.12 1.62 ... > X_means X_sds t22 CI for (i in 1:5000) { + midwid = 5 # does it cover the true mean? + } > sum(CI[,3])/5000 # % of CI's covering the true mean [1] 0.949 But when you draw a particular sample , and calculate the sample mean and its confidence interval, this interval either covers the parameter value or it does not. You can't say that $P(\text{my interval covers the true mean})=95\%$ , you can only say that your interval is a set of plausible values for the true mean, with a 95% "confidence level" ( not probability, see here ). However, if you say that your 23 numbers represent the 100% of the population (in your comment to spdrnl'answer), then confidence intervals are meaningless, because you know the true mean (and the true standard deviation). If you wish to know which values lie between the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile you can just use the R quantile function: > (x (q x[x >= q[1] & x EDIT If you want to calculate a 95% CI on your data, here is how I would do in R: > x (x_mean (x_sd (halfwidth (ci Your CI is different: > c(x_mean-1.96*x_sd/sqrt(23), x_mean+1.96*x_sd/sqrt(23)) [1] 4.568713 6.909548 but you can use $1.96$ instead of the 97.5th percentile of a Student $t$ variable with $n-1=22$ degrees of freedom: > qt(0.975,22) [1] 2.073873 only if you know that $2.86$ is the population (i.e. the "true") standard deviation.[1] As to the interpretation, a CI is not a (sub)range of your data. The people value spanning in between that CI do not matter. A CI is just a range of plausible means : you can say that the population ("true") mean is plausibly between 4.5 and 7. So by checking several averages of 22 person at a random, that mean has always to be in the CI level. Is that the case? Yes, almost... By checking several averages (and standard deviations) of 23 person at random, the sample mean will tend to be in a 95% CI (which will be different for each sample) in 95% of the samples (see my first code above). This is why you believe that your CI is plausible. [1] Try using the CONFIDENCE.T function instead of CONFIDENCE or CONFIDENCE.NORM (see here , then here ). In Python, numpy.std returns the population standard deviation, if you are looking for the sample standard deviation, you can supply an optional ddof parameter (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34050491/standard-deviation-in-numpy ): >>> import numpy as np >>> x = np.array([4,2,4,3,1,6,2,9,2,12,6,5,7,8,5,9,6,4,6,7,9,10,5]) >>> np.std(x) 2.800891027548941 >>> np.std(x, ddof=1) 2.863840258755363
