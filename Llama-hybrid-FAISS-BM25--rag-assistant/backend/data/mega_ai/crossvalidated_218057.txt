Specifying a convergence criterion for the approximate randomization test

All documents (e.g., (1,2)) that I have read on approximate randomization test indicate that one needs to choose the number of shuffles prior to running the approximate randomization test. Example from (1), where the number of shuffles is fixed to 9,999: I wonder whether it would be OK to specify a convergence criterion on the significance level, instead of pre-defining a number of shuffles. (and if so, what would be a reasonable convergence criterion and how comes few people if any uses one.) E.g., one such convergence criterion could be stop the approximate randomization test if the significance level hasn't varied more than $\pm0.01$ over the last 50 shuffles. The main rationale would be that the convergence speed of the significance level depends on the dataset and the analyzed system. Below are some examples of number of shuffles (x-axis) vs. significance level (y-axis), as we can see the significance level sometimes converges before 9,999: Conversely, one could (?) imagine cases where the significance level hasn't converged yet after 9,999 shuffles.
