What should I say and explain about a negative constant in binary logistic regression?

I am finishing my undergraduate thesis and I was asked this problem of negative constant in my examination. So I am trying to find out how to explain what to say in regard to the negative constant. In my model, I have 15 predictors and one response. And in binary logistic, the response is either 1 or 0. So the examiner insisted that the response should only be either 1 or 0, not negative. So why is the constant negative if all the predictors excluded? What should I say here? What is the problem? Much appreciated on the help.
