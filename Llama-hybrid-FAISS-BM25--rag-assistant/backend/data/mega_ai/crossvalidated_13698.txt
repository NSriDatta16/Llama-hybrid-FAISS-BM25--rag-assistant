There are several alternatives to Stepwise Regression . The most used I have seen are: Expert opinion to decide which variables to include in the model. Partial Least Squares Regression . You essentially get latent variables and do a regression with them. You could also do PCA yourself and then use the principal variables. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Both PLS Regression and LASSO are implemented in R packages like PLS : http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pls/ and LARS : http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lars/index.html If you only want to explore the relationship between your dependent variable and the independent variables (e.g. you do not need statistical significance tests), I would also recommend Machine Learning methods like Random Forests or Classification/Regression Trees . Random Forests can also approximate complex non-linear relationships between your dependent and independent variables, which might not have been revealed by linear techniques (like Linear Regression ). A good starting point to Machine Learning might be the Machine Learning task view on CRAN: Machine Learning Task View : http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html
