What's the most efficient way to store objects in a SQLCe Database?

I need to increase the performance of a compact framework application which uses a SQLCe database to persist cached objects between sessions of the application. Currently, objects are serialized into XML and stored in a SQLCe database, but having run a profiling tool it seems that there is quite an overhead in doing this. I was thinking of changing this to a binary serializer but does anyone know of any more efficient ways of storing these object for quick retrieval? Thanks. Update: Just found out there's no binary serialization support in compact framework so not an option.
