My coworker got the API to work in PHP so I took a look at his code and he was using cURL . I found out there is a python version called PycURL . After installing PycURL, I ripped out the urllib code and used PycURL instead. import pycurl c = pycurl.Curl() c.setopt(pycurl.URL, authenticate_url) c.setopt(pycurl.SSLVERSION, 3) c.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYPEER, False) c.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2) c.setopt(pycurl.USERAGENT, 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows NT 5.0)') outputXML = c.perform() c.close() I guess urllib is not as robust as PycURL.
