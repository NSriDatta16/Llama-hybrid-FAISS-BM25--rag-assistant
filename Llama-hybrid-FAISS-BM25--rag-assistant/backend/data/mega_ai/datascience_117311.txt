Another solution is to directly use GPT for maths. Currently GPT-3 is one of the best models to answer maths problems, but it requires a poweful hardware. https://openai.com/blog/grade-school-math/ Nevertheless, you can have good results using GPT-2: https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math/blob/master/grade_school_math/train.py I recommend starting with the smallest model (124M parameters). It should be enough if it is just a chatbot to solve classic maths problems. https://huggingface.co/gpt2
