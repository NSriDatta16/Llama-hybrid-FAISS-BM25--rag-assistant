The DBML file is mapping that defines your classes based on your database schema. Yes, it defines your (default) connection string, but it doesn't "configure" your database at all. Linq to Sql uses a database-first approach where you have the database and model your classes after the DB schema. By dragging & dropping the table onto there, you'll be automating the creation of the classes so you don't have to type them out. You can change property names etc from there and the mapping between the property and its correct database column name will remain intact.
