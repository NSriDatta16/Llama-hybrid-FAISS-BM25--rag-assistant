Looking for a Design Pattern

I have 80-90 classes which are all a type of calculation. But each class uses one method compute which is the same in each in class. The items that are different in each class are the are the instance variables used inside the compute method. The reason I am looking for a pattern is because what I am doing seems extremely repetitive.Below is an example of just one calc but there can be up to 200 calculations. Protected Overrides Sub Compute(ByVal cache As Cache.ClientCache(Of System.Guid), _ ByRef objIsTickBoxATicked As IClientAnswer(Of System.Guid)) Dim objClientAdviceParas As ClientAdviceParagraphs 'Get the Client Advice Paragraphs objClientAdviceParas = GetTickBoxesFromCache(GetAnonymousCache(cache), _ CType(cache.Client, Client)) 'Return the value objIsTickBoxATicked.BoolValue = _ CheckTickBox(objClientAdviceParas, m_csClientAdviceParaWelfareBenefitsReferral) End Sub
