Why use `javascript:void(0)` instead of `javascript:` as an href do nothing placeholder?

I have seen href="javascript:void(0)" and I have seen href="javascript:;" Is there any reason I would not just use href="javascript:" instead? Edit: Let me make it clear: I am combining this with an onclick and have no objection to using return false if it becomes necessary to use the alternative. Of course this is only if the alternative makes better sense over javascript: . Also, I have yet to see a answer to my question shown (clearly I think) in the first paragraph. Thanks, david. :) I have seen href="javascript:void(0)" and I have seen href="javascript:;" Is there any reason I would not just use href="javascript:" instead?
