I've never implemented something like this, but form the description, I think the local storage of mobile device acts as a cache. Because it may not be practical if the local storage is of the same size as the server side database. So I would first figure out the suitable size of client side storage, and then try to find a suitable cache replacement stategy. This depends on the nature of your application. The principle is that you keep the data that is most likely to be used in cache. When your application requires scaning the whole data set, i.e. select * from mytable, do this kind of query on the server side. Also connect the server if local cache is miss. To do the cache replacement, you may need to partation the server side data into groups, so that for most groups, if you have the group in your cache, you know you have all of its members in your cache. For example, you can partition a datatable by the day it was last modified, or by (row number mod group size). The point is, only cache the information you need during the day. If its impossible to decide which information will be needed, you can just download the newer groups that is not in local storage. Such as all records for yestaday (since you already have all records from the day before yesterday). I think its critical to find a suitable way to partition the records.
