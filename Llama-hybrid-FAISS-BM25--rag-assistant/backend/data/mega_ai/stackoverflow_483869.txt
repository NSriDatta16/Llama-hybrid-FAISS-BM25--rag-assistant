Anyone know of a simple way to store the Rails Page cache on Amazon S3?

I am looking for a simple and automated way to store the page cache on S3 (and of course cloudfront.) I know of a plugin that does this with the fragment cache, but before I create it myself, wanted to tap into the collective wisdom here :) Edited: To make myself more clear, I am not looking to use S3 to serve the files, but rather, the CloudFront CDN.
