Decision trees: leaf-wise (best-first) and level-wise tree traverse

Issue 1: I am confused by the description of LightGBM regarding the way the tree is expanded. They state: Most decision tree learning algorithms grow tree by level (depth)-wise, like the following image: Questions 1 : Which "most" algorithms are implemented this way? As far as I know C4.5 and CART use DFS. XGBoost uses BFS. Which other algorithms or packages use BFS for decision trees? Issue 2: LightGBM states: LightGBM grows tree by leaf-wise (best-first).It will choose the leaf with max delta loss to grow. When growing same leaf, leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than level-wise algorithm. Question 2 : Is it correct to say that level-wise growth trees will have equal depth for all leaves? Questions 3: If Question 2 is not correct, then the trees from level-wise and leaf-wise growth will look the same at the end of the traversal (without pruning etc). Is it a correct statement? Questions 4: If question 3 is correct, how can "leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than level-wise algorithm"? Does it have to do with the post-pruning algorithm?
