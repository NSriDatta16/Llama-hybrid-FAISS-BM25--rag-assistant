Here's some things to try out: Run each photo through a convnet to extract features, concat them and run the concatenated feature vector through a fully connected network to get the price. To deal with varying number of inputs, you could decide for a maximum amount of inputs per house, and use zero-filled placeholder for inputs for houses with less inputs than maximum. Given enough data, and enough variation in data, the model should learn to ignore placeholders by treating them as noise. Have one model to predict the house price from an image. Predict house prices for multiple images separately, and average predictions afterwards.
