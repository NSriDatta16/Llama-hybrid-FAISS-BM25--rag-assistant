executing an unmanaged assembly: First - this does not exist. An "Assembly" (which has the physical form aof a .DLL file) is ALWAYS managed. An unmanaged DLL is simply not an assembly PER DEFINITION. DLL's were around WAY before .NET and the term Assembly is SPECIFIC for a managed .NET DLL in this context. Is it impossible to execute an unmanaged assembly using AppDomain? Exactly. Which part of the vast documentation indicated otherwise? You can use: P/Invoke to make calls out into a DLL. This sometimes is REALLY hard as the .NET managed API is not so elegant for certain unmanaged structure constructs. Use C++/CLI to create an assembly that references the DLL. Managed C++ is great for bridging the gap.
