Extracted from the official Microsoft support forum : A possible reason for the not being able to drag & drop files to the application could be UAC integrity level (IL). With UAC enabled in Vista or Win7, drag and drop is not allowed to happen from low IL process to high IL process by default. Please check whether your application is elevated (run as admin) when the problem happens. If you don't want to disable UAC, you could try just disabling UIPI (User Interface Privilege Isolation). Open regedit and go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System Add a new DWORD (32-bit) Value called EnableUIPI and set it to 0. Restart the machine and see if it behaves as you want it to.
