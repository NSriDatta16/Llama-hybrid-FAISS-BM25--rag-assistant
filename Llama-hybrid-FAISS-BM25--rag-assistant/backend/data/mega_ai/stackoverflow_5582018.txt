The internal storage for an ArrayList is an object array ( object[] ). When storing reference types in the ArrayList , the reference is just cast to object and stored in the array. The reference type instance itself contains information about it's type, so it's possible to cast it back to the actual type when you get it from the ArrayList . Value types are boxed inside an object, and the reference to that object is stored in the array. The object contains information about what type the value is, so that it can be unboxed correctly when you get it from the ArrayList .
