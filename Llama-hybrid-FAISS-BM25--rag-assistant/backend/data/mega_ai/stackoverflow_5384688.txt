What are the challenges in embedding text search (Lucene/Solr/Hibernate Search) in applications that are hosted at client sites

We have a enterprise java web-app that our customers (external) deploy on their intranets. I am exploring different full text search options: Lucene/Solr/Hibernate Search and one common concern is deployment/administration/tuning overhead for this. This is particularly challenging in our case, since we do not host these applications. From what I have seen, most uses of these technologies have been in hosted applications. Our customers typically deploy our application in a clustered environment and do not have any experience with Lucene/Solr. Does anyone have any experience with this? What challenges have you encountered with this approach? How did you overcome them? At this point I am trying to determine if this is feasible. Thank you
