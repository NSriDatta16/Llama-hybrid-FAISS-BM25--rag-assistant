In this case, the objective is to derive the joint probability P(A and B) from the conditional P(A|B). Consequently, the correct prior term of the Bayesian numerator is P(B) and NOT the conditional P(B|A) because P(A|B) X P(B|A) â‰  P(A and B). Rather, the correct P(B) to use as the prior for table two is the sum of the updated posterior conditional probability, P(B), from table 1: P(B|A) + P(B|~A). As such, in this case, P(B|A)=0.09/0.71 = 0.13, and P(B|~A) = 0.23/0.29 = 0.79. So, given that A OR ` A occurs, B has an occurrence probability of .13 + .79 = .92.
