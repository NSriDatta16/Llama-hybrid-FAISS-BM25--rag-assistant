Distances for binary and non binary categorical data

I am computing a matrix of distances for categorical data. I am using the Jaccard distance since as far as I understood it should be working properly with this kind of data. I have BOTH binary and non-binary. My question is: can I use the Jaccard method to compute distances for data including BOTH binary and non-binary variables (as in Mydata in the example below) WITHOUT transforming the non-binary in binary? If the answer is not, is there an alternative way or I have to transform every attribute in a (0,1) variable? A Jaccard code in R (function vegdist in package vegan ) provides me results but I am not able to reproduce them if I include both the binary and non binary attributes. I provide an example of the data I have a Mydata 1 0 3 1 1 2 0 0 1 0 1 0 where the attribute c is the non-binary, with possible values within (0,4). The R function provides me the following distance matrix for Mydata but I am not able to reproduce it manually. For instance, the first element 0.40 is the distance between observation 1 and 2 along the 3 attributes) 1 2 3 2 0.40 3 0.75 0.75 4 1.00 0.75 1.00
