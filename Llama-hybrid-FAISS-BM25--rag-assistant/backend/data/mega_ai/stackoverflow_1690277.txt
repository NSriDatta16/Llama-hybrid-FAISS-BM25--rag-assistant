I'd go for the pragmatic approach of one table, with a status column to indicate whether the user is 'privisional' or 'confirmed' (say), and check constraints to ensure that all the mandatory information is present when the status is 'confirmed'. Whether you should use nulls or empty strings is something I don't have much of an opinion on, as I am used to Oracle, which can't distinguish between the two!
