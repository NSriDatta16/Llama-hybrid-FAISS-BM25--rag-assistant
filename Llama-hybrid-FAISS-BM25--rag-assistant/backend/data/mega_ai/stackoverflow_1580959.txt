This declaration has a special meaning when used to declare parameter of a function. Within the parameter list it is equivalent to char[100][512] , char[123][512] , char[3][512] (you get the idea - the first size can be just anything, it is simply ignored) and also to char (*)[512] . Effectively, it will accept as an argument a 2D array of chars with flexible (arbitrary) first size. The array that you will actually pass to this function should be declared with a concrete first size, for example char names[3][512] = { "abc", "cde", "fgh" }; if you know the first size at compile time, of course. If the first size is only known at run time (say, n ), you'll have to allocate the array dynamically char (*names)[512] = new char[n][512]; // Now fill it with names or, more elegantly, with a typedef typedef char TName[512]; TName* names = new TName[n]; // Now fill it with names I expect that the SDK function you are talking about also asks you to pass the first size of the name array as another parameter.
