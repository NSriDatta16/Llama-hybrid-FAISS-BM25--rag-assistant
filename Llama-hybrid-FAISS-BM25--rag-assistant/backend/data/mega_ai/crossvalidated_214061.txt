Would the importance() and varImpPlot() R functions be helpful in identifying these variables or are there any other ways? Yes. If you would like to stick to random forest algorithm, I would highly recommend using conditional random forest in case of variable selection / ranking. You can use the party package for fitting conditional random forest. In this algorithm the permutation-importance measure gets corrected to account for spurious correlation by estimating conditional permutation-importance metric for which $X_j$ is considered together with other strongly correlated variables with $X_j$. For more reference please see Party publication . This paper also indicates some good practices on using the varimp() function: if all predictor variables are of the same type, use either randomForest or cforest (...) as randomForest is computionally faster if the predictor variables are of different types, use party::cforst with the default option controls = cforest_unbiased and premutation importance varimp(obj) if the predictor variables are correlated, depending on your research question, conditional importance, vailable via varimp(obj, conditional = TRUE) for party::cforest can add to the understanding of your data The idea is to describe to a nontechnical client what the most important variables are. Are there any plots I could use to show the importance of these variables? The most basic way to present variable importance is to create horizontal bart plot with normalized importance score (summing up to 100).
