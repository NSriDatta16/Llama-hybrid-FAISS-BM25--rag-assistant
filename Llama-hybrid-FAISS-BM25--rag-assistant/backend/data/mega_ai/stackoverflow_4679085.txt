Getting Error "The remote server returned an error: (403) Forbidden" when screen scraping using HttpWebRequest.GetResponse()

We have a tool which checks if a given URL is a live URL. If a given url is live another part of our software can screen scrap the content from it. This is my code for checking if a url is live public static bool IsLiveUrl(string url) { HttpWebRequest webRequest = WebRequest.Create(url) as HttpWebRequest; webRequest.UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5"; webRequest.CookieContainer = new CookieContainer(); WebResponse webResponse; try { webResponse = webRequest.GetResponse(); } catch (WebException e) { return false; } catch (Exception ex) { return false; } return true; } This code works perfectly but for a particular site hosted on apache i am getting a web exception with following message. "The remote server returned an error: (403) Forbidden" On further inspection i found the following details in the WebException object Status="ProtocolError" StatusDescription="Bad Behaviour" This is the request header "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5 Host: scenicspares.co.uk Connection: Keep-Alive" This is the response header "Keep-Alive: timeout=4, max=512 Connection: Keep-Alive Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html Date: Thu, 13 Jan 2011 10:29:36 GMT Server: Apache" I extracted these headers using a watch in vs2008. The frame work in use is 3.5.
