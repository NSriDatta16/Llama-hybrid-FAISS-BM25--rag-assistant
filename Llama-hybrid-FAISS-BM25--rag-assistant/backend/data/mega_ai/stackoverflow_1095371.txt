It really depends on the average/expected data size for your application. For something like a password safe the data would be likely in KB, not GB range, and XML may be a better choice, especially for portability (e.g. synchronizing between machines). If the data model is complicated (e.g. more than, say 10, significant entities) or stores thousands of items then a SQL-style database is more appropriate. An example of an application that uses encrypted XML for storage: ToDoList from AbstractSpoon - source is available too. Another easy-to-deploy database (1 assembly) is VistaDB.net - recommended, syntax is very compatible with MS SQL Server.
