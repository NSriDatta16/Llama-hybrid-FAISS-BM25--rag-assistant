Eric Lippert did a nice article on this http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/05/25/why-is-the-return-type-parameter-last.aspx I encourage you to read the article but the gist of the article is that the reason the return value appears on the right is that it's the most natural position for it. It is the natural choice for both the English language, mathematics and higher order functions. C# has the return type first for historical reasons.
