Using binary variable with low variance in logistic regression

I am trying to design a repeated measures study where a person makes a choice (yes vs no). On the next trial they are asked to make a yes vs no choice on a different question. I want to test if the response in the previous trial will affect the what choice is selected in trial 2. Would a logistic regression work for this? I'm assuming distribution of choices will be very skewed towards the yes choice on trial 1 and I'm worried I won't have enough variance to detect a real effect. Is there an alternative test I could perform to analyze this?
