In both of these models, your outcome and explanatory variable of interest lie in [0,1]. When you calculate the average marginal effect, you are getting the average change in the outcome associated with a 1-unit increase in the explanatory variable. A one-unit change in X is very large if X is between 0 and 1 and may not even make sense: what does going from 0.8 to 1.8 even mean when 1 is the max? This means you might want to either divide the output of margins by 100. rescale your explanatory variables to lie in [0, 100] so that a one-unit change corresponds to 1 percentage point use an increase between 100 pp and 1 pp with (1) or (2) Here is an example where the outcome is the participation rate in the 401(k) plan at 4,075 firms in the US. This is a type of retirement savings account in the United States where employees have to opt in or can opt-out if enrollment is automatic. The explanatory variable of interest is the employer match rate per dollar saved by the employee: 0.5 means the match is 50 cents for every dollar saved, 0 means the employer does not match anything, and 1 means 1:1 match, a doubling. Values above 1 are possible here. You would expect to see a higher enrollment rate in firms where the employers match more generously.

Since the baseline is 0.84, that basically means everyone is expected to participate after the change. But that's a very large change since the mean match rate is 0.46, and the max is 2. Less than 5% of firms match at that new rate. I next implement the two approaches I suggested. If we consider a one-penny increase in the match rate, then participation only increases by 0.00145, or 1/10th of 1 percentage point. Equivalently, an increase of 10 cents is associated with a 1.45 percentage point higher participation. Generally, you would expect all of these to be close, but that not always the case when things are very nonlinear. The logit case is identical to the fractional regression, so I will omit that.
