You've got a fever, and the only prescription is Tag Cloud! You're still going to have to clean things up, but with tools like TaggCloud or Tag2Find you can organize your files by meta data as opposed to location on the drive. Tag2Find will watch a share, and when anything is saved to the share a popup appears and asks you to tag the file. You should also get Google Desktop too.
