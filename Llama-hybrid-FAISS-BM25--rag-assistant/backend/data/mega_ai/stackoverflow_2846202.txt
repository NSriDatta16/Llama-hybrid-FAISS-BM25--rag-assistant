As an avid android user. I think MediaStore is the "Public Link" between the internal Android Media Scanner Application (You can manually invoke it through Spare Parts) and 3rd party applications, like yours. I'm guessing MediaStore is this "public link" based on its android.provider packaging. As providers in android, is how applications provide information to other applications If MediaStore is a ContentProvider, reading information populated by MediaScanner. Then MediaStore is for User media, such as music, video, pictures etc. For ringtones, notifications; I think you are supposed to use android.media.RingtoneManager Also don't hardcode the path "/sdcard/" There is an api call to get it, Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() http://twitter.com/cyanogen/status/13980762583 ==== The pro is that Media Scanner runs every time you mount the removable storage to the phone, and it also scans the internal memory (if it has any like the HTC EVO & incredible)
