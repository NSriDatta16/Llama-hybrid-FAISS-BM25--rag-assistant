Binary logistic regression - SPSS

I did some regression analysis in SPSS using two binary variables: Biomarker X (0= low levels; 1= high levels), where 0 was the reference category and Obesity (0=no; 1=yes) ''Biomarker X'' was taken as the independent variable and ''Obesity'' as the dependent variable. The following results were obtained: Exp(B)= 6.5; 95% Confidence Interval for Exp(B)=1.09-38.63; Sig.=0.040. I interpreted these results as follows: Biomarker X is a predictor of obesity and subjects with high levels of Biomarker X have a 6.5 fold increased risk of obesity compared to subjects with low levels of Biomarker X. To my surprise, exactly the same values were obtained when ''Biomarker X'' was the dependent variable and ''Obesity'' the independent variable, which would mean that Obesity is a predictor of high levels of Biomarker X. While these results might be statistically valid, they make absolutely no sense from a biological/medical point of viewâ€¦ I would therefore appreciate your help with the interpretation of these data. Furthermore, it would be great if you could recommend additional statistical tests that might clarify these results.
