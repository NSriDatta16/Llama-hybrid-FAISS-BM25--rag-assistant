The glm function in R allows 3 ways to specify the formula for a logistic regression model. The most common is that each row of the data frame represents a single observation and the response variable is either 0 or 1 (or a factor with 2 levels, or other varibale with only 2 unique values). Another option is to use a 2 column matrix as the response variable with the first column being the counts of 'successes' and the second column being the counts of 'failures'. You can also specify the response as a proportion between 0 and 1, then specify another column as the 'weight' that gives the total number that the proportion is from (so a response of 0.3 and a weight of 10 is the same as 3 'successes' and 7 'failures'). Either of the last 2 ways would fit what you are trying to do, the last seems the most direct for how you describe your data.
