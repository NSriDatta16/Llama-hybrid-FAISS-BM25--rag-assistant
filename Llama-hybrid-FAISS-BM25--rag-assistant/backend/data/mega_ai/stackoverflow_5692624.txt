Creating custom connectivity in PyBrain neural networks

I want to create an artificial neural network (in PyBrain) that follows the following layout: However, I cannot find the proper way to achieve this. The only option that I see in the documentation is the way to create fully connected layers, which is not what I want: I want some of my input nodes to be connected to the second hidden layer and not to the first one.
