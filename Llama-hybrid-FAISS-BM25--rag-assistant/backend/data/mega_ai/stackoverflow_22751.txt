I use: Infragistics (.NET WinForms controls) LeadTools (video capture) Xtreme ToolkitPro (MFC controls) National Instruments Measurement Studio (computational libraries, plotting, and DAQ) I've found significant bugs in every one of these, so I try to limit their use as much as possible. Infragisitcs is pretty good for what it is, and National Instruments is by far the best, although quite limited. I would avoid LeadTools at all cost.
