I've finally found a solution for this problem! You can put the text you need inserted into the system pasteboard and then paste it at the current cursor position: [myTextField paste:self] I found the solution on this person's blog: http://dev.ragfield.com/2009/09/insert-text-at-current-cursor-location.html The paste functionality is OS V3.0 specific, but I've tested it and it works fine for me with a custom keyboard. If you go for this solution then you should probably save the user's existing clipboard contents and restore them immediately afterwards.
