Standards are critical and PEP 8 is a very good style guide that I insist on. The only guideline I disagree with is the spacing around mathematical operators. For example PEP8 insists on the following spacings Without PEP8 With PEP8 ---------------------------------------------------------------- y = sqrt(x**2 + y**2) y = sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2) a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d a * x ** 3 + b * x ** 2 + c * x + d 10**(a*x + b) 10 ** (a * x + b) F = V/(sqrt(g*h) + epsilon) F = V / (sqrt(g * h) + epsilon) a*cos(nx/pi) + b*sin(nx/pi) a * cos(nx / pi) + b * sin(nx / pi) I am trying to conform, but this is the one area where I am struggling. Do anyone else also feel that PEP8 spacing makes mathematics harder to read? Update: PEP8 was corrected to recommend the formatting on the left while discouraging the formatting on the right: Yes: i = i + 1 submitted += 1 x = x*2 - 1 hypot2 = x*x + y*y c = (a+b) * (a-b) No: i=i+1 submitted +=1 x = x * 2 - 1 hypot2 = x * x + y * y c = (a + b) * (a - b)
