A short answer: Sampling is not only used to estimate a distribution function*, it is also used to perform computations with a density function and MCMC is just one of many ways of sampling. Often such computations are a way of Monte Carlo integration . Computing a posterior average, a 95% highest density interval, marginal distributions*, etcetera, if the density function is a complex function then such values can be difficult to derive analytically and manual integration might require a lot of computations to perform. A sampling method is an alternative to approximate the desired quantity. *In the case of nuisance parameters, then Bayes rule doesn't give the posterior of the parameter, but of a joint distribution with the nuisance parameter. So the statement "if we already KNOW the posterior distribution?" must be nuanced and the marginal posterior distribution is not even known. In these cases the MCMC can also be used to compute the density function (which is unknown ).
