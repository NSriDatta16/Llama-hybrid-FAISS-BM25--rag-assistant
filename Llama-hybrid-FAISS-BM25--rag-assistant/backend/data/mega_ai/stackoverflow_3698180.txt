Draggable objects in Cocoa

I am completely new to objective c and have an quite ambitious project I want to create. One of the things I'll need to do is have a drawing layer, where I can have a circle in the middle, and be able to drag other circles near it to attach them, and then be able to move them around, changing their position around the initial circle. I know this may sound vague, but its the best way I can explain it. Could anyone give me some pointers as to how this could be achieved, or a good reference where I could learn how to do it? Many thanks for any help you can provide.
