You could attempt to address this problem using matching . To motivate this approach, here is a quote about it from wikipedia about how bias can arise when observational data lacks the characteristics of a randomized trail. The possibility of bias arises because the apparent difference in outcome between these two groups of units may depend on characteristics that affected whether or not a unit received a given treatment instead of due to the effect of the treatment per se. In randomized experiments, the randomization enables unbiased estimation of treatment effects; for each covariate, randomization implies that treatment-groups will be balanced on average, by the law of large numbers. Unfortunately, for observational studies, the assignment of treatments to research subjects is, by definition, not randomized. Matching attempts to mimic randomization by creating a sample of units that received the treatment that is comparable on all observed covariates to a sample of units that did not receive the treatment. It seems to me, you are concerned by precisely this possibility. Namely, that offers were not assigned randomly across days of the week, and this may end up biasing your analysis. One approach for addressing this problem is propensity score matching. It matches observations from the different groups (the days) so that they are more comparable to each other, thereby hopefully avoiding the effect of non-random treatment assignment. You can find a nice introduction in Mostly Harmless Econometrics . I am not sure how easy it will be to do matching across all days (you'll have to look into that), but you can certainly compare between two days like this. So if you are particularly interested in comparing other days to Monday, since it seems like a big performer, that should be possible. You should match on the characteristics of the offers that you have - the idea is that responses to similar offers should be matched and compared to each other. Propensity score matching can be carried out in R using the MatchIt package .
