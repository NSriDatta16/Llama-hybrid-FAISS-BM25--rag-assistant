Another way to do this. Make sure to turn NSZombie on so it reports the memory address of the object that is getting the extra release. Then Run with Performance Tool->Object Allocations. This will bring up instruments. Look at the Console log as provided by Xcode organizer. Once you get the crash lookup the memory address in instruments. You will see the entire history of mallocs/frees on that object, as well as links straight into your code.
