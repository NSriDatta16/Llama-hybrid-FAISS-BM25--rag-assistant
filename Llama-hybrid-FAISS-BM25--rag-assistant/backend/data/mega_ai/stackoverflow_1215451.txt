You need an app manifest that demands elevated privileges. Here's a quote from a blog that answers this: First, you can create a manifest file by adding an “Application Manifest File” Item to your project (default name: app.manifest), then you can set it through the Application Tab in the Project Properties. If you want to change the Windows User Account Control level in your manifest file, all you need is to set the value of the level attribute of the requestedExecutionLevel node with one of the following: asInvoker (default): the application will run using the current Windows user provileges requireAdministrator: the application requires an Administrator user highestAvailable: highest privileges for the current user will be used http://dariosantarelli.wordpress.com/2007/11/21/vs2008-embedding-uac-manifest-options/
