I've done that once for a client. Here is what I have done. Pre-required : GeoIp library for PHP. 1- Create store views relative to the languages in your Magento admin. 2- Add a filtering system by doing : 2a - Edit the page.xml layout file of your main/parent theme and, around line 35/36 (in the handle, add : 2b - Create a template/page/html/country-filter.phtml in your main/parent theme and put this code which can be changed based on your needs : if(!isset($_COOKIE['frontend'])) { setcookie("frontend",session_id(),time()+60*60*24,"/",""); $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; $country = geoip_country_name_by_name($ip); switch($country) { case 'France': $url = $this->getUrl() . '?___store=YOUR_STORE_VIEW_CODE_FOR_FRANCE'; header( 'Location:' . $url) ; /* (Maybe add "exit;" here)*/ break; // (etc... for other cases) default: break; /* No need to specify a country/store view for default as you must have done that in System > Manage Stores in your Magento backend.*/ } }
