How much space is alloted to application storage on the iPhone?

Does anyone know what subset of the iPhone's overall storage capacity is reserved for applications and application data? I am not talking about RAM, but rather disk space. I remember reading that only a portion of the iPhone's capacity was used for application data, while the remainder was used for music and media, however I cannot remember the amount. Thank you.
