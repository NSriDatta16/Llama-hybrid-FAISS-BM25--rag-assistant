It may be possible to make templates of dual purpose - to that they could be rendered into placeholders for the replacement by js and at the same time they could be rendered normally for the server output. Only a few templates will need to be of dual purpose like that - the fragments that are to be replaced by the js. I agree with Ignacio, it is much better to keep just one copy of each template, so that you don't have to write a separate one for the javascript, however there is definitely room for improvement from the approach that I've mentioned above. Ideally you might want to have templates compiled into robust javascript function code as well as plain string for the output by the server. Closure templates called Soy, solve the problem nicely but do not (perhaps just yet) work with python, but they do work with Java and Javascript. Hopefully one day there will be python support for that. But even if that happens, the templating language will be probably more restricted as it will be tough to make things like .get_absolute_url() , filters, etc work both in python and javascript - all automatically.
