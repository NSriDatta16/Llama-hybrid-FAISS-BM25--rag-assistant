Looking for a wiki-style, standalone, version-control-"safe" documentation package

My team and I have found that documenting our project (a development platform w/ API) with a wiki is both useful to us and useful to the users. Due to some organizational issues, we're forced to do multi-site development without network connectivity. We've switched to a DVCS (Mercurial) and had great success with this. The wiki documentation proves to be a problem as the central site is setup with MediaWiki. The offsite people have no way to access or edit the wiki. Is there any sort of wiki-style package which doesn't not require a server/database and will be useable in a DVCS environment? Update: Should be open-source and cross-platform
