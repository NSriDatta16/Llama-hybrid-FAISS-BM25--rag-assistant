The unit information prior is a data-dependent prior, (typically multivariate Normal) with mean at the MLE, and precision equal to the information provided by one observation. See e.g. this tech report , or this paper for full details. The idea of the UIP is to give a prior that 'lets the data speak for itself'; in most cases the addition of prior that tells you as much as one observation centered where the other data are 'pointing' will have little impact on the subsequent analysis. One of its main uses is in showing that use of BIC corresponds, in large samples, to use of Bayes factors, with UIPs on their parameters. It's probably also worth noting that many statsticians (including Bayesians) are uncomfortable with the use of Bayes Factors and/or BIC, for many applied problems.
