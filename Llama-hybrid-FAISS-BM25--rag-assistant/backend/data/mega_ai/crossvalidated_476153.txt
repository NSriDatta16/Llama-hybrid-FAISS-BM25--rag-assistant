This is a very interesting question and I had a search and found some methods: uniform combination of losses from different tasks dynamic weight average uncertainty weighting methods with various amounts of training data per-task For the details please refer to this paper: A comparison of loss weighting strategies for multi-task learning in deepneural networks and some more up-to-date papers under the term multi-task learning loss weighting strategies or refer to this open course: CS 330: Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning . Hope that helps.
