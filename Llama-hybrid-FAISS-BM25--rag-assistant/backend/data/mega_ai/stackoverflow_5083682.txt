Get Selected HTML in browser via Javascript

I have a requirement for my web app to allow the user to "Print Selected Only". In other words, a user selects text and potentially images and then clicks this option. I've seen examples of getting selected text with Javascript, but haven't found a solution for getting the selected html itself. As an example if I have a document like so: A bunch of text Even more text If user highlights the image and the second paragraph, I'd want the javascript to return: Even more text Is this possible and how would one go about doing it? Edit: I ended up going with a js library called Rangy for this.
