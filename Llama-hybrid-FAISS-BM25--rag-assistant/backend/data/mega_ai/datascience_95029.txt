What does my learning curve indicate?

I have performed logistic regression. And I am getting an accuracy of 77% with my current model. I divided my training set into cross validation set and train set. And I plotted a learning curve (graph of training examples vs cost function for train set and cost function of cross validation set). My learning curve is shown below - What does it indicate? Since both the curves have a very less difference one is (0.51 and other in 0.52), Is my model biased, or is it correct?
