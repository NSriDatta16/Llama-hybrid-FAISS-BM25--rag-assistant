Is there a document describing Silverlight 2.0 security considerations?

Our IT guys haven't worked with Silverlight 2.0 yet and I am asking them to roll it out across the organisation. They would like to see a document from Microsoft that describes the security implications for the network. Can anyone point me to one?
