How to Execute an application in XP when a particular type of USB device is attached

In Windows XP what is the best way to execute a particular application when a particular type of USB device is attached (it currently attaches as a storage device - i.e. it appears as a drive). The solution I am looking for must execute the application from the very first time the device is attached or offer the application as a selection, whichever is easier to achieve, the device must remain attached as a storage device. EDIT: Polling all attached devices is not adequate - windows will already have done its pop-ups at that stage. The issue is with starting the application without additional pop-ups, the application will then need to use the device as a normal storage drive.
