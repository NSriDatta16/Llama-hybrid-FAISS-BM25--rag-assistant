I am quite pleased with the .wixlib option. It took me just a few minutes to do once I understood what a .wixlib was. I did the following: In VS2008, Add->New Project... of type "WiX Library Project" named SQLDialog. A Library .wxs file is created with an empty element. I copied the UI element from my existing dialog (in my Main "WiX Project") into the Fragment element: ... I added the wixlib project to the Release Build configuration in VS2008. I deleted the SQLDialog.wxs file from the Main WiX Project and referenced the SQLDialog wixlib project, instead. When I recompiled the solution, the Main WiX project worked EXACTLY THE SAME AS BEFORE!! Sweet! Then I referenced the SQLDialog wixlib project from my other WiX Project and utilized it from there. Worked great! Build Server is happy because the shared .wixlib project is part of the solution it is compiling. So, for our purposes, I think this was better than a "shared" directory. No offense Bob. I appreciate your thoughts.
