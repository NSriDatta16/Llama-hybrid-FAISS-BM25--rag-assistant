Well, you could create your own TreeNode derived class: class MyNode : TreeNode { public int number {get; set;} } But then you'll be casting when you retrieve the node from the tree, no improvement over casting the Tag property. And you ought to override the Clone() method. A cleaner approach is to leverage TreeNode.Name and make that a key in a dictionary to find your custom data back. Good when CustClass gets to be non-trivial. The Name property isn't used for anything else.
