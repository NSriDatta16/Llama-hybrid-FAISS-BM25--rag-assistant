Recurrent Neural Networks are considered a type of Deep Learning (DL). I think they are the most popular DL tool for (1d) sequence-to-sequence learning. They are currently the basis of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) approaches (pioneered 2014 at LISA (UdeM), Google, and probably a couple others I'm not remembering).
