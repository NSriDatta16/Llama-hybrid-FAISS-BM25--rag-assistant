For data organization/management, ensure that when you generate new variables in the dataset (for example, calculating body mass index from height and weight), the original variables are never deleted. A non-destructive approach is best from a reproducibility perspective. You never know when you might mis-enter a command and subsequently need to redo your variable generation. Without the original variables, you will lose a lot of time!
