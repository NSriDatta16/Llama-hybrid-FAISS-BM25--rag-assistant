Which Machine Learning model to choose for n Number recommendations based of input numeric parameters

We want to develop a Machine Learning based recommendation model. Our data-set has about 25 numeric input parameters and an output parameter (Lender). Based on the input parameters we want machine learning model to recommend n number of best lenders. Here is the Sample Data with few input attributes and LENDER (Output parameter). M_Year B_Age V_Score C_Type F_Amount Terms F_Product V_Type LENDER 2019 20 150 1 15000 12 1 1 Lender-A 2019 30 250 2 25000 36 3 3 Lender-B 2019 20 150 3 35000 24 2 2 Lender-C 2019 20 150 1 10000 48 5 4 Lender-D Please advise which machine learning model can fulfill our requirement? We want to use sklearns or AWS Sagemaker. But unable to decide which algorithm to use.
