Using a randomization unrelated to the content of your study is called the instrumental variable approach. Try looking into that. Your example won't work as you've described it. Let's say Party A has a higher average net worth than Party B. You want to create two groups that are equal on net worth but differ in party affiliation. When you randomize into 2 conditions, 1 and 2, it is true that what you are left with is two conditions, 1 and 2, that should have equal average net worth. Now you want to sample one party from each condition, so you leave all Party A people in condition 1 and all Party B people in condition 2, and throw out the rest. The problem is that Party A members (even just those in condition 1) still have a higher average net worth than Party B members. Essentially what you doing is randomly throwing away some members of Party A and some members of Party B; doing so doesn't change the distribution of net worth in either party. You need to use strategic matching (e.g., propensity score) to throw out the right members of each party. An unrelated randomization wont help using the matching approach.
