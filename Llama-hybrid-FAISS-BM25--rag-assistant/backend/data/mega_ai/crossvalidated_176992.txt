Is there a unified form for Process control and process control analysis

I have done some reading (NIST, JMP, PCS, Juran, some JEDEC, ...) and it appears there are four very common general types of control charts: Shewhart (X-bar, R, S) CUSUM (cumulative sum) EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average) GMA (geometric moving average) Questions: Is there a generalized form that integrates these? It would be something that for one set of parameters yields a Shewhart but with a change yields the CUSUM. Does it exist? Outside of particular cases, or general synthetic data, how are they compared? Is there a way to compare them analytically?
