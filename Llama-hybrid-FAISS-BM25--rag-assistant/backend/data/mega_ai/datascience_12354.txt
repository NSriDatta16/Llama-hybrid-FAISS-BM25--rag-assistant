What is a good way to start Data Analysis of unknown dataset (JSON data)

I am working with an organization to analyse their data residing in Mongodb and to look for any trends/patterns in the data. I am quite new to the professional field of Data Analysis but have a good background of Statistics and Data Mining (University coursework). I will be doing a proof of concept on the data to understand if the data the organization is gathering is good for Analytics and if no what enhancements should they include in their datasets to make it better for Analytics. I do have some predefined questions that I am planning to answer but looking strategically what would be a good way to approach this kind of problem. I have previously worked with some of the Kaggle datasets and projects in University where datasets were fixed and questions to be answered were given.
