Should the resulting weight vector of SVM be of unit length?

In a tutorial on SVM by Andrew N.G http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes3.pdf , on page 6,7 he has explained SVM in connection to functional margins and then has replaced it by 1 reasoning that W can be rescaled appropriately. But then in the final formulation there is nothing that talks about scaling of W, so when we will solve the optimization problem it may not be appropriately scaled and moreover constraints say that y_i*(w.x+b) >= 1. So how are both formulation of the problem equivalent unless we explicitly make sure to scale w while we implement the solution. I am very much confused about the affect of functional margin and geometric margin on the formulation of SVM optimization problem.
