How to do SQL Like % in Linq?

I have a procedure in SQL that I am trying to turn into Linq: SELECT O.Id, O.Name as Organization FROM Organizations O JOIN OrganizationsHierarchy OH ON O.Id=OH.OrganizationsId where OH.Hierarchy like '%/12/%' The line I am most concerned with is: where OH.Hierarchy like '%/12/%' I have a column that stores the hierarchy like /1/3/12/ for example so I just use %/12/% to search for it. My question is, what is the Linq or .NET equivalent to using the percent sign?
