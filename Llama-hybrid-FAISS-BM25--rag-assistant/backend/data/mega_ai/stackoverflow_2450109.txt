Panels-style UI for arbitrary CCK fields?

I have a Drupal content type that has unlimited photo, textbox, and external link CCK fields, but while fields themselves can be reordered via drag-drop (i.e. photo B before photo A), I can't arbitrarily order amongst fields (i.e. photo B, link A, photo A, text A, link B). Panels is awesome, with its drag and drop, and just what I'm looking for interface-wise. Has anyone seen a Panels-style UI for ordering arbitrary collections of disparate CCK fields?
