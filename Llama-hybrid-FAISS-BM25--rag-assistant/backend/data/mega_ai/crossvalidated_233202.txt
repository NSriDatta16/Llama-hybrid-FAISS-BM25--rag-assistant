How do know whether average ratings are a good predictor of my ratings for a product?

I have a small dataset that contains names of books, their average Goodreads ratings and the ratings I have given them. I want to know whether the average rating of a book is a good predictor of the rating I will give the same book. Here's a small sample of the data: Title Author 340 Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking Susan Cain 276 The Witches Roald Dahl 63 The 48 Laws of Power Robert Greene 293 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking Malcolm Gladwell 128 The Martian Andy Weir 119 The Design of Everyday Things Donald A. Norman 71 The Hostile Hospital (A Series of Unfortunate Events, #8) Lemony Snicket 33 The Stonekeeper (Amulet, #1) Kazu Kibuishi 369 Y: The Last Man, Vol. 1: Unmanned (Y: The Last Man #1) Brian K. Vaughan 222 The Book Thief Markus Zusak Average.Rating My.Rating 340 4.02 4 276 4.16 4 63 4.16 5 293 3.87 5 128 4.39 4 119 4.16 5 71 3.93 4 33 4.13 2 369 4.12 3 222 4.35 3 How do I know whether Average.Rating is a good predictor of My.Rating ? I tried the cor function in R and the correlation I got was 0.1970633. What I understand from this result is that the predictive power of a Goodreads rating is negligible. It follows that I might have a similar outcome if I had randomly picked books from a bookstore. However, I do not feel that Goodreads ratings are as unreliable as the correlation seems to suggest. In fact, I feel that most books that have a high rating are those I have personally liked as well. Also, I intuit that selecting books based on genre and the average rating is a much better approach than randomly picking up books from a bookstore or library. What am I missing? Update: Here's the scatter plot of my data: This is result that cor.test gives me: Pearson's product-moment correlation data: rated$Average.Rating and rated$My.Rating t = 2.9746, df = 219, p-value = 0.003263 alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.06683011 0.32069438 sample estimates: cor 0.1970633
