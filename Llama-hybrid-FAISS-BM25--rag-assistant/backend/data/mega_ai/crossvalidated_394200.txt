Prediction in logistic regression with prediction criteria ranges

I’m not sure how to best explain my problem but I’ll try. I can’t be too specific because this is a homework assignment; I just would like some guidance from the experts on how to approach it. So I’ve fit a logistic regression model. Now I am trying to predict some response based on some values for a bunch of predictors. Two of those predictors are Income and Rank. Income (in \$) is coded by {1 = less than 5000, 2 = 5000 to 9999, 3 = 10000 to 14999, 4 = 15000 to 19999, etc. up to 15} and Rank is coded by {5 = top 10%, 4 = next 10%, 3 = next 20%, 2 = next 20%, bottom = last 40%}. How do I go about prediction if I want to predict the probability of the response based on (some concrete values for other predictors), an income of less than $10000 and a rank in the top 15%? I’m not sure how to really predict when I have to combine multiple categories of a predictor and also split between categories if that makes sense? For Rank, I’m almost thinking about using Rank = 4.5 for prediction but that doesn’t seem right. Thanks for all the help!
