Can I suggest you not do this? I know you're trying to be helpful for your users, but having a window shrinking randomly (it will likely seem random to the user) is going to be confusing and perhaps frustrating. This is probably even more true with the new Windows 7 UI feature Aero Snap i.e. you dock the window to the left and then it resizes on you. Consider the window size a user preference. The user has already told you how big they want the thing to be, respect it! Edit: I should also add that there is a bug if you do go down this route. Consider the form being 1000 pixes wide and the user drags it to (-500, 100) to show it half on their monitor. If they hit a button that's visible (or worse, something happens in the background!) and the form resizes down to 450 pixels the window has just disappeared! The user sees it in the taskbar, but can't get to it unless they know some fancy alt+space shortcuts.
