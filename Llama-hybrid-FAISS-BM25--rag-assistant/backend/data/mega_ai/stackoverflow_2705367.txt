Mysql latin1 turkish data and delphi 2010 utf8

I have tables collating latin1_general_ci and have turkish character values. And i can use this data on delphi 7+zeos with no problem. but i want to upgrade my delphi to 2010 version but zeos too slow as i saw. so i want to use odbc+ado or dbexpress solution. dbexpress solution works fine , display my data as entered and write as entered table without any change to column charset. but dbexpress has problems as i saw. for example when i select * from table which has column types as varchar,decimal,int,tinyint,text give av errors on xp systems. vista and 7 does not give any error and work fine(not fully tested). in xp systems access violation trace is the access violation debug trace is |7C9010E0|ntdll.dll | | |RtlLeaveCriticalSection | | |7E419239|USER32.dll | | |CharUpperBuffW | | |7E419216|USER32.dll | | |CharUpperBuffW | | |7C80CED0|kernel32.dll| | |LCMapStringW | | |7C910380|ntdll.dll | | |RtlImageNtHeader | | |7C903247|ntdll.dll | | |RtlConvertUlongToLargeInteger| | |7C90E485|ntdll.dll | | |KiUserApcDispatcher | | |009A631E|Project1.exe|Unit1.pas |TForm1|Button1Click |110[37]| ado solution(dbgo) works fine but its not show my data as entered.its want everything be utf. but i don't want to convert my data to utf before test everything. how can i see my data as entered and write client side utf and store latin1(as zeos or dbexpress do). i was tried many other options. eg. mysql side collation and charset parameters. sorry for my bad english. i hope someone understand me. thanks.
