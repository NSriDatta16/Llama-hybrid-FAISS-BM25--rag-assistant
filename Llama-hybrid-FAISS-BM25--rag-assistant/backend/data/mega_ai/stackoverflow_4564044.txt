Magento local.xml layout file - overriding

Is there any way to override, or re-add something that was removed via it's xml layout, using local.xml? I've made a theme that's all based on one page layout, 2columns-left. But a lot of pages, such as the sitemap, are set to use a 1column layout. So for example, in catalog.xml, we have: Catalog Seo Sitemap (Common) page/1column.phtml And in my local.xml, I can override the root template to use by adding: page/2columns-left.phtml So it's now showing the sitemap in a 2column left layout. But there's nothing in the left column, as the has removed it. I hate that I have to override this whole catalog.xml just to remove that, as it's a pain then when they update to a new version, I need to update all these extra layout files too. So, is there any way to fix that using my local.xml? I think for the default Magento themes, they should have everything set to use the 3column layout, as that way you're free to remove whatever you don't need, but it's all there by default, so all changes can be done in the local.xml file.
