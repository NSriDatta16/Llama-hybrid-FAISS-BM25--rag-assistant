You're right that averaging over the responses and performing a repeated measures ANOVA is not the ideal thing to do. Your intuitions are good; there should be a difference between a global accuracy that's based on 48 responses and one based on 400. First, you should be using logistic regression. If you're not very familiar with that, it may help you to read the answer I wrote to this question: difference between logit and probit models . Although it was written in a different context, there's a lot of information about logistic regression, and it can help you get a sense of what it's about. Logistic regression, in its basic form, is for independent data, and your data are not independent. To deal with this, you want to either fit a logistic regression model using the generalized estimating equations, or fit a GLiMM. The choice of which to use is based on the nature of the question you want to ask. I discuss these issues in this question: difference between generalized linear models generalized linear mixed models in SPSS . For more thorough explanations of these topics, you may want to read Agresti's Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis . One thing I think you won't need to worry about is the size of the clusters though, these will work fine with your situation. HTH.
