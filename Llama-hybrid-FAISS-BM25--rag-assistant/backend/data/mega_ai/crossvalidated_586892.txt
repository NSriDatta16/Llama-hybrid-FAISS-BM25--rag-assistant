RMSE is non-negative, so it obviously doesn't make sense to ask for a negative one. Your response is in 1000 USD, so the RMSE is also in this unit. Using the empirical rule, you can say that approximately, 2/3 of the predictions are within 2200 USD of the observed values. If you prefer a relative performance measure, you can study by how much better the MSE of your model is compared to the average. This is called R-squared and can easily be obtained using the score() method. Hyperparameter selection might leads to a better model. There is no need to scale the input of a tree-based model.
