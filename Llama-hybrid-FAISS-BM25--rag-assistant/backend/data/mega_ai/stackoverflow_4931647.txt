Yes, you can either embed the external library in your bundle or wrap ("OSGIfy") the library as an OSGi bundle. For both options, Pax Construct ( http://www.ops4j.org/projects/pax/construct ) is a good tool. If your external library itself has dependencies, embed all of these in a single bundle or use Pax Construct to wrap them transitive. If have to to choose between wrapping or embedding, consider dependency management and versioning of bundles. If you need to upgrade the external library and it's embedded in your own application bundle, you always release both the library and your own code. It is e.g also not possible to have 2 version of the library active without having 2 version of your application bundle active. And also... if you are not working in an OSGi environment, would you like to add third-party classes in your application jars? So why do it in an OSGi environment? I personally prefer in such a case to see the external lib as a black box, and wrap the library and it's dependencies in a single bundle.
