Your series does not pass all stationarity tests, it merely passes the ADF test. And even the ADF test is not a test of stationarity, it is a test of presence of a unit root. Your time series certainly does not appear to have a unit root; its level is stable. Hence, ADF rejects the null hypothesis of presence of a unit root. But that does not imply stationarity. ACF and PACF are not tests per se, and they only reveal autocorrelations but may miss other traits of nonstationarity such as nonconstant variance. ACF and PACF indicate 24-period seasonality; no surprise given that your data seems to be hourly. However, when adjusted for seasonality, your series might be stationary. Perhaps auto.arima (available from the forecast package in R; there is a counterpart in Python, too) or a similar algorithm will find a stationary model that is statistically adequate.
