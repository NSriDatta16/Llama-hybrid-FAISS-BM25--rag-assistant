Create a php/mysql form to be embedded on many different websites

I am not sure where to start, and would appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction. I would like to create a simple form 'widget' for embedding on different websites. The idea is that the form reside on my server, and the form information will be submitted to the database on my server, but will be embedded on other sites. ** The form has dynamic drop down menus that populate based on $_GET variables. For example, if I were using an iframe it would look like this... Should I use an iframe or would javascript be better for this, is there a better way? What are the security concerns that I need to look out for?
