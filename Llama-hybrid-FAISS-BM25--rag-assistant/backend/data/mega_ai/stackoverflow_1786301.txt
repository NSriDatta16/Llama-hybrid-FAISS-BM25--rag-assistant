Quite often the code fragments become large enough that it looks like this: #if WINDOWS void dowindowsroutine() { } #else void dounixroutine() { } #endif int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { #if WINDOWS dowindowsroutine(); #else dounixroutine(); #endif return 0; } Yes, here's an example of where you would indent preprocessor macros. Sometimes it becomes large enough that we do it in the linker (linking against impwindows.o or impunix.o depending on makefile switch).
