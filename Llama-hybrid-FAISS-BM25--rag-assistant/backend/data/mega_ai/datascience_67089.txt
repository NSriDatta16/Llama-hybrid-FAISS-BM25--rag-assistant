Anomaly Detection/Novelty detection

I have a data-set that has over 6 million normal data and around 50 anomaly data. Those anomaly data is identified manually (by monitoring the user`s activity over camera and identify). I need to develop a model to detect these anomalies. My problem is that the anomaly data looks like normal data, which means they are not outliers or has a certain pattern. If I plot the normal data over anomaly data they are in the same distribution. I tried several anomaly detection approaches: Multivariate Gaussian Distribution Approach to identify anomalies I tried to create new features that anomaly data will be outliers and then I can use Multivariate Gaussian Distribution Approach, but could not able to find any combination to isolate the anomalies. I guess there is no point of using a classification algorithm since dataset is highly imbalanced. I tried OneClassSVM, DecisionTree, RandomForest but AUC is 0.5 (as good as random). How to implement a model for this kind of scenario? Other methods which I can think about: Develop a NN with AutoEncoders Try Generate Synthetic Samples and resample the dataset
