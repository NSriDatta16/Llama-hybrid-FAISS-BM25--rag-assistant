Find element in array with lowest difference from average in C

I need to set the size of array. After that I start to input numbers to dill this array. During that procedure I count sum for calculating average later. Now I have an array and average and I need to find the element with lowest difference from average. Like: array size = 3 input = 1 input = 2 input = 3 average = 2 Counting abs( 1 - 2 ) = 1 abs( 2 - 2 ) = 0 abs( 3 - 2 ) = 1 So the lowest difference have the element with value 2 . And in the end of the program I need to out put that element from array and its index. So far I came up with: #include #include int main( int argc, char **argv ) { int n = 0, i = 0; double average = 0; int sum = 0; double tmp = 0; double min = 0; int index = 0; int *a; double *b; printf("Amount of elements = "); scanf("%d", &n); if( 0 == n ) { return 0; } if( n 10 ) { return 0; } a = ( int* )malloc( sizeof( *a ) * n ); b = ( double* )malloc( sizeof( *b ) * n ); while( i Update: My apologies. The question is how to achive the last part without macking this simple program even more complicated. Thank you all for help.
