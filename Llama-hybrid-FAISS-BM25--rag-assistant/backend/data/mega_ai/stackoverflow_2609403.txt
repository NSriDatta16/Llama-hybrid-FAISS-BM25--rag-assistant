Since you say you're new to the mac: You can configure the trackpad to accept clicks directly (that is, tapping on the pad is the equivalent of clicking the button). In that way, left-clicks can be performed either by clicking the trackpad button or by tapping the trackpad itself. Right-clicks are, in Mac-land, sometimes represented by control-clicks (which gets hairy when the application is programmed to accept control-clicks, but that's a whole 'nother story...) So you can hold the control key and click the trackpad button, or tap the trackpad, to get a right-click. You can further configure the trackpad to accept two-finger taps on the trackpad as right-clicks (no control key needed); also, two-finger drags can scroll, like a scroll wheel.
