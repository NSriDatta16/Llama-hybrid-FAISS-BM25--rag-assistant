Interpretation of probability should be consistent across all probability statements: Regardless of the interpretation of probability that one is using in Bayesian analysis, that interpretation ought to be consistent across different kinds of probability statements . In terms of the fundamental meaning of what probability actually is, there is no reason to interpret sampling probabilities (relating to observable values conditional on unobserved parameters) differently to prior probabilities (relating to unobserved parameters). Thus, if a Bayesian gives an epistemic interpretation to probability, and treats the prior as an encapsulation of his beliefs about uncertainty in the unobservable parameters, then consistency requires that he should also give the postulated sampling distribution (and thus the likelihood function) an epistemic interpretation, reflecting his beliefs about the uncertainty in the sampling process. "Subjectivism" is where it gets tricky: When you start talking about the "subjective" interpretation things get a little muddier, since that term can refer to two different things, broadly classified as "weak subjectivism" and "strong subjectivism". Weak subjectivism: In this interpretation, the term "subjective" is used in its weaker sense, meaning merely that probability encapsulates the beliefs of a subject. (Some people prefer to use the term "epistemic" for this concept, since it does not actually require subjectivity in the stronger sense.) In this case both the likelihood and prior refer to beliefs of the subject, so both the likelihood and prior are "subjective" in this weak sense. Consistency requires that either both are weakly subjective, or neither are weakly subjective. Strong subjectivism: In this interpretation, the term "subjective" is used in its stronger sense, meaning that weak subjectivism holds, and furthermore, the subject's belief lacks any outside "objective" justification (i.e., two or more different subjects could all hold different beliefs, and none would be more wrong than the others). In this case the "subjectivity" of the prior refers not only to the fact that it encapsulates the subject's belief, but also to the fact that it is not grounded in an objective justification, and that it may legitimately differ between subjects. It is possible for the prior to be "subjective" in this stronger sense, and the likelihood "objective", insofar as it is a belief based on an objective justification. Example of the difference: Suppose you have a series of exchangeable binary values $X_1,X_2,X_3,...$ where belief in exchangeability is based on some objective reasoning referring to outside conditions. In this case, the belief in exchangeability logically leads (via de Finetti's representation theorem) to belief in the sampling distribution: $$X_1,X_2,X_3,... \sim \text{IID Bern}(\theta) \quad \quad \quad \theta \equiv \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i.$$ Now, it might be the case that there is no objective reasoning that favours any particular prior for $\theta$ (e.g., you eschew appeal to "non-informative" priors), and so you simply decide to choose a prior that reflects your own personal beliefs about $\theta$ . In this case both the likelihood and prior would be "subjective" in the weaker sense (more accurately described as "epistemic"), but only the prior would be "subjective" in the stronger sense.
