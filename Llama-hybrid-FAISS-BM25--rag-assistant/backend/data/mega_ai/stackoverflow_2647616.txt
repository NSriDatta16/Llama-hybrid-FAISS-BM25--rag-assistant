@Zombies, let me show you a quick example from a script I wrote recently: def fetch(build, toFile) { new FTPClient().with { connect ftpServer enterLocalPassiveMode() login ftpUser, ftpPassword changeWorkingDirectory "/var/staging/revision-${build}" fileType = FTPClient.BINARY_FILE_TYPE toFile.withOutputStream { ostream -> retrieveFile "build-${build}.zip", ostream } disconnect() } } It uses commons-net API, but I think you would agree that it has a much clearer syntax than comparable Java program. So I don't think using the Java APIs defeats the purpose of having a scripting language. Furthermore, it helps you leverage your existing knowledge of the Java APIs, so is a very pragmatic approach.
