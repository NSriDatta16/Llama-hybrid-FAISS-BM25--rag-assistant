"nudge" a (table)View to use a Navigation Bar?

my Context is a tableView controlled by a Navigation Controller. So when i select a row, a new view is pushed by the navigation controller. Now i want also to "nudge" (like the effect on the start-screen to switch through the App-overview, i hope you know what i mean) to another view (also a tableView, similar to the first View) or back. I tried this by using the touchesBegan and touchesMoved methods, but I wasn't able to realise this. Is there an easier way? Thank you very much! Jonathan
