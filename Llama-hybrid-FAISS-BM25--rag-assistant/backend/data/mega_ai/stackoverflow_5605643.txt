As Qberticus mentions, commons-logging will work within Android. I just confirmed this by dropping the commons-logging library into an Android project and logging messages at the INFO level. Commons-logging will default to the Jdk14 logging framework, which will then pass through to the Android Logging subsystem, with results viewable in logcat. The tag is set to the class whose log is used: for example, using the log from LogFactory.getLog(Foo.class) will have the tag "Foo".
