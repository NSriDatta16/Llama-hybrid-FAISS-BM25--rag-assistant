Is LINQ a valid option?

We (my team) are about to start development of a mission critical project, one of the sub-systems of this project is a Windows service. This service will be a backbone of the entire system and has to respond as per mission critical standard. This service will contain many lists to minimize database interaction and to gain performance, I am estimating average size of a list to be 250,00 under normal circumstances. Is it a good idea to use LINQ to query data from these queues, or should I follow my original plan of creating indexed list? Indexed List is a custom implementation of Idictionary , which will work like an index and will have many performance oriented features such as MRU, Index rebuilding, etc.
