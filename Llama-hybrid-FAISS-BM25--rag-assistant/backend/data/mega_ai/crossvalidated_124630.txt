What is meant by this formulation of Bayes' Rule?

From the Wikipedia article on Bayesian inference, we get the following formulation of Bayes' Rule: $$p(\theta \mid \mathbf{X},\alpha) = \frac{p(\mathbf{X} \mid \theta) p(\theta \mid \alpha)}{p(\mathbf{X} \mid \alpha)} \propto p(\mathbf{X} \mid \theta) p(\theta \mid \alpha).$$ I do not understand this at all. How does one arrive at this equation from the humble $p(A\mid B) = \frac{p(B\mid A)p(A)}{p(B)}$? (I understand Bayes' Rule well in a Frequentist context.) Also, what is the meaning of the numerator $p(\mathbf{X} \mid \theta) p(\theta \mid \alpha)$, and how is it different from $p(\mathbf{X} \mid \alpha)$?
