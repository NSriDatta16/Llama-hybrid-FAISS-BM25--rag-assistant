It's almost easier to build a quick Proof of Concept service that demonstrates how clean and simple it is. A simple SQLAlchemy mapping with a quick demo of query processing. A simple template showing how cool Mako is. A simple Pylons app to put the two together. Most important -- use their application and their data. Not a lame hello world; not an existing tutorial. If they want to compare your clean, elegant demo of their app with .NET and J2EE, they'll see that other languages lead to a much, much bigger code base. Edit Show them this: http://python.org/about/success/ Also, one of the best Python demos is to do things the way the SQLAlchemy and Django tutorials do things -- in interactive python from the >>> prompt. Nothing is more exciting than programming which is so simple you can do it interactively. You won't find a lot of compelling case studies. Python is a community. .Net and J2EE are products. .Net has Microsoft's advertising backing it; Microsoft can afford to do extensive surveys and studies of their product. Same for Sun (soon to be Oracle) and J2EE -- lots of marketing hype backing up their claims. Python just has what's on the Python.org site ( http://python.org/about/ ). The various related projects (Pylons, Mako and SQLAlchemy) don't have lavish case study whitepapers. They do have a large number of downloads, and lots of word of mouth. But if someone's looking for "proof" that Python works better than .Net, there's not going to be much.
