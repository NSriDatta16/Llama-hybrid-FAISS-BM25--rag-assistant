Advices to create a data set from dictionnary's screenshot

I have six thousand screenshots like the one below. I would like to create a date set to do some deep learning. My goal in the end is to create the next word prediction using only my own word data set. (For exemple, I found this : Next word prediction ) So for the first step, I would like to extract the english word of the photo (here it's reckless). Do you think I can code something to do it for me because it might be "reckless" to write them down six thousand time. I have ubuntu 20/windows 10 I code a lot with python and I tried in the past Java, C and Ocaml for a semester. Thank you for your help.
