SQL Server reporting services..Best advise for integrating with other technologies?

I'm looking to implement SQL Server Reporting Services as our standard reporting platform in our company. We were trialing Crystal Reports, but alas it seems to be plagued by issues. SQL Server Reporting Services looks to be a great product, but I have a concern or two. I have some existing web apps in ColdFusion, and the backend is in MySQL. If I move forward with SQL Server Reporting Services, how should I set up my environment? Is there a JDBC connector or is ODBC the only way to talk to this? How does it integrate for the user? Will I need to re-authenticate the user to view the reports? Will I need to put a link in ColdFusion to link to the Reporting Services system? Is there a way to make it seamless for the user? Should I port all the backend to SQL Server to fully leverage the SQL Server platform? Should I convert my existing apps to ASP.NET, and make the entire platform SQL Server / ASP.NET? It's not too bad in the fact that the existing apps / MySQL aren't of a size that is too big to port. So I guess just looking for some best practice advise to see if its okay to use the reporting services component on its own, or if I'm much better to consolidate everything into a Microsoft solution.
