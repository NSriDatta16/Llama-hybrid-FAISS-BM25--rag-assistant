Get mode of decision trees from Random Forest

I am trying to find out how to determine / display the mode of the decision trees (used by Random Forest to make further predictions / assignments). I am using library(randomForest) in R: r I can extract a given tree using t where k is the tree number. However, in my understanding, Random Forest is using the mode of these trees to classify new items. How can I access this, and perhaps display a final decision tree?
