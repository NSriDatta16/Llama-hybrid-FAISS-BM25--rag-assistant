If you know that the die is fair, then this can equally be viewed as a Bayesian interpretation with a dogmatic prior that puts all prior probability on the die being fair, so one could argue that the Bayesian interpretation does equally well. If, on the other hand, the die is not fair, then, if you have prior knowledge on the sense in which it is not fair, you may improve your inference over the frequentist estimator $n_6/n$ , especially when $n$ is "small".
