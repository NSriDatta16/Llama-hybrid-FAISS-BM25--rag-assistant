Generating unique ids from a custom place-value notation for a URL Shortener

I want to make a URL shortener that has this URL format: http://myurlshortner.com/ {id} Where the id is unique and generated from the following place-value notation sequence/system/series: 0 1 2 . . . 9 a b c . . . z For example: http://myurlshortner.com/1b6z For saving the entry to database, I want to make id the primary key(or unique field) that increments with every new entry and follows the above mentioned sequence. How can I do this? For data storage, I will use Amazon SimpleDB. So there won't be any stored procedures or other DBMS functionality like there are in MySQL that I can use. This is exactly(almost) like how URL shortners like http://tinyurl.com and http://bit.ly work. ...and I am coding in PHP. I hope you understand my question.
