Hein, there are a lot of tools and libs with the functionality available. Which to choose depends whether you would like to use a gui for your work or if you would like to embed it in some other program. Standalone Data mining tools (there are ohters like WEKA with Java interface): Rapid Miner Orange Rattle gui for R KNIME Text based: GNU R Libs: Scikit for Python Mahout on Hadoop If you know a programming language well enough I would use a lib for that language or give R a try. If not you may try one of the tools with gui. A tree example in R: # we are using the iris dataset data(iris) # for our tree based model we use the rpart package # to download it type install.packages("rpart") library(rpart) # Building the tree fit As suggested the analysis with R requires you to code yourself, but you will find a package for most classification tasks which will work out of the box. An overview can be found here Machine Learning Task View To get started with RapidMinder you should have a look at Youtube. There are some screencasts, even for decision trees.
