If it's huge data base plus massive read-write in real-time much like apps layered on Twitter feeds and Facebook, you are probably going to be more worried about how fast and efficiently you can retrieve data from database. There are tools to do so, in both, Java and PHP, so you are not going to be worried much what you start with. I would suggest to with one you have more suitable tools and APIs to develop on. So, to answer your questions: For a system like ours, does it even matter what we go with? It does not matter what you choose. At least, when starting it is premature to decide what's the best. I've seen pretty efficient system on Java. So, I am inclined towards Java. Because at the end, it's the performance boosters that matter.... or am I entirely wrong in thinking that? Performance boost will come with faster data-retrieval and ability to handle large request load. Java scales pretty well. But there are high performance sites build on PHP. I would say, it's a good idea to evaluate what makes you to do less work in getting your app done and go with that. In massive load situations, you might have to tweak things in either of the cases.
