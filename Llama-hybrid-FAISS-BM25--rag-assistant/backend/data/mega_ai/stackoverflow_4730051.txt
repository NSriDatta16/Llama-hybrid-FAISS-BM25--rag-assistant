I've always been more interested in maintenance tasks than posting; I sprinted to 3k in a couple weeks so I could edit and close and then mellowed out a bit. I live in the 10k tools pages these days, and spend almost all my SO time on maintenance stuff: fixing posts by new users (oh how I love /review ), retagging, going through spam/offensive flags, and checking active [un]close/[un]delete votes. I'm constantly flagging things for mod attention, and they're almost always acted on, which is probably a good sign. I also spend a ridiculous amount of time on meta , and I've posted the comment "you'll have to wait for a moderator to fix that" entirely too many times. Mod tools are very helpful for solving whole categories of problems (reputation confusion, merging accounts, suspicious voting patterns, etc.), and I'd rather help people with them directly then tell them "the good news is this is fixable; the bad news is I can't do anything about it" Finally, I'm a pro-tem mod on the Unix and Linux SE , so I'm familiar with what mods do on a daily basis. And so far they don't hate me there yet, so I'm not terrible at it, but they have far ( far ) fewer requests for mod help than SO does, and I'd like to help here as well
