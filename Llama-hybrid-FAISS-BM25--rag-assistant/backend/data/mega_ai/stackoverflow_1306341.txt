Do you know what, specifically you're testing? Measuring "performance" is almsot always useless, unless you know exactly what it is you want. For example, are you looking for low latency on query result retrieval? Perhaps high throughput on date retrieval? Perhaps you care more about fast insertions into the database, and less about fast query results? Perhaps you care about different things on different tables (in fact, that's almost always the case). My advice will probably be ignored, but I'll say it anyway: Don't optimise before you know what you want. Don't optimise as you write the code. When you do get around to optimising your database, make sure you optimise for the right things. Use realistic data - if you're testing dictionary-sized hunks of text, don't test with binary data (for example). Anyway, I realise you were probably looking for a more technical answer, but hey...
