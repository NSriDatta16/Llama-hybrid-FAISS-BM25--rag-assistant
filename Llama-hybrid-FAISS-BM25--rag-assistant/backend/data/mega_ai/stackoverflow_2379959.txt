The character รก is not represented a single byte in UTF-8 strings, but the two-byte sequence C3 , A1 . So when you slice [0,1] from the string you get only the first byte of it, \C3 or \303 , which you can't meaningfully upcase . Ruby 1.8 doesn't do Unicode, so you're going to be fighting against byte strings and having lots of problems like this trying to write internationally-aware applications in it. See eg. this question for some background. Ruby 1.9 finally fixes this (although I dislike its approach).
