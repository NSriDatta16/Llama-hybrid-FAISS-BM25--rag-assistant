This is a tricky topic in general; because of the size variability you mentioned it rather boils down to motif finding. Yet I can propose four ideas: Supposing that you can align sequences (ok, you always can, but let's say it yields non nonsense consensus), you can reduce the problem to the conserved region and make attributes out of aligned residues. Finding important residues will then be a simple feature selection. Look for motifs using MEME or something more fancy to make PWM and just hope it will work. Sequence logo will show you the residue importance based on the predictive power it applies. Make attributes out of N-gram spectra, i.e. counts of all possible N-residue words for few values of N (till your computer won't explode). Or use SVM with string kernel, it usually boils to the same thing. >
