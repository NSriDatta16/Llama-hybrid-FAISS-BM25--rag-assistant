Whenever you want to change the visual appearance of anything in Silverlight, you have to think in terms of VisualStateManager. To change the appearance of a Selected DataGrid cell, you'll need to avail yourself to the wonders of VSM. By editing DataGridColumn.CellStyle's "Selected" state you can change the appearance of the selected grid cell. In Blend, drag and drop a new DataGrid on a Page. Right click on the DataGrid and choose "Add Column --> Add DataGridTemplateColumn" Right click on the DataGridTemplateColumn in the "Object and timeline" pane and go "Edit Column Styles --> Edit CellStyle --> Edit Copy" Right click on "Style" in the "objects and timeline" pane and go "Edit Template --> Edit Current". Now comes the interesting part, how to specifically solve the problem of a disappearing button. If the button is the only thing you've got in that CellTemplate then you can just hide the whole contents of the cell. Select the "Selected" state from the "States" pane. Set the visibility of the ContentPresenter in the CellStyle.Template to Collapsed. (A nicer UX would be to add a 0.3seconds animation taking opacity from 100% to 0%). Essentially this whole tutorial is about getting to the CellStyle.Template for your DataGridColumn and adding an animation to the Selected State.
