Using an Android resources efficiently

I'm trying to figure out how to use Android's resource system efficiently, both to provide the highest resolution resources and to keep the .apk size low. My resource folders: drawable-normal-mdpi drawable-normal-hdpi drawable-large-mdpi Now the way I'm using the resources (a game) the normal-hdpi and large-mdpi are exactly the same. I don't want to include both in my final .apk because its going to inflate the size unnecessarily. Is there a way to get around this? I tried to use a symbolic link (linux) but the android tools follow the links and copy the resources.
