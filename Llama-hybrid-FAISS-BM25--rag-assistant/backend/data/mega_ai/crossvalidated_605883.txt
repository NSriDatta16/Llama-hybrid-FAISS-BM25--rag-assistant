Is updating gamma conjugate distributions always increasing?

In Bayesian inference, the gamma distribution is the conjugate prior to many likelihood distributions: Poisson, exponential, normal (with known mean), etc. The update rule seems to always add to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . For example, if: $$ X \sim \Gamma(\alpha, \beta)\\ Y\sim Poisson(X) $$ then $$ X|Y \sim \Gamma(\alpha + Y, \beta + 1) $$ Many examples can be found, e.g. here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior Is it always true that the updated Gamma parameters are always larger? Could this be proven? Formally, if $X \sim \Gamma(\alpha, \beta), X|Y \sim Gamma(\alpha', \beta'$ ), is it always true that $\alpha' \ge \alpha$ and $\beta' \ge \beta$ ?
