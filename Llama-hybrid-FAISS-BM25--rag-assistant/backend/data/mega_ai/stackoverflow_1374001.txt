One of the best explanations I've seen of a bad design pattern is New Life for EJB by Rajat Taneja and Ganesh Prasad. Some very bad design patterns were widely used. EJB 1 and especially EJB 2 made it into wide spread use despite being convoluted and badly designed. Taneja and Prasad give a lucid explanation of what is wrong with those specifications. They also don't think very highly of the EJB 3 spec.
