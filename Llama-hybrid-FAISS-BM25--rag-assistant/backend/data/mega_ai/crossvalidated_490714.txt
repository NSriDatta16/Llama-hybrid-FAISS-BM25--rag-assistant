The reason why $H\neq W^T$ is that for two vector $a$ and $b$ to be orthogonal, you need: $$\sum_{i=1}^n a_ib_i=0$$ This will typically be achieved by having $a_ib_i$ to be positive at some indices and negative at others - and this is not possible under non-negative matrix factorization. If you factor $A$ as $WW^T$ (maybe with eigendecomposition or Cholesky), the resulting $W$ will almost certainly have negative numbers in it. As for the interpretation, I'm afraid I can't figure out the correct intuition for NMF of a adjacency matrix. I would advise you not to discard SVD-like approaches, since there are many interesting results in spectral theory applied to adjacency matrices, including spectral graph theory, spectral embeddings and spectral clustering. Those approaches might be well suited to your use case (and info about these methods seems to be way easier to find online).
