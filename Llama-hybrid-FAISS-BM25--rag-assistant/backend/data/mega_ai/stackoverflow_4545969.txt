You've already identified why setReadDataOnly() isn't working. enableMemoryOptimization() is not a valid method for any class within PHPExcel. If you wish to optimise memory, you enable one of the cell cacheing methods before loading any file or instantiating a new PHPExcel object. $inputFileType = 'Excel2007'; $inputFileName = 'testBook.xlsx'; $r = PHPExcel_CachedObjectStorageFactory::initialize(PHPExcel_CachedObjectStorageFactory::cache_to_phpTemp); if (!$r) { die('Unable to set cell cacheing'); } $objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader($inputFileType); $objReader->setReadDataOnly(true); $objPHPExcel = $objReader->load($inputFileName); EDIT The thread on enableMemoryOptimization() that you link to in your question is from a user who wanted this built into PHPExcel in a way that broke most of the class's functionality, while improving performance for his specific use case (at the expense of most other users); and which would have resulted in two incompatible methods for manipulating data within the library. As such, I rejected it.
