We have a number of policies, which are enforced via an in-house plug-in to Visual Studio. We check that code compiles and that unit tests have be run successfully. At the moment we also check code coverage and issue warnings for code which doesn't have enough tests. We also do various consistency checks and verify that an appropriate task is present in our change management system in order to provide traceability for all changes. The advantage of tool support is great, as it is not really up to people to respect the policies, but obviously there's a drawback as well as these checks take time to run. However, with many developers it is hard to enforce standards without proper tool support.
