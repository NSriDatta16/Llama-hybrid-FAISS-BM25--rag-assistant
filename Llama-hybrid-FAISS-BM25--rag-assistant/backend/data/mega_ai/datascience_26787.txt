Format for time series data with non-trivial sampled data

I have a data stream that I would like to share with some data scientists. It is a regularly captured time series with some fields that are simple scalars, booleans. Each sample has a UTC time and fractional seconds since start of capture. Also captured is a 3d spline that varies in size. These splines are also regularly sampled. Additionally, there are some other multi dimensional fields as well ([x,y,z,pitch,yaw,roll]). For simple data sets I would normally use CSV. However due to the nature of the more complex data I need a more appropriate format. What are my options for formats that would allow easy loading into Matlab or other common data science tools?
