How to bridge between seemingly unrelated but congruent PDF and PMF?

Let's assume a probability mass function $P$ on the discrete domain $\{0,...,N\}$ and a density function $f$ and the existence of two real factors $a$ and $b$ so that we have for all numbers $k$ in $\{0,...,N\}$: $$P(k) = a * f(k * b)$$ What can be said about the theoretical / mathematical relationship between $P$ and $f$? Can $f$ be used to understand $P$ and vice versa? (I hope my question is not too fuzzy - in case it is, I would adjust it according to suggestions) To add some context: library(VGAM) #drayleigh N 1, prod(1 - (1:(k-1)/N)), 1) plot(1:N, sapply(1:N, p, N)) a p defines a random process (I think it is a Markov chain) that will sample from {0,1} until 1 is chosen and then stops. The probability of choosing 1 increases linearly from 0 to 1 within N+1 steps. The Rayleigh distribution is a special case of the Weibull distribution which is used for modelling mortality. The process I define above could obviously serve as a very simple model for mortality - the older you get the higher the probability of dying until an age of 100 where dying can be considered as certain. But I am wondering whether I could f.x. infer from my simple process an intuitive idea that helps understanding what the Rayleigh distribution captures. And because I expect this situation to come up again in the future I am asking for a general answer. But of course insights into this specific context are welcome.
