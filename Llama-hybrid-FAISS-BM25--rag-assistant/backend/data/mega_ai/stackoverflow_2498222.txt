Depending on how many bugs "manual testing" turns up, you could simply do test-driven bug fixing which in my experience is far more effective than simply driving up code coverage by writing "post-mortem" unit tests. (Which is not to say writing unit tests afterwards is a bad idea, it's just that TDD is almost always a better idea .)
