Is the output of logistic regression the chance that the event occurs?

I used gradient descent to obtain the coefficients for a logistic regression function. When I run my function on my test data set, I get values between 0 and 1. If I get a predicted value of say, .7, and the actual value is 1, I count that as a correct prediction. I say that the prediction says there is a 70% chance the event happens. Is my reasoning correct?
