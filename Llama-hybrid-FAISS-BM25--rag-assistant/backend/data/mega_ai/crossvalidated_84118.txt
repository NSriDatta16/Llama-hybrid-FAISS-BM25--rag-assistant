Is there justification for using cross validation scores as model averaging weights?

Bayesian model averaging uses approximate Bayes factors. Some researchers use AIC to weight models. Is there justification for using, say, the Brier score, median absolute deviation, or other such scores computed from out of sample predictions to construct weights for model averaging instead of the various information criteria? I played around with this a while back when averaging the results of popular election forecast models.
