You're very close, the deflate documentation has a sample configuration that shows how to gzip specific files or how to exempt certain files: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html Place the BrowserMatch rules in a FilesMatch to make them only apply to PDFs. http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#filesmatch That should work, good luck! UPDATE After some more information from the question poster it seems that mod_filter should be able to combine conditions for User-Agent (Browser) and Content-Type. (discussion in comments)
