ANN time series classification validation loss never decreases

Problem statement: E2E classifier Input : [7x3600] time series of physiological parameters recorded from a medical device. Output : I am trying to learn a binary classifier to determine if the device is in use (with biological material) or experiencing a maintenance test. Data : ~500 labeled examples. ~30:70 imbalance Loss metric : 3x positive class weighted Binary Cross Entropy. Baseline: Randomly assigning positive case 3/5 of time => ~1.1 Problems Non ANN approaches: Random forest & ROCKET did not give compelling results. Tried using standard MLP, 1d-CNN and a RNN(S4) approach. All methods overfit after 1-2 epochs and validation loss is never better than optimally randomly assigning class. On one single run (1d-CNN 6 layers, with some pooling & layernorm no residual connections) validation loss decreased to 0.6 but without adjusting hyperparams or model structure this never happened again. Tried leveraging pretrained image classifiers by making images of the graphs with fixed axes. Also no better results. In each case: Upping L2 regularisation does not help. Dropout ( I have not tried transformers, so may try this or a VAE based classifier. Questions Am I being greedy seeking a loss of I want to maximise the test-AUROC ideally >0.9 Do I need more data?
