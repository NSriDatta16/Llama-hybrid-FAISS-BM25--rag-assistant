For future reference: I just had this happen to me. It turned out, the header (.h) file was not actually included in the project. The tricky part is, Xcode still let me jump between counterparts and edit the file as normal, but when I tried to reveal the file in the group tree, it wasn't there. Dragging the file back into the project from the Finder fixed the problem.
