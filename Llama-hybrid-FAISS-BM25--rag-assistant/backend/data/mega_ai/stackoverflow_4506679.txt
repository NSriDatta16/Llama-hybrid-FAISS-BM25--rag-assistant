Rendering plain text through PHP

For some reason, I want to serve my robots.txt via a PHP script. I have setup apache so that the robots.txt file request (infact all file requests) come to a single PHP script. The code I am using to render robots.txt is: echo "User-agent: wget\n"; echo "Disallow: /\n"; However, it is not processing the newlines. How to server robots.txt correctly, so search engines (or any client) see it properly? Do I have to send some special headers for txt files? EDIT 1: Now I have the following code: header("Content-Type: text/plain"); echo "User-agent: wget\n"; echo "Disallow: /\n"; which still does not display newlines (see http://sarcastic-quotes.com/robots.txt ). EDIT 2: Some people mentioned its just fine and not displayed in browser. Was just curious how does this one display correctly: http://en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt EDIT 3: I downloaded both mine and wikipedia's through wget, and see this: $ file en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt: UTF-8 Unicode English text $ file sarcastic-quotes.com/robots.txt sarcastic-quotes.com/robots.txt: ASCII text FINAL SUMMARY: Main issue was I was not setting the header. However, there is another internal bug, which is making the Content-Type as html. (this is because my request is actually served through an internal proxy but thats another issue). Some comments that browsers don't display newline were only half-correct -> modern browsers correctly display newline if content-type is text/plain. I am selecting the answer that closely matched the real problem and was void of the above slightly misleading misconception :). Thanks everyone for the help and your time! thanks JP
