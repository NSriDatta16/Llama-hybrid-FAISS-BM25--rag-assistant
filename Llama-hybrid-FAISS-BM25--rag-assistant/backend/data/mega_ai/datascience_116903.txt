Finding one time series signal among 1000 incoming signals

I have one IoT signal, which should be recognized among 1000 incoming IoT signals. However, I receive only values and signalID. What approach would you suggest for this kind of problem? I have done a lot of time-series classification problems, but here, I have a lot of signals which are not trained. My dataset is straightforward: timestamp signalA t1 value1A t2 value2A ... ... The dataset I get from IoT devices has the same structure, but 1000 columns. Therefore, I should recognize the signal A in that dataset.
