As mkt said in a comment, linear regression does not assume the dependent variable is itself normally distributed, but only the residuals. Regarding the non-linearity, you can consider a non-linear transformation of the predictor variables. For continuous variables like the age, taking a logarithm often helps. You can also try a polynomial, or splines, e.g. restricted cubic splines. For discrete variables, whose values are just arbitrary encodings, you are free to change the encoding. E.g. instead 0, 1, and 2 for low, mid, and high, you may take 0, 1, and 5, if it makes the dependency more linear. Update: "Normality" is a mathematical ideal which can never be truly achieved in practice. Even for your data where the Shapiro-Wilk test is negative! The negative test result does not confirm that the data are normally distributed; it just fails to reject that hypothesis. So, the true question which you should be interested in is whether the violation of normality assumption is so strong than an alternative gives better prediction than the ordinary least squares regression. As of alternatives, I can think of mean absolute deviation (MAD) or SVM regression with a linear kernel (which is basically a MAD regression with some tolerance $\epsilon$ ), but I don't know whether they are available in Stata.
