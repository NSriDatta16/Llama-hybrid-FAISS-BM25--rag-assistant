Search text with a regular expression to match outside specific characters

I have text that looks like: My name is (Richard) and I cannot do [whatever (Jack) can't do] and (Robert) is the same way [unlike (Betty)] thanks (Jill) The goal is to search using a regular expression to find all parenthesized names that occur anywhere in the text BUT in-between any brackets. So in the text above, the result I am looking for is: Richard Robert Jill
