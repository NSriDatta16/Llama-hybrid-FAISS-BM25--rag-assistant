What do you mean with "recording in progress"? You have an app that is recording something? The easiest way (which doesn't require any additional permissions) is to give any of your views android:keepScreenOn=true (there's also setKeepScreenOn() ). If you want to be hardcore, you can request a wakelock permission, but that should not be necessary - if you have a UI, keepScreenOn is a much more elegant solution.
