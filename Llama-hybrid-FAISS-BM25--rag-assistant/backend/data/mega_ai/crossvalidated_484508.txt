How to compute confidence interval for Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV)

I have a very small data set of 50 samples, and I am performing LOOCV for evaluating the performance of a simple logistic regression model. I want to know the confidence interval of my evaluation, is this possible for LOOCV? I have tried running the loocv experiment multiple times with different random seeds (including setting the random state in the scikit learn implementation of logistic regression), I always get the same results for each run so the variance is zero. My background is not statistics so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks. UPDATE: Thanks very much for all the answers below! I have learned not just this particular problem but cross validation in general. https://avehtari.github.io/modelselection/CV-FAQ.html is also a good source of information for learning the problem around CV.
