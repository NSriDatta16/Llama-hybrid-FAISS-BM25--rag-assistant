Statistical test to find difference in mean for sample that is not normally distributed

I have a time series that has a non-normal distribution and I'd like to find out if it's mean (or drift of the cumulative sum) is statistially significantly different to zero. I know that if the time series has a normally distributed return, I could use a pared t-test, but since in my case I would violate that assumptation I'm looking for an alternative. Any suggestions are appreciated.
