It would invalidate the model to remove insignificant variables. What does not have the same mean? If you are using binary logistic regression and are referring to the prevalence of $Y$, this can vary from sample to sample as long as what explains the difference is captured in the covariates. But the bigger problem is that data splitting is a highly inefficient way to validate a logistic model. My course notes present better ways: http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/rms .
