The mixture of the domain object with the service layer is the biggest bad practice (if you see that as a bad practice). You end up calling user.Save() which means if you want to change your ORM, you are reliant on this pattern. The 2 alternatives are a layer aka a set of facade classes to perform your CRUD operations, or to put this inside the domain object as something like User.Service.Save(user); If you're using .NET then ActiveRecord is obviously ActiveRecord based, Coolstorage, Subsonic and a few others .
