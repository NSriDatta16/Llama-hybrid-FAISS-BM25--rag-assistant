As others have said, it's not possible to do this in a standard way - what you end up with will be platform-specific: CPU because of the way opcodes are structured (relative vs. absolute references), OS because you'll likely need to set page protection to be allowed to execute from stack. Furthermore, it's compiler-dependent: there's no standard-and-guaranteed way to get the size of a function. If you really do have a good use-case, like the flash reprogramming RBerteig mentions, be prepared to mess with linker scripts, verify disassembly, and know you're writing very non-standard and unportable code :)
