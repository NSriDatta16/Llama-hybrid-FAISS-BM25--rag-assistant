The binary zero inflation part of the model only captures the proability of excess zeros , not the probability of zeros overall . I would expect that in the negative-binomial count component of the model, the mean decreases for some classes of your predictor, thus increasing the probability of zeros. Moreover, you could consider a hurdle model rather than a zero-inflation model which is often simpler to interpret because all zeros are modeled jointly. In fact, the zero hurdle part would coincide with your first logistic regression model.
