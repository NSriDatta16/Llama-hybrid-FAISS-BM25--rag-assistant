Try the set-up tutorial below: http://bid.berkeley.edu/cs160-fall10/index.php/Tips_and_Tricks In the first section, "Android Quickstart," the last paragraph says: When you run an error-free program, the emulator will start automatically. Its not smart about screen size however, and may be too large for some monitors. If you have this problem, start the emulator instead using "SDK setup" program from the main Android SDK directory before you run a program. It will give you a dialog to set the size or scale. Setting the height to 8" works well on 768-pixel high monitors.
