TextMate question: how to move caret to next/previous blank line

See title. Is there already a simple key combination that does this that I can't find in the manual? Is there a command I can put in KeyBindings.dict to do this? I was hoping moveToBeginningOfParagraph: would do it but that appears to just go to the beginning of the current line. Help appreciated.
