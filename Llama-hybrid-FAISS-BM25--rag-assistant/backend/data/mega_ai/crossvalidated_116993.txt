The plot that JMP uses for logistic fits is described on page 2-79 (page 93 of the PDF) in this demo document produced by JMP. http://www.jmp.com/training/scripting_workshop/2004/concepts_using_jmp_handout.pdf This platform features a new kind of scatter plot. The data points are plotted according to their real abscissa and a dummy random ordinate. It organizes the points so that you can see how they fall into one of the categories. So for each point, the $X$ coordinate is the position that is in the data, and the $Y$ coordinate is just randomly placed above or below the blue line so you can see where the points fall.
