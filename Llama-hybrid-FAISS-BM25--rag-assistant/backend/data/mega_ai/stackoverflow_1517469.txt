CSS max-width with percent

max-width with a percent doesn't seem to work in either IE 8 or Firefox 3. Specific pixel widths work fine. Am I missing something? I have an input form, and I want to display some explanatory text to the right of it. But I don't want the explanatory text to squash the form. I haven't used max-width before but it seemed an excellent solution. I wrote this simple CSS style: div.hint {max-width: 50%; float: right;} Then I wrote: ... hint text ... etc ... The div.hint squashes the form severely to the left. I tried this with just some text instead of the form. The div.hint takes about 95% of the screen, just gives a small margin on the left, and then the other text is pushed completely below it. If I change the max-width from a percent to a fixed number of pixels, it appears to work. But I don't want to base it on pixels because I don't know the dimensions of the user's browser. Does percent not work with max-width despite what I read in documentation, or am I missing something? In response to Seanmonster's comment: Here, I'll give a trivial but complete web page that illustrates what I thought should work but doesn't: Max width test .form {max-width: 75%; float: left;} .hint {max-width: 50%; float: right;} Fourscore and seven years ago our forefathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. We are now engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. Etc. Label 1 Value 1 Label 2 Value 2 Label 3 Value 3 When I open this page in a browser, I get, not two columns, but the "hint" div taking 100% of the width, and below that the "form" div taking 100% of the width. If I change both the max-width's to "width: 50%", I get two columns as I would expect. Apparently I'm missing something about how max-width is supposed to work, but ... I don't get it.
