How should I update an iCal RRULE when moving an appointment?

I'm switching my app's calendar from Telerik Scheduler to jQuery fullcalendar. I'm storing recurring events in the db using iCal RRULEs. The question is, when someone drags an event to a new date, how can I update the RRULE so each subsequent occurrence is bumped by the same time delta? I've looked at DDay.iCal and I see the method RecurrencePattern.IncrementDate(ref iCalDateTime dt, int Interval) That sounds like what I'm looking for, but there are no details in the documentation . Any suggestions? Thanks so much, Michael
