@Paco: You are wrong. Repositories are not only for storing objects. If you have read Eric Evan's DDD book, you'd know that Repositories are like an object-oriented in-memory representation of data. You can use a Repository object the same way as you use a Collection. You can use indexer to get or set objects, you can use the Add() method to add a new object, you can use the Remove() method to remove an object, etc. The Repository then uses the infrastructure to read/write data from/to the database. It can use a DataMapper for simplifying the retrieval of data from your relational database and mapping to your Entities.
