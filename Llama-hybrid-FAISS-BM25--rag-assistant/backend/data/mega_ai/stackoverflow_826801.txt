It's not the tools, it's you Whenever developers try to do something new like doing UML diagrams, charts of any sort, project management they first look for the perfect tool to solve the problem. After endless searches finding not the right tool their motivation starves. All that is left then is complaints about the lack of useable software. It is the insight that the plan to be organized died in absence of a piece of software. Well, it is only yourself dealing with organization. If you are used to organize you can do it with or without the aid of a software (and most do without). If you are not used to organize nobody can help you. So "not having the right software" is just the simplest excuse for not being organized at all.
