If you want to build a cross platform program, you will stumbl across a few kind of problems. Cross compilers problem Some compilers are offering non-standard functionalities that might not work on other compiler. You have to make sure that compiler functionnalitie's you use are standard or available on all the compilers you use (An exemple would be the VC++ #pragma that wasn't usable on gcc until version 4.2.1) Platform specific functions and libraries Guess what, if you include it won't compile on a linux system (this is madness I know). So you must try to avoid those platform specific libraries/function. If you ever have to use them, try to encapsulate their use and select the specific class you need to compile on different system.
