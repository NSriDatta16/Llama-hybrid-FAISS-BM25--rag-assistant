php feedback email form

Hi I'm trying to make a feed back form for php and it worked but I was just wondering, can i make a set of code also deliver this email to the visitor who sent this mail? Also tagged along with a small message like "Thank you, for your feedback. This is the message you wrote ".....". and here is my code: Use Back - Enter valid e-mail \n"; $badinput = " Feedback was NOT submitted \n"; } if(empty($visitor) || empty($visitormail) || empty($notes )) { echo " Use Back - fill in all fields \n"; } echo $badinput; $todayis = date("l, F j, Y, g:i a") ; $attn = $attn . "(" . $ccopy . ")" ; $subject = $attn; $notes = stripcslashes($notes); $message = " $todayis \n From: $visitor ($visitormail)\n Website URL: $weburl \n Message: $notes \n Additional Info : IP = $ip \n Browser Info: $httpagent \n Referral : $httpref \n "; $from = "From: $visitormail\r\n"; if (($ccopy == "ccyes") && ($visitormail != "")) mail($visitormail, $subject, $message, $from); if ($myemail != "") mail($myemail, $subject, $message, $from); if ($ccx != "") mail($ccx, $subject, $message, $from); ?> Ohh one more thing is it possible to change the timestamp to asia? +8gmt? I my knowledge is pretty little in php. Thanks!
