First make sure your database is reasonably healthy, run DBCC DBREINDEX on it if possible, DBCC INDEXDEFRAG and update statistics if you can't afford the performance hit. Run Profiler for a reasonable sample time, enough to capture most of the typical functions, but filter on duration greater than something like 10 seconds, you don't care about the things that only take a few milliseconds, don't even look at those. Now that you have your longest running queries, tune the snot out of them; get the ones that show up the most, look at the execution plans in Query Analyzer, take some time to understand them, add indexes where necessary to speed retrieval look at creating covered indexes; change the app if needed if it's doing SELECT * FROM... when it only needs SELECT LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME.... Repeat the profiler sampling, with duration of 5 seconds, 3 seconds, etc. until performance meets your expectations.
