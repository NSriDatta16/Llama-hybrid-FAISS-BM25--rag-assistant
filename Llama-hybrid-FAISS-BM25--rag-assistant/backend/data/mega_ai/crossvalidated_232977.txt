Average Variance Extracted (AVE) and Mean Inter-Item-Correlation (MIC), are they the same?

I am doing a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and used the reliability() in R statement to get the average variance extracted (AVE). I also calculated the Mean Inter-Item-Correlation (MIC) manually from the item-correlations based on CFA output. The results are the same. Are these the same indicators of reliability? I thought they are different?
