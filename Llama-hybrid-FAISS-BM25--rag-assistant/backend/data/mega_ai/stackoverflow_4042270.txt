"const" does not necessarily mean the storage is read-only. It is a declaration that the C++ program will not change it (and hence that the compiler should reject any attempt to do so). It doesn't mean the value will not change. It's quite legitimate for a variable to be "const volatile" (the program won't change it, but it might change at any time). A read-only hardware port might well be such a beast, for example. So at the "lower levels of the machine", nothing needs to be done. The memory is what it is, and the application programmer needs to declare stuff correctly..
