FCMappers offer support for starting with FCM and also provide a Microsoft Excel-based tool that is able to check and analyse FCMs. The output is saved as Pajek file and can be visualized within third party software like Pajek, Visone, etc. They also offer to adapt the software to specific research needs. Additional FCM software tools, such as Mental Modeler, have recently been developed as a decision-support tool for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.
