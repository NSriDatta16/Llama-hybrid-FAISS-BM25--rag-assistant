Autocorrelation of daily time-series using acf and pacf plots

I have a time series dataset with daily entries over the past 20 years. I would like to see whether the series is autocorrelated. To do so I have done the following> dataset=read.csv(file="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22681355/dataset.csv", head=TRUE) par(mfrow=c(2,1)) dataset=diff(dataset) acf(dataset) pacf(dataset) From the plots it seems that there is no autocorrelation, however, I'm not sure whether the acf and pacf plots are suitable for my dataset. What is a suitable test for stock data ?
