I had good results with simple median filter. Our task is to analyze eye movements. Recordings of eye position are performed each 1 ms. We are interested in gaze velocity. Obviously, it is an equidistant very noisy signal, from which we should obtain a derivative. We try several different filters, the best was moving median filter. Before differentiating the filtered signal we average equal neighbors (remove all equal values and place one on the middle of period of equality). After this step we obtained rather pretty derivative.
