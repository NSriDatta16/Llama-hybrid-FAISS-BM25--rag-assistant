Well, the obvious difference is that AIR runs on your desktop and not in the browser. The AIR runtime ( what your swf runs inside when it is an AIR app ) also provides you with more access to the user's computers. This is not a comprehensive list, but here are a few features that AIR has that the normal flash player doesn't: local file system access sqlite database classes webkit integration ( for displaying html ) native drag and drop clipboard open external apps from within your air AIR apps can be built w/ pure ActionScript, Flex, JavaScript & HTML. Here you can find the complete ActionScript Language Reference for AIR 2.0.: http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/index.html?filter_air=2 Note that any class with the AIR icon next to it is AIR only. This should be a good way for you to see what is unique to AIR.
