Why is logistic regression a linear classifier?

Since we are using the logistic function to transform a linear combination of the input into a non-linear output, how can logistic regression be considered a linear classifier? Linear regression is just like a neural network without the hidden layer, so why are neural networks considered non-linear classifiers and logistic regression is linear?
