What is a fuzzy neuron?

The only thing I understood about fuzzy neurons is that the neuron's activation function is replaced with some operation used in fuzzy. Other than that, I didn't understand much from science paper I found. Also, it is hard to just Google it because of it's name, which results in listing some fuzzy or ANN or hybrid systems, which is not what I'm looking for. Is there anything more to fuzzy neurons than I have described above? Also, I'm curious, when and how to use it ? And is there any other change in neural network structure or calculation that needs implementing if I'm going to use fuzzy neuron. If someone has a good material on this subject, please link. I really have had a hard time finding anything on this subject. EDIT: Title of the paper I've mentioned: Combining neural networks and fuzzy logic for applications in char.recognition. ByAnne Magaly de Paula Canuto. University of Kent. Can't find link to it anymore, i found it last year. But this is the title. Fuzzy neuron is mentioned in section 1.4.
