MySql has clustered indexes but there appears to be limited control on these indexes. MySql clustered indexes and see this question here DB2 has MDC (multi-dimension cluster) which can effectively index organise the table in several ways. I've never used them but you can probably just have a single dimension MDC which would be the same as a standard clustered index. Oracle is a bit of a pain. Last time I checked with its IOT implementation requires you create the table as IOT and you can't change it later, which is annoying when you want to load a load of data with no indexes for speed and then index it after.
