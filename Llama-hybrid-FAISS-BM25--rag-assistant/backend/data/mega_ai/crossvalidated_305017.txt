Your two best choices are either dimensionality reduction or another algorithms that doesn't rely on distance measures. If you have plenty of images, you may train a neural network and don't need to do dimensionality reduction or other feature engineering. If you don't have so many images to train a neural net, try to find a way to extract features from your images first and classify on those features.
