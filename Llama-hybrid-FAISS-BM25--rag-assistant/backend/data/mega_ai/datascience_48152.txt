Multiple regression (using machine learning - how plot data)

I wonder how I can use machine learning to plot multiple linear regression in a figure. I have one independent variable (prices of apartments) and five independent (floor, builtyear, roomnumber, square meter, kr/sqm). The task is first to use machine learning which gives the predicted values and the actual values. Then you have to plot those values in a figure. I have used this code: x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = tts(xx1, y, test_size=3) Outcome: LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, n_jobs=None, normalize=False) regr.fit(x_train, y_train) Outcome:nothing regr.predict(x_test) Outcome: array([2.37671029, 3.91651234, 2.98472475]) np.mean((regr.predict(x_test) - y_test) ** 2) Outcome: 2.976924398032532e-26 How can I plot the actual values of the dependent variable and the predicted ones in the same figure?
