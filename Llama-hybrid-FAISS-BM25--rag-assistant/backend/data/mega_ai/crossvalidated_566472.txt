Handling many short times series with exogenous variables simultaneously

I am trying to find a solution to a problem, having a dataset with multiple short time series and exogenous variables. Read this , this , and this . And many other resources. Still cannot find a clear answer if I can build any autoregressive model. Dataset characteristics: a large number of independent entities and 3 observations, annual one times series for each that I want to forecast forward 1-3 years (2020-2022) multiple covariates, some time series themselves some static I hypothesize that any predictive power of the covariates is similar across entities Any ideas how to approach this? I did all possible research, but nothing working so far.
