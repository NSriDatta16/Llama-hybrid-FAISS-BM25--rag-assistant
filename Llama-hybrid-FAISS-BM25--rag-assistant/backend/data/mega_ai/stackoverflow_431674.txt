Not AFAIK, at least not with standard swing widgets. In VB you have a group widget, which is essentially a panel + border. In Swing you have a JPanel which is the container widget, and you create and set a border object on it only if you need one. One can argue that in a way that is more elegant since you don't pay for something you don't use (e.g., border)
