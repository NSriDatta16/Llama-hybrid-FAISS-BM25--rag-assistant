Gaussian distribution with poisson variance

Let's $r_t\sim \mathcal{N}(0,V_t)$ where $V_t = (1+m)^{J_t}$ , $m\geq0$ and $J_t\sim \mathcal{P}oi(\lambda)$ . How can we compute the distribution of $r_t$ when the parameters are $m$ and $\lambda$ . In other words I would like to compute $$\sum_{j\geq0}\frac{e^\lambda}{j!}\lambda^j\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi(1+m)^{j}}}\exp\left\{-\frac{r_t^2}{2(1+m)^{j}}\right\}\,.$$ I know this sum is convergent as for all $j$ , $\exp\left\{-\frac{r_t^2}{2(1+m)^{j}}\right\}\leq 1$ then $$\sum_{j\geq0}\frac{e^\lambda}{j!}\lambda^j\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi(1+m)^{j}}}\exp\left\{-\frac{r_t^2}{2(1+m)^{j}}\right\} \leq \sum_{j\geq0}\frac{e^\lambda}{j!}\lambda^j\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi(1+m)^{j}}} = \frac{\exp\left\{\lambda+\lambda(1+m)^{-1/2}\right\}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\,.$$ My objective at the end will be to estimate this model by MCMC. So, I would like to sample parameters $m$ and $\lambda$ after computing their posterior. An accepted answer should then help me to compute those posteriors. Thanks
