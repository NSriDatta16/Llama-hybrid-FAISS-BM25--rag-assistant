FILESTREAM does not actually require local storage, just not SMB network storage. An iSCSI or Fiber Channel SAN works fine to store FILESTREAM data. You can also have multiple filestream file groups per table, essentially partitioning your data. If you are strictly targeting sql server 2008 there is very little reason to not use filestream for large binary data. There is a Microsoft whitepaper describing filestream partitioning here .
