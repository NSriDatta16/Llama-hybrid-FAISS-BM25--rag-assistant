If I had to venture a guess, it isn't working as you expect in touchesBegan because you're not accounting for the fact that you drew the path offset. [aShape containsPoint:p] isn't going to know about the context transform you applied previously. On a slightly different note, [aShape dealloc] you should never call dealloc on an object directly. The only time you call dealloc is on super at the end of your own dealloc. This line should be [aShape release]
