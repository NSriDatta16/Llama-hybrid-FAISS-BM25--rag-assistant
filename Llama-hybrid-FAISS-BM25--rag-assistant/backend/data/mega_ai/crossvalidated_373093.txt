The reasons are summarised well by @StasK. And I will show some ways to fix this errors. It may suffer from your model building. Use function summary , you will find there are some correlations between the latent variables you define, that are out of bounds. I mean $|\rho| > 1$ or $|\rho|$ is near 1. If you find it is true, one way to solve it is to collapse the not-good latent variables into one latent variable and their manifest variables. For example, latent1 =~ v1 + v2 latent2 =~ v3 + v4 latent3 =~ v5 + v6 latent1 is good and the other two are bad. Change in this way, letent1 =~ v1 + v2 letent2and3 ~= v3 + v4 + v5 + v6 And find whether there is a better result. The idea is from Erin Buchanan, you can check her tutorial for SEM online. I drop this reference because of the sexual assault related to a online teaching organization. If you are interested in the reference, connect to me privately, I reply some technical but not yet organized notes.
