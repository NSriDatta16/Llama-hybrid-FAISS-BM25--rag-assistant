What classes should I use C#'s using statement with?

I've read and I believe I understand what C#'s using statement does (please correct me if I'm wrong): Initializes an IDisposable object as read only to a limited scope (the using block). I know you can initialize before the using and that doesn't limit the scope, but that is advised against here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yh598w02.aspx I'm not always paying attention to what classes are subclasses of what. I'm not too sure what classes inherit from IDisposable. I'm not just curious what classes can be used in a using statement, but what classes would my coworkers expect to find in a using block? What classes should be in a using block? Also, is there really anything wrong with not using a using block and not calling Dispose? Is it just about memory or also stability?
