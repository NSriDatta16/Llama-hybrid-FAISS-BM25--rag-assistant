The short answer is " It Depends ". For most scenarios like salary calculation, my guideline would be to look at what data is needed by the computation. If a majority of inputs belong to ClassA, then it indicates that it should be a method of ClassA. Persistence is however a special case. Persistence is a 'service' ; you tell someone to go write this to disk for later retrieval. There is no state of any one object that is being accessed. So create a stateless service that accepts the input that needs to be serialized/deserialized DAO_Service.Save(anEmployee); DAO_Service.Save(preferences); DAO_Service.Save(taxRecord);
