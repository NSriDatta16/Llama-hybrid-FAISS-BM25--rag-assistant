TRichView already knows how to display HTML, right? You shouldn't need to embed a TWebBrowser in it. So can't you insert the HTML that Laurence's answer demonstrates? You said the component supports Flash, after all. If it turns out TRichView doesn't support Flash, then try embedding it as a Delphi control, instead. You already asked how to do that. TRichView says it knows how to insert Delphi controls, so import the Flash ActiveX player into Delphi; that will define a Delphi component, which you should be able to put onto the TRichView .
