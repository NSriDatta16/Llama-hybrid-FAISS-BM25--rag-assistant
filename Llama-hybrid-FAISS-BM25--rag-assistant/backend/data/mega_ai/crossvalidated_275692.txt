How do PCA/SVD Decorrelate the variables

I understood the "technique" for doing SVD and PCA. However, I couldn't understand these two claims: PCA/SVD decorrelate the variables They do so using orthogonal transformations For 1, PCA does the eigen decomposition of covariance matrix and SVD operates on the data matrix. How to explain that they decorrelate the variables? In 2, I think I am missing some matrix transformation properties. How to see the transformations involved in the techniques of PCA/SVD and why are they only orthogonal . Many thanks.
