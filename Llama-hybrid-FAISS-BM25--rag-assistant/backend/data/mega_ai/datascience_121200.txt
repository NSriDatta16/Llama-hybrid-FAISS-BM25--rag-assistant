Passing target text to gpt2 and T5 for fine tuning to learn text generation task

I have text with each line in following format: some text-1 some text-2 some text-3 I want fine tune model to learn generate some text-3 after reading some text-1 and some text-2 . In GPT2 and T5 text generation tutorials, we do specify input-ids for target text i.e. labels, but for GPT2 we dont. For example in this T5 text generation tutorial , we can find line: model_inputs["labels"] = labels["input_ids"] But I could not find any such line in these GPT2 text generation examples: huggingtweets demo , huggingartists demo Finetune GPT2 for text generation
