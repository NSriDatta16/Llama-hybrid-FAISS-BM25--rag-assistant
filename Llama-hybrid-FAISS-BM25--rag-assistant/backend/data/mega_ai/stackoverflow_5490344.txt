Database to Rich Text Box Problem

I am having some trouble in binding my data from my Access database into my rich text box on my Visual C# form. Here is my code: private void Form2_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { string connectionString = ("Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source= C:\\Documents and Settings\\Harvey\\Desktop\\Test.accdb"); OleDbConnection conGet = new OleDbConnection(connectionString); OleDbCommand cmdGet = new OleDbCommand(); try { //open connection conGet.Open(); cmdGet.CommandType = CommandType.Text; cmdGet.Connection = conGet; cmdGet.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM Paragraph"; richTextBox.Rtf = cmdGet.ExecuteScalar().ToString(); conGet.Close(); MessageBox.Show("Data loaded from Database"); } catch (Exception ex) { //display generic error message back to user MessageBox.Show(ex.Message); } finally { //check if connection is still open then attempt to close it if (conGet.State == ConnectionState.Open) { conGet.Close(); } } } When I press the button to load up the form that will contain the rich text box, I get a pop up box saying 'File Format Not Valid' Essentially in my database, there is 1 column that has data in it (1 word per row in that column) The code I have above was taken from the Internet and other people have had success in using it, i'm just now sure what's going wrong
