Just a few bits of info I picked up reading through all these great answers, the links provided and the ideas those sparked: Only about 55% of the boxes that access our web site that report .NET Framework versions in their user agent string have 3.5. I was unable to determine when Microsoft will be pushing 3.5 with Windows Update (some say they've been doing for a year, some say they're starting soon). MSI apparently will auto install the right .NET framework. It lists .NET Framework in the installer as a dependency under the installers. EDIT: We had to update the installer project to specifically target 3.5. EDIT: Users must run the generated Setup.exe and not just the .msi file if you want the dependencies checked. For those not using MSI... One can't distribute .NET framework without a licensed copy of .NET Framework SDK (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms994395.aspx ). However, one can distribute an installer ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc160716.aspx ).
