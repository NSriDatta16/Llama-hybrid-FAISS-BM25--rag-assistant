SVN organization for a 3rd-party component

We are a small company which develops components for the Joomla! CMS. In the Joomla!'s jargon, a component is a small application that extends the CMS features (we are for example editing a directory component). As a classical framework, Joomla has a pre-defined files structure which looks like this one: |-- administrator/ | |-- backups/ | |-- cache/ | |-- components/ and our components is taking place in different directories marked with 'here'. To summup, we've got: a back-end interface a front-end interface language files (for back and front) media files (images, JS script, CSS...) modules plugins We use SVN as version control system, but we are hesitating on the "best" way to organize our repository: should we mimic the Joomla's files structure, for example create a administrator/components/ to hold our back-end folder or just set a back/ folder should we separate modules and plugins from the component's trunk? What is your opinion about setting a repository for a software which should sit on an already predefined files structure? What is the "best" strategy for this? Thank you
