There are already several answers to this question but on my reading, they are all incorrect (or easily misinterpreted). A frequentist prediction interval works like a frequentist confidence interval. The "promise" of a frequentist confidence interval holds on repeated samples,e.g. if I construct a 95 percent confidence interval then on repeated samples 95 percent of the intervals will contain the parameter value. Any particular interval will either contain the parameter value or not though. So once you've constructed the interval, there is no guarantee, for example, that the parameter falls in the interval with a certain probability. This is also how a prediction interval works. You 1) sample a distribution, 2) construct an 80 percent prediction interval and then 3) sample the distribution again. Now if your repeat steps 1 - 3, thousands of times, the outcome from step 3) will fall in prediction interval from step 2) 80 percent of the time. However, if you follow step 1) and 2) only once and then repeat step 3) thousands of times, the prediction interval from step 2) will almost certainly not cover the outcome from step 3) 80 percent of the time. So to the question, I calculated an 80% prediction interval of the outcome of interest (proportion of patients, average temperature etc.) based on my previous study. Is it true that in the future study I will receive the outcome within the calculated prediction interval with 80% probability?" the answer is no.
