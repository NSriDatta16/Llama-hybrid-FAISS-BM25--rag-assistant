Your problem is you didn't put the data into the variable descr that the code you ran assumed would be there. Read the last paragraph of Sec. 2 of the paper; it says what should be in descr and how to get it: The descriptor data are contained in an R data frame names descr and the outcome data are in a factor vector called mutagen with levels "mutagen" and "nonmutagen". These data are available from the package website http://caret.R-Forge.R-project.org/ That page leads you to a github page that has a link to the data (it's not so easy to spot, but it's there). descr is here: http://topepo.github.io/caret/descr.RData mutagen is here: http://topepo.github.io/caret/mutagen.RData
