Can my standard laptop be used to run deep learning projects?

I wish to do a project in deep learning using deep convolutional neural networks and deep Q learning. However, I am not sure if my laptop is up to the task. I am currently running 64 bit Win 10 OS, Intel(R) Core i7, 16 GB ram with NVIDIA GeForce 940MX graphics card. I plan to use tensorflow or pytorch to play around with some deep learning projects, eventually the ones involving deep q learning. I am specifically curious about the GPU requirements for running these projects on laptops, as I simply cannot purchase a GPU and replace or add it onto to my laptop. I know this question is sort of out of the scope of this stackexchange, but I simply cannot find any other websites with people who are doing deep learning.
