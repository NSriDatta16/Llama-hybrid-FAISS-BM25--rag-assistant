Question about initWithNibName

I make all my controllers in code and most of the GUI too. Some GUI's I make with IB. I then set the file's owner to the viewcontroller and drag an connection from the file's owner to the view. But initWithNibName confuses me... I am override the designated initializer to this - (id)init { [super initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil]; return self; } - (id)initWithNibName:(NSString *)nibNameOrNil bundle:(NSBundle *)nibBundleOrNil { return [self init]; } Why do I not need to set which nib the viewController shall use in the init-initalizer? Because it works without. I thought I must use [super initWithNibName:@"SomeNib" bundle:nil]; In the init-initalizer
