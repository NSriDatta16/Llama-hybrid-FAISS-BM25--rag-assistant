I think you have a wrong hypothesis to verify. In general, applying PCA before building a model will NOT help to make the model perform better (in terms of accuracy)! This is because PCA is an algorithm that does not consider the response variable / prediction target into account. PCA will treat the feature has large variance as important features, but the feature has large variance can have noting to do with the prediction target. This means, you can produce a lot of useless features and eliminate useful features after PCA. Please check my answer here for details and some demo. How to decide between PCA and logistic regression?
