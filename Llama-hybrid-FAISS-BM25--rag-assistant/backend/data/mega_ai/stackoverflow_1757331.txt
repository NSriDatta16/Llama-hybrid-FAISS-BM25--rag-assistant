ASP.NET MVC with tree - pattern

I am preparing a skeleton of ASP.NET MVC application with basic CRUD functions on Products and Parts included in these products. Application contains couple of strongly-typed views based on the MasterPage and now I want to add a widget to display the menu tree. This menu tree is going to reflect the Products/Parts structure so it is related to the content displayed in the main window. I have searched forums and found different ways of tree rendering and including the new widget in the application: jquery.treeview - provides nice-looking tree but how can I use (build, render, pass to the view) it in my application? RenderPartial, RenderAction, etc.- seems to be very clear so I was going to use RenderAction method to include my widget in the master page, but how can I build/render the tree to be displayed? extend the HtmlHelper to create a new Html.RenderTree method (nice example at: http://www.matthidinger.com/archive/2009/02/08/asp.net-mvc-recursive-treeview-helper.aspx ) Probably I should just merge some fragments of found examples but since I am new to ASP.NET MVC technology I am not sure about the best pattern in such case. Any help (suggestions, patterns, point the good example, etc.) would be appreciated. Thanks diork
