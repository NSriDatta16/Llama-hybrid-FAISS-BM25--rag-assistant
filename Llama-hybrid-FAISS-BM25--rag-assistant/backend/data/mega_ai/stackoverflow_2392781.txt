PHP Zip Archive organized in a Array

I am trying to organize a Zip Archive into an array so that I may extract certain files into their rightful place. The Zip contains 3 folder, and in each folder holds files that may be extracted depending on their extension. Zip -> Folder 1 -----File 1 -----File 2 -----File 3 -> Folder 2 -----File 1 -----File 2 -> Folder 3 -----File 1 -----File 2 At the moments, the folder are named numerically. Folder 1 Folder 1.1 Folder 2 However, when I put them in a loop to describe the statIndex to an array, the folder are rearrange as follow in the array: array[0] = Folder 1 array[1] = Folder 2 array[2] = Folder 1.1 I am trying to sort the statIndex so that Folder 1.1 would come after Folder 1, then after Folder 1.1, Folder 2 would come. The Key of the array are important for organizing the data, and thus why I need help sorting statIndex. Thus: array[0] = Folder 1 array[1] = Folder 1.1 array[2] = Folder 2 Help is very appreciated.
