It is difficult to assess the fit of the Poisson (or any other integer-valued GLM for that matter) with Pearson or deviance residuals, because also a perfectly fitting Poisson GLMM will exhibit inhomogeneous deviance residuals. This is especially so if you do GLMMs with observation-level REs, because the dispersion created by OL-REs is not considered by the Pearson residuals. To demonstrate the issue, the following code creates overdispersed Poisson data, that is then fitted with a perfect model. The Pearson residuals look very much like your plot - hence, it may be that there is no problem at all. This problem is solved by the DHARMa R package , which simulates from the fitted model to transform the residuals of any GL(M)M into a standardized space. Once this is done, you can visually assess / test residual problems, such as deviations from the distribution, residual dependency on a predictor, heteroskedasticity or autocorrelation in the normal way. See the package vignette for worked-through examples. You can see in the lower plot that the same model now looks fine, as it should. If you still see heteroscedasticity after plotting with DHARMa, you will have to model dispersion as a function of something, which is not a big problem, but would likely require you to move to JAGs or another Bayesian software. library(DHARMa) library(lme4) testData = createData(sampleSize = 200, overdispersion = 1, randomEffectVariance = 1, family = poisson()) fittedModel
