Maybe you can use protocols? Make Class1, Class2 and Class3 conform to a protocol with a property myColor. Then you could have a method like this (assuming your classes are of type UIView and your protocol is called ColorProtocol): - (void) changeColor:(UIView *) myOBJ toColor:(UIColor*)myColor { myOBJ.color = myColor; myOBJ.frame = ...; } Here is what your protocol definition could look like: @protocol ColorProtocol @property (nonatomic, retain) UIColor *myColor; @end Change your class definition files (.h) as follows to specify that you will conform to the protocol: interface Class1 : UIView {...} In the implementation files (.m) you must simply synthesize the myColor property to conform to the ColorProtocol: @synthesize myColor; If your classes are very similar, using inheritance might be even simpler though.
