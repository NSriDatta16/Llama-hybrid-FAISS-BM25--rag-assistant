Help with SQL query - some magic needed

I need some help with a query - I'm using Firebird 2.1. I have a table like: RowID (primary key) | ActivityID | Duration | BilledAt 1 | 1 | 50 | 06.08.2010, 14:05:00.598 2 | 1 | 70 | 06.08.2010, 14:05:00.608 3 | 2 | 30 | 06.08.2010, 14:05:00.598 4 | 3 | 40 | 06.08.2010, 14:05:00.598 5 | 3 | 50 | 06.08.2010, 14:05:00.608 I'd like to get the Durations for each ActivityID BUT if there are more than one entries available with the same ActivityID, I need the get the one with the highest BilledAt value. (the most recent entry) If I execute: SELECT ActivityID, Max(BilledAt) FROM BilledTime GROUP BY ActivityID; I'll get what I want without the Duration values. If I include the Duration column in the GROUP BY clause, then multiple ActivityIDs are selected. Is there an elegant solution to this? Thanks!
