magento sort attribute option collection by position?

Greetings, I am trying to sort an array of attribute option values by their "position" as entered in the manage attributes panel. I seem to have tried everything, does anyone know how this is possible? I thought for sure this would work: $_collection = Mage::getResourceModel('eav/entity_attribute_option_collection') ->setStoreFilter(0) ->setAttributeFilter($_productAttribute->getId()) ->addAttributeToSort('position') ->load(); But it didn't. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
