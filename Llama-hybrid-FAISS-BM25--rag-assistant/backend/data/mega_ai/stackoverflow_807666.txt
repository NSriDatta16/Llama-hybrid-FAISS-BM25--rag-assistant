If you want to implement a REST API in Erlang there is only one thing to do. Use the excellent MochiWeb Kit to build your own HTTP server that implements your protocol. Don't panic, it really is easier than it would appear. There are a number of tutorials about how to do it including a screencast set from the Pragmatic Programmers. It comes with a complete set of json libraries, so you'll be fine!
