How to style a comment section in ul/li

How would I go about adding a comment section under each photo in this gallery? (You can view an image of what I'm hoping to do here: - won't let me post a link because i'm a new member.... zhttp://www.some-things.net/storage/Picture109.p ng ) I know the iframe may not be the best way to be working this - but my friend wanted a sideways scroll area with wordpress integration and I couldn't find any suitable gallery plugins. The images are displayed in a ul/ li - but because it's display-inline it won't let me put in another div below each image. http://www.some-things.net/storage/anna/wordpress/?page_id=49 Basically I want to create a section under each picture that contains room for comment if needed - something like the picture above. Any tips on the code needed would be great!
