Scipy ttest_ind versus ks_2samp. When to use which test

From the docs scipy.stats.ks_2samp This is a two-sided test for the null hypothesis that 2 independent samples are drawn from the same continuous distribution scipy.stats.ttest_ind This is a two-sided test for the null hypothesis that 2 independent samples have identical average (expected) values. This test assumes that the populations have identical variances by default. Assuming that one uses the default assumption of identical variances, the second test seems to be testing for identical distribution as well. The only difference then appears to be that the first test assumes continuous distributions. If that is the case, what are the differences between the two tests? What is the right interpretation if they have very different results? For example I have two data sets for which the p values are 0.95 and 0.04 for the ttest(tt_equal_var=True) and the ks test, respectively.
