This is essentially not possible with the stock browser on an android consumer device for security and privacy reasons. You may be able to use netstat (or look in /proc/net/tcp) to see the IP addresses and port numbers of currently active connections, but this won't tell you the file being accessed or even in many cases the specific site as mapping between IP and host names is not 1:1. And it might happen when you aren't looking. On a rooted phone you can extract the browser's history database. You can write your own browser leveraging the same underlying webkit engine, or even the stock browsers sources, while also providing some kind of monitoring or history api. But the user has to decide to use that instead of the stock browser.
