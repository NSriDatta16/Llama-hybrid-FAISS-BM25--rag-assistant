I hate to answer my own question, but this is probably the best way to close the loop. The excessive redirects was actually not caused by the code I posted. I was fooled. We had an HttpModule that, ironically, used code mentioned in this answer . It turns out that installing certain versions of the Ask.com toolbar on IE will modify the user-agent string to include 'Ask', causing false-positives on this 'IsCrawler' checker. Because 'IsCrawler' evaluated to true in these cases, a different code path was executed that caused the infinite redirect loop. The querystring case changing was a result of this, not the web browser ignoring the location header as I was asking about. Since I didn't even really answer my question , if anyone can post a somewhat authoritative answer on whether there are any known browsers or scenarios behaving as I asked about, I will mark that as the accepted answer.
