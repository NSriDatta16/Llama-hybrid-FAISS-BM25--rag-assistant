Not sure how to use ccTouchesBegan to do what I want it to do

So when I see ccTouchesBegan (or touchesBegan for that fact of the matter) I see something like this usually: - (void)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { UITouch* touch = [touches anyObject]; } But, what I am not getting is how do you just detect if one object has been touched? For example how would I check if a specific CCSprite I declared has been touched? Sorry if this is a newbish question but, I just don't understand and if you need more clarification just ask how I can clarify myself more.
