Best way to save drag and drop layout

I've seen this question a few times but they mostly have to do with individual objects and cookies. I am building an application with a toolbox drag and drop functionality (very much like you'd see in Visual Studio - i.e. dragging objects onto a form, giving them a name, etc...) Therefore the droppable area could have many objects including nested droppables. Any opinions on what is the best way to save to a SQL Server database, and then re-load such a complex layout? Objects would need to load and display exactly as they were saved. It will be done by ajax but beyond that I'm not sure the best way to proceed. Also any examples that might point me in the right direction would be great. Much obliged.
