In some ways these two broad categories of machine learning techniques are related. Though not perfect, two papers I have found helpful in showing the similarities in these techniques are below Ronan Collobert and Samy Bengio. 2004. Links between perceptrons, MLPs and SVMs. In Proceedings of the twenty-first international conference on Machine learning (ICML '04). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 23-. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/1015330.1015415 and Andras, Peter. (2002). The Equivalence of Support Vector Machine and Regularization Neural Networks. Neural Processing Letters. 15. 97-104. 10.1023/A:1015292818897.
