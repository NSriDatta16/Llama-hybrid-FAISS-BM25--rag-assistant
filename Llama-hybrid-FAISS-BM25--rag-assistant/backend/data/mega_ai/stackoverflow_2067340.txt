You can improve I/O performance in several ways depending upon what you use for your storage setup: Increase filesystem block size if your app displays good spatial locality in its I/Os or uses large files. Use RAID 10 (striping + mirroring) for performance + redundancy (disk failure protection). Use fast disks (Performance Wise: SSD > FC > SATA). Segregate workloads at different times of day. e.g. Backup during night, normal app I/O during day. Turn off atime updates in your filesystem. Cache NFS file handles a.k.a. Haystack (Facebook), if storing data on NFS server. Combine small files into larger chunks, a.k.a BigTable , HBase . Avoid very large directories i.e. lots of files in the same directory (instead divide files between different directories in a hierarchy). Use a clustered storage system (yeah not exactly commodity hardware). Optimize/design your application for sequential disk accesses whenever possible. Use memcached . :) You may want to look at "Lessons Learned" section of StackOverflow Architecture .
