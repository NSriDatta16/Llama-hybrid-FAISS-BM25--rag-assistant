How to invalidate browser session

How can I invalidate Browser Session. I am using JSP's. In web.xml the session-timeout is been set to 180 seconds and I want it like that only. But the problem is on some special occasion for some user's browser session need to be invalidated immediately right after a form submit. I have used session.invalidate(); to invalidate session and also used response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache"); response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); response.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); But, still when I click the back button it will take me to the same users session. Is this loading from browser cache? This is what i have in my JSP : function submitForm(){window.document.submitFrm.submit();} " name="submitFrm" id="submitFrm"> ' /> Am I missing something?
