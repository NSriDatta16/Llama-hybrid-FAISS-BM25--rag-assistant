No one, including frequentists, can say anything without assuming a model. If you assume a model, such as a simple "biased coin toss" $Y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$, then you can talk about probabilities. In that case, you can infer about $p$, such as that it's "probably" (here things start to differ) close to 0.5. But you can also come up with other models, such as the "alternating" one you are proposing (but it's not really specified). Here, a statistician typically uses an information criterion to decide on the model. These compare the number of parameters and the likelihood of this data to see how efficient the data is explained. A Bayesian may look at a posterior predictive check. A machine learner might see with cross-validation that the "alternating" model is much better at prediction. Not to say that any of these approaches are better, but to say that they all need a model.
