How do I stop a sound when a new sound button is pressed

I'm new to Xcode and I'm having an issue, if you click the sound buttons multiple times they overlap each other. How would I set my code so that if you click a button while a sound is playing it will stop the current sound playing and start the new one. If you could post the code it would be much appreciated. Thanks, Dominick Here is a copy of my current code: #import "Sound3ViewController.h" @implementation Sound3ViewController -(IBAction)playnow:(id)sender;{ soundFile = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"winning" ofType:@"mp3"]]; sound = [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:soundFile error:nil]; sound.delegate = self; [sound play]; } - (IBAction)play2:(id)sender { soundFile = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"onadrug" ofType:@"mp3"]]; sound = [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:soundFile error:nil]; sound.delegate = self; [sound play]; } - (void)dealloc { [super dealloc]; [sound release]; [super dealloc]; } - (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning { // Releases the view if it doesn't have a superview. [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]; // Release any cached data, images, etc that aren't in use. } #pragma mark - View lifecycle /* // Implement viewDidLoad to do additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib. - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; } */ - (void)viewDidUnload { [super viewDidUnload]; // Release any retained subviews of the main view. // e.g. self.myOutlet = nil; } - (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation { // Return YES for supported orientations return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait); } @end
