From a viewpoint of displaying graphics, the greatest precision that normally matters is (in simple terms) a single pixel in the final display 1 . Given the resolution of a typical current monitor, having another couple or three bits for the height map would be nice -- but for most geometry, it's not really necessary. In particular, even though a single pixel pretty much defines the greatest precision for which you have a lot of use, drawing Mt. Everest so its height is actually wrong by two or three pixels isn't really a major problem for most people most of the time. It comes down to this: the idea that you'd want to use a precision of one meter for a height map of Mt. Everest is simply a mistake -- a need (or even use) for that level of precision is right on the border between rare and nonexistent. At the same time, using a relatively dense format like one byte per pixel generally means quite a bit -- less storage and less bandwidth leading to faster displays. Technically with anti-aliasing, sub-pixel resolution can and does mean something -- but while it matters a lot for things like smoothing lines that would otherwise look quite jagged, for something like getting the height of a mountain correct, it doesn't mean nearly so much. In fact, as far as most people care most of the time, it's completely meaningless.
