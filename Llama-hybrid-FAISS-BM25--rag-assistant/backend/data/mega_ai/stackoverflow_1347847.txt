How do I move boolean logic out of my View?

In my ASP.NET MVC View I pick a sprite based on a boolean value set in the model like this: "> This is ugly and I don't like it. My objective is to use the sprite-icon_dog_new if Model.HasNewDog is true and use sprite-icon_dog if Model.HasNewDog is false. What is a more elegant and more readable way to do this?
