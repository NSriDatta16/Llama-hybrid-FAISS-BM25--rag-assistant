There are some very important steps to be taken before defining your time series. You can generate time variable first: //generate time variable t gen t=_n //time series set tsset t Then start the above steps. After all the analysis is done, you can copy paste the real date to the value. Then it will give you a good graph. Otherwise, especially for 5-day per week data, it may create problems.
