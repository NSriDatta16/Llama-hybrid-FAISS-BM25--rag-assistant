The question is what you want to learn, but it is certainly good idea to study various modules, because you learn to read other people code and learn various tricks. Some random recommendations I can think of start with smaller modules with clear interface you know and are interested in once you feel familiar with organization of modules and basics, try something larger try rather newer modules look into test suite and into examples if you don't understand specific piece, try to make reduced example a play with it It is hard to recommend something specific, but I liked my recent look into Web::Scraper module.
