You don't say what platform you are on, but typically the memory returned by gethostbyaddr will be allocated and managed by the sockets library you are using - you don't free it yourself. Whatever you are using to diagnose leaks is probably giveing false positives. For example, this man page http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/gethostbyaddr.html says that the pointer returned may be to static data, while MS use thread local storage. In neither case can or should the data be freed, and in neither case is there a leak.
