There is a major disadvantage to fitting individual predictors separately in regression. This page points out a major difficulty in general and a difficulty specific to generalized models like logistic regression. Even in ordinary least-squares regression, omitting a predictor that is both correlated to outcome and to the included predictors leads to omitted-variable bias in the estimates of the coefficients of the included predictors. In logistic regression, omitting any predictor associated with outcome, even one not correlated with the included predictors, leads to omitted-variable bias. Thus your coefficient estimates from the single-predictor regressions would be biased in difficult-to-know ways. And as a comment points out, the single-predictor route does not allow for examining interactions. I can think of no offsetting benefit.
