ure. Immigration enforcement relies on such aggregated data—including utility accounts and driver's license records, supplied by commercial providers to track, locate, and build digital dossiers on individuals who may have attempted to obscure their identities. Terabytes of personal data are traded on public marketplaces, providing raw inputs that can be aggregated into mosaic-style identity profiles. Some of this data is disclosed voluntarily, often in exchange for minor conveniences or benefits. Data brokers actively exploit the mosaic effect by linking disjointed datasets using unique attribute groupings, especially after major breaches, effectively "unlocking" new identification possibilities. Aggregation of third-party records from search queries to application usage logs creates centralized profiles that the government can access with a single request, yielding more comprehensive personal insights than traditional segmented requests. Digital rights advocate Samantha Floreani explained that the mosaic effect causes individual risk to compound with each successive aggregation of data, as personal details can be reassembled using a common identifier such as an email address. The volume of data held by technology companies enables prosecutors to extract incriminating details from digital histories that were never intended for legal scrutiny. Some of this data is disclosed voluntarily, often in exchange for minor conveniences or benefits. Gaps in a user's location history—such as those triggered by deletion policies—can themselves be used as circumstantial evidence in legal proceedings. This information is frequently shared with the expectation that it will be analyzed to reveal patterns about individuals. Mosaic theory extends beyond GPS tracking to modern telecommunications and Internet services, where providers' centralized records of location, communications, and usage data can be disclosed under the Stored Communications Act by court order or subpoena, enabling the government to assemble revealing mosaics of private lives. The approach re-frames surveillance law by treating continuous or repeated data collection as a single, holistic search rather than a series of isolated intrusions. Writing in Iowa Law Review, Jesse Woo analogizes the mosaic theory debate to the Sorites Paradox, arguing that incremental data collection may seem innocuous until it accumulates to a revealing whole—paralleling concerns over how much data constitutes a privacy harm. Continuous cell site location tracking can pinpoint an individual's presence within 'ordinarily and hitherto private enclave[s]'—including specific rooms—and associate them with others over time, yielding an unprecedentedly detailed portrait of personal movements. Employment The aggregation of personal data across platforms and time can intensify visibility by creating unintended overlaps between private and professional domains, such that, for example, a person living with cancer seeking employment may face potential discrimination if a prospective employer views their publicly accessible social media, leading to implicit bias despite their qualifications. This data can expose insights into an individual's routines, relationships, emotional state, mental health, and cross boundaries between personal and professional life via aggregation. In a widely cited real-world demonstration, medical records for Massachusetts state employees—originally believed to be anonymous—were linked to individuals by matching demographic attributes from health data with information available in voter registration lists. This process enabled re-identification of named individuals and sensitive details, including the sitting governor, despite the absence of direct identifiers in the released medical dataset. Health analytics A 2017 study found that combining de-identified health research data with external sources, such as housing characteristics and public records, significantly increased the risk of
