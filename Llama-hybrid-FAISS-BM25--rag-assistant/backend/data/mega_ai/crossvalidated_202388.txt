Ordinal or binomial regression?

I have designed a question and now intend to use SPSS to analyse the results: My dependent variable is: intention to vote. Yes or No. My independent variables are: a series of question ranked on a scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Do I need to use ordinal regression, if the dependent variable is Dichotomous? Even thought the independent variables are ordinal. Or do I need to use binomial logistic regression, as my dependent variable is simply yes or no? Would it be possible to do this with ordinal independent variables? Many thanks.
