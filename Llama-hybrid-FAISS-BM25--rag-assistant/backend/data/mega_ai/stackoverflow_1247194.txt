What about objects that do not have addAttributeToFilter ? I've been trying for hours to load a role object by its name and nothing works. The only possible method is load, which would work perfectly if not for an unexplicable if (!intval($value) && is_string($value)) { $field = 'role_id'; } in Mage_Admin_Model_Mysql4_Role::load , which only makes it impossible to filter using a string value. Magento has a Rube Goldberg architecture...
