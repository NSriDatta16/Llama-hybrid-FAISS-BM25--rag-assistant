As far as I know, most neural networks don't use a a priori probability distribution over the input images. However you could interpret the selection of the training set to be such a probability distribution. In that view, these artificially generated images are unlikely to be picked as images in the test-set. One way to measure the 'joint-probability' would be to randomly generate images and then label them. The problem would be that the vast, VAST majority would have no label. So to get a reasonable number of labelled examples would take for too much time.
