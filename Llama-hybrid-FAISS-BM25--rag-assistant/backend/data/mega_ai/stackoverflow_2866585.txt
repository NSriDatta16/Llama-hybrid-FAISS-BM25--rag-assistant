Different virtual directories can have different application pools. If they share the same app pool and blow up then the whole app crashes. If you have different app pools configured for the virtual directories then they are isolated. Bear in mind that setting up different app pools for your virtual directories has other consequences such as the lack of ability to share in memory session state. In this case you have to use out-of-process storage.
