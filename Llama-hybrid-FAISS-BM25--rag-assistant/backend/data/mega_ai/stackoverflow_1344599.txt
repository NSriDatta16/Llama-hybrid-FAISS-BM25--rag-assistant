SQLiteJDBC and PreparedStatement to use pragma table_info

I'm utilizing Java and SQLiteJDBC to work with SQLite. I need to access name of columns for a given table and I've found that I could accomplish this with the following command: pragma table_info(myTable) However, when attempting to do the following I get an error. PreparedStatement _pstmt = this._DBConnection.prepareStatement("pragma table_info( '?' );", new String[] {_tableName} ); java.sql.SQLException: NYI I have no idea what NYI means and furthermore, I'm not sure if I can do what I'm trying to do. Any suggestions on how I can accomplish getting the column names?
