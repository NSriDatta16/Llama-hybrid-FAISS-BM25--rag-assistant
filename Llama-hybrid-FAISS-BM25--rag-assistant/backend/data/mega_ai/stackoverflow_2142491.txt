How can I detect which UIImageView was selected with a touch in touchesBegan?

The user can create a unlimited number of UIImageViews with a button press with this code: - (IBAction) addPicture:(id)sender { imageView = [[UIImageView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0, 45.0, 324, 52.0)]; imageView.tag = a; imageView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"Picture.png"]; a = a + 1; [self.view addSubview:imageView]; [imageView release]; } So the first UIImageView gets the tag 1 and the second 2 and so on... Now how can I find out, which UIImageView was select by the user with a touch? I think, I have to do this in touchesBegan, but as I said, I donÂ´t know how to get the right UIImageView. For example in my app-idea the user can create images with a button and then he select a picture with a touch and can move it and resize it. Thanks for your help.
