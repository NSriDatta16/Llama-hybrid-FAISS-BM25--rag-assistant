What are the best models/methods for training when the target is multidimensional?

I am not very familiar with all methods in Machine Learning. However, I know for example when I apply linear regression, the y is always assumed to be one-dimensional. My target is multi-dimensional. One approach would be to train a model for each dimension. But I wonder if there are other approaches that considers all dimensions together (so not to consider them independently, like if I train a different linear regression model for each dimension)?
