A parallel with programming languages is probably very relevant. While hi-level languages are the preferred tools for most programming jobs, and have been made possible (in part) by the increases in CPU speed and storage capactity, they haven't removed the need for assembly language. In a similar fashion, non-binary protocols introduce more abstraction, more extensibility and are therefore the vehicle of choice particularly for application-level communication. They too have benefited from increases in bandwidth and storage capacity. Yet at lower level it is still impractical to be so wasteful. Furthermore unlike with programming languages where there are strong incentives to "take the performance hit" in exchange for added simplicity, speed of development etc., the ability to structure communication in layers makes the complexity and "binary-ness" of lower layers rather transparent to the application level . For example so long as the SOAP messages one receives are ok, the application doesn't need to know that these were effectively compressed to transit over the wire.
