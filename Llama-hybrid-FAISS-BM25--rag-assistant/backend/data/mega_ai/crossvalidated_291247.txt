Can a calibrated prediction model that is able to discriminate have a poor Brier score?

I did a logistic regression with selected covariates on a dataset with about 10000 records and event rate of 10%. The cross validated c-index was 63% which admittedly is not very high. Looking at a calibration plot the model seemed well calibrated. However, the reduction in Brier score from a model without covariates was only about 3%. What can be the cause of the low reduction in Brier score? A random forest on the same data gave a c-index of 59% and still a low reduction in Brier score compared to the logistic regression without covariates.
