Bayesian logistic regression with mixed (two level) data

I have two datasets, the first on schools, and the second lists students in each school who have failed in standardized test (emphasis intentional). The first dataset has the structure below (I'm sorry I could not figure out how to insert a proper data snippet): School_ID Total_White Total_Black Total_Asian School_Revenue The second looks like this: Student_ID School_ID Race I am trying to estimate the probability of failure, given student race and school revenue. If I run a multinomial discrete choice model on the second dataset, I shall clearly be estimating P(Race | Fail=1) . I obviously have to estimate the inverse, P(Fail=1 | Race) , by merging the two datasets by School_ID. Since all the pieces of information are available in the two datasets ( P(Fail), P(Race), Revenue ), I see no reason why this can't be done. But I am stumped as to actually how to implement in R. Any pointer would be much appreciated. Thanks.
