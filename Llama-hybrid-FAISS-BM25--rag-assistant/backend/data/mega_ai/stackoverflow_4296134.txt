Calling Matlab from C# using COM object

I'm trying to make a simple C# GUI that uses Matlab for its processing. I'm trying to use the Matlab application COM object for communication but am getting the following error during allocation: An unhandled exception of type 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException' occurred in cSharpCallsMATLAB.exe Additional information: Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {491B6189-7E9D-43F4-A7DE-C062DF7B326E} failed due to the following error: 80080005. Earlier I create the necessary object: private MLApp.MLAppClass ml; and assign it in the form constructor: ml = new MLApp.MLAppClass(); and the program hangs on that line and returns an error after about 5 seconds. I've looked around but can't seem to fix this problem. Does anyone have any advice on how to get C# to successfully connect to Matlab? Thanks!
