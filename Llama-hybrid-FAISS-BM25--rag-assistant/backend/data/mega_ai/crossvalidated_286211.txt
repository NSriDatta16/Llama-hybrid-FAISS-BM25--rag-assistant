The Multinomial Test seems appropriate. You can do this through a significance test, or by using Bayesian inference with a Dirichlet prior. For a frequentist significance test, your null hypothesis is: $$ \begin{split} P(4H) &= 1/16 \\ P(3H) &= 1/4 \\ P(2H) &= 3/8 \\ P(1H) &= 1/4 \\ P(0H) &= 1/16. \end{split} $$ That's the probability distribution of an outcome of four flips of a fair coin. What you're trying to find is if the distribution of "head count" outcomes represents the distribution given by a set of fair coins. While this won't answer the question of whether any one coin is unfair (which, for the reasons you stated in your question, you just cannot do) this does help answer whether your set of coins are all fair. If the probability of getting an outcome that's as likely or less likely than yours given that they're all fair coins, then that's a reason to reject the null hypothesis. As mentioned in the article I linked, the Multinomial test is intractable for a large number of samples and categories. That's because, for $N$ samples and $k$ multinomial categories, there are $N + k - 1 \choose k - 1$ possible outcomes, and you have to figure out which outcomes, from that set, are less likely than the one you got. So an approximation scheme like the likelihood ratio test might be appropriate. In your case ($N=56$, $k=5$) there are 490 thousand possible outcomes. If you don't mind the computational load, you can brute force calculate the probability of all those outcomes and search for which ones are lower than, or equal to, the probability of your outcome. The sum of those probabilities is your $p$-value. Otherwise you can use the LR test as illustrated in the wiki article, which is simple enough.
