This type of problem is a panel data problem - given that building a model to forecast rental growth on both cross-sectional and time series data (i.e. data across several properties collected at varying periods in time). In this regard, a distinction must be made between fixed and random effects, whereby fixed effects only consider factors that do not vary over time, e.g. land size, rooms per property. In other words, these factors are time-invariant . On the other hand, random effects are time-dependent and will vary over time, e.g. interest rates, building costs, housing supply. Notwithstanding that viewing the data would be necessary to advise further - one potential course of action is to model the predictions using a panel data model (as one example, the plm library in R allows for linear modelling across panel data). The objective of this would be to estimate the effect on rental prices by considering only fixed effects at first, and then also estimating the same using random effects. While this model makes it easier to isolate the time effect - attention must still be paid to the effects of confounding variables when doing so. e.g. if supply increases next year and interest rates fall concurrently - it can be difficult to know whether the increase in supply or the fall in interest rates had a larger impact on rental prices for that year. Based on the information in the question - my view is that estimating these effects using a panel regression is a good first step.
