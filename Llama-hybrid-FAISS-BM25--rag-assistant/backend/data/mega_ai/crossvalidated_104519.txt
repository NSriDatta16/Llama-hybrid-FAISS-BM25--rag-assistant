Why isn't bayesian statistics more popular for statistical process control?

My understanding of the bayesian vs frequentist debate is that frequentist statistics: is (or claims to be) objective or at least unbiased so different researchers, using different assumptions can still get quantitatively comparable results while bayesian statistics claims to make "better" predictions (i.e. lower expected loss), because it can use prior knowledge (among other reasons) needs fewer "ad hoc" choices, replacing them by prior/model choices that (at least in principle) have a real-world interpretation. Given that, I would have expected that bayesian statistics would be very popular in SPC: If I were a factory owner trying to control my process quality, I would primarily care about expected loss; If I could reduce that, because I have more/better prior knowledge than my competitors, even better. But practically everything I have read about SPC seems to be firmly frequentist (i.e. no prior distributions, point estimates of all parameters, many ad-hoc choices about sample size, p-values etc.) Why is that? I can see why frequentist statistics were a better choice in the 1960's, when SPC was done using pen and paper. But why hasn't anyone tried different methods since then?
