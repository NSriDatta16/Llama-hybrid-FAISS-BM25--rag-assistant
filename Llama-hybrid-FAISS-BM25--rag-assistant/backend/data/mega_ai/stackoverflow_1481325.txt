How to make a simple jQuery button in XHTML strict with no form postback?

I am making a site with DOCTYPE XHTML Strict and it complains if I have an input button or button element outside a form . So I put it in a form and it complains that I don't have an action attribute. So I put in an action attribute but then the buttons postback to the page, which I don't want. How can I just have a normal jQuery button with bound event in XHTML strict? here is another paragraph What color is the sky? blue Show Answer
