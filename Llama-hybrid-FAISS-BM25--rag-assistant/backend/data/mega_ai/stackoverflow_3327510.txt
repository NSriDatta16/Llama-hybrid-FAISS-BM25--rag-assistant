Just to be clear your intent is to create an emulated MMO server to the effect of WOW? That's not really a trivial task and carries with it its own ethical implications. Just to get started will require a ton of research, inspection, decoding, an extreme attention to detail. If you are serious about it, then I would suggest looking up networking tools that can help you inspect traffic across the network and creating a scientific process for operation inspection. Again, it should be noted this is by no means a trivial task.
