How to report a SVM model to a 3rd party after cross-validation?

I have a binary classification problem. I trained my dataset using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Now I want to report the model I trained to a 3rd party so that they can use. For the primal probem of SVM, the classifier equation is of the form, y = w.x + b where w is the weight vector, b is the constant and x is the new instance. Depending on the value of y , we can predict the class. I could report the weight vector w and constant b which was obtained my model. But if I want to test my model using cross-validation, then how do I report my model? Everytime I cross-validate, the equation of the classifier built will change.
