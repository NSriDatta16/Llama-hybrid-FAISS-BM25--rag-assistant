You might want to have a look at these papers: F. Bach, M. I. Jordan. A probabilistic interpretation of canonical correlation analysis. Technical Report 688, Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, 2005 and CÃ©dric Archambeau, Nicolas Delannay, and Michel Verleysen. 2006. Robust probabilistic projections. In Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Machine learning (ICML '06). They both give graphical model interpretations of CCA, form it as (slightly different) probabilistic models, and show how these can be solved using the EM algorithm. Whilst it might not exactly match your requirements, it seems that your problem could be formulated as a graphical model in this way. Depending how the resulting model looks, you might be able to use off-the-shelf methods to solve it - see e.g. this list of software packages
