Random Forest is based on bagging and voting . It means all the individual model has to persist to be used in prediction. Hence increasing the count of estimators will need more RAM . The good news is that the same property makes it eligible to be trained in parallel if Cores/CPU is available. Please try that.@Brady Gilg has suggested the same. I have tried ~10 Mn records with estimator count between 15-40 and it needed less than 30 mins. It seems your production system is very light Or something is incorrect with the E2E model.
