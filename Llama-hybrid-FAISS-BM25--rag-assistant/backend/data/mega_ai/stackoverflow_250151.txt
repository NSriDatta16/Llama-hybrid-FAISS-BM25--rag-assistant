Lua as a general-purpose scripting language?

When I see Lua, the only thing I ever read is "great for embedding", "fast", "lightweight" and more often than anything else: "World of Warcraft" or in short "WoW". Why is it limited to embedding the whole thing into another application? Why not write general-purpose scripts like you do with Python or Perl? Lua seems to be doing great in aspects like speed and memory-usage (The fastest scripting language afaik) so why is it that I never see Lua being used as a "Desktop scripting-language" to automate tasks? For example: Renaming a bunch of files Download some files from the web Webscraping Is it the lack of the standard library?
