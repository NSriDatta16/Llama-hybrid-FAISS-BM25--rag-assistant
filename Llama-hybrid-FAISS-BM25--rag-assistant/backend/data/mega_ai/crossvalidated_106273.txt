My reading of the literature on exact logistic regression is that it has the same problems of power loss that Fisher's "exact" test has. What got you interested in exact logistic regression? A better approach may be to use penalized maximum likelihood estimation with ordinary unconditional logistic regression. ["Exact" logistic regression is a type of conditional analysis in the same sense as Fisher's test, i.e., it in some ways changes the hypotheses one tests by conditioning on certain margins.]
