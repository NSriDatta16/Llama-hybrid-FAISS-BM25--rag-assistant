Cloning a Lua table in Lua C API

There are heaps of examples of how to clone a Lua table in Lua, however I wasn't able to find any example of how to do it with the native Lua C API. I tried to do it by hand twice, but ended up with a real (although working) mess. Does anyone have any tips or links on how to elegantly do a shallow copy of a Lua table in the C API?
