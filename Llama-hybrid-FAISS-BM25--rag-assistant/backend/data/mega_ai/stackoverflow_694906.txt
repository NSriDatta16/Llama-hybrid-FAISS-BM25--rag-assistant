I was working on making modifications to Magento for a client. There is very little information on how the Magento system is organized. There are hundreds of folders and files, and there are at least a thousand view files. There was little support available from Magento forums, and I suspect the main reason for this lack of information is because the creators of Magento want you to pay them to become a certified Magento developer. Also, at that time last year there was no StackOverflow :) My first task was to figure out how the database schema worked and which table stored some attributes I was looking for. There are over 300 tables in Magento, and I couldn't find out how the SQL queries were being done. So I had just one option... I exported the entire database (300+ tables, and at least 20,000 lines of SQL code) into a .sql file using PhpMyAdmin, and I 'committed' this file into the subversion repositry. Then, I made some changes to the database using the Magento administration panel, and redownloaded the .sql file. Then, I ran a DIFF using TortioseSvn, and scrolled through the 20k+ lines file to find which lines had changed, LOL. As crazy as it sounds, it did work, and I was able to figure out which tables I needed to access. My 2nd problem was, because of the crazy directory structure, I had to ftp to about 3 folders at the same time for trivial changes. So I had to keep 3 windows of my ftp program open, switch between them and ftp each time. The 3rd problem was figuring out how the url mapping worked and where some of the code I wanted was being stored. Here, by sheer luck, I managed to find the Model class I was looking for. Mostly by sheer luck and other similar crazy adventures I managed to work my way through and complete the project. Since then, StackOverflow was started and by a helpful answer to this bounty question I was able to finally get enough information about Magento that I can do future projects in a less crazy manner (hopefully).
