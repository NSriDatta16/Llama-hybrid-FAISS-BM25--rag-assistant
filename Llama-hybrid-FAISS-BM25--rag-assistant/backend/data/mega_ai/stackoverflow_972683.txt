So long as their aren't dependencies among multiple changes, keep your check in's small. Check in the smallest collection of changes that won't break the build or introduce other problems. For bugs or small change request, usually one check in per bug (or change) tends to work best. This allows you to easily identify which file (or files) were updated to address a particular issue. this is not only helpful in rolling back changes but also in determinie what changes were made to fix an issue should a similar problem arise in the future. For major changes, if they can be broken down into smaller units of work to be checked in, do so. A - if you do need to roll back something because of a minor mistake, having to rollback all of the changes is just plain depressing. B - hard drives crash - if you are working on something for an extended period of time, the more changes you implement and the longer you work without checking in, the greater risk you are putting your work and your organization in.
