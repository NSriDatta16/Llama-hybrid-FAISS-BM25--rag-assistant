How do you Manage Infragistics WebGrid Data from JavaScript/Ajax code?

I am working on a project that I need to use the Infragistics WebGrid control for some lists of data. I am loading the data on the client-side using JavaScript for display on a Map, and then I need to display that same data within multiple WebGrids. All the data available will be displayed in the WebGrids, but only a subset of the data (only that which is currently within view) will be plotted on the Map at any given time. Since I am loading the data using JavaScript/Ajax, I would like to only load it once, and use the same mechanism to populate the WebGrid control with data too. Does anyone have any tips/pointers on working with the WebGrid completely from within client-side JavaScript/Ajax code?
