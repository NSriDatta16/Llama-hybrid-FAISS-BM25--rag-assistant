Yes, K-means is an option. But you need to do some data processing first. My first concern is about quantifying those statuses (are they linearly depended, like does B means something in the middle of A and C)? then numerate them (A to 1 and B to 2 and C to 3 etc) Represent your data set in a dimensional way, melt years columns into three columns Year (with values of 2000, 2001, 2003 etc) so you get a time series dimension. Year_status (status value). Year_percentage (percentage of the year). Try to treat pattern by moving window (kernel), and try different sizes.. for example size of 3 will cluster every 3 followed statuses into patterns centroids (for example.. having a common occurrence of A, E, A)
