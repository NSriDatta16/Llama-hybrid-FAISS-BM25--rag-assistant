Here's the situation if you choose a fixed value of K (possibly depending on the time of day). Think about the steady-state requirement: if there are L requests per minute then you need to produce L objects per minute, else your pool with grow or shrink with time. So with T fixed you choose a value of K such that L = K/T. You can now simplify your thinking by working in a more useful time scale than minutes: the time to make 1 object, or T/K. With K/T = L as above, then there will be on average 1 request per unit of T/K. That is, in this time scale, the Poisson rate is 1. Finding a pool size N that has less than a 1% chance of running out then means that N must be above the 99% probability point of a cumulative Poisson distribution having rate 1. That value is N = 4, for which the cumulative Poisson probability is 99.6%. If you could accept a 1.9% chance of running out, you could get by with N = 3. This argument ignores the quantization in K and the possibility of choosing K adaptively. Also, I'm not completely sure that it properly covers the fact that you will be only producing a new unit after one has been taken from the pool. This should, however, point you in the right direction.
