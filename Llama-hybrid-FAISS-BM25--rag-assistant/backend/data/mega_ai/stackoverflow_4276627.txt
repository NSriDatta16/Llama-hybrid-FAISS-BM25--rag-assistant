Facebook Like API

I am having some trouble with the facebook like api. I am creating the like button with the following code: artist_id;?>&amp;amp;show=albums&amp;amp;sub_section=song&amp;amp;id= song_id;?>" layout="box_count" show_faces="false" width="50" font="arial" title=" song_name);?> by artist_name;?> on www.nettunes.co.za"> I am then listening for the event and calling a javascript function, that ajax runs a piece of PHP that inserts the like into the local database to keep track of all likes for this artist. using this code: var e = document.createElement('script'); e.type = 'text/javascript'; e.src = document.location.protocol + '//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js'; e.async = true; document.getElementById('fb-root').appendChild(e); FB.Event.subscribe('edge.create', function(response) { var song_id = response.toString().split("&amp;id="); likeSong(song_id[1]); }); The problem is that it doesnt always call this likeSong function and add the like to the database. Has anyone had a similar problem before? or do you know of a better way of doing this? thanks so much take care, Chregan
