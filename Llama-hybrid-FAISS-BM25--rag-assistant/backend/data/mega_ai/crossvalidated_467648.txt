Suppose we have data as shown in the histogram below. (Of course there are no ages below $0,$ but I wanted the histogram bars to be of equal widths.) Suppose we make the simplifying approximation that all ages in each of the $k = 4$ histogram bins are at the centers of their intervals. Then we get frequencies $3, 41, 51, 5$ (for $n = 100$ subjects altogether) 'located' at midpoints $7, 25, 45, 65.$ Then the sample mean can be estimated as $$\bar X \approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^k f_im_i = 36.66.$$ The average was computed, using R statistical software as a calculator, as follows: f = c(3, 41, 51, 5) m = c(7, 25, 45, 65) a = sum(f*m)/100; a [1] 36.66 Perhaps somewhat less accurately, we can approximate the sample variance as follows: $$S^2 \approx \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^k f_i(m_i - \bar X)^2 = 159.358.$$ v = sum(f*(m-a)^2)/99; v [1] 159.358 Unless you have the original data, you can't know how accurately $\bar X$ and $S^2$ are actually estimated by these formulas. However, I simulated the heights in R, so we can check the true values. For my simulated data the approximate values happen to be quite accurate. [I suspect results in this example turned out to be a little better than usual--especially because we used only four intervals.] set.seed(2020) # for reproducibility x = round(rnorm(100, 35, 10)) summary(x) Min. 1st Qu.

Results are usually pretty good if you use a dozen or so intervals. (2) Some elementary statistics books (especially high-school AP statistics books) have formulas for estimating sample medians, other sample quantiles, estimating population modes from data summarized in the form of intervals and frequencies.
