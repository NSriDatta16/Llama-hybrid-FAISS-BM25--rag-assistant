You could try Awesomium (yes, the name is slightly /facepalm worthy ;)). It's based on Chrome (which uses Webkit) and is free for non-commercial use (commercial licensing is also available) and there is a CodePlex project called AwesomiumDotNet that provides a .NET wrapper for it. I haven't used it yet myself, but came across it doing some research into embedding a Webkit-based browser into an .NET/WPF app.
