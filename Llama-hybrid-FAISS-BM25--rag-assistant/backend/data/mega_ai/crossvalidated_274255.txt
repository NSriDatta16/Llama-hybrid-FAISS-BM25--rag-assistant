How to penalize coefficient of some features in a model?

I am building a logistic regression model for classification purposes -- I have 8 features - a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, b2, b3, b4. I want to build a model such that I should be able to penalize the coefficients of some of these features. For example, say no penalty for a1, a2, a3, a4 and l2 penalty for b1, b2, b3, b4. I am looking for both a theoretical solution and probably some direction to implement it in Python Thanks!
