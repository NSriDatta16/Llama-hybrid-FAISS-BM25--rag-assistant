Can existing WPF applications be converted to MonoDroid easily?

Is there any automated conversion which will take an existing WPF application and convert it to MonoDroid? Leveraging existing knowledge of C# is great. What would be the icing on the cake would be being able to continue writing WPF XAML code as well.
