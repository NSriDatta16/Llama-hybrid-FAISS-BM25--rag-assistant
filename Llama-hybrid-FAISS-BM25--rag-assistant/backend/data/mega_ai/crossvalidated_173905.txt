Does the sample size influence the number of PCs needed to explain a fixed percentage of variance?

In PCA, I have observed the following pattern: larger sample sizes from the same population(s) imply that a higher number of principal components (PCs) are required to explain a fixed percentage of variance. Using an anecdotal example, if I have a sample size of 100, then 10 PCs explain 90% of the variance. However, if I have a sample size of 200, then 20 PCs may be required to explain the same 90% of variance. My questions are: Does this pattern hold generically for all kinds of data? If the answer to the previous question is "yes", then is there any literature reference I can use to make such claim? (I've searched but didn't find any). If the answer to the previous question is "no", is there a simple rational I can use to explain why this pattern occurs?
