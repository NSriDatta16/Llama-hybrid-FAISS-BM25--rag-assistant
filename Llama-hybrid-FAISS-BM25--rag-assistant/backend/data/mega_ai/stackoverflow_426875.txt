I would say that if it is indeed only a little extra work and it adds so much extra value it's hard to conceive it could be a waste of time. Users coming in behind you that look to use your components in future will find it a lot easier and will be saving a lot of time that would otherwise be spent coding by hand. Not to mention that if you can drag and drop a component with a mouse click and drag, then why waste the keystrokes?
