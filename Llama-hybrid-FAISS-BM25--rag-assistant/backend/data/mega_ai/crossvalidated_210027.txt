Evaluating two sets of random samples

Let $p$ be a probability distribution that can be computed tractably for any given point. I use two MCMC methods to generate samples from the distributions. For each MCMC method, I run 1000 Markov chains with random initialization till the chain converges. This gives me two sets of random samples with thousand samples each, one for each MCMC method. Now I wish to evaluate which set of random samples are more representative of the distribution $p$. In two dimensions, I can do a scatter plot of the points and compare it with a surface plot of the distribution $p$. However, I am not sure what to do in higher dimensions. Evaluating $\sum_{i=1}^n \log p(x_i)$ for each set individually isn't useful, because a Markov chain that always generates the mode will win. I can compute the derivative of $\sum_{i=1}^n \log p(x_i)$ with respect to the parameters of $p$. The set with the lower norm of derivative is probably a better fit to $p$. However, I am quite sure that there is a much simpler idea. ANy suggestions?
