URL Builder for CherryPy

After using werkzeug as a web framework (which is great and simple, but doesnt support some features), i'm now trying cherrypy. Now what I miss in cherrypy is werkzeug's elegant way of building urls (e.g. for links in templates) using the name of a decorated function like this: @expose('/archive/ / ') def archive(request, year, month): pass >>> url_for('archive',2010,04) '/archive/2010/04' I didn't find a similar way in cherrypy, did I miss it?
