Dependent variable selection for loglinear segmented regression in time-series analysis of rare events

My office is going to implement a bundle of infection control measures in hospital and see if it can effectively reduce the infection rate of some pathogen. The unit of measurement will be "case per thousand patient bed days". We have chosen 4 wards for implementing the control measures for 12 months, and do the measurement monthly, but by looking at the current infection data, even thses wards are considered as having the highest count of infections, they are still considered as relatively clean, as they have several months with zero measurement in rates. I have created a regression model showing if they managed to reduce 50% of infection, and the betas in the model (with three variables inside), are not statistically significant. My colleagues are worried that with all these hard work, giving non-significant result will be very frustrating for the front line staff. Is there any alernative outcome measure, or even alternative statistical methods, for time series of rare events? Thanks!
