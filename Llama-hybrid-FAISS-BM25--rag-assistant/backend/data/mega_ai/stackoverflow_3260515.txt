SQLite short file names 8.3

I am attempting to compile SQLite for an operating system that does not support long file names. The max file name is 8 chars long with an extension of 3 chars (8.3). Currently a "-journal" is created while using SQLite this breaks the file name rule and stops SQLite with "Disk I/O Error" I have tried to disable the journal from being created in the first place with "PRAGMA journal_mode OFF" but it appears that the file still gets created then destroyed. Is there anyway (compile flag or PRAGMA, ect) to force SQLite to use 8.3 file names? Is there anyway to disable the journal from being created? Not Windows, not Unix, not OS2, other OS
