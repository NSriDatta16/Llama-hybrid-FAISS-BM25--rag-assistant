If the IV is always zero, all messages with common text at the start (for example, emails with the same first two or three cipher blocks for the 'From ' or 'From: ' information) will be encrypted the same. This gives the attacker leverage over your key. That is unconditionally bad. As long as you use a reasonably random IV, the attacker loses that leverage. Don't risk it.
