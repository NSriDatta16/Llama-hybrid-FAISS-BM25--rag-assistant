Well, you have reversed your handle_event clauses. The first one will always match, so you won't reach the {test} clause. As far as I know, the best online documentation is http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/events.html . But I can recommend e.g. the book Erlang and OTP in action http://www.amazon.com/Erlang-OTP-Action-Martin-Logan/dp/1933988789
