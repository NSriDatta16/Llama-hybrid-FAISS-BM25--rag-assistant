What are first-class objects in Java and C#?

When I started OO programming many years ago I gained the impression that variables (if that is the right word) were either "primitives" (int, double, etc.) or first-class objects (String, JPane, etc.). This is reinforced by a recent answer on primitives in Java and C# (@Daniel Pryden: Are primitive types different in Java and C#? ). However don't know whether C# ValueTypes are primitives, objects or some other beast such as second-class objects. I see that SO has only one use of the first-class tag so maybe it is no longer a useful term. I did not find the Wikipedia article useful ("This article is in need of attention from an expert on the subject."). I'd be grateful for a taxonomy and current usage of terms, primarily related to Java and C# (though maybe other languages will shed enlightenment). Clarification : I'd like to understand the term first-class and what its range of use is.
