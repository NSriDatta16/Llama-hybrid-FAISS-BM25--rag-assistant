Has anyone used ICU with Delphi?

Has anyone used the ICU ( see http://site.icu-project.org/ ) DLLs from Delphi? Specifically I'm interested in the Code Page Conversion and Collation functions. Looking at the header files it would appear that they are mostly in C++ using classes, so without having done much research yet, I would assume that it's necessary to create a simple wrapper around this that exports simple functions which can easily be imported in Delphi. Has anyone done any work for that yet? Or can anyone recommend a different solution for Delphi that has similar extensive coverage for codepages and collation orders?
