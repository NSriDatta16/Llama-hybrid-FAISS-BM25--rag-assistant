How to define a list of lists in Scala?

I would like to create a storage for the following type: List(List(2.3,1.1),List(2.2, 1)) But if I do the following: var y = List(List (1.0, 2.2), List(2, 1.1, -2.1)) then it creates as List[AnyVal] and gives me error if I try to perform math operation: y(0)(0) * 2 // Error - value '2' is not a member of AnyVal
