Do you need to be able to read the contents of the txt file or is it just for storage? if it's the latter you could consider creating a serializable class that encapsulates all your properties (e.g. Person, Employee etc...) and then bind these fields to the form fields. Then you only need to serialize the class/object into and store it into a text file rather than having to sw.Writeline each individual field.
