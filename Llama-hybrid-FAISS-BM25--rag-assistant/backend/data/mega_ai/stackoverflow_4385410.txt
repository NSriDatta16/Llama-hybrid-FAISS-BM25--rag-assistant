Clear input field when data is dragged and dropped

I wrote a function that automatically clears the preset value of an input field when the user focusses on it, and puts it back on blur if the user does not input any value. so the value of would be set to nothing on focus. The problem I am facing is as follows: When I select a bit of text on the page and drag and drop it into the input field, the field will not be cleared before the dropped text is applied. Instead the value of the input field will become: exampleLorem, opposed to just Lorem. Is there a proper way to remove the default value right after the text is dropped into the input field?
