Using the embed tag literally compiles that resource into the final SWF output. So it's a matter of how much preloading you want to do and how big you want your initial swf to be. If you are embedding some small thumbnail images or sound files, this may be okay to an extent. But if you embed all of your assets or large assets, well you can figure it out from there, you're going to merge that file size + the size of any other files into 1 file, which is also meant to be your user interface. Keep assets external (for the most part) and dynamically load them in. There might be specific cases as mentioned here in other answers where it is required but unless otherwise dictated, organize your assets and simply load/unload them as needed. The other nice thing about using the Loader class is that is gives you more control over destroying the object from memory than anything else. You can call the unloadAndStop(Boolean CallGarbageCollector) method and directly request the VM to forcefully stop, delete and clean that object up. Anyway hope this clarifies things.
