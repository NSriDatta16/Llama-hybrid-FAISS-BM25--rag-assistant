Sure, you could do something like this: foreach($_POST as $key => $value) $_SESSION['form'][$key] = $value; This will save all the POST data into the $_SESSION['form'] array. Note that it saves all the data, a malicious user can just add values to this. On the last page you can echo the fields like this (don't forget to escape the values, that's what htmlspecialchars() is for). foreach($_SESSION['form'] as $key => $value) echo htmlspecialchars($key) . ": " . htmlspecialchars($value) . " \n"; Edit: The array_merge() approach is acutaly more elegant than this one, so just forget about the first piece of code.
