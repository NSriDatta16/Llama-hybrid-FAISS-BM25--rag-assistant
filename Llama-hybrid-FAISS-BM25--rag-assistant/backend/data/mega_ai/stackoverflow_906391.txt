grid control with surrport for hierarchical data and frozen column?

I am trying to find out a way of showing hierarchical data ( 3/4 levels nested data) in grid ( in IE6+ ). I want to show hierarchical data with vales for all columns at the parent and child nodes. Also I want to freeze first two columns in the grid. Be able to expand ( drill down ) the grid view by loading data on demand ( ajax) looking at loading grid with about 800 to 1K rows. I saw a few jquery grids where it does not support column freeze and other third party controls ( infragistics) generate so much of javascript that along with the first column IE also starts freezing.
