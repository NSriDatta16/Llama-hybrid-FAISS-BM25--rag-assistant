How to explain decision tree algortihm in layman's terms?

I have a task at hand, where I have to explain decision tree algorithm to a person who has not much understanding of machine learning . I have been looking around, but find it difficult to explain the algorithm in layman's terms, so that a person will understand what is happening in the process. What is the best way to describe the algorithm, possibly using some very simple basic example, so that the whole process of the algorithm is broken down to simple steps for understanding?
