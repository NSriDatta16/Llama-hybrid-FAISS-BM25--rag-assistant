Calculating variance of $c=a/b$ based on $\sigma_a$ and $\sigma_b$ (error propagation)

My problem concerns the calculation of variances in 2 different ways (the variances calculated in the 2 different ways do not seem to match)... I have the following data: For variable $A$: $\;\;\;\;$ 2, 1, 2 For variable $B$: $\;\;\;\;$ 8, 3, 1 Now define variable $f$ as follows: $f:=A/B$, so: for variable $f$ this becomes: $\;\;\;\;$ $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, 2 Now the variance of $f$ can be computed through 2 methods: Method 1 $$var(f)= \frac{1}{3-1} \sum_{i=1}^3 (f_i - \bar f)^2,$$ where $\bar f$ is the average of the $f_i$'s (simple computation yields: $\bar f= \frac{31}{36} ) $ This gives: $var(f)\approx 0.975$. Method 2 Through propagation of uncertainty (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty ) For $f$ the following holds true (see above wiki link): $$var(f)= \sigma_f^2 =f^2 \left( \left(\frac{\sigma_A}{A}\right)^2 +\left(\frac{\sigma_B}{B}\right)^2 - 2 \frac{\sigma_{AB}}{A\times B} \right). $$ where $\sigma_{AB}$ is the covariance. It is easy to calculate (using the sample variance formula) that: $\sigma_A^2 = \frac{1}{3}\approx 0.3333$ and $\sigma_B^2 =13$. Furthermore (using Excel), $\sigma_{AB}=Cov(A,B)=\frac{1}{3}\approx 0.3333$. Substituting $\sigma_{AB}$, $\sigma_{B}$, $\sigma_{B}$ and $A=\bar A$, $B=\bar B$, $f=\bar f$ into the above formula for $var(f)$ yields: $var(f)\approx 0.617$ My question is: why do I get 2 different numbers for the variance of $f$?
