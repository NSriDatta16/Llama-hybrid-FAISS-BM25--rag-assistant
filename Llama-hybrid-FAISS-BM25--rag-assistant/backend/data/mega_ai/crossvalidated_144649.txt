How to test predictive power of ARIMA model

Once I've fitted an ARIMA model (by choosing, say, the one with the lowest AIC), how can I go about gauging how effective it is at forecasting a given financial time series? Should I somehow incorporate transaction costs? For example, let's say I found that an ARIMA(2,1,2) is the best fit for predicting daily returns on 10-year treasuries, based on data from 2004-2014 (random example). How can I then gauge how well it actually would have predicted returns? I've thought of several ways I could potentially do it, though I doubt they are technically sound. I'm doing this for a thesis and selected the topic mainly just to learn how to fit econometric models and test their viability thereafter.
