*) Regarding the Finder: if a file or directory is being dragged from one volume to another, it will (by default) be copied. If the action is being performed on the same volume the file or folder will (by default) be moved. As a side note to file operations on volumes: 'moving' things across different filesystemes behaves differently, again. Normally, moving a file or directory doesn't mean 'copying' and 'deleting' the original afterwards - only their links within the filesystem usually become modified but here and then, it actually behaves exactly like that. *) Furthermore, take care of the objects permissions: if filesystem permissions to that source file or a directory (and it's content within) doesn't allow write operations to it, it will be copied again.
