Silverlight vs Flash vs HTML5, should I care?

I have read a range of articles on advantages/disadvantages of Microsoft Silverlight framework in comparisson to Flash. Fact that there were two version of Silverlight in the past 18 months worries me, as well as the fact that over 97% of web browsers already have Flash pre-installed. I'm a .NET developer and I'm very happy with what I can do in the framework. At the moment I feel like I have to put my own preference to a side and decide whether I need to integrage flash with .NET instead of using Silverlight with WPF. Did anybody try integrating Flash with .NET? What challanges did you come across? How easy was it in comparisson to working in Silverlight? I have also read about recent talks between Microsoft and Adobe. Whatever way I go It feels very unstable. Can HTML 5 really compete with what's offered by Flash and Silverlight? Thank you
