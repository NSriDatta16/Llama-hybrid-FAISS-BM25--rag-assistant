Those classes are not at odds. The DTO is simply serving as a conduit of data from storage that is intended to be used as a dumb container. It certainly doesn't violate the SRP. On the other hand the .toDTO method is questionable -- why should Customer have this responsibility? For "purity's" sake I would have another class who's job it was to create DTOs from business objects like Customer. Don't forget these principles are principles, and when you can et away with simpler solutions until changing requirements force the issue, then do so. Needless complexity is definitely something to avoid. I highly recommend, BTW, Robert C. Martin's Agile Patterns, Practices and principles for much more in depth treatments of this subject.
