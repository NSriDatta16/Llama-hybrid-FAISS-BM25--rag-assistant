I think you are on the right track in order to minimize the storage-amount within the SVN. I'd recommend the following technique: commit "A" as a branch in the repo remote copy (aka branch) "A" into new branch "B" - A and B are now completely the same check out "B" as a new project/folder (outside your "A"-working dir) add the changed files into "B" ( I'm pretty sure the modify-date won't count as a diff) commit "B" Good luck!
