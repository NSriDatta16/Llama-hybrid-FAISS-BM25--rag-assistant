You're also nesting tables and lists inside of paragraph tags which is invalid markup for the doctype you're using. A handful of the meta tags are not closed correctly along with capitalization of attributes which are also not allowed with the selected doctype. The stylesheet link tag is not closed correctly. The images tags in the table are not close correctly nor are the break tags. Fix the html errors first and then see where you're at with your layout. Good luck and hope this helps some.
