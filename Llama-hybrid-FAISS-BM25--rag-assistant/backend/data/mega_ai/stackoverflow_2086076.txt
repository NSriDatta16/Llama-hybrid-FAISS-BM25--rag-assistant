For me that would be the Joy programming language which is an elegant functional stack-based language. If you are interested in the implementation of this kind of languages, you can look at the Cat programming language which is similar, but has a static type system. There are implementations available in C#, and other languages. Note: I should disclose that I am actually the author of Cat.
