Best way to store large amounts of text data?

I am planning on building a 'data file' that my new game loads, this file contains a whole lot of text (we are talking about 300-400, maybe even double that, paragraphs) along with some trivial data. Basically, what would be the best way of storing this data in a file. There are a few requirements: backward/forward compatible (be able to gracefully accept older data and recognize new data( encryptable (so something like sqlite would be bad?) lightweight and quick to load possibly with some sort of anti-corruption recovery sector. Basically, is there anything out there that fits my needs? or is it going to be a 'roll-your-own' situation (no problem with either). If it's a roll-my-own, what would you recommend. I pretty much threw XML out of the window (far too 'bulky' and complex), was thinking of something like a virtual file-system, with a 'location-table' for quick reading of the data. I'm pretty curious what other programmers have to say.
