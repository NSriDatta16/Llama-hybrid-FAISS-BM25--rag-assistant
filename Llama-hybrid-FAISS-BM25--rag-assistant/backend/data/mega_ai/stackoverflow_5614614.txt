Which way should I follow for the load test in .Net?

I saw a few ways for load test. However really I'm confused about it! Because my story is : I collect datas from a web service, and I serialize them to give somewhere. Someone wants to calculate avarage time of my code( from collect data to serialize them ) for 100 or 150 users. These users can access my code same time asynchronously. So I want to make specific load test just in my code. Which way should I follow? Multithread? ThreadPool? PerformanceCounter? in C#
