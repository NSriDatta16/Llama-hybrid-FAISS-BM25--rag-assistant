I would recommend using different workspaces, and then adding the common projects to each workspace (you can specify the location of the project to be outside of the workspace). I believe this will work, but I haven't tried it, so I can't be sure. As @JesperE and @Dennis S suggested, working sets will help you organize your projects, but they may not make eclipse run any faster, since the projects will all still be loaded into the workspace.
