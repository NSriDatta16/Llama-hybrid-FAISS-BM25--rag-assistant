Why do you think a 5 point Likert-scale item is a count variable? I don't know your data but a 5-point Likert scale item does not sound like a variable that is a count variable with a Poisson distribution ( Poisson Distribution ) and thus you don't want to specify family=poisson . If your DV is a 5-point Likert scale (ordered categorical variable), you can either use linear models (e.g., multiple linear regression) or logistic models (ordered logistic regression, for example by using the polr function of the R package MASS ). In my opinion, you should use ordered logistic regression instead of linear regression if there are floor or ceiling effects in your DV, that is, if most people selected the highest or lowest category of the DV. You can check floor and ceiling effects by looking at a histogram of the DV and by looking at the mean score of the DV (A mean lower than 2 or higher than 4 could indicate a floor effect and ceiling effect, respectively). A consequence of floor and ceiling effects is that linear models underestimate the regression coefficients unless the independent variable(s) shows the same floor and ceiling effect, respectively. That's why equally difficult items of a scale are often higher correlated than unequally difficult items (McDonald & Ahlawat, 1974).
