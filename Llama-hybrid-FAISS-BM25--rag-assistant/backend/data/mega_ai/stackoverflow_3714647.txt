Because you have scoped your resources, you don't actually have direct access to the agents_controller via any actions. So calling get 'index' is really just trying to access /agents. If you tried this in your browser, it would fail as well. To get a success you'll have to supply a location param like so: get 'index', { :location => 'hawaii' } Hope that helps. Edit: If you want additional access to the agents_controller (meaning location is optional) simply add a top-level resource for it in your routes file: resources :agents
