If you want to store the source code in you DB, you can use the Java 6 Compiler API to compile it at runtime. See here for an example. In order to load classes at runtime, you can either use an URLClassLoader if you can specify the location of the bytecode with a URL, or use ClassLoader.defineClass and supply the bytecode as an array of bytes. Either way you should pay attention, that in order to use your dynamically loaded class, it should implement an interface that is known at compile time.
