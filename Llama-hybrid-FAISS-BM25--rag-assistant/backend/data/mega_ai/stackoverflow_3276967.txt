After fiddling with this for a little over an hour, I could not get it to work properly. I was able to get the generic test running properly with instrumentation for NUnit 2.5.5 using nunit-console.exe. Although the NUnit console runner ran my test successfully via the generic VSTest, I was never able to generate code coverage results. Although the test features of VS2010 sound great when reading about them, the implementation seems overly complex and very heavy. I've been using NUnit for years with great success and very low friction. I decided to try out JetBrains dotCover beta and within 5 minutes I downloaded it, installed it, and was able to configure and use it very successfully. It integrates seemlessly into ReSharper 5 and just worked for my NUnit tests. The code highlighting is a great visual tool to quickly locate blocks of code that were not executed by the tests.
