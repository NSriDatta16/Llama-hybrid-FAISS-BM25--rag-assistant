Can i use Magento's classes in my project?

i would like to use some classes that are into lib/Varien , my idea is to copy the classes into my project and put my classes to inherit from Varien's, actually i can do it, just using Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V. lol, what i really mean is if i do it, am i violating the copyright, law or maybe some license agreement of Magento?
