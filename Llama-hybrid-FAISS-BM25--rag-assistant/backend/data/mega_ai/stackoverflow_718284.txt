A regular expression is not required for something like this. Plain string operations can do it. (Example in C#): text = " " + text.Replace("\r\n", " ") + " "; (Depending on if the line breaks are system dependent or not you should use either a specific string like "\r\n" or the property Environment.NewLine .) If the string initially comes from user input so that you don't have total control over it, you have to properly html encode it before putting the paragraph tags in, to prevent cross site scripting attacks.
