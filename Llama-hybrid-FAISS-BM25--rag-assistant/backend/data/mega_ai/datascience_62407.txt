Answer: The error states that the target needs to be in single row i.e. (1,) where as you are giving (10,) ValueError: Error when checking target: expected dense_10 to have shape (1,) but got array with shape (10,) SOLUTION 1: Use "keras.utils.np_utils.to_categorical" to convert your model data labels to categorical one hot vectors. from keras.utils import to_categorical label = array(label_column) # one hot encode encoded_label = to_categorical(label) Then you can have 10 labels in target which your last layer expects. model.add(keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')) SOLUTION 2: If above does not work, then change the last layer of your CNN network to have one output as given below. model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
