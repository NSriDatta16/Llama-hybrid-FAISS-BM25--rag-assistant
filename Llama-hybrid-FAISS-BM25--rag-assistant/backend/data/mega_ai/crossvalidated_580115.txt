Machine Learning for Stock Price Prediction Issue

In financial application, someone might make use of machine learning techniques in stock price prediction, e.g. LSTM. In general, before training the model, in light of the model robustness, some practitioners might select MinMaxScaler to transform the whole series of stock prices. However, the MinMaxScaler could result in a considerable issue when predicting newly unseen data after model deployment. The stock prices could make a new high or new low at the periods far beyond from the training / testing samples. For example, the stock prices between 01JAN2000 and 31DEC2021 are used for training / testing the LSTM model, in which the historical high was just 100 dollars. After deploying the well trained LSTM model, around one year after model development, the stock price has been pushed up to a new high of 200 dollars at 31DEC2022. In other words, if the same MinMaxScaler setting at model development is applied to the new data, this could lead to an out-of-range data issue and a critical problem in predicting the future prices as the stock price series has moved to a new price range. Under such circumstance, how do the practitioners overcome the out-of-range data issue? Keep re-training the LSTM model again and again when the stock prices make a new high or new low? Thanks for sharing your insight in advance!
