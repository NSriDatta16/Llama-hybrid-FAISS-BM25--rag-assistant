A smaller dataset is better: Is this statement false in statistics? How to refute it properly?

Dr. Raoult, who promotes Hydroxychloroquine, has some really intriguing statement about statistics in the biomedical field: It's counterintuitive, but the smaller the sample size of a clinical test, the more significant its results are. The differences in a sample of 20 people may be more significant than in a sample of 10,000 people. If we need such a sample, there is a risk of being wrong. With 10,000 people, when the differences are small, sometimes they don't exist. Is this a false statement in statistics? If so, is it therefore also false in the Biomedical field? On which basis can we refute it properly, by a confidence interval? Dr. Raoult promotes Hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid-19, thanks to an article about data from 24 patients. His claims have been repeated a lot , but mainly in the mainstream media, not in the scientific press. In machine learning, the SciKit workflow states that before choosing any model, you NEED a dataset with at least 50 samples, whether it be for a simple regression, or the most advance clustering technique, etc., which is why I find this statement really intriguing. EDIT: some of the answers below make the assumption of no result bias. They deal with the concept of power and effect size . However it seems there is a bias in Dr. Raoult data. The most striking being removing data for the dead, for the reason they could not provide data for the entire duration of the study. My question remains however focused on the impact of using a small sample size. Source of the statement about Statistics in a French magazine Reference to the scientific paper in question.
