I novel approach I saw was by IT Jolliffe Principal Components Analysis . You run a PCA on your data (Note: PCA can be quite a useful data exploration tool in its own right), but instead of looking at the first few Principal Components (PCs), you plot the last few PCs. These PCs are the linear relationships between your variables with the smallest variance possible. Thus they detect "exact" or close to exact multivariate relationships in your data. A plot of the PC scores for the last PC will show outliers not easily detectable by looking individually at each variable. One example is for height and weight - some who has "above average" height and "below average" weight would be detected by the last PC of height and weight (assuming these are positively correlated), even if their height and weight were not "extreme" individually (e.g. someone who was 180cm and 60kg).
