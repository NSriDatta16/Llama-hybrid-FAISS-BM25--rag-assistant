When calculating weights using inverse probability weighting, should the mean of the distribution of weights =1?

I am trying to calculate stabilized weights using inverse probability weighting by "dropout" from my cohort study to try to account for selection bias due to follow-up. I read from one source that the distribution of the stabilized weights should have a mean of 1, that the sum of the unstabilized weights should be double the size of the sum of the stabilized weights and that the range for the unstabilized weights should be greater than that of the stabilized weights. However, no matter what I've tried with my code, the average distribution of the stabilized weights is not 1. Are these criteria valid? I have not been able to find these criteria anywhere written anywhere else.
