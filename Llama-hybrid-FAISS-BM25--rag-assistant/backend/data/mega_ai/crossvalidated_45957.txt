Detrending a time series regression model

In my text book is says: Regress each of $y_t, x_{t1}$, and $x_{t2}$ on a constant and the time trend $t$ and save the residuals... What do they mean regress each on a constant? What constant specifically? This is coming from a section in the textbook (introductory econometrics to be exact) dealing with detrending a time series.
