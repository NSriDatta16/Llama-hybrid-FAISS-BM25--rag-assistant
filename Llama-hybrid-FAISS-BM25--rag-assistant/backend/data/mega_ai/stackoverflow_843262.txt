You may have already found a solution but I thought I'd answer just in case. I started an open source project a few months ago to help organize EC2 infrastructures. It stores metadata in SimpleDB. You create your machine configuration in a Ruby DSL where everything is organized into environments and roles. Here's a typical configuration: env :stage do size 'm1.small' # Default EC2 machine type for the 'stage' role :app do positions 1 # Only 1 machine addresses '11.22.33.44' # Define an elastic IP disks do # Define EBS volumes path "/rudy/disk1" do # The path to mount size 100 # The size in GB device "/dev/sdr" # The unique disk device end end end role :db do size 'm1.large' # Use more powerful machine for db ami 'ami-dc1038a8' # A 64-bit debian end end You can then launch the environment from the command-line: $ rudy startup The following machines were started: m-us-east-1b-stage-app-01 ec2-11-22-33-44.us-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com $ rudy -r db startup The following machines were started: m-us-east-1b-stage-db-01 ec2-79-125-50-26.us-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com $ rudy machines m-us-east-1b-stage-app-01 ec2-11-22-33-44.us-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com m-us-east-1b-stage-db-01 ec2-79-125-50-26.us-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com $ rudy disks disk-us-east-1b-stage-app-01-rudy-disk1 vol-eee10486; 100GB; /dev/sdr; mounted You can login with: $ rudy -u root ssh The project is called Rudy.
