You don't want to use the t-test as that ignores trend. You need to use time series methods specifically "intervention analysis". You build a causal variables(dummy variable) that has zeroes before and one when you made the change and on out. For example 0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1. Post your DAILY data to dropbox.com so we can take a look or here. You need to account for daily fluctations as well using 6 day of the week dummies.
