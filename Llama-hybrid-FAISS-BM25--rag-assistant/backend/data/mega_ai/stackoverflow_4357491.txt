openmp: difference in combining 2 for loop & not combining

What is the difference in combining 2 for loops and parallizing together and parallizing separately Example 1. not paralleling together #pragma omp parallel for for(i = 0; i 2. paralleling together #pragma omp parallel { #pragma omp for for(i = 0; i which code is better and why????
