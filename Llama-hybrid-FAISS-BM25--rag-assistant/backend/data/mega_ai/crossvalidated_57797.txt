Introductory textbook on nonparametric Bayesian models?

I'd like to wrap my head around this topic but learning from white-papers and tutorials is hard because there are many gaps which are usually filled in textbooks. If it is important I have relatively strong mathematical background as I did my Ph.D. in applied mathematics (CFD to be more precise).
