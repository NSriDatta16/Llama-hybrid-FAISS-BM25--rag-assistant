I am using VAE for the dimensionality reduction of 1D data. I have also experienced, the sudden rise of KLD, which I thought would decrease anyway. See the image below: I am using Gaussian likelihood as a reconstruction error instead and it also increases. But $$ \beta * KL - reconstruction $$ as a total loss function decreases which @Sycorax mentioned. See the total loss below: The $\beta$ comes from a paper called 'disentangled VAE', higher value reduces the performance of the decoder generating poor reconstructions. So a balance should be searched based on your application/data.
