Third party controls and scripts

Looking for a good resource to find asp.net controls and such. I don't mind purchasing them so open source is not my only consideration. I have a social site that I want to build but I do not want to reinvent the wheel. Things like membership and user managment, banner ad managment, forums etc.. are common features in most any social site so i was hoping to purcahase that code. I have considered DotNetNuke but this is a learning project and not every organization uses DNN so I figure I can learn things about ASP.Net dev by writng my own app that I would not by using DNN.
