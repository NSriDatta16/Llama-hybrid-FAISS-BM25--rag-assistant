You can accomplish something similar using a class autoloader . I would also make sure that your include_path is set properly and that you are using a directory structure that makes sense for your classes - it's generally a good practice to NOT depend on class autoloaders, and instead include classes based on their relative path to your include_path . I'd highly recommend browsing through Zend Framework, particularly Zend_Loader , for a good (if not over-architected) implementation. Also notice that Zend Framework will work without an autoloader in place - each file calls require_once on its direct dependencies, using their nice, organized directory structure.
