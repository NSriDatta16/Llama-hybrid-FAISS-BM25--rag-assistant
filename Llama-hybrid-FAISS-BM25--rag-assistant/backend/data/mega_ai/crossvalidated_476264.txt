A gamma prior with shape parameter $\alpha_0 = 2000$ and rate parameter $\kappa_0 = 1),$ for the Poisson mean $\lambda$ has $E(\lambda) = 2000$ and $P(\lambda Maybe that is a reasonable prior for a click rate "about" $2000,$ but not likely more than 2100. pgamma(2100, 2000, 1) [1] 0.9863525 Subsequently, if data over $n=20$ days shows $t=42\,000$ clicks, then considering $t = \sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i,$ where $x_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} \mathsf{Pois}(\lambda),$ the likelihood function is $\lambda^t\,e^{-n\lambda}.$ Thus, the posterior density is of the form $$p(\lambda|x) \propto \lambda^{\alpha_0-1}e^{\kappa_0\lambda} \times \lambda^t\,e^{-n\lambda} = \lambda^{\alpha_0+t-1}\,e^{-(\kappa_0+n)\lambda},$$ which is the kernel (density without norming constant) of $\mathsf{Gamma}(\alpha_n, \kappa_n),$ where $\alpha_n = \alpha_0+t,\,\kappa_n=\kappa_0+n).$ Thus, for our example, the posterior distribution is $\mathsf{Gamma}(44000, 21),$ the posterior mean is $\alpha_n/\kappa_n \approx 2095 $ and a 95% Bayesian probability interval is $(2075,2115).$ a.n = 44000; k.n = 21 qgamma(c(.025,.975), a.n, k.n) [1] 2075.706 2114.861 If we were doing frequentist inference, then a Wald 95% confidence interval (reasonably useful because of the large numbers of counts) would be about $(2080, 2120).$ pm = c(-1,1); (42000 + pm*1.96*sqrt(42000))/20 [1] 2079.916 2120.084 If you want to choose a prior distribution that has less influence on the posterior, then choose both $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ to be very small. A 95% Bayesian probability interval with a noninformative prior (say, using $\alpha_0 = \kappa_0 = 0.01),$ would be $(2079, 2119).$ a.n = 42000.01; k.n = 20.01 qgamma(c(.025,.975), a.n, k.n) [1] 2078.925 2119.072
