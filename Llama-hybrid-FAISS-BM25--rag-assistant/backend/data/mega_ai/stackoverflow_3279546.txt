Well on cursor it is because each record is being inserted one at a time and not in a batch. So with bulk insert they insert in a batch. So the trigger fires once for the batch. I think I read about a workaround one time that was pretty clean. Let me see if I can find it. EDIT: You know when you said bulk operation I didn't even pay attention to the sql and assumed you were using bcp. But I do still remember a work around that I am going to look for. EDIT2: Ok take a look at this article and see if it helps you out: http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/tarad/archive/2004/09/14/2077.aspx
