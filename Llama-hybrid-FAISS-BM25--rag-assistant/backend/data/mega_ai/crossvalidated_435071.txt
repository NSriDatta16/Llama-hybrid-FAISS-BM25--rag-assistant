You're right, this is a tricky question because, clearly, neither method is well suited for the task. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I assume that they know this, and they know that you know this. So the "trick" is, basically, with a gun to your head and being forced to pick between two bad options, knowing what you know about those options, which one is less bad ? Given this circumstance, I would choose the Neural Network with linear activation for the following reason: A NN is a universal function approximator. The function you want to approximate is one that either outputs a real number between $0$ and $1$ , or only outputs $0$ or $1$ (or only outputs an upper-bounded positive integer, if this is a multi-class classification). For example, if the true distribution of the data is the Sigmoid of a linear combination of the inputs (the form of an ordinary logistic regression), it is possible, in principle, for a neural network with linear activation to mimic this, given enough input data and network complexity. But it is impossible for an ordinary linear regression to mimic this. (Though, keep in mind, that a NN with linear activation outputting a number between $0$ and $1$ wouldn't have the same interpretation as a logistic model doing this, because a linear model's loss function is trained to minimize the difference between its direct output and the target variables in the data, not to estimate the probability that the target will be a certain value. This is still an inherent flaw in the method, as it's not meant to handle Bernoulli-distributed data.) With that said, I think it would be important, in an interview, for you to clarify that you know that this is the better of two bad options. Make sure you understand that it is not actually a viable choice in a real scenario.
