What can be inferred from a short multivariate time series?

I have annual observations of 24 variables over 10 years, and I would like to identify evidence of structural change (regime shift). The data pertain to university enrollment & spending, so I expect the variables to be trend stationary and I'm looking for shifts in the linear trends. My concern is the number of observations seems far too small to identify a regime shift with any certitude, but I hope there's a way to compensate using the large number of variables. Many of the variables are highly correlated so I've looked into PCA for dimensionality reduction, but then I'm unsure how to evaluate statistical certainty (for example with the Chow test). A standardized version of the data can be found here as a CSV file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7z9b5n5exq2j6t5/standardized.csv?dl=0 Edit: I'm looking for general methods which could be useful in such a case, not an analysis of this data file specifically (which was included only upon request).
