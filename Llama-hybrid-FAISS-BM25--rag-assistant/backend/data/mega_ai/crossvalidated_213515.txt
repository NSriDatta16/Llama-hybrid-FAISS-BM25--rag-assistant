If you have a dataset with three columns - one for length, one for width, one for height - then I would suggest that you create a fourth column for volume. The volume column should be the product of the length, width, and height columns. Then you can take the sample average and the sample standard deviation in the way that you generally would: $\bar{x}=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{V_i}{N}$ and $s_x=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N(V_i-\bar{V})^2}$, where $V_i$ is the volume of the $i$th cube.
