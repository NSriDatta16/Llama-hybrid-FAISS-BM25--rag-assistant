RMSE in Weka Time Series Forecasting

I am using Weka Time Series Forecasting to forecast the trend of the topic NLP in 2018 . For that I used evaluate on training option in Weka to obtain Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The RMSE value I obtain is 0.785 . What does this imply? Is there a threshold value (e.g., RMSE 0.2 ) that we can consider to accept/reject this prediction?
