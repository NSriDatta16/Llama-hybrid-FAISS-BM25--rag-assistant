There might be a better way, but I created a paragraph by using a custom form element and view helper. Seems like alot of code for something so simple. Please let me know if you've found a more simplistic way to do it. //From your form, add the MyParagraph element $this->addElement(new Zend_Form_Element_MyParagraph('myParagraph')); class Zend_Form_Element_MyParagraph extends Zend_Form_Element { public $helper = 'myParagraph'; public function init() { $view = $this->getView(); } } class Zend_View_Helper_MyParagraph extends Zend_View_Helper_FormElement { public function init() { } public function myParagraph() { $html = ' hello world '; return $html; } }
