How to parse JSON to receive a Date object in JavaScript?

I have a following piece of JSON: \/Date(1293034567877)\/ which is a result of this .NET code: var obj = DateTime.Now; var serializer = new System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer(); serializer.Serialize(obj).Dump(); Now the problem I am facing is how to create a Date object from this in JavaScript. All I could find was incredible regex solution (many containing bugs). It is hard to believe there is no elegant solution as this is all in JavaScrip, I mean JavaScript code trying to read JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) which is supposed to be a JavaScript code and at this moment it turns out it's not cause JavaScript cannot do a good job here. I've also seen some eval solutions which I could not make to work (besides being pointed out as security threat). Is there really no way to do it in an elegant way?
