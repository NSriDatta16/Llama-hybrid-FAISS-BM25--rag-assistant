The Jasper How-to tells that in conf/web.xml , for your org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet you need: development - Is Jasper used in development mode? If true, the frequency at which JSPs are checked for modification may be specified via the modificationTestInterval parameter.true or false, default true. checkInterval - If development is false and checkInterval is greater than zero, background compiles are enabled. checkInterval is the time in seconds between checks to see if a JSP page (and its dependent files) needs to be recompiled. Default 0 seconds. The element has the following properties: reloadable - set to true if you want hot-deployment of classes and libs in addition to jsp files antiResourceLocking - should be false All the above was about the server. Client-side caching is another reason why you may not see newer version of pages. Simply hitting CTRL+R / CTRL + F5 often suffices. Deciding your cache strategy is something different, and a different topic - what resources would you tell the browser to cache, and for how long. Preferably you should put the cache headers - Expires and Cache-Control (and Pragma ) in a common location in your application, where you can change it quickly.
