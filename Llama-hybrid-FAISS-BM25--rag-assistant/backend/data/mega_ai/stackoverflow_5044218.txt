If you want the effect of a Gaussian blur without the cost, do a box blur multiple times. An infinite number of passes will replicate a Gaussian, but it only takes ~3 to be good enough to fool the eye. If you implement the box blur by doing horizontal and vertical strips seperately, an extremely fast implementation is just to scan each strip of pixels and maintain a running total, adding the pixel radius/2 in front while subtracting the pixel radius/2 pixels behind and multiply by cached 1/radius to calculate the running average. The great thing about this is that the radius of the blur has negligable effect on how long it takes to calculate.
