Pointwise Confidence Regions in Gaussian Process

In Rasmussen's Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning, the joint distribution of noisy function observations, $y=f(x)+\epsilon$ , at $x$ and noiseless function evaluations, $f^\star$ , at unseen points, $x^\star$ , given the hyperparameters of the kernel and the noise variance is $$ \begin{bmatrix} y \\ f^\star \end{bmatrix}\sim N\biggr(0, \begin{bmatrix} K(x,x)+\sigma^2I & K(x,x^\star)\\ K(x,x^\star) & K(x^\star,x^\star) \end{bmatrix}\biggr ) $$ Rasmussen uses the above to derive $p(f^\star|y,X,X^\star)$ , which Rasmussen refers to as the predictive distribution. He appears to construct $95\%$ confidence regions by taking the pointwise mean and 1.96 times the standard deviation given by the conditional distribution of $f^\star$ . What is the interpretation of these pointwise intervals around the mean and its relationship to $f$ ? I believe the predictive distribution above is a distribution over functions which describes the set of plausible values $f^\star$ could take on if I sampled from the conditional. It isn't clear to me though that these intervals are directly related to the realized values of $f$ which occur in the training points. Is that accurate?
