Weird shape resizing behavior in WPF

I am making a WPF application that will let the user draw and resize shapes. The resizing part is done using adorners, and the shapes are my own classes derived from Shape . For example I have a Polyline , and for each of it's points I am adorning a Thumb with a handler on it's DragDelta event: void Thumb_DragDelta(object sender, DragDeltaEventArgs e) { PolylineEx polyline = this.AdornedElement as PolylineEx; ResizingThumb thumb = sender as ResizingThumb; int index = (int)thumb.Tag; Point newPoint = new Point( polyline.Points[index].X + e.HorizontalChange, polyline.Points[index].Y + e.VerticalChange); Trace.WriteLine(String.Format("Arranging point {0}:{1},{2}", index, newPoint.X, newPoint.Y)); polyline.Points[index] = newPoint; } Well, the problem is that sometimes (often), dragging a thumb is not smooth at all. First I thought it was a performance issue, because of a new Point being created every time (and other things), but then I noticed that sometimes the point is set up at weird coordinates that have nothing to do with the position of the mouse. I've also uploaded a sample project HERE , could someone who knows his way around wpf take a look and enlighten me of what is happening? Also, if anyone thinks of a better way for doing this, any feedback would be highly appreciated. Thank you. Edit: HERE is a new link to the project files.
