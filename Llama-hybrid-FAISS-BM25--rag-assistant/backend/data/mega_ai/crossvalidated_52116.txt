If you want to use regression here, then check all the assumptions of the model carefully after fitting. The errors should be uncorrelated for example. Your $Y$ here is time dependent and it is very likely that some assumptions are violated. I suggest to use time series regression with regressors as $X1$ and $X2$ instead of multiple regression. See Arima for example in package forecast . For this approach, depending on the model, it may use the previous $Y$'s to forecast. To answer your questions: 1) Yes you can. You use the previous values of $Y$, $X1$ and $X2$ to fit your model. Then you plug in the new values for $Xi$'s i.e. $X1=22$, $X2=33$ to forecast $Y_{T8}$. 2) You fit your regression model, then check the assumptions. If they were ok, then you plug in the new values for $Xi$'s i.e. $X1=22$, $X2=33$ in your fitted model to forecast $Y_{T8}$. For instance, let's say you fit your regression model and estimated the regression coefficients as 0.5 and -2 then your model is $Y_t=0.5X1_t-2X2_t+\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the error terms. Then the forecast for $Y_8$ would be $\hat{Y_8}=0.5(22)-2(33)$. 3) No, it is not mandatory. If you decided to use the Arima model, then $X1$ and $X2$ would be the xreg argument the in the Arima function as explained in the package forecast .
