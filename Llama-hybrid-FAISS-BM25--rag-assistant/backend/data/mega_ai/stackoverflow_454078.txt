x86 has a very limited set of available registers compared to most other architectures. This doesn't really make the assembly language any harder to learn, but sometimes makes it harder to implement code in practice. Also, because of the x86 history of strong backward compatibility, the instruction set is not terribly symmetric (definitely pre-RISC) and there can be lots of exceptions to the rule and corner cases to pay attention to.
