In terms of working with text, have a look at NLTK. Very, very well supported & documented (there's even a book online, or in paper if you prefer) and will do the preprocesing you require. You might find Gensim useful as well; the emphasis is on vector space modeling and it's got scalable implementations of LSI and LDA (pLSI too I think) if those are of interest. It will also do selection by tf-idf - I'm not sure that NLTK does. I've used pieces of these on corpora of ~50k without much difficulty. NLTK: http://www.nltk.org/ Gensim: http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/projekty/gensim/ Unfortunately, as to the main thrust of your question I'm not familiar with the specific libraries you reference (although I've used bits of scikits-learn before).
