Touch event on midlet command

I am creating application for touch devices for nokia. J2ME provides methods pointerPressed , released and dragged on canvas. I have generated a canvas in full screen mode having commands. On click of "option" command, another command menu opens, which is having commands like Ok, Back, Next. Now to get the event of sub command menu I have to get that which command is clicked. My question is how can I get that particular command has been clicked? Application is for N97/Music express (no keyboard support). I just want the way out using touch functionality. keyPressed event is not at all useful for me.
