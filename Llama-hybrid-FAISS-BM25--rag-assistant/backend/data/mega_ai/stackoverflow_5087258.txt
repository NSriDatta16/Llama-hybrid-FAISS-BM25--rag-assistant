Lucene Fast Vector Highlightor fragments

Im new to Lucene. Is there a way to get the Lucene FVH to return fragments/snippets centered around the search query instead of approximately starting with the search query? Also, Is there a way to tell the FVH fragmenter to fragment only at the newline char? Thanks!
