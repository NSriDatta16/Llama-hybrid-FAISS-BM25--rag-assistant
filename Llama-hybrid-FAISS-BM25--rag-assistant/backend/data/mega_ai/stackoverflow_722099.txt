Not sure what the benefit of (2) is, do you find it useful? I certainly look at FxCop and StyleCop violation counts. In an ideal world these are 0, but on some projects this isn't realistic (e.g. inheriting legacy code), so we set a threshold and try not to exceed it. Test coverage is good. Sometimes it may be interesting to measure number of checkins and / or changed files since the last build. I never found an actual use for it but it was interesting to see how the rate of checkins increased towards the release date.
