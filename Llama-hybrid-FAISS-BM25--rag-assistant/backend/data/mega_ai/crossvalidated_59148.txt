Reductions of Bayesian experiments: regular conditional experiment

I'm reading Florens et al.'s 'Elements of Bayesian Statistics', currently working through chapter 1, 'Reduction of Bayesian Experiments'. I find most of it clear, except the definition of regular conditional experiments (p. 51) and everything that relies on this definition. I'll appreciate help in deciphering it. I assume those who would respond to my post are familiar with this book and its terms and notations, but i'll be happy to provide more details per request. The conditional experiment $\mathcal{E}^\mathcal{T}$ is said to be regular if there exists a regular version of $\Pi^\mathcal{T}$ such that there exist regular versions of $\mu^\mathcal{S}$ and $P^{\mathcal{A}\vee\mathcal{T}}$, in this case we then have: $$\left(1.4.9\right)\hspace{10mm}\Pi^\mathcal{T}=\mu^\mathcal{T}\otimes P^{\mathcal{A}\vee\mathcal{T}}=P^\mathcal{T}\otimes\mu^\mathcal{S}$$ What i don't understand is the expression $\mu^\mathcal{T}\otimes P^{\mathcal{A}\vee\mathcal{T}}$. The way the $\otimes$ operator is defined (Theorem 0.3.10, p. 18), in the expression $Q\otimes W$ $Q$ is a probability on $\left(M,\mathcal{M}\right)$ and $W$ is a transition from $\left(M,\mathcal{M}\right)$ to $\left(N,\mathcal{N}\right)$. However, in the present case, for every $\left(a,s\right)\in A\times S$, $\mu^\mathcal{T}\left(a,s\right)$ is a probability on the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}\times S$, whereas $P^{\mathcal{A}\vee\mathcal{T}}$ is a transition from $\mathcal{A}\vee\mathcal{T}$ to $A\times\mathcal{S}$. So the expression $\mu^\mathcal{T}\otimes P^{\mathcal{A}\vee\mathcal{T}}$ is not well defined, hence meaningless.
