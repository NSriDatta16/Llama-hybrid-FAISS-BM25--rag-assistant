GLSL Normalize Mouse Input

i'm new in this shader world and just want to try out something. I want to do the following: In a specific radius around the mouse the texture in the background should rotate by 10Â°. The mouse coordinates are absolute values, so to work with them i have to normalize them, so i can adress the right space in the texture. But somehow this doesn't work right. The rotation works but i get the color information with a little offset. I think the problem is the normalize(mouse) but i don't know how to do this right. Here is the shader: uniform sampler2D tex0; uniform vec2 mouse; void main() { vec2 pos = vec2(gl_FragCoord.x, gl_FragCoord.y); if (distance(pos, mouse) I'm using cinder to do this. mShader.uniform( "mouse", Vec2f( m.x, 682 - m.y ) ); Thank you.
