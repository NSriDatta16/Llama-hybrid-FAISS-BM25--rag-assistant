I've never seen a regression model for ratios before, but regression for a percentage (or more commonly, a fraction) is quite common. The reason may be that it's easy to write down a likelihood (probability of the data given your parameter) in terms of a fraction or probability : each element has a probability $p$ of being in category $A$ (vs. $B$). The estimate of $p$ is then the estimated fraction. Note however: it's not standard to make a linear model for a fraction; more common is a generalized linear model , which is a linear model along with an invertible, nonlinear 'link' function that controls the range of the desired model (here $[0,1]$). The most common model for fractions is (as you noted) logistic regression, which allows you to use regressors on the real line but have a fraction constrained to live on [0,1]. However, logistic regression is technically a model for binary data, meaning you observe a series of events where each input (set of independent variables) produces an independent observation of $0$ or $1$. For the case where you just have a population divided into two different classes (i.e., and you don't have separate regressors for each member of the population), you might want binomial regression . That being said, there's probably nothing to stop you from writing down a generalized linear model (GLM) for ratios. (Logistic and binomial regression are also GLMs). You'd need to pick a function mapping from the input space to the space of possible ratios (e.g., $\log$), then write down your likelihood in terms of the resulting ratio.
