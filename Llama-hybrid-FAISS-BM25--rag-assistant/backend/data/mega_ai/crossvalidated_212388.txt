Alternative construction of ARMA(1,1) process

My question is related to the exercise 2.9, p. 79 in Brockwell & Davis, An Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting , 2nd edition, New-York, Springer, 2002 (It is also related to exercise 3.5, same reference). Let {$Y_t$} be a process defined by $$ Y_t = X_t + W_t,$$ where $\{W_t\}\sim \mbox{WN}(0, \sigma_w^2),$ and {$X_t$} is the following AR(1) process $$ X_t - \phi X_{t-1}= Z_t,\quad \{Z_t\}\sim \mbox{WN}(0, \sigma_z^2),$$ and $E(W_s Z_t)=0$ for all $s$ and $t$. The goal of this exercise is to show that $Y_t$ is in fact an ARMA(1,1) process. We define the process $\{U_t\}$ as $$U_t= Y_t - \phi Y_{t-1}$$ 1) We compute the autocovariance function of $U_t$ at lag $h$ and we get $$\gamma_U(h) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle \sigma^2_z + \sigma_w^2 (1+\phi^2) , & \text{ if } h=0, \\ \displaystyle -\phi\ \sigma^2_w ,& \text{ if } |h|=1, \\ \displaystyle 0, & \text{ if } |h|>1. \end{array} \right. $$ $\{U_t\}$ is 1-correlated and hence is a MA(1) process (by Proposition 2.1.1, B & D). 2) Thus, there exists a white noise sequence $\{\varepsilon_t\}$ with variance $\sigma_\varepsilon^2$ such that: $$Y_t - \phi Y_{t-1} = U_t = \varepsilon_t + \lambda \varepsilon_{t-1}. $$ Then we want to express the parameters characterizing the MA(1) process $\{U_t\}$, namely $\lambda$ and $\sigma_\varepsilon^2$, in terms of the parameters characterizing $\{Y_t\}$ and $\{X_t\}$, namely, $\phi$, $\sigma_w^2$ and $\sigma^2_z$. By equalizing the autocovariance function of the two representations, we obtain the following system: $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} \displaystyle \sigma^2_\varepsilon (1+\lambda^2) &= & \sigma^2_z + \sigma_w^2 (1+\phi^2), \\ \displaystyle \lambda \sigma_\varepsilon^2 & = & -\phi\ \sigma^2_w. \\ \end{array} \right. $$ If $\phi = 0$, we get $\lambda = 0 $ and the process $\{Y_t\}$ is a white noise with variance $\sigma_\varepsilon^2 = \sigma_z^2 + \sigma_w^2$. We now assume that $\phi \neq 0$ and $\lambda \neq 0$. Dividing the two equations of the system, we get: $$ \frac{1+\lambda^2}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{-\phi} \frac{\sigma^2_z}{\sigma^2_w} -\frac{1+\phi^2}{\phi} \Leftrightarrow \frac{1+\lambda^2}{\lambda} = -\frac{k^2 + \phi^2 +1 }{\phi} . $$ where $k^2 = \frac{\sigma^2_z}{\sigma^2_w}$. We then get the following second order equation for $\lambda$: $$\phi \lambda^2 + (k^2 + \phi^2 +1)\lambda + \phi. $$ The latter equations admits two real (and positive) solutions, if I am not wrong. Question : is there any issue with the non-identifiability of the MA(1) process defined by $ \varepsilon_t + \lambda \varepsilon_{t-1}$? In other words, is that correct that I have, for the same process $\{Y_t\}$, two solutions for representing it in this way?
