Choosing "typical" (median) values to calculate probability in logistic regression

Following Hosmer et al. (2013, see below for full reference) I am trying to find estimated probabilities from a logitistic regression controlling for the additional covariates. Hosmer et al. (2013, p. 80-1) proposes to calculate a modified logit "that subtracts the contribution of [the covariates of interest] from the logit and uses its median value as a way to control for the additional covariates". In particular, they propose $$\hat{g}(\textbf{x}) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\beta_{3}x_{3} + \beta_{4}x_{4} + \beta_{5}x_{5} + \beta_{6}x_{6}, \label{eq:1}$$ and then using $$\hat{gm}(\textbf{x})=\hat{g}(\textbf{x})-(\beta_{1}x_{1}+ \beta_{2}x_{2}),$$ where $x_{1}$ and $x_2$ are the independent variables of interest. My question is how $\hat{gm}$ is calculated if for instance the coeffients were as follows (these are values from the example in the book): $\beta_{0}$ -7.695 $\beta_{1}$ 0.089 $\beta_{2}$ 1.365 $\beta_{3}$ 0.083 $\beta_{4}$ -0.201 $\beta_{5}$ 0.583 $\beta_{6}$ -0.791 Hosmer et al. finds $\hat{gm}=-5.349$, but I cannot understand how this value is obtained. Can anyone help me? So far I have downloaded the dataset from here and run the regression as described in the book giving me the coefficients mentioned above. I have then calculated the predicted values from the model for each observation in the data set (the median of which is -4.369), say $\textbf{P}$. Then I have calculated the predicted values for $\beta_{1}x_{1}=\textbf{B1}$ and $\beta_{2}x_{2}=\textbf{B2}$ for each observation. Finally, I have calculated $\textbf{P}-(\textbf{B1}+\textbf{B2})=\textbf{A}$, the median of which is -6.707, i.e. not -5.349. The R script of my efforts so far can be found here . For completeness it should be noted that it seems that they do not advise to use median values of the covariates, as "these values may not provide a logit that is, in some sense, at the median or middle of the log-odds of [the independent variable] for these covariates".
