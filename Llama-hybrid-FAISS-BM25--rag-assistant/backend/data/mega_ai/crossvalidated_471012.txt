Just an example: Step functions cannot be represented by linear regressions: A factory at the sea side has a wall to protect it from the waves. Waves smaller then 5 meters stay behind the wall and do no harm. Waves above 5 meters lead to water coming into the cooler, short-circuit it and there is a loss worth of 10 Million Dollars. Model the loss as a function of wave height. Simplest problem imaginable for a decision tree regression, not at all a good match for a linear model (even logistic regression claims perfect separation...).
