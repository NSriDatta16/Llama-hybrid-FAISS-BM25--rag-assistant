Is there a way to select nth column in a SELECT clause from a table/view

I've this GIGANTIC view with several hundred columns and I need to select 114th column something like: SELECT "144" FROM MyView; PS: Obviously, I don't know the name of the column. I just copied the results row into an Excel file, searched for a particular value that is in EJ column so I want to select all rows showing only nth column in my view to do my further debugging. Cheers!
