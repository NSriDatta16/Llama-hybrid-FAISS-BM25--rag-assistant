If you don't care about being bourne, you can switch to Perl: my $pcap="somefile.pcap"; my $counter = 0; open(TCPDUMP,"tcpdump -n -r $pcap|") || die "Can not open pipe: $!\n"; while ( ) { # At this point, $_ points to next line of output chomp; # Eat newline at the end $array[$counter++] = $_; } Or in shell, use for : for line in $(tcpdump -n -r $pcap) do command done
