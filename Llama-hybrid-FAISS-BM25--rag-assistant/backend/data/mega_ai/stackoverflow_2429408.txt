C++ freeing static variables

I would like my class to have a static pointer to a dynamically allocated region of memory. I understand how to initialize it - in my case I will initialize it when the first object needs it. However, I don't know when/where in the code to free it. I'd like to free it when the program terminates. I might be able to free the pointer in my objects' destructor, but then I'd have to maintain an object count to see if it's safe to free when the object is the last object in use. Is there a more elegant way to do this? Please let me know. Thanks, jbu
