Inject an array of Objects in Guice

I would like to achieve something similar to the following in Guice: public MyClass { private final InjectedObject[] injectedObjects; @Inject public MyClass(InjectedObject[] injectedObjects) { this.injectedObjects=injectedObjects; } } ie I would like to be able to create a certain number of instances of an object, and inject them into another object as an array. I could probably do this instead: public MyClass { private final InjectedObject[] injectedObjects; @Inject public MyClass(InjectedObjectProvider injectedObjectProvider) { this.injectedObjects=injectedObjectProvider.getArrayOfInjectedObjects(5); } } ...but I was wondering if there was another route that was more elegant?
