Download Manager: How to re-construct chunks fetched by multiple connections

so i am developing my own download manager for educational purpose. I have multiple connections/threads downloading a file, each connection works on a particular range of the file. Now after they have all fetched their chunks, i dont exact know how to i bring this chunks together to re-make the original file. What i did: First, i created a temporary file in 'wb' mode, and allowed each connections/threads to dump their chunks. But everytime a connection does this, it overwrites previously saved chunks. I figured this was because i used the 'wb' file descriptor. I changed it to 'ab', but i can no longer perform seek() operations What i am looking for: I need an elegant way of re-packaging this chunk to the original file. I would like to know how other download managers do it. Thank in advance.
