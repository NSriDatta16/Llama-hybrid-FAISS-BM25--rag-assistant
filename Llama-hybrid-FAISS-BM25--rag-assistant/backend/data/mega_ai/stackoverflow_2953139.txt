You seem to have translated: do repeat stmt until A[ j ] ≤ x; into do { stmt; } while (A[j] >= x); This is not correct. The comparison which is the opposite of ≤ would be >, not ≥. Therefore, your comparison when translating from "until" to "while" would use > such as while (A[j] > x); . The other errors in your possible homework are similar and I encourage you to think each translation through carefully on your own.
