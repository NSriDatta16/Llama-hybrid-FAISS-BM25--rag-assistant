You might consider suggesting that all utility classes be placed in a well organized package structure like com.yourcompany.util. . If people are willing to name sub packages and classes well, then at least if they need to find a utility, they know where to look. I don't think there is any silver bullet answer here though. Communication is important. Maybe if a developer sends a simple email to the rest of the development staff when they write a new utility, that will be enough to get it on people's radar. Or a shared wiki page where people can list/document them.
