It's also not about having transcendent numbers. A variable that can take the two values 0 and pi is still discrete. It has just two levels. It's not about infinitely many numbers in a finite interval, either. Otherwise we would never have continuous variables, because our measurement resolution are discrete, and so are our numeric representations. On discrete variables, the average of two values may not correspond to a real value. Say you have a binary value, less than 6 ft and over 6 ft tall, encoded as 0 and 1. If the average of two persons is 0.5, does that mean they are on average exactly 6 ft tall? On continuous variables, it would be perfectly plausible to observe an interim value. But even then, there is a gray area. If you consider the classic 'iris' data set. The variables are continuous. They are lengths of flower petals, so it is plausible for a flower to have any length in-between. But for many analyses, you will get artifacts from the discrete resolution of the input data, which has 0.1 mm or so as step size. This causes problems e.g. with Single-Link clustering. But this is IMHO a different kis0nd of discreteness: the values in-between make sense, it is only our input data that has a bad resolution .
