WOW GOT IT!!! Just cost me a day of trying stuff. But it is usually something simple like this: self.tableView only works if the main view is a subclass of UITableViewController. In my case it is not, I dragged the tableView into the XIB. I need to determine which subview to reload: //The view might not be at index:0, in my case it is... [[self.view.subviews objectAtIndex:0] reloadData];
