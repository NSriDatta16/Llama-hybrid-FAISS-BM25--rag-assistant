What you are looking is probably tests for block exogeneity. Granger causality has a nice interpretation in terms of certain coefficients in VAR model being zero. Suppose we have the VAR model for $(x_t,y_t)$: \begin{align} \begin{bmatrix} x_t\\ y_t \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} c_1\\ c_2 \end{bmatrix} +A_1 \begin{bmatrix} x_{t-1}\\ y_{t-1} \end{bmatrix}+...+ A_p\begin{bmatrix} x_{t-p}\\ y_{t-p} \end{bmatrix} +\begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_{t}\\ \varepsilon_{t} \end{bmatrix} \end{align} Then $y$ fails to Granger cause $x$ if matrices $A_1,...,A_p$ are lower triangular matrices, i.e. the upper right elements are zero. This concept easily generalises to three variables. In your case the $z$ equation in the VAR system should have only the lags of $z$, and these lags should be present in $x$ and $y$ equations. Then both $x$ and $y$ will fail to Granger cause $z$, but not vice-versa. Technical details are probably more complicated, but the I hope I managed to convey general idea. You can read about this in Hamilton's book (J. D. Hamilton, Time Series Analysis, page 309), or you can search Google with key words Granger block exogeneity tests.
