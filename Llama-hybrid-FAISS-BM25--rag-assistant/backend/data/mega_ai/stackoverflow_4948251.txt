I tried that and then tried pcapy. I choose pcapy because my use was similar to an example which I found googling. http://snipplr.com/view/3579/live-packet-capture-in-python-with-pcapy/ (or see the same code copied below) import pcapy from impacket.ImpactDecoder import * # list all the network devices pcapy.findalldevs() max_bytes = 1024 promiscuous = False read_timeout = 100 # in milliseconds pc = pcapy.open_live("name of network device to capture from", max_bytes, promiscuous, read_timeout) pc.setfilter('tcp') # callback for received packets def recv_pkts(hdr, data): packet = EthDecoder().decode(data) print packet packet_limit = -1 # infinite pc.loop(packet_limit, recv_pkts) # capture packets
