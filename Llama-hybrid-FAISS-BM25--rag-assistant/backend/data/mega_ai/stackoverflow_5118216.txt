Maybe this isnt entirely the same as whats being talked about here, but a lot of these snippets helped me to get my solution working so i thought id share it incase anyone else needs to do (exactly!) what i needed to do. i wanted to load external content fragments into an accordion but getting it to resize properly etc was fiddley, heres my solution: $(document).ready(function () { //All the content is loaded at page load which means you dont get screwy animations $('#accordion').accordion({ autoHeight: false, // set to false incase theres loads more in one panel than the others create: function (event, ui) { $('div#accordion > div').each(function () { //for each accordion panel get the associated content from external file and load it in. var id = $(this).attr('id'); $(this).load('ajax_content.html #' + id, function () { $('#accordion').accordion('resize'); }); }); } }); }); Hope this helps someone =) Oh and i should have mentioned that obviously in the ajax_content.html file there is a div with a the same id as each of the accordion panels so it knows what to put where!
