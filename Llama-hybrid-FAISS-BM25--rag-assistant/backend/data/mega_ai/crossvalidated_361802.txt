"Effective parameters" can also be referred to as "effective degrees of freedom". In a linear model, we note that the leverages -- the amount the fitted value changes with the actual value $\partial \hat y_i \over \partial y_i $ -- can be added up to obtain the degrees of freedom of the model. This way of calculating degrees of freedom can then be applied to non-linear models. For example suppose your "model" is to take the average of the $k$ nearest neighbours. For each observation, the fitted value is the average of $k$ values. The observation itself will be amongst these $k$ nearest points, and its own contribution will be $y_i/k$, hence the leverage for every observation is $1/k$, and for $n$ observations the effective degrees of freedom is $n/k$.
