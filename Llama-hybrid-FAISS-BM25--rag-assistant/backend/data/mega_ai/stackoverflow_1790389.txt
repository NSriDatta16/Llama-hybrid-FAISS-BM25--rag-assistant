You can't build an AST for Scala from the grammar alone. There's implicits to consider, and, to consider them, there is the type inferencer to consider. You can, however, call the compiler itself -- it is just a jar file, after all. Scala 2.8, in particular, has quite a few hooks for other programs to latch on -- work of Miles Sabin, who is doing this precisely so that the Eclipse plugin for Scala can leverage the compiler in such way. I suggest you go to the Scala Tools mailing list, and get in contact with people there.
