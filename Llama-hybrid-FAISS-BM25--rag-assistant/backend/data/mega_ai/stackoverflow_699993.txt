Velo moved the flexmojos codebase to Sonatype, we're currently updating the site. Until the site is ready, you can read the latest information about Flexmojos on the Sonatype Forge Wiki: https://docs.sonatype.org/display/FLEXMOJOS/Home There is a site for flexmojos at http://flexmojos.sonatype.org The Flexmojos chapter in Maven: The Definitive Guide is still in development, but if you read it, you'll notice that there is a big difference between the previous versions of Flexmojos and the newer 3.0 release. Namely, you can depend upon the repository hosted at repository.sonatype.org to obtain all of the necessary Flex open source artifacts. What is the difference between the super POMs? Quick answer is that the upcoming 3.1 release (this week) is going to move away from using super POMs to add in all of the plugin information. Using typed Super POMs isn't something compatible with the way that most organizations use Maven. Usually there is a corporate POM or a top-level POM in a project. With the 3.1 release of Flexmojos you are going to see more stand-alone POMs from the flexmojos archetypes that allow Flexmojos projects to be integrated into larger, more complex multi-module Maven projects.
