It simply means that data in your training set is not ordered randomly, or at least, there's some unlucky order of the data. Seems like when training on unshuffled data, given the initial samples, your model finds some unfavorable local minima and it is hard for it to unlearn it when looking at the latter samples. The solution in many cases would be just to randomly shuffle the data. It may also be a good idea to do in-depth exploratory analysis of your data, to check what exactly could be the issue with ordering. You could split your data by indexes into some number of bins and then compare the bins between each other looking at different plots and summary statistics (depending on what exactly your data is). You could also check if there is a correlation between index and some variables, or if adding index as a feature to your model plays a significant role in it (usually you would need more interpretable model for this, e.g. logistic regression). Maybe there some other issues with the data that you were not aware of?
