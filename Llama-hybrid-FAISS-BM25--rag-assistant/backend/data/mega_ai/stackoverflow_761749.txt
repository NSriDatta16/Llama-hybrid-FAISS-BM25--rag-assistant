Another option (not elegant but works) could be to perform a ping pong using services: Get the file from the server. Perform the encoding /transformation you need on the client side. Send it to the server again using a WCF service, store it in session. Call a javascript method from SL that will make a request to a custom HTTP hanlder. That custom HTTP hanlder would return the file that was in session as an attachment (first time the nasty bar from IE would appear... you are going to download something...). My case is a bit simpler, in my application I needed to export a DB Diagram to JPEG and to perform an export as well to an HTML report, I used that approach (ping pong :)).
