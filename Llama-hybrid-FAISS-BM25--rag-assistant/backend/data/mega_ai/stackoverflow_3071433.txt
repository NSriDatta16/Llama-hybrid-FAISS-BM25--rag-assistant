WCF high instance count: anyone knows negative sideffects?

Did anyone experience or know of negative side effects from having a high service instance count like 60k? Aside from the memory consumption of course. I am planning to increase the threshold for the maximum allowed instance count in our production environments. I am basically sick of severe production incidents just because "something" forgot to close a proxy properly. I plan to go to something like 60k instances which will allow the service to survive using default session timeouts at a call rate average for our clients. The throttling settings would be: maxConcurrentCalls = 100 maxConcurrentSessions = 60000 maxConcurrentInstances = 60000 InstanceContextMode = PerSession Thanks, Alex
