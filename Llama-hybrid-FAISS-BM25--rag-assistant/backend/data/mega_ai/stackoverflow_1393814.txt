WPF Application moves offscreen during remote access session

i have a problem in which i am hoping to find the best and easiest to implement solution. I have written a WPF application which can be dragged around the desktop but i usually put it in the top right hand corner of the screen. My problem is that when i remote dial in from another location - where the resolution is always lower - the application is offscreen and there is no way for me to get it back unless i kill the process and relaunch it. I have thought of some ideas in order to always keep it visible. 1] Whenever it is running have it spawn a child thread that checks the visible resolution in a loop. When it is outside the detected bounds it will update its location. 2] Use some sort of messaging system to send it a message when i remote in - and that will trigger it to re-align itself. Does anyone have any suggestions??
