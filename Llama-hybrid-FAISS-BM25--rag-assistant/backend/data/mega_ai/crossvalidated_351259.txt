2018 Update - Different Algorithms for Hyperparameter Optimization

Common question: What are the different options (in common languages like R or Python) available for optimizing hyperparameters? I am primarily interested in implementations in R that can work with XGBoost. My question has been asked before, but I didn't see any recent revisits to this question. Thorough responses can be seen here . Based off my search, the most common methods are Grid search, which is inefficient and can often fail to optimize Random search - more efficient than grid search. see . Bayesian optimization - Implemented in R with rBayesianOptimization and MlBayesOpt Particle Swarm Optimization . Implemented in psoptim in R. Past those, what other algorithms are implemented in R? One of the linked questions mentions LIPO for example, but I couldn't find any R package. As of June 2018, what options we do have?
