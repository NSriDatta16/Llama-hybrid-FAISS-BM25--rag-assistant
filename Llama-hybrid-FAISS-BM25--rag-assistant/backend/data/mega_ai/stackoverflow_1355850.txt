Since there are only 1.1 million chunks, you can index a chunk using 24 bits instead of 32 bits and save space there. You could also compress the chunks. Perhaps Huffman coding is a good choice. I would also try the following strategy: instead of using a character as a symbol to encode, you should encode character transitions. So instead of looking at the probability of a character appearing, look at the probability of the transition in a Markov chain where the state is the current character.
