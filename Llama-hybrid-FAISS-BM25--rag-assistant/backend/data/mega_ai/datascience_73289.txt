Which target variable should I use?

I have a problem where I want an LSTM to predict the resistance of a body. This value can also be calculated if we know the drag coefficient and the speed of that body. In my case, at inference time, the speed is known, meaning that I can do the following: predict the drag coefficient, and then calculate the resistance accordingly predict the resistance directly Which one should I use as my learning target?
