Depends how you define consistency. Suppose by consistent you mean the probability of facing out remains constant throughout the 7 weeks. A simple way then is to plot all the proportions with their C.I. and see if they overlap (then you will fail to reject the null hypothesis). N=30 #xout There are 2 slight issues with this approach. it is a multiple comparison thing, which you may or may not wish to adjust for. It assumes temporal independence, which you can check with acf(phat) . Alternatively, if you can assume a structural model, you can try to decompose the time series. StructTS(phat) or StructTS(phat,type="level") , and then you can look at the output and compare the variance of the changing slope/level (if changing) and that of epsilon. You can see ?StructTS for the underlying model assumed. Whichever way you do it, as you have noted, your sample size is essentially 1, so care needs to be taken if you try to generalize your finding to the wider population of spiders.
