object oriented analysis and design

i'm doing a system these days, my first one actually and i'm in trouble doing OOAD, i need some help from you all, i'm familiar with diagrams drawn in UML,but when given a scenario i can't make a link, can't see a flow of them, for example now i'm designing the system, i've done use case diagrams and activity diagrams and now i'm finding it very difficult to decide the classes according to the situation? i can't find a flow between these diagrams, how can i get class diagrams when i'm done with the above mentioned two diagrams? i'm not that much expert in UML either,just familiar with the diagrams? can some one solve the problem? any suggestion of tutorials? how to analyse a system? what is the problem with me?? regards, Rangana
