Time series - plotting continuous and categorical variable

I have two variables one dependent(Y) and another is independent(X). Y is continuous and X one is categorical. Values of both variables are recorded for every minute, for example 10:00 - X=5, Y=89; 10:01 - X=5, Y=90, 10:02 - X=1, Y=21, 10:03 - X=1, Y=22 (time series). I wanted to explore the variation of Y based on X over a period of one day (1440 minutes). Would like to know the suitable visualization for this scenario. Sample data set Time - Category - Response 10:00 - 5 - 89 10:01 - 5 - 90 10:02 - 1 - 21 10:03 - 1 - 22 10:04 - 1 - 19 10:05 - 4 - 51 10:06 - 4 - 48
