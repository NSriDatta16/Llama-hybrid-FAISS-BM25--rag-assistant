jQuery fadeTo effect applied to

I want to add the fadeTo effect to a tag using jQuery. This should be possible, right? Here's my code: if ($) { $(document).ready(function() { $("tr[id$='_trPendingRequest_Manager']").fadeTo("slow", 0.33); }); } For whatever reason, the effect is not happening. I decided to do a bit more testing and added a paragraph tag directly above the table containing this , and I was able to successfully apply the fadeTo effect to the paragraph tag. So, this leads me to think that one cannot apply the fadeTo effect to tags. Anyone have a nugget of wisdom they'd not mind sharing with me as to why I can't get this to work? EDIT: Here's the html of the with the > which I am trying to apply the effect to. &nbsp; You have request(s) pending your action ... Removing the rest for brevity ...
