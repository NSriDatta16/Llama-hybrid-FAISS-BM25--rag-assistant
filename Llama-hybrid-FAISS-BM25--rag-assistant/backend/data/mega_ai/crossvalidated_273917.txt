In your second example you are using only very small values for c in grid search: ( (0.000001,0.00001,0.0001) ) Low values of c in SVM imply strict regularization. The results you get may be due to extreme underfitting. Try using the same parameters for grid search as in the first example and check whether the parameter estimates for your op$best.model are close to zero.
