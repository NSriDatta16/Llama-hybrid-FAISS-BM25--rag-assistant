A selector, generally, is a label / path to a code element. For example, in CSS, to style any paragraphs within a container div with id="container", the selector is #container p, where # just means 'id'. I imagine in other languages it means something similar - the program is looking for an element but can't find the one it's been told to, so it throws the error.
