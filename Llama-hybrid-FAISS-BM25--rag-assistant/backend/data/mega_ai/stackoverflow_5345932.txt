Nexus Repository Manager

We want to install Nexus in an environment where >100 developers use this. What is the max load that Nexus could handle. We might have >50 simultanesous requests for artifacts (a fresh local repo is used on every build) I want to have multiple instances share the repo storage (I have tried and it does not work but wondering if anyone has tried to do this). We want to have one instance of Nexus in Read mode that is in sync with other one in Read/Write mode. Any possibilities?) Please share your thoughts. Thanks in advance.
