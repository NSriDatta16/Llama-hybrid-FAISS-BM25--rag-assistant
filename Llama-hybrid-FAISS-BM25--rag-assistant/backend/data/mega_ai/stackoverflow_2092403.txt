C++ library/framework,API for Mixture models in machine learning

I want to use Gaussian mixture models for data clustering ( using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which assigns posterior probabilities to each component density with respect to each observation ) . Is there a c++ library which has Gaussian mixture models implemented alongwith sample dataset and examples?
