You may need to disable caching on the page that you are opening. I had an issue where pages shown in a popup window were not changing and that sounds like a similar issue. Not sure what you are using to create the pages but in .net i added this to the base page to call on page load /// /// Set the page to not Cache /// protected void DontCache() { try { //Dont Cache Response.Expires = 0; Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); Response.AppendHeader( "Pragma", "no-cache" ); } catch ( Exception ) { throw; } }
