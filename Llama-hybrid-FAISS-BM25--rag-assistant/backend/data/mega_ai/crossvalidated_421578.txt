Neural networks aren't magical, they're incredibly sensitive to the data that you use to train them -- just like every other model. If the problem you're trying to solve has license plates that are rotated a bit, then you'll need to model that as a part of the task. This is called data augmentation, and it's used all over the place in machine learning and especially machine learning for image-related tasks. What you should use as training data likewise depends on your application. Will your model receive a picture of a car, from which something will have to identify and extract the patch of pixels containing the license plate? Or are images of license plates available already, and all you have to do is read off the digits?
