If you cannot use a linear regression with a controlling variable, or related, the partial correlation, another option is to stratify on the temperature variable. To do so, categorize temperature into multiple, say five, categories. Then you run five conditional regression models, i.e. for the units in each category of temperature one model of shark attacks and sales. Use the quintiles of temperature as thresholds for categorization. The net effect of shark attacks is found by taking the weighted average of the regression parameter across the categories of temperature (i.e. weighted for the category frequency of temperature). I believe there is an argument by Cochran that says that stratifications of this type can remove 90% of the bias due to confounding.
