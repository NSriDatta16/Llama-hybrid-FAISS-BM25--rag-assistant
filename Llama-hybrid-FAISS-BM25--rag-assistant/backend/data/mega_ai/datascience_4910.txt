In machine learning and statistics, classification refers to the problem of predicting category memberships based on a set of pre-labeled examples. It is thus a type of supervised learning . Some of the most important classification algorithms are support vector machines svm , logistic regression , naive Bayes , random forest random-forest and artificial neural networks neural-network . When we wish to associate inputs with continuous values in a supervised framework, the problem is instead known as regression . The unsupervised counterpart to classification is known as clustering (or cluster analysis), and involves grouping data into categories based on some measure of inherent similarity.
