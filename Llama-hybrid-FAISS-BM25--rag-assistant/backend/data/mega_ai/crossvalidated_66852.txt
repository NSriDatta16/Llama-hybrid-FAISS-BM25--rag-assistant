(This is largely a repetition of your previous question, maybe you should have edited that one instead. But anyway.) (1) Your datasets seem to be very similar, consist of genetic data and differ only by the regions where the subjects came from. Therefore I guess one can assume that the variance of individual dimensions (loci?) is pretty similar in each dataset, the number of dimensions is the same, and so the total variance is also very similar. (2) First eigenvalues of covariance matrix of your "active" subset in dataset 1 (same regions) are very similar to each other. As the datasets are also similar, I guess this means that the same is true for the "supplementary" subset of dataset 1 and also for both subsets of dataset 2 (different regions). (3) In the dataset 2 the PC1 of the "active" subset" and the PC1 of the "supplementary" subset are very highly correlated. This means that it is essentially the same component. The reason PC1_active explains a little bit less variance in the "supplementary" subset than in the "active" subset is simply because this PC is optimized for the active subset. The subsets have slightly different PCs, so no wonder a PC from another subset would explain less variance. (4) In this sense, yes, it is a global result. However, these comparisons only make sense if the total variance is the same between subsets (which I assume is true based on (1)). In general it makes more sense to compare the variance of the supplementary data projected onto the PC1_active to the variance of the supplementary data (same data) projected onto the PC1_passive (different PC), instead of comparing it to the variance of the active data (different data) projected onto the PC1_active (same PC). (4) What happens in your dataset 1, I don't know. If (1) and (2) is true, then you should get similar explained variance with both PCs. You get 3-5 times difference, and it is weird. You need to explore this in more detail. I would compute the amount of variance first 5 active PCs explain in the active dataset and passive dataset, and the amount of variance first 5 passive PCs explain in the active and passive dataset (it's usually more convenient to deal with relative variances, i.e. normalized by the total variance, which is sum of all eigenvalues). With these 20 numbers you can maybe better see what is going on. Finally, I am not sure what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is to "isolate the effect of different origins" (so you suppose that the effect is localised in loci?), then PCA would not help you much. If your goal is to classify subjects by the origin, then you would be better off doing dimensionality reduction with PLS (partial least squares) instead of PCA, see Barker, M., & Rayens, W. (2003).
