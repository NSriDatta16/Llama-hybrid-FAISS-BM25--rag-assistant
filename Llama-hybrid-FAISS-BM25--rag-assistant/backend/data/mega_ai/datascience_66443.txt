Parameters to build a churn prediction engine

Let us assume that I’m working for some company A, and my manager has asked me to build a churn prediction engine given that the product to which the churn prediction is to be done is unknown. The engine must be a generalized one, that is it should predict the potential churns for any product data that is fed into it. I have found a few basic parameters that are required for such a generalized engine. Recency, Frequency and Monetary value can be utilized for a generalized engine to determine the potential churns in any product. What are all the other generalized parameters like the above mentioned? Say, you don’t know Machine Learning but how would you say if a person would churn or not with a parameter other than his subscription details, his activity or the complaints he made. What other parameters that would make sense here?
