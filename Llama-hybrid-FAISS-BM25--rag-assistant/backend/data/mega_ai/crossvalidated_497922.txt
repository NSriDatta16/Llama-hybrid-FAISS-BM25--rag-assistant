Identifying assumptions of Difference-in-Difference versus Fixed Effects models

I am reading the seventh edition of Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach by Jeffrey Wooldridge and I am a bit confused on the different identifying assumptions for difference-in-difference models and fixed effects models. The generalized model for diff-in-diff is of the following form: $$ y_{igt} = \gamma_{g} + \lambda_{t} + \beta D_{gt} + \epsilon_{igt} \quad \quad \quad (1) $$ where $i,g,t$ index individual, group and year respectively. Groups usually represents geographical units treated at the same time, but they can also represent, for example, low-wage vs high-wage workers. $D_{gt}$ is the binary treatment indicator. Now, for this model, Wooldridge argues that we need the well known parallel trends assumption which is usually showed by plotting the pre-treatment trends of each group. On the other hand, a generalized version of a fixed effects model follows this specification: $$ y_{it} = \alpha_{i} + \lambda_{t} + \beta D_{it} + \epsilon_{it} \quad \quad \quad (2) $$ That is, we have replaced the group/state fixed effects with individual fixed effects. From my understanding, the point estimate $\hat{\beta}$ does not change between DiD and FE. Instead, we change the inference (see this post ). Wooldridge does not mention whether parallel trends plays any role in this type of model. Instead, he argues that $D_{it}$ should be randomized and not react to past shocks. This is consistent with the implementation of this same fixed effects models with state-specific time trends in the paper Woman's Suffrage, Political Responsiveness, and Child Survival in American History by Grant Miller (albeit the author calls this a diff-in-diff model I recognize it as a fixed effects one following Wooldridge). Miller argues that "only the timing of [treatment] is assumed to be exogenous". So, I guess my questions are the following: Should we care about parallel trends when trying to estimate (2), i.e a FE model? Should we care about exogenous treatment timing when trying to estimate (1), i.e a diff-in-diff model? Thanks in advance.
