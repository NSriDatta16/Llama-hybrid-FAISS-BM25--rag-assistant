"I have tried the use of an improper uniform distribution on lambda by letting the max tend to infiniti. My posterior is then just the Poisson again." This cannot be possible since the posterior of lambda is continuous. You have to distinguish between the sampling model and the distributions of the parameters in a Bayesian framework. The Gamma prior is a conjugate prior for the Poisson distribution. This is a reasonable choice is you have reliable prior information. An alternative is the use of Reference (Jeffreys) priors which does not require the elicitation of hyperparameters. In addition, the posterior inferences obtained with this sort of prior are typically similar to those obtained with the classical approach. See: http://www.uri.edu/artsci/ecn/burkett/545lect5.pdf You can use a flat prior on the parameter $\lambda$. However, given that this is not a proper prior, you have to check conditions for the existence of the posterior distribution corresponding to this prior. This is, $$\int_0^{\infty} L(\lambda)d\lambda where $L$ is the likelihood function, up to a proportionality constant. In this case $$L(\lambda)\propto \lambda ^{n\bar{x}}e^{-n\lambda},$$ where $n$ is the sample size and $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean. Then $$\int_0^{\infty} L(\lambda)d\lambda \propto \bar{x} n^{-n \bar{x}} \Gamma (n \bar{x}).\,\,\, if \,\,\, \bar{x}\neq 0,$$ and $1/n$ if $\bar{x}=0$. Therefore, the posterior is proper.
