I have seen papers using quartic root regression coefficients in thinking about percentage changes, while avoiding taking logs (and dropping observations). If we're interested in using quartic roots to calculate percentage changes, we know that: $\hat{Y} = (\alpha + \hat{\beta}_1 X_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 X_2)^4 \implies \frac{d\hat{Y}}{dX_1} = 4\hat{\beta}_1(\alpha+\hat{\beta}_1 X_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 X_2)^3$ For the equivalent of a log-level regression, in which we're interested in the percentage change in $Y$ resulting from a unit change in $X$, we have to know the levels of all the $X$ variables: $ \frac{d\hat{Y}/dX_1}{Y} = \frac{4\hat{\beta}_1}{\alpha + \hat{\beta}_1 X_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 X_2} $ For the equivalent of a log-log regression, in which we're interested in the percentage in $Y$ resulting from a percentage change in $X$, we'd have: $ \frac{d\hat{Y}}{dX_1}\frac{X_1}{\hat{Y}} = \frac{4\hat{\beta}_1 X_1}{\alpha + \hat{\beta}_1 X_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 X_2} $ It doesn't seem especially convenient (I prefer the log transformation), but it can be done, either evaluating the $X$ values at the sample means or at hypothetical values. I suppose, actually, you could replace the denominator with the sample average value of $Y^{1/4}$, and that would be a bit more convenient.
