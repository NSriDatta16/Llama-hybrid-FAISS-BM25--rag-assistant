For time series anomaly detection there can be multiple approaches. As you have said, if you are using ARIMA as the model, you can use MAPE or SMAPE as the error metric and use a confidence threshold using it. Anything falling beyond the CI band can be an anomaly. Similarly you can go for DBSCAN or statistical profiling based approaches.
