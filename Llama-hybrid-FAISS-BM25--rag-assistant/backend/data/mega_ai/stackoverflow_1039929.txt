Why a pure OOP design to a Data Structure & Algorithms Library would be better ?! OOP is not the solution for every thing. IMHO, STL is the most elegant library I have seen ever :) for your question, you don't need runtime polymorphism, it is an advantage for STL actually to implement the Library using static polymorphism, that means efficiency. Try to write a generic Sort or Distance or what ever algorithm that applies to ALL containers! your Sort in Java would call functions that are dynamic through n-levels to be executed! You need stupid thing like Boxing and Unboxing to hide nasty assumptions of the so called Pure OOP languages. The only problem I see with STL, and templates in general is the awful error messages. Which will be solved using Concepts in C++0X. Comparing STL to Collections in Java is Like comparing Taj Mahal to my house :)
