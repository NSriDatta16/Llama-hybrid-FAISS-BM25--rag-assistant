Perhaps you could use the AVAudioRecorder's support for audio level metering to keep track of the audio levels and enable recording when the levels are above a given threshold. You'd need to enable metering with: [anAVAudioRecorder setMeteringEnabled:YES]; and then you could periodically call: [anAVAudioRecorder updateMeters]; power = [anAVAudioRecorder averagePowerForChannel:0]; if (power > threshold && anAVAudioRecorder.recording==NO) { [anAVAudioRecorder record]; } else if (power Or something like that.
