How to analyse a distribution with some given sample moments?

Suppose that I have n observations, $$X_1,...,X_n$$ with unknown distribution, n being small (say, between 6 and 20). If I know the first four sample moments (average, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis), there is an infinity of distributions having these four moments, but what can I say about the underlying distribution? Can I detect multimodal distribution for instance? Are there basic relationships in order to get confidence intervals, without having to calibrate a distribution on these four moments?
