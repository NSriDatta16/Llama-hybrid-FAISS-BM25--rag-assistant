Discussions of Q , R , S , T , P and O as alternative modes of factor analyses are pretty rare these days. It's as if this typology has passed out of the literature. But if one can speak in terms of a "data cube" where each face of the cube is a different "mode" of information -- the unit of analysis, the description of the components and the approach to computing the association index -- then the typology unfolds from there. In other words, the alternatives can be related to the mode loaded or under analysis. Here's a table of how they can be interpreted: Source: Dillon and Goldstein, Multivariate Statistics , p. 43 R-mode FAs are the most common type and, more commonly, are what most people refer to when speaking of FA or PCA. It's worth noting that, to your point, Q- and R-mode factor analyses flip modes of the data cube but they are agnostic wrt covariance vs correlation matrix inputs. Wrt Q-mode FAs, D&G write: Q-mode FA has been employed in psychology and in other behavior sciences as a method for clustering persons. In Q-type analysis we interchange rows and columns of the basic data matrix so that the elements relate to the covariances or correlations between the individuals . D&G go on to cite several problems with Q-mode FA that can complicate the assignments to clusters and the number of clusters it can create since the dimension of the matrix is limited to the min(of n,p).
