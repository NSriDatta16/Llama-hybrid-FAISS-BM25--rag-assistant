There are several possible ways to do this. If you don't need any non-textured data to modify your texture you could use a fragment shader. ( ping-pong technique might be interesting for that) Use glTexSubImage2D if only a small part of the texture is replaced and you don't need to worry about performance or it should work on older graphic cards. Use a pixel buffer object . That should be faster then glTexSubImage2D. Some more infos about that can be found here .
