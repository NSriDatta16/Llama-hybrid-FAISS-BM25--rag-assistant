Why shouldn't I use a field with a "set" datatype? Alternative layouts?

I've been designing my database layout and I guess I need a way to place multiple entries in a single field. I want to create a row for each student in the database, and I want one of the fields to contain their classes. I don't want to do a bunch of separate fields because there is not a set amount of classes a student can have, it can vary. I was reading up on the SET datatype and read the paragraph about why not to use SET . I was wondering if anyone could make a more "english" explanation of this, or if it actually ok to use then tell me so. If it's not, could anyone suggest a better layout for the current situation? Much appreciated, as always!
