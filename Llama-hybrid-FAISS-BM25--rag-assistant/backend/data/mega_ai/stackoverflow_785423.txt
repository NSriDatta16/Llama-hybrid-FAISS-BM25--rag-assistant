Although its a good idea but practically it may not be useful. To train somebody you can organize training and assign mentor who can help and guide. The mentor can assign work from the real project and may monitor. Pair programming should be between relatively experienced people, if you want to get the benefits of this concept. In my view pair programming with an inexperienced person will have loss of productivity and not sure how much the person will pickup when somebody is constantly checking on him. Assigning a task and giving chance to develop it independently and then review it will provide good self learning.
