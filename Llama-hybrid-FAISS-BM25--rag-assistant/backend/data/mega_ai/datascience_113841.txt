FileNotFoundError: Unsuccessful TensorSliceReader constructor

I am trying to deploy my model. I am encountering the following problem: FileNotFoundError: Unsuccessful TensorSliceReader constructor: Failed to find any matching files for ram://a603e930-4fda-4105-8554-7af5e5fc02f5/variables/variables You may be trying to load on a different device from the computational device. Consider setting the experimental_io_device option in tf.saved_model.LoadOptions to the io_device such as '/job:localhost' This happened when I stored an NLP model in a pickle. I have seen that it does not work so I then tried to save the model as .h5 The problem still persists and shows me the above error
