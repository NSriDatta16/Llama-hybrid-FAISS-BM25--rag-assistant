I think your notation is getting in the way of an answer. $E$ is usually used for evidence and $H$ is usually used for hypothesis . It appears you are using them as variables. You cannot form a prior on a variable, $(x,y)$ as variables are constants in Bayesian thinking. If you have observed something, then there is no uncertainty regarding it. It isn't actually variable. If you saw that it was 45 degrees yesterday at noon, there is no randomness involved. It was 45 degrees at noon. You cannot form a probability distribution around a fact. Let me create an example for you. Let us imagine that you are concerned with the accounting ratio $\gamma=\frac{\text{accounts receivable}}{\text{sales}}$ . In particular, you are the CEO of your company, and you have a meeting in the morning. Your accounting department is closed, but you just got off a call from your sales manager with sales figures, and you need an estimate of receivables. This may not be the best example because it is implicitly assuming quite a bit of stability. Nonetheless, let us work with $x=\text{sales}$ and $y=\text{accounts receivable}$ . Another way to map this is as $$y=\gamma{x}+\epsilon.$$ Since it is an example, let us assume that $\epsilon$ is normally distributed. We have past observations of $(x,y)$ . We do not know $\gamma$ . Our likelihood function is $\mathcal{N}(y-\gamma{x},\sigma^2)$ . We will denote the likelihood $f((x,y)|\gamma;\sigma^2)$ . Our prior would be about what we believe $\gamma$ and $\sigma^2$ to be. Ignoring existing data and working from information from outside your data set, what is the relative probability of each value of $\gamma$ and $\sigma^2$ . We will denote the prior $\pi(\gamma,\sigma^2)$ . The posterior density would be $$\pi’(\gamma,\sigma^2|(x_1,y_1)\dots(x_I,y_I))=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^If((x_i,y_i)|\gamma;\sigma^2)\pi(\gamma;\sigma^2)}{\int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_0^\infty\prod_{i=1}^If((x_i,y_i)|\gamma;\sigma^2)\pi(\gamma;\sigma^2)\mathrm{d}\gamma\mathrm{d}\sigma^2}.$$ Now that we have a posterior, we can create a prediction based on prior observations and our prior outside knowledge regarding the location of the parameters. We can now form a prediction regarding this month’s receivables. It would be $$\pi''(y=Y|x=X;(x_1,y_1)\dots{(x_I,y_I)})=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_0^\infty{f}((x=X,Y)|\gamma;\sigma^2)\pi’(\gamma;\sigma^2|(x_1,y_1)\dots(x_I,y_I))\mathrm{d}\gamma\mathrm{d}\sigma^2.$$
