A simple and intuitive explanation to the first question: You first need to roll any number. This is easy, it'll always take exactly 1 roll. You then need to roll any number other than the first one. The chance of this happening is $\frac{5}{6}$, so it'll take $\frac{6}{5}$ (1.2) rolls on average. You then need to roll any number other than the first two. The chance of this happening is $\frac{4}{6}$, so it'll take $\frac{6}{4}$ (1.5) rolls on average. You then need to roll any number other than the first three. The chance of this happening is $\frac{3}{6}$, so it'll take $\frac{6}{3}$ (2) rolls on average. And so on until we successfully complete our 6th roll: $\frac{6}{6} + \frac{6}{5} + \frac{6}{4} + \frac{6}{3} + \frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{1} = 14.7\ rolls$ This answer is similar to Neil G's answer, only, without the markov chain.
