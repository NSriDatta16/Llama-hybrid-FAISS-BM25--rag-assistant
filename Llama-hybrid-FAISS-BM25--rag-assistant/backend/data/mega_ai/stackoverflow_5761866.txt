how to run a shell command at the END of the Android.mk build process?

I am trying to copy a file from libs/arm/eabi in to res/raw at the end of the NDK build process using Android.mk From some searching, I found that you can run a shell command to copy the file, like this: $(shell cp $(LOCAL_PATH)/../../libs/armeabi/pcapd res/raw) However, even if I put this at the end of my top-most Android.mk, it always tries to run this command first. How can I get it to run this after the build completes?
