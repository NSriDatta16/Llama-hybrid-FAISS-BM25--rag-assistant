It is extremely unnatural and contrary to common sense to use any of the test statistics you suggested; the average is not at all what matters when you want make claims about $d$. Say (for a sample of size $n=2$) you observe $y_1=4$, $y_2=0$, so $(1/2)(|y_1|+|y_2|)=2$, and your test would now commit the lunacy of accepting the null hypothesis $d You could work with $T=\max |Y_j|$, and reject $d You can read up some on this in lecture notes of mine that I put together recently. See here; tests are discussed in Chapter 6.
