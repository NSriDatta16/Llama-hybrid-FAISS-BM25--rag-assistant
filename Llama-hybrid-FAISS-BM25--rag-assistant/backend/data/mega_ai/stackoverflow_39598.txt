With so much untapped power I cannot see how it would go unused for too long. The question is, though, how the GPU will be used for this. CUDA seems to be a good guess for now but other techologies are emerging on the horizon which might make it more approachable by the average developer. Apple have recently announced OpenCL which they claim is much more than CUDA, yet quite simple. I'm not sure what exactly to make of that but the khronos group (The guys working on the OpenGL standard) are working on the OpenCL standard, and is trying to make it highly interoperable with OpenGL. This might lead to a technology which is better suited for normal software development. It's an interesting subject and, incidentally, I'm about to start my master thesis on the subject of how best to make the GPU power available to the average developers (if possible) with CUDA as the main focus.
