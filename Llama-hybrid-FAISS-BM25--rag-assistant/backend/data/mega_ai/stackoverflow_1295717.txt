Alternatives to adding dynamically generated inline JavaScript

Generating inline JavaScript in HTML has always made me feel dirty and after having used YUI a bit I get the sense that it's best to leverage HTML elements as an alternative. Would it be insane to use a hidden to store keys and values to be used by static JavaScript which would only act when it found the rather than using inline JavaScript? What practices are common out there and what practices have the most merit with regards to avoiding inline JavaScript?
