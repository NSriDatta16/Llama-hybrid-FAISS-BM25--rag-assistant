I don't think that is possible, given that the actual movement of the window is done by the operating system alone (and I can't think of any application right now that restricts such a movement). But maybe you can emulate such behaviour by encapsulating your actual application into a different window. You could then change the actual application size to the full screen and make it transparent and use startDrag to emulate the dragging of the inner window. Because with that function you can specify boundaries in which the movement is allowed. I don't know if that will work as you would like it to, however.
