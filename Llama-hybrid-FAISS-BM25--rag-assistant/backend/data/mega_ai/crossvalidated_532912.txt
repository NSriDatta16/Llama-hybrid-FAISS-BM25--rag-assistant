Weighted Average and Expectation in machine learning

Bishop's book defines expectation as "weighted average of a function". $$E[f(x)] = \int f(x)p(x)\text dx$$ However, the Wikipedia page of weighted function defines a weighted average as $$E[f(x)] = \frac{\int w(x)f(x)\text dx}{\int w(x)\text dx}$$ Why has Bishop called Expectation as weighted "average" and not just weighted sum as the denominator term is missing in definition of expectation?
