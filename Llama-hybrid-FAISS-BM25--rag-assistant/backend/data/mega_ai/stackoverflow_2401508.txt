What would be the most efficient way to do this search (mysql or text)?

Suppose I have 500 rows of data, each with a paragraph of text (like this paragraph). That's it.I want to do a search that matches part of words. (%LIKE%, not FULL_TEXT) What would be faster? SELECT * FROM ...WHERE LIKE "%query%"; This would put load on the database server. Select all. Then, go through each one and do .find >= 0 This would put load on the web server. This is a website, and people will be searching frequently.
