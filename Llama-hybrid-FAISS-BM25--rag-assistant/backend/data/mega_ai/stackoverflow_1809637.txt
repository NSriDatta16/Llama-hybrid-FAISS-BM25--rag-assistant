app/design/frontend/default/default/template/catalog/product/price.phtml This is the file that controls the prices. You'll find the Special and Regular there. There are a few more files in the Product/View folder - price.phtml, price_clone.phtml, tierprices.phtml Read through them. Magento uses a different price type for each type of product (Simple, Config, Group, etc) Hope this helps.
