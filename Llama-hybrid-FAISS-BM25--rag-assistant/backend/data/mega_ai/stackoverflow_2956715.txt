You're not giving us a lot to go on. Controller names in CakePHP are generally plural: 'users' not 'user'. If you're using the helpers to write the URLs, it maybe that for this reason Cake can't find them and is defaulting to the webroot. A code fragment from the .ctp file would really help us to help you (as well as routes.php if you've changed it).
