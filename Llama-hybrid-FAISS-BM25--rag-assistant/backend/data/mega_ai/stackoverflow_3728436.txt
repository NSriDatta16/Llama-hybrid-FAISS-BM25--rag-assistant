Calling RegOpenCurrentUser in VC++ 6

I'm working on a Visual C++ 8 project on WinXP but unfortunately I have only Visual C++ 6.0 available. When compiling it,an error is raised: "error C2065: 'RegOpenCurrentUser' : undeclared identifier". Since RegOpenCurrentUser has been introduced as late as Windows 2000,it's not included in VC6 header files.I try to declare it myself and add #pragma comment(lib, "C:\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0A\\Lib\\Advapi32.lib") to the source code,but it doesn't work. How can I call it or is there any equivalent function?
