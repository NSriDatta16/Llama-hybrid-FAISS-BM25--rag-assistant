Neural networks are popular (and good at) in areas like working with images and text, where they out-of-the box are able to detect patterns and do feature engineering by their own. If to extract (see) the features the only thing you need to do is to do some simple manipulations over your data, neural networks should handle it well on their own. This doesn't mean that they will always do so, or that they won't find some spurious patterns, since we already had lots of such examples. On another hand, if you could easily do some kind of meaningful feature engineering, this won't hurt and it will make it easier for the network to learn. So basically, you should try different neural network architectures and check if they work as expected. You probably should read more about feature visualization . As about normalizing and standardizing the images, the operations only re-scale your data, so this should not have any negative effect. It only could be problematic if you cared about some very small values, that would be made even smaller, so that it would lead to numerical precision problems, but this probably is not something you should worry about.
