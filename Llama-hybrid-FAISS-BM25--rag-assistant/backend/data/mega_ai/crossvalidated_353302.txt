May I suggest using Larry Wasserman's LN that are available on: http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/ ? Although Larry has removed the homeworks (and solutions), the LNs are very well written. A big bonus is the link to Larry's videos posted on YouTube. Unfortunately, the video quality is not that great but Larry is an amazing lecturer. I audited (in-class) an earlier version of Larry's course ... Given CMUs machine learning focus, Larry's course design is to prepare students for graduate-level machine learning courses. So, Larry will spend more time on topics that fulfill that goal (cf. traditional intermediate statistics texts).
