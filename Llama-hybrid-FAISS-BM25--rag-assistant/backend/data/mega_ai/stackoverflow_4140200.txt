Find top ten values in a Map

Say I have a TreeMap > , where object Song has three String fields and an internal CompareTo method. The keys for the map are unique words in the lyrics that are not common words such as "she", "the", "if", or "on". There are multiple copies of Songs in the map, since there are an average of 60 words mapped to a single Song. For extra credit, the professor asked us to come up with an algorithm to find the top 10 values in the map. I didn't solve the problem in time, which is why I'm asking here. The part that I'm stumped on is, unlike with an ordered array or list, you can't just grab the top values sequentially. So, I thought about: Create a PriorityQueue with the Comparator sorting the Nodes based on the Set size iterate over the map for each map node create a Node object with the key-value pair insert Node into the queue Even though the PriorityQueue will end up with all the key-value pairs, the top sizes will be at the top, and I can just retrieve the first ten. This seems like a very roundabout way, since this particular map has 31,000+ nodes mapping to over 637,000 values. Is there a better way?
