creating an indexed dummy variable as a predictor in OLS

I am performing on OLS with two predictors and a response variable. The data is a time series of 450 days approximately. There is an irregular pattern in my response variable - it sometimes arbitrarily does not respond to the predictors. I wanted to capture this irregularity in a dummy variable and use it as one of the predictors. 1) Is this a good approach? 2) How can I create a dummy variable which is an index of the irregularity in R ?
