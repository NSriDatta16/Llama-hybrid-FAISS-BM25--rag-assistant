Formulating simple games as Bayesian problems

Say you are in a game where every win doubles your money and every loss halves. You can walk away any time with the money you have by giving up. The rules of the game are that at every step you are presented with a problem that has four choices ($1$ to $4$) and one of them is correct. You cannot proceed after wrong guess Say you have $\$16$ in winnings and you have eliminated $3,4$ leaving with you either to decide on $1$ or $2$ or walk away, and 'you think' there is at least $67\%$ possibility of $1$. Is there a Bayesian decision formula to make 'correct' decisions?
