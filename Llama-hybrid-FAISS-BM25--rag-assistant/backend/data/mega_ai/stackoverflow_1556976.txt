Package to compare document semantic similarity (LSA, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, Language Models)

I'm looking for a package (any programming language) that I can use on a corpus of 50 documents to perform interdocument similarity testing using various metrics like term frequency-inverse document frequency ( TF-IDF ), Okapi best matching ( Okapi-BM25 ), language models (probability distributions over a sequence of words), LSA , etc. As the result, I want a document similarity matrix (i.e. doc1 is x % similar to doc2 etc.). This is for research purposes, not for production. I specifically want the document similarity matrix as I want to correlate this with human ratings.
