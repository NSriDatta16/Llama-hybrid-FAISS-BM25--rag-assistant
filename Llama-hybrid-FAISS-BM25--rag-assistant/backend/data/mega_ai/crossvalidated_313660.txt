What are the support vectors in a support vector machine?

I know how support vector machines work, but for some reason I always get confused by what exactly the support vectors are. In the case of linearly separable data, the support vectors are those data points that lie (exactly) on the borders of the margins. These are the only points that are necessary to compute the margin (through the bias term $b$). For C-SVMs, however, I always get confused as to what exactly the support vectors are. Obviously, the data points on the border of the margin are still support vectors, but I always get confused whether or not the points that are in the margin are support vectors or not. After all, only the exact borders are used to compute the bias term $b$ (in the same way as for the linearly separable case) and thus it could be argued that the margin is only supported by these points. I do have this feeling that this is incorrect, however, because I have found multiple questions here where they mention 1000+ support vectors, which would be impossible if only those on the border count. My question is thus what exactly the support vectors are for an SVM and how I can remember this.
