Model selection using a standard p-value approach

I need to perform model selection using a standard p-value approach. Using logistic regression we would like to compare the following models: Y = A + B + C + D Y = A*B + A + B + C + D Y = A*C + A + B + C + D Y = A*D + A + B + C + D I performed the following analysis in R: first However, I think I do not have the right output here for a model selection based on p-values? anova(first, second, third, fourth, test="Chisq") # Analysis of Deviance Table # Model 1: Y ~ G + N + E + C # Model 2: Y ~ G * N + G + N + E + C # Model 3: Y ~ G * E + G + N + E + C # Model 4: Y ~ G * C + G + N + E + C # Resid. Df | Resid. Dev | Df | Deviance | Pr(>Chi) # 1 595 | 609.90 | # 2 594 | 609.90 | 1 | 0.000169 | 0.9896 # 3 594 | 609.81 | 0 | 0.087775 | # 4 594 | 609.90 | 0 | -0.085001| So, how to perform a model selection here, using a standard p-value approach?
