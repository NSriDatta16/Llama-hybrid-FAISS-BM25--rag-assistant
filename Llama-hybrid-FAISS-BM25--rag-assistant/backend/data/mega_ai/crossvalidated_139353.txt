Why does logistic regression not work in p > n setting?

I have started working on a wide (p > n) genetic data set. It is recommended to me to use a regularization technique (such as LASSO or Ridge regression) in order to reduce the number of genes to be used in the logistic regression. Why does logistic regression break down if I use all the genes to predict the outcome ? Is it because of the theory behind it or the implementation of the algorithm for the model ?
