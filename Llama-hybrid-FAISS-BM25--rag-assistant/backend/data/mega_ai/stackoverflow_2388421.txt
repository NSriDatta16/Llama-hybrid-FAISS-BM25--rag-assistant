Using an interface to represent configuration is a good idea. But your implementation looks a little off. Joshua Flanagan wrote about writing application configuration code in a way that specific configuration sections can be injected into your code. This is a good idea, as it really decouples your code from worrying about details behind configuration. Have a read . I think this will address the issue you are having re. testability.
