Is it possible to force a packet to be fragmented in Java?

I have a bug which is caused by fragmented packets. I would like test this bug by creating a fragmented packet in the test and sending it to the software containing the bug. How would I go about doing this? Any guidance or alternative approaches appreciated, thanks.
