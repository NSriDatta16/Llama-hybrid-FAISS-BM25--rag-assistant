Are dimensionality reduction techniques useful in deep learning

I have been working on machine learning and noticed that most of the time, dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE are used in machine learning, but I rarely noticed anyone doing it for deep learning projects. Is there a specific reason for not using dimensionality reduction techniques in deep learning?
