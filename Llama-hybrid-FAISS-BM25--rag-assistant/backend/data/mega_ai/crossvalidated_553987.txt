Should I use every Dicom slice of a Dicom series?

I have a skull fracture CT scan dataset, consisting of fracture or normal cases. My question is: Let's say patient-1 has a skull fracture, and his CT scan has 300 Dicom slices. Now should I label every Dicom slice of his CT scan as fractured when I feed these 300 slices into a CNN?
