Theoretical Backgorund For the sake of simplicity let's assume $\sigma^2=\gamma(0)=1$ , where $\gamma(h)$ represents the autocovariance at lag $h$ . Let your time series be $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ . Consider the covariance matrix of your data $$\begin{align} \Sigma_X=\begin{bmatrix}1 & \gamma(1) & \gamma(2) & \cdots & \gamma(n-1)\\\gamma(1) & 1 & \gamma(1) & \cdots & \gamma(n-2)\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \gamma(n-1) & \gamma(n-2) & \gamma(n-3) & \cdots & 1\end{bmatrix}\end{align}.$$ For a stationary process (I am assuming you would like your time series to be stationary) this covariance matrix will be positive semi-definite (see https://stat.ethz.ch/Teaching/buhlmann/Zeitreihen/acf.pdf , and Show that the autocovariance function of stationary process {${X_t}$} is positive definite ). Now since $\Sigma_X$ is positive semi-definite and symmetric, it will have a symmetric square root such that $$\Sigma_X=\Sigma_X^{1/2}\Sigma_X^{1/2}.$$ Finally we can use the fact that for a vector of random variables $Z$ , $\text{Cov}(AZ)=A\Sigma_ZA^T$ . So here if $Z$ is a vector of normal random varaibles with $\Sigma_Z=I$ then $$\text{Cov}(\Sigma_X^{1/2}Z)=\Sigma_X.$$ Application in R So in your case what you would do is Using the ACF you have calculated, create a $\Sigma_X$ matrix in R. Calculate $\Sigma_X^{1/2}$ (you could use the sqrtm() function in R). Generate $Z$ using rnorm() in R, and then multiply $Z$ by $\Sigma_X^{1/2}$ to get your time series with the desired covariance, and hence autocovariance, structure.
