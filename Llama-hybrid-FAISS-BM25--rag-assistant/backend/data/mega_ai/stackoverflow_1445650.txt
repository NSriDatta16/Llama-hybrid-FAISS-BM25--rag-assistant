Create a new table. First, there's the philosophical reason, which is that one object (read: table) should have one purpose. That gets blurred a lot in database logical design, but it's a good principle nonetheless. But the real reasons are from physical design: first, the number of users that will be logged on at any given time can be assumed to be far less than the total number of users, so that storage requirements will be lower. And lower storage requirements translate directly into reduced load on the database, simply because you have fewer blocks to read and update. If you put this data in your main table, moreover, than those blocks will be scattered over a much wider space, and the contents of the blocks will continually grow and shrink as you change the data. And finally, you'll probably require some indexes, for example to see who's online now. And those indexes will (1) take up even more space, (2) create even more scattered dirty blocks that have to be physically written to disk, and (3) introduce a point of update contention.
