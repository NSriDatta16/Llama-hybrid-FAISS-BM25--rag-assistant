Implementing ACID

I am starting research on a project that will need to provide ACID semantics on its database. Due to the nature of the data it is not suitable for storage in common off-the-shelf systems (relational or key-value). What are some good resources on how to implement systems which must provide ACID semantics? My typical Google search returns more information about system which already provide ACID semantics rather than how to go about implementing such systems.
