help figuring out math formula for performance gains

I'm trying to write a report to recommend moving transaction logs to a separate physical drive but I need to provide some numbers. I have some queries from a profile that was done last month. I'm trying to determine the reduction % of the duration. I know that it can't be 100% exact but a very close numbert will suffice. Query 1 Reads: 325229284 Writes: 85989 Duration: 840732 Query 2 Reads: 558955611 Writes: 87066 Duration: 1015697 Query 3 Reads: 422966141 Writes: 85087 Duration: 918225 currently reads and writes happen on the same drive. I want to move them so reads are one drive and writes are another. I tried to figure it out assuming writes are 20% slower than reads but didn't average in seek times. I was getting between 7%-15% but have no idea if those figures are correct. Assuming drive seek time is avg 1ms.
