What about using the GAUSS code provided by Sansó et. al (2004). This method is a development of the ICSS algorithm method proposed by Incl´an and Tiao (1994). Sanso et. al (2004) is widely used to detect the structural breaks in the unconditional variance, and it has improved results when the residuals are not normally distributed. In order to control for the breaks detected by this method, researchers from a dummy variable for every break, that takes 1 from the date of the break and zero everywhere else. If you have many breaks try to exclude the breaks that happen in less than 63 days in between them ( a common practice). Potter and Dijk (2004) imposed a minimum distance restriction between breakpoints for daily data as 63 or 126 business days (three or six months, respectively) You can find the code here: http://www.uib.cat/depart/deaweb/personal/profesores/personalpages/andreusanso/publ_archivos/icss.zip References: Incl´an, C. and Tiao, G.C.
