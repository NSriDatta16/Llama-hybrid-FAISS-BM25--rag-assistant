I agree with Al - he deserves the answer, but this (admittedly untested) code fragment should do what you asked for: def write_bmp_to_dc_rotated( dc, bitmap, angle ): ''' Rotate a bitmap and write it to the supplied device context. ''' img = bitmap.ConvertToImage() img_centre = wx.Point( img.GetWidth()/2, img.GetHeight()/2 ) img = img.Rotate( angle, img_centre ) dc.WriteBitmap( img.ConvertToBitmap(), 0, 0 ) One thing to note though from the docs : ...using wxImage is the preferred way to load images in wxWidgets, with the exception of resources... Was there a particular reason to load it as a bitmap rather than a wx.Image?
