Generally, VARMA is more parsimonious than VAR, so theoretically it should beat VAR in terms of AIC and BIC in some if not most instances. Why is this not happening? Features of the data Perhaps the data generating process is close to a very simple process such as a random walk. Some commodity prices are not very far from that. Then a model as parsimonious as a VAR(1) (or a VAR(0) for first differences of the data) might be all you need. Estimation of VAR and VARMA VAR and VARMA are usually estimated in different ways. It may be that the estimation precision of VAR is better than of VARMA for your sample size. Comparability of AIC and BIC values Are the AIC and BIC values comparable between VAR and VARMA? AIC and BIC involve likelihoods, and likelihoods often involve constants that get treated differently in different software implementations. This is because they do not matter when comparing models estimated using the same implementation. However, that might cause problems across implementations. Moreover, some implementations report average likelihood (averaged over the sample) while other report regular likelihood. Also, even comparing VAR(1) with VAR(2) can be problematic depending on which data points exactly the likelihoods are evaluated on. For a VAR(1), the likelihood may be estimated on all but the first data point. For a VAR(2), it may be the first two points that are dropped. Such treatment would make the likelihoods and the AIC and BIC based on them incomparable.
