How to interpret the average rate of NB-GLM when offset is involved?

My question is on how to interpret the coefficients of a negative-binomial GLM that included an offset. My dataset is a clinical trial where patients got one of two treatments (A or B) and stayed in the trial for different numbers of visits where the maximum possible number of visits is 52. The DV is number of visits where a specific event was reported (e.g. number of such visits are either 3, ..., 52) and the outcome should be reported as a rate i.e. number of healthy visits / total number of visits. As the "total number of visits" can differ per patient, as some patients leave the clinical trial already before the end of the trial, the offset in the model includes the (log) total number of visits per patient. As an outcome of the model, the average rate for treatment A is 21 and the average rate for treatment B is 17. What are these average rates referring to? Is it 21/52 and 17/52? Or is the rate rather the average of all "offset-corrected" individual rates? [edited for clarity]
