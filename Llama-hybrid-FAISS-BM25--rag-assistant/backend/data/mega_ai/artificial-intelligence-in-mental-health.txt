Artificial intelligence in mental health refers to the application of artificial intelligence (AI), computational technologies and algorithms to support the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health disorders. In the context of mental health, AI is considered a component of digital healthcare, with the objective of improving accessibility and accuracy and addressing the growing prevalence of mental health concerns. Applications of AI in this field include the identification and diagnosis of mental disorders, analysis of electronic health records, development of personalized treatment plans, and analytics for suicide prevention. There is also research into, and private companies offering, AI therapists that provide talk therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Despite its many potential benefits, the implementation of AI in mental healthcare presents significant challenges and ethical considerations, and its adoption remains limited as researchers and practitioners work to address existing barriers. There are concerns over data privacy and training data diversity. Implementing AI in mental health can eliminate the stigma and seriousness of mental health issues globally. The recent grasp on mental health issues has brought out concerning facts like depression, affecting millions of people annually. The current application of Artificial intelligence in mental health does not meet the demand to mitigate global mental health concerns. Background In 2019, 1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people around the world were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depressive disorders being the most common. In 2020, the number of people living with anxiety and depressive disorders rose significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the prevalence of mental health and addiction disorders exhibits a nearly equal distribution across genders, emphasizing the widespread nature of the issue. The use of AI in mental health aims to support responsive and sustainable interventions against the global challenge posed by mental health disorders. Some issues common to the mental health industry are provider shortages, inefficient diagnoses, and ineffective treatments. The global market for AI-driven mental health applications is projected to grow significantly, with estimates suggesting an increase from US$0.92 billion in 2023 to US$14.89 billion by 2033. This growth indicates a growing interest in AI's ability to address critical challenges in mental healthcare provision through the development and implementation of innovative solutions. AI-driven approaches Several AI technologies, including machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), deep learning (DL), computer vision (CV) and LLMs and generative AI are currently applied in various mental health contexts. These technologies enable early detection of mental health conditions, personalized treatment recommendations, and real-time monitoring of patient well-being. Machine learning Machine learning is an AI technique that enables computers to identify patterns in large datasets and make predictions based on those patterns. Unlike traditional medical research, which begins with a hypothesis, ML models analyze existing data to uncover correlations and develop predictive algorithms. ML in psychiatry is limited by data availability and quality. Many psychiatric diagnoses rely on subjective assessments, interviews, and behavioral observations, making structured data collection difficult. Some researchers have applied transfer learning, a technique that adapts ML models trained in other fields, to overcome these challenges in mental health applications. Deep learning Deep learning, a subset of ML, involves neural networks with many layers of neurons, that can grasp complex patterns, similarly to human brains. It is particularly useful for identifying subtle patterns in speech, imaging, and physiological data. Deep learning techniques have been appli
