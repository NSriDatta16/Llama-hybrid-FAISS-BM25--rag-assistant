In a GLSL fragment shader, how to access to texel at a specific mipmap level?

I am using OpenGL to do some GPGPU computations through the combination of one vertex shader and one fragment shader. I need to do computations on a image at different scale. I would like to use mipmaps since their generation can be automatic and hardware accelerated. However I can't manage to get access to the mipmap textures in the fragment shader. I enabled automatic mipmap generation: glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP, GL_TRUE); I tried using texture2DLod in the shader with no luck, it simply kept giving the normal texture. I also tried using glTextureParameteri(GL_BASE_LEVEL, X) in the main program and it did not change anything. How would you do that? I am using Linux. My graphic card is a Nvidia Quadro quite old. Here is my glxinfo output with all the supported extensions.
