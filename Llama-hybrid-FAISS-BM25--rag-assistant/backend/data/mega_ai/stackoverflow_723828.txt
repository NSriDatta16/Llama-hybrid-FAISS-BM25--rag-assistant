Removing an Item from Magento's Admin Panel Navigation

Using the Magento Ecommerce system, is is possible to remove an item from the Admin Panel Navigation menu? More generally, is there a way to use the config override system to remove existing elements from a configuration? I know I can add to the navigation with an override that looks something like this 0.1.0 The CMS 70 Foo Item adminhtml/foo but how would/could I completely suppress the CMS navigation item?
