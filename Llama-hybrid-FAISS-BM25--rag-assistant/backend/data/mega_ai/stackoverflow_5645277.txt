I spent half the night on this, and finally found a solution. The key line is: 04-05 18:00:11.276, (Lcom/example/android/app/FragmentLayoutSupport; had used a different Landroid/support/v4/app/FragmentActivity; during pre-verification). The problem is that the android-support-v4.jar which you are using in your test project is different from that one in your application project. Remove all of the references to android-support-v4.jar from your test project. Then go to your application project Properties->Java Build Path->Order and Export and check android-support-v4.jar to export it. Now both projects will be using the same library, and dalvik won't complain.
