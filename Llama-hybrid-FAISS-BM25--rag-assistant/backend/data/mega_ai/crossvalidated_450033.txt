@EdV's answer provides a very standard constructed model that has a Gaussian/Normal error term, which is a very common model for time series. A very natural question might be why is the error term Gaussian? To be clear, it's frequently not! But when it does occur, a natural explanation is something like the central limit theorem . This theorem 1 tells us that if we have a random variable that is the average of many independent random variables, the distribution of this average will approach a normal distribution asymptotically, even if the individual variables are not normal distributed themselves. I'm doing a little handwaving here, but if the noise in your recordings are the result of a summation of a large number of much smaller errors of all roughly the same magnitude, it would make sense that this observed noise would be approximately normally distributed. 1 Actually there are many, many different versions of the central limit theorem out there that apply under different conditions. The central limit theorem I'm referring to is the one they teach in stats 101.
