I'd propose that you use Access as a front-end tool for entering, editing and printing your data. You can store the data in any back-end database engine (MySQL, SQL Server, etc.), though Jet/ACE (the default Access database engine) is likely to be completely adequate unless your data set gets very, very large (it's limited to 2GBs but you don't really want to continue using it if your data grows to much over 1GB during regular usage). For complex statistical analysis, though, I'd recommend considering exporting the data and using a proper statistics package for doing the analysis. This means your reporting might all be done from there. In that situation, you could leverage Access's capabilities in allowing you to create an interface for selecting the datasets you wanted to export for analysis. The last time I did this for a client, they were using SPSS for the data analysis and I built them a very flexible export interface (they could choose any variables they liked for analysis). Whether this is a helpful alternative depends on the extent and type of the analysis you're going to do. If you're using a lot of functions that Access VBA lacks and have to borrow them from Excel or write replacements for them, then you might be better off doing all of that in some other program. Also, it may be that some or many or all of your calculations belong in the presentation layer and not in SQL. Access reports have a lot of capabilities here, and if you're summarizing data, it may be best done at that level, rather than in the SQL recordsources underlying your reports.
