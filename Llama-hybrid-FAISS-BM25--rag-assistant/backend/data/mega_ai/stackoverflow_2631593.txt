The tricky bit is recording the connections. Oracle doesn't do this by default, so if you haven't got anything in place then you won't have a historical record. The easiest way to start recording connections is with Oracle's built in audit functionality. It's as simple as audit session / We can see the records of each connection in a view called dba_audit_session . Now what? The following query uses a Common Table Expression to generate a range of datetime values which span 8th July 2009 in five minute chunks. The output of the CTE is joined to the audit view for that date; A count is calulated for each connection which spans a five minute increment. with t as ( select to_date('08-JUL-2009') + ((level-1) * (300/86400)) as five_mins from dual connect by level You can then use this query as the input into a query which calculates the average number of connections. This is a fairly crude implementation: I choose five minute increments out of display considerations , but obviously the finer grained the increment the more accurate the measure. Be warned: if you make the increments too fined grained and you have a lot of connections the resultant cross join will take a long time to run!
