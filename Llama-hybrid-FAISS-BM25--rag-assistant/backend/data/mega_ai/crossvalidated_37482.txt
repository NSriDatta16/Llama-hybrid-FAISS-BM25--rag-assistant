You are not correct in the way that in the frequentist framework parameters (in your case probability\proportion) are NOT a random variable. However, if you assume Bayesian framework, you can safely work with parameters as random variables and to obtain probabilities that some parameters exceeds some value. You have your sampling distribution $$X|p,N \sim B(N,p)$$ Assume that you observed sample is $X_{1},...,X_{t}$. Then, the likelihood function is proportional to $$p^{r}(1-p)^{N-r},$$ where $r= \Sigma X_{k}$. Now you need prior distribution on the proportion parameter. The usual choise in this problem is to use beta distribution $B(\alpha, \beta)$. Then you posterior (due to the conjugacy property) will also be a beta distribution with updated parameters $B(\alpha +r, \beta +N-r)$ or $$p|X,N \sim B(\alpha +r, \beta +N-r)$$ Now you can calculate the probabilities that you want, though it is not straightforward, since it requires to calculate incomplete Beta function. Another aspect is that I dont see any way how to calculate the number of experiments, since all statistical information colapses to one sum $r$.
