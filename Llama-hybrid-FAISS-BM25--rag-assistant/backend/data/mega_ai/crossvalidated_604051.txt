You can aggregate the other variables to have the same level of granularity as the pollution measurements. So deaths at t would be measured as total deaths in the past four days (t, t-1, t-2, t-3). I would also include a lag pollution term from t-4 as a covariate to pick up conditions closer to the start of the four-day window. For things like wind, maybe max would be better than an average. The broken sensor days could be handled with traditional imputation techniques. This may not work if sensors break because pollution is heavy. If you have time series data, you might consider a regression model for TS (like regression with Newey-West standard errors). The usual/quasi Poisson models both assume that errors are independent across observations, which is inappropriate with observations that are periods.
