This is more of a programming question than a data science question and would therefore be better suited to the stackoverflow stackexchange. The numbers you are seeing are related to ticklabel formats used by the matplotlib library. Changing the axis settings should allow you to get rid of the numbers on the top left of the plot: ax.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False, style='plain') # or plt.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False, style='plain') For more in-depth information on the offset and style see this stackoverflow answer or the matplotlib documentation .
