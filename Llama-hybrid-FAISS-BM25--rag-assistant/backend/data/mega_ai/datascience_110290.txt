find speedup for different number of processes

I am new to data science I need to create code to find speedup compared with the number of processes while using a k-nearest neighbor. which (k=1,2,3,4,5,6,7). this process should be after downloading some datasets. it is preferred to use python. What is the appropriate code in python for that?
