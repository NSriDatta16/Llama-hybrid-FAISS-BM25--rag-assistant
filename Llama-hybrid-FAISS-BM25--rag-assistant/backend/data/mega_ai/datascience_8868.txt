Welcome to the real world of data science. Here, the data sets are not as clean as you thought while doing those courses/tutorials online. Those are super polished and refined. But, the real world data is not so. The step where one does the cleaning and scrubbing is called the data pre-processing step. So, some nice data cleaning techniques, in addition to @jknappen's excellent answer are: Elimination of zero variance columns/predictors: These columns are not important, and they cause the model and the fit to crash and leak errors. So, eliminating them would make complete sense. Correlated Predictors: Reducing the level of correlation between the predictors would be a very nice step in the pre-processing process. Scaling: You must be knowing why scaling is important during pre-process. Predictor Transformations A nice reference from Kaggle forums where the pre-processing and cleaning of data sets is discussed.
