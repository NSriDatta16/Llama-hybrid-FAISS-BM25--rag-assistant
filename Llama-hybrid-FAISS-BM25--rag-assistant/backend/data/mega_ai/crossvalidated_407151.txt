Generally, depends on the model you are going to use later. If you are planning to use a tree-based model, then label-encoding (or even frequency-encoding) works fine. However, if you plan on using a linear model or Neural network, then one-hot encoding works better. Using one-hot encoding in tree-based models might unnecessarily increase complexity (See this link ). Always strategize your preprocessing so that it benefits the model you have chosen.
