This heavily depends on the learning method. Most general purpose approaches have one (or several) ways to deal with this. A common fix is to assign a higher misclassification penalty on the minority class, forcing the classifier to recognize them (SVM, logistic regression, neural networks, ...). Changing sampling is also a possibility like you mention. In this case, oversampling the minority class is usually a better solution than undersampling the majority class. Some methods, like random forests, don't need any modifications.
