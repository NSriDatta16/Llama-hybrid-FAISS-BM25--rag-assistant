I would recommend checking out the following sites: http://deviceatlas.com/ http://mobileelements.com/ http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/ They all talk about how you target particular mobile devices, so that way you can use different style sheets for different mobile devices. Generally for a black berry just look for "blackberry" in the user agent string is a good enough case
