I went to the ( W3C Validator ) and input the following document into the fragment validator: When validated as HTML 4.01 it errors with this message: The sequence can be interpreted in at least two different ways, depending on the DOCTYPE of the document. For HTML 4.01 Strict, the '/' terminates the tag '). However, since many browsers don't interpret it this way, even in the presence of an HTML 4.01 Strict DOCTYPE, it is best to avoid it completely in pure HTML documents and reserve its use solely for those written in XHTML. And when validated as XHTML 1.0 it passes with a warning about UTF-8, not related to this. So in short, the answer to your question is: because it's not valid.
