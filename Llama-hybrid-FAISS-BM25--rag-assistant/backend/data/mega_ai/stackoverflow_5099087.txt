run a sample of the calculation before the main program executes, and guesstimate from this. randomly resample at sensible intervals throughout and keep a moving average, just incase the first sample was misrepresentative. afterall, what you actually need is a working speed, and not a theoretical one. (the theoretical speed might be 3 ghz, but the working speed might be equivallent to 500 mhz if there are lots of other applications running in the background.) var t:Number = getTimer(); var i:int = 0; while( getTimer() - t
