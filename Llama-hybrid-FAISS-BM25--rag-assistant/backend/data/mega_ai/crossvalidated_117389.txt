The negative intercept means that, if subscribers were 0, the predicted revenue would be -189,883,443 and that predicted revenue increases by 24.4 for each subscriber. This is a nonsensical result, so, it is probable that either 1) You did something wrong in Excel and aren't doing what you think you are doing (very easy to believe, Excel is not great for statistics 2) There are violations of the assumptions. Possibly outliers or leverage points. 3) The form of the relationship is not linear. (There could be other reasons too).
