It is pretty easy to do with WinForms (there are events for that there). Since you are not using WinForms, you need to use WinAPI. You can register your window to accept drag&drop events using the RegisterDragDrop Function and the IDropTarget Interface (or use your own). [DllImport("ole32.dll")] static extern int RegisterDragDrop(IntPtr hwnd, IDropTarget pDropTarget);
