ffmpeg to transcode streaming video and storage

Examples of ffmpeg that I've seen so far all seem to accept a file on disk storage as input, to transcode it into another file in disk storage as output. Also i've come accross ffserver which can be used to stream-out video. However, yet to find a good tutorial or example of ffmpeg used to transcode streaming video/audio, constrained by say parameters like running-time or no. of frames or other event, and save the transcoded media on disk. Any pointers, tips or hints would really help.
