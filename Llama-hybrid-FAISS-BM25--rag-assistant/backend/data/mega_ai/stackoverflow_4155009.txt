How to Bind Listbox in WPF to a generic list?

i'm having trouble getting a clear answer for this. I have a Static class (DataHolder) that holds a static list with a complex type (CustomerName and CustomerID properties). I want to bind it to a ListBox in WPF but add another item that will have the word "All" for future drag and drop capablilities. Anyone?
