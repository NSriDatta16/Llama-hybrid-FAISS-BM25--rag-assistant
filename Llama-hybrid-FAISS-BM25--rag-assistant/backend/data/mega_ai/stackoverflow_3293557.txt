How do I create git tags for legacy gcc releases?

I've cloned the Official GCC git repository, which includes a full GCC development history, but git branch -r lists only a few recent branches, and 'git tag' reports no tag. git fetch --tags didn't help. git svn fetch will recreate tags/branches that were in SVN, but will take about 10 days to complete. I know I could use SVN directly, but would prefer to leverage git's superior merge capabilities to forward-port changes from gcc-3.3.2. So, is there a relatively quick way to automatically retrieve git tags or branches for old GCC releases?
