Ranking: Only allowing features to have positive weights

I read the following in the Google "rules for machine learning" : Rule #35: Beware of the inherent skew in ranking problems. Only allow features to have positive weights. Thus, any good feature will be better than a feature that is "unknown" . What do they mean by that? How would you accomplish that at training time? Why would "any good feature" be better than a feature that is unknown?
