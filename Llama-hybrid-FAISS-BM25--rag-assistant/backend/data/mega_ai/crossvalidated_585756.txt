Here's one statistical interpretation of Frobenius norm of $\Sigma$ . Lets say that there's a dataset with $b$ rows $X$ whose empirical covariance matches $\Sigma$ . We have $$\|\Sigma\|^2_F=\|\frac{1}{b}X^TX\|_F^2=\frac{1}{b^2}\|XX^T\|_F^2$$ You can rewrite the last term as $$\frac{1}{b^2}\sum_{ij} \langle x_i, x_j\rangle^2$$ In other words, $\|\Sigma\|^2_F$ is the average dot product between two pairs of examples in any representative dataset. Meanwhile, spectral norm of $\Sigma$ is the largest variance among all directions, a kind of normalizing factor. If we use trace instead of spectral norm, it gives us the quantity which occurs in linear estimation literature: $$R=\frac{(\text{Tr}\Sigma)^2}{\text{Tr}\Sigma^2}$$ It's kind of a measure of degrees of freedom, giving the size of the largest batch such that samples are mostly pairwise uncorrelated. When observations come from distributions with high value of $R$ the corresponding estimation problem is easy, for details, see definition 3 and Theorem 2 of Uniform Convergence of Interpolators: Gaussian Width, Norm Bounds, and Benign Overfitting
