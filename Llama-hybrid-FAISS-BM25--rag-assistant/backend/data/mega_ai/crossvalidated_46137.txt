Very nice question. A thing to realize upfront is that machine learning is both an art and science and involves meticulously cleaning out data, visualizing it and eventually build models that suite the business in question, while simultaneously keeping it scalable & tractable. Skills wise, more important than anything else is to focus on probability and to use simple methods first before jumping onto complex ones. I prefer the R & Perl combination, since you known python that should be good enough. When working on a real job, you will invariably have to pull your own data so knowledge of SQL (or whatever other no-sql your company supports) is a must. Nothing beats experience in the ML area, so engaging in sites like stackexchange, kaggle is also a great way to get exposed to this field. Good luck.
