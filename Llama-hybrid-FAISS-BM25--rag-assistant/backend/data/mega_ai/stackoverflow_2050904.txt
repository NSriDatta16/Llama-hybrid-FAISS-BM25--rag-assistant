How do I get Eclipse to get all of my resources on Tomcat's classpath?

I am having a devil of a time getting Eclipse to run my webapp on tomcat with the classpath correct. I have some spring configuration that references property files at classpath:/whatever.properties - these properties files live in my web project at src\main\resources, and I can see that they get deployed to the WEB-INF\classes folder, but they are not picked up. Also, a breakpoint in my custom spring property provider is not hit, even though the code is run (verified through logging). .project snippet: org.maven.ide.eclipse.maven2Builder org.eclipse.jdt.core.javabuilder org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.builder org.eclipse.wst.validation.validationbuilder org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature org.maven.ide.eclipse.maven2Nature org.eclipse.jem.workbench.JavaEMFNature org.eclipse.wst.common.modulecore.ModuleCoreNature org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.nature .classpath snippet: org.eclipse.wst.common.component: uses I have tried with Tomcat's Location (right click the server, select Properties) being in workspace metadata, and also with it living in the Servers project. I have tried using the workspace metadata deployment, letting eclipse take over my tomcat installation, and a custom deployment location. It has worked once - breakpoint hit, properties read - but when I started the server again the next time, it went back to its old ways. If you need more information, let me know and I'll edit the post ASAP.
