How to use an tag inside a in the middle of a text?

I want to do something like this: This is a text paragraph. I disabled margin and padding for the h2 but it still breaks the line before and after the h2 tag. How can I use the h2 tag in the middle of a text and make it look like if it was a normal word, just like does? The doctype of my html document is "XHTML 1.0 Transitional"
