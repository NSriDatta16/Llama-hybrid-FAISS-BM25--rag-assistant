After posting this question I spoke with a coworker who suggested I read the article: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000968.html In short, it advocates that programmers be more aware of branching. It helped me to see there is no right way to go about organizing our repository. For our team we will have a trunk and two long term branches for test and development. In addition we will make seperate branches for each task do we and merged the changes from the task branches as we promote the task up to testing and production.
