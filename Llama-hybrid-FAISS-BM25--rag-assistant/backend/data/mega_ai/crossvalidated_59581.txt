Based on the suggestions proposed by Glen_b and COOLSerdash I did an ordinal logistic regression using 375 instances each comprised of 10 binary features and the results are as follows. values |std error| T-Value | P-Value | 2.5% | 97.5% | -3.40728 | 0.0750 | -45.4461| 0 | -3.55 | -3.26 | -2.61808 | 0.0590 | -44.3806| 0 | -2.73 | -2.50 | -2.03321 | 0.0519 | -39.1592| 0 | -2.13 | -1.93 | -1.71011 | 0.0493 | -34.7131| 4.99E-264| -1.81 | -1.61 | -1.37915 | 0.0472 | -29.1895| 2.63E-187| -1.47 | -1.29 | -1.17436 | 0.0463 | -25.3652| 6.11E-142| -1.27 | -1.08 | -0.94292 | 0.0455 | -20.7434| 1.41E-95 | -1.03 | -0.85 | -0.78121 | 0.0450 | -17.3608| 1.64E-67 | -0.87 | -0.69 | -0.66665 | 0.0447 | -14.9029| 3.16E-50 | -0.75 | -0.58 | According to here , since the 95% CI does not cross 0, all the parameter estimates are statistically significant. I have some followup questions which I will put in my question.
