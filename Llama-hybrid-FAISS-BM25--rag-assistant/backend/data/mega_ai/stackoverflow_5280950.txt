Canvas GUI Toolkit

Is there a simple (and fast) toolkit for drawing things on a canvas (e.g. circles, lines, rectangles)? It would be best if it was in Python, Java, C++. I'm trying to make an application that drag'n'drops items to a canvas and moving them around in the canvas. I've looked at a few, pyglet, Java Swing, HTML5 or are there other ones more suitable?
