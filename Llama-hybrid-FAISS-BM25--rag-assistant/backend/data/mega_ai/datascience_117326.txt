The log variance is necessary to compute the KL divergence term in the loss function. During training, the VAE minimizes a loss function that includes a reconstruction loss and a KL divergence term. The reconstruction loss measures the error between the input and its reconstruction, while the KL divergence term measures the distance between the encoder's distribution and a prior distribution over the latent space. See also: Mathematical details from this article . However, in the github you've mentioned, the standard deviation is a trick to generate images from the model. It is used in the function generate, which is applied to retrieve images from the model in experiment.py : def sample_images(self): # Get sample reconstruction image test_input, test_label = next(iter(self.trainer.datamodule.test_dataloader())) test_input = test_input.to(self.curr_device) test_label = test_label.to(self.curr_device) # test_input, test_label = batch recons = self.model.generate(test_input, labels = test_label) vutils.save_image(recons.data, os.path.join(self.logger.log_dir , "Reconstructions", f"recons_{self.logger.name}_Epoch_{self.current_epoch}.png"), normalize=True, nrow=12)
