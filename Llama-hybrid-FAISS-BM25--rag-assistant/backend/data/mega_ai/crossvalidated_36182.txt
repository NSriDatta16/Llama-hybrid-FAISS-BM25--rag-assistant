The point $[E(X), E(Y)]$ does always fall on the least squares regression line when fitting $Y=AX+B$. where by $E(X)$ and $E(Y)$ we mean the sample averages. In your notation it should be $E(Y\vert X=E(X))=E(Y)$. This is an interesting property of the least squares estimate. Given $Y_i=A X_i + B +e_i$ is the model with $i=1,2,...,n$. The least squares estimates for A and B are obtained by taking partial derivatives of $\sum e_i^2$ with respect to $A$ and $B$ and setting them equal to zero. This leads to two equations in two unknowns and one of the equations reduces to $Y_b=A X_b +B$, where $X_b$ and $Y_b$ are the sample means for $X$ and $Y$ respectively. To answer the new question from the edit: You do not add the overall mean nutrition intake for every subject because Their total caloric intake is not always at the mean total caloric intake for the individual subject. All we said with the first result was that if your total caloric intake is at the sample mean then the expected nutricianal intake would be at the sample mean. But the authors want to adjust each individual based on his own total caloric intake.
