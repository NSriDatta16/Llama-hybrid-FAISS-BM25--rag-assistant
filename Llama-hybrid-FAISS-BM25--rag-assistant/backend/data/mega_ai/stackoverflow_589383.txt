Look at javax.servlet.ServletContextListener for implementing threads in a web application. It is generally a bad idea to start threads in servlets - the listener makes sure you only have one thread and that it is started when the application starts. It also allows you to elegantly stop the thread when the application is stopped (i.e. when the servlet context is destoyed). You can use a Thread Monitor pattern to send a notification to the thread to start/pause/stop processing etc. methods in this pattern would be Thread.notify() and Thread.wait(). You can create the thread in the contextInitialized() method
