Viewstate becomes corrupt intermittently

I have had a user of my VB.net web app complain he keeps getting an intermittent error message, causing him to crash out of the system. Stack Trace: [FormatException: Invalid character in a Base-64 string.] System.Convert.FromBase64String(Strings) +0 System.web. UI. LosFormatter.Deserialize(String input) +25 System.web. UI. Page. LoadPageStateFromPersistenceMedium() +101 [HttpException (0x80004005) : Invalid_Viewstate Client IP: 127.0.0. 1 Port: 3491 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible: MSIE 7.0; windows NT 5.2; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET ViewState: dDwxMZUZMDI3MTC203Q802w8aTwxPjS+02w8dDw7bDxpPDU+02 kBNj47aTw4PjtpPDEDPjtpPDE4PjtpPDIwPjtpPDIXPjtpPDM OPjtpPDM1PjtpPDM2PjtpI Http-Referer: http ://localhost/ /webForms/frmSystem.aspx?User=2&systemNo=22011U&Zoom=1&Strips=6 Path: / /webForms/frmSystem.aspx.] System.web.

ProcessRequestMain() +447 It appears from the error message that the viewstate keeps becoming corrupt (see screen-dump below), but I don't understand why. He claims it happens every 2-3 minutes, but I've used the system a lot and have never experienced it. I should mention too that he is using the web-app in a very "non-standard" way. To achieve optimum speed he's actually using remote desktop, to connect to our server directly, and running it as localhost. ("Madness!"- yes, I know. I didn't make the decision.) That may not be relevant of course. Some advice on what is likely to be causing the viewstate to become corrupt would be extremely helpful. Screen-dump of error
