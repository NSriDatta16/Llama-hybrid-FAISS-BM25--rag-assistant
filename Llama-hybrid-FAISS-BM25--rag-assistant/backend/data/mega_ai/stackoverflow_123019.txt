Here is a db related example I often use. Let us say you have an object and a container object like an list. Let us assume that sometime you might want to store the objects in a particular sequence. Assume that the sequence is not related to the position in the array but instead that the objects are a subset of a larger set of objects and the sequence position is related to the database sql filtering. To keep track of your customized sequence positions you could make your object implement a custom interface. The custom interface could mediate the organizational effort required to maintain such sequences. For example, the sequence you are interested in has nothing to do with primary keys in the records. With the object implementing the interface you could say myObject.next() or myObject.prev().
