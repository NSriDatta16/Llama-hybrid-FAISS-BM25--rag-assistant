This is perhaps not the most elegant solution, but it should work. You can have PHP sniff your url variables for the existence of a particular variable. I'd probably call this something like 'selectedTabId' or something like that. Then, if that variable exists, you can have jQuery invoke the click action on that tab. You'll want to use switch/case for this rather than just sending through whatever happens to be in the URL, as people can put nasty things there that you don't want your jQuery to run. I won't do that in my example below, for expediency's sake. This is a notional example... "; echo "jQuery(document).ready(function(){'#$selectedTabId').click()});"; echo " "; } ?> Give that a shot and see if it works for you.
