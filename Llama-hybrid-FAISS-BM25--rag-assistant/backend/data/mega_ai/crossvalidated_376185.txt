Minimal sufficient statistics of increasing dimensionality (not equal to the number of observations)

Restricting the attention to the case of fixed parameters support, it's my understanding that (minimal) sufficient statistics of fixed dimensionality, i.e. a fixed number of of them, exists in, and only in, the case of exponential families. Looking outside, I found the case of the Cauchy distribution: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2975830/minimal-sufficient-statistics-for-cauchy-distribution where "reduction" is a achieved by the sorting, which is not invertible. I don't find this example too interesting as order statistics seems to be always sufficient for iid data and the dimensionality is equal to the dataset size. I also found the following (very) related question: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/149065/examples-of-sufficient-statistics-for-non-exponential-family-distributions but I fail to understand how the first example doesn't have fixed dimensionality of 1, while the second example is too loosely defined. What is a known example of a distribution whose minimal sufficient statistics dimensionality isn't fixed nor equal to the dataset size (ideally sublinear)?
