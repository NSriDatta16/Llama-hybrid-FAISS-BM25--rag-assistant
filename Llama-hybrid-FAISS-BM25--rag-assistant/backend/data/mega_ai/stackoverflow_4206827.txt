Apple does strongly discourages quitting from application programmatically. I think you can handle your case without quitting application - when application goes to background(in applicationDidEnterBackground method of application delegate) save some flag indicating that you want to reinit it on resume, then when application comes back to foreground (applicationWillEnterForeground method in delegate) apply your initialization logic in case flag is set.
