VBA/SQL openrecordset(strSQL) Error 3001

I am trying to run a query on a database server (Oracle 10g) using VBA/Excel and to display the results in a excel table. I have created the ODBC connection (read-only) and tested the connection. I works fine if I import data as a data source in excel (I am able to filter through a query as well) However my VBA code is giving me Error 3001 Sub Test() Dim cnn As ADODB.Connection Dim canConnect As Boolean Dim rs As Recordset Dim strSQL As String Set cnn = New ADODB.Connection cnn.Open "DSN=blah;Uid=blah;Pwd=blah" strSQL = "select job_start_dttm, job_end_dttm from c_job" Set rs = cnn.openrecordset(strSQL) ActiveCell = rs(0) End Sub I get Error 3001 - Arguemnts are of worng type, are out of acceptable range, or are in confilct with one another The query itself runs fine in SQL developer. Thanks edit: The error is on "Set rs = cnn.openrecordset(strSQL)" line
