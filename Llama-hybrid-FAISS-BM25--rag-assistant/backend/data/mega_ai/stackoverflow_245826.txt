Basically the best thing I've seen for this sort of thing would be either Flash or Java that let you drag the nodes around, and it would auto stretch, move, expand based on tension values on the edges. Brief googlage exposes this . I tried the Java application version, seems to work on a basic level, but perhaps overkill for your needs. :) Check out the AJAX version, maybe? Perhaps check out ways to drag with jQuery .
