If I understand your question (esp. Edit 2) correctly, you want to search for circular patterns in a digial image from a camera or scanner. As RobS already said, hough transform and template matching in the fourier spectrum are good ways to do this. You will probably find lots of libraries for hough transformation or FFT, but I'm not sure you'll be able to use one of those without actually understanding the algorithms. For example: Standard hough transformation only works for lines, it has to be adapted for circles. Also, it needs some kind of preprocessing to find the edges of the circle. It has a few parameters (the size of the internal parameter space) that are hard to adjust if you don't know what they mean. If you can binarize your image, i.e. if the circular patterns you're looking for are significantly brighter or darker than the background, it might be simpler to Binarize the image Group connected areas of pixels aka Blobs (e.g. using Flood-Fill) Decide if a blob is one of your patterns by comparing some of it's characteristics (e.g. total area, number of boundary pixels, average brightness, average contrast) to the kind of pattern you'd expect Neither of these subproblems (Binarization, Segmentation, Pattern matching) is simple or even solvable in general, but if your problem is simple enough, you might just get away with a few very simple algorithms.
