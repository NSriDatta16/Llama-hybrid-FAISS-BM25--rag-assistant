I ran into a similar issue with fields with line feeds in. Im not convinced this is elegant, but... For mine I basically chopped mine into lines, then if the line didnt start with a text delimeter, I appended it to the line above. You could try something like this : Step through each field, if the field has an end text delimeter, move to the next, if not, grab the next field, appaend it, rince and repeat till you do have an end delimeter (allows for 1,000,000,000 etc) .. (Im caffeine deprived, and hungry, I did write some code but it was so ugly, I didnt even post it)
