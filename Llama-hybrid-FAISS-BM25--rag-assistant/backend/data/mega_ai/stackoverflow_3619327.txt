Visual Basic 6 creates projects which have the extension vbp . I think it stands for Visual Basic Project (obviously). As Joel suggested in his answer , you can use the VB6 IDE to open the file. Since you stated that you have a C# background, I take the liberty to assume that you're using Visual Studio. If that's the case, you can open the project with visual studio and it will be automatically upgraded for you. You must note, however, that the project will be 'upgraded' to VB.NET. If the project was large and fairly complicated, you'll have to be prepared for quite some time correcting errors. VB6 and VB.NET are quite different you know. Plus, unless you fix all the errors in the upgraded project, you can't convert the code to C# or any other .NET language.
