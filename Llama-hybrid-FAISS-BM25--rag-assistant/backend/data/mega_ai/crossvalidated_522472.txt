Two-sample t-test between coefficient from regression on two different samples

I am trying to perform a two sample t-test on the regression coefficients for event dummies between two portfolio's (portfolio 1: Top portfolio and portfolio 2: Bad portfolio) The Do file I wrote for now provides a regression output that looks the following: Click image for larger version I am struggling to find a way/methodology to store this information whereafter I can easily use it to perform the two sample t-tests for every respective coefficients and finally between the sum of the coefficients, as I would run exactly the same regression for the "bad" portfolio. What information should I store? Is it sufficient to just save the coefficients and the Std. Err., or do I need to save the weighted (market cap) average daily returns of the portfolio's? or maybe the returns from all the companies in the sample with an indicator if they are part of portfolio "good" or "bad"?
