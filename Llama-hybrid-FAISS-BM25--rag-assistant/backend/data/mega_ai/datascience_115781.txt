With RandomForest as it exists in scikit-learn, and practically all other implementations, there is no way to input structured data - be it 1D sequences or 2D matrices. All data must be transformed into a set of feature columns before passing to fit()/predict(). And the RandomForest method is unaware of any relation between these feature columns. This typically means that to perform well on images or sequences, feature engineering must be performed in a previous step of the pipeline, to extract meaningful features that the classifier can work with.
