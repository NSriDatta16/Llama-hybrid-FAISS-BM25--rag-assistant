There is a PhD thesis from one of the Kaggle guys about Understanding Random Forests. And that's actually the title of his thesis. This is the link and i think its a pretty new PhD: http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~glouppe/pdf/phd-thesis.pdf Hope this helps, it's more specific and starts from basics as well.
