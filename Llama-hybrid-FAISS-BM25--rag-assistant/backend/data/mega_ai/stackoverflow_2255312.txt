How to build widget page using jquery, json object, and xml file in ASP.NET

I am trying to build a page which consists of different user controls which is divided in 3 columns. I have created a custom class for the page and widgets where the user controls will be loaded in. The custom class needs to be stored in an XML file, and using jQuery sortable for drag-and-drop functionality. At this point, my question is what is the best implementation for loading and saving the states of the page and widgets inside the page? I was thinking about using JSON and WebMethod for that, but I am still missing out the architecture on how I should build the page. Help me please, since I am such a newbie in ASP.NET development and jQuery... Thanks in advance!
