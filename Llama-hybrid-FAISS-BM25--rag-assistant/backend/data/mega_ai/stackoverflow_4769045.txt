Some general tips Make sure that non technical people such as clients or business analysts understand the tests. Strive to organize your test suites well. Probably you could organize them per feature or functionality. Also try to separate tests for corner cases from the "normal" tests. I think that XMLUnit can do diffing of XML files http://xmlunit.sourceforge.net/
