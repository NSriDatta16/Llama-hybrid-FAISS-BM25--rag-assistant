The !important property is being applied to .byline , but you don't have enough content in the paragraph to realize it (it isn't being applied to the first line). The #main p:first-line selector is more specific to the first line of the element than #main p.byline . You can fix it pretty easily by changing the first-line selector to only apply to paragraph elements that follow h3 elements. #main h3+p:first-line { color: #999999; font-weight: bold; } Also, the specificity calculator was probably not completely accurate because :first-line isn't a real element, but a pseudo-element. Smashing Magazine has a nice article on Advanced CSS Selectors .
