In most non-compulsory survey contexts, there is a substantial problem with nonresponse. This from 2002: "the recently reported estimate of survey cooperation rates from CMOR, the Council for Market and Opinion Research [USA], averaged only 14.7 percent." and from Paul Gerhold, "I believe that it is still possible to draw random samples. I just don't believe that it is possible to execute them." In this context, the fact that the SAMPLE is random isn't very relevant, because the resulting data isn't. This makes bias adjustment the major issue in valid estimation, and field method design is an important component. The ways in which one might want to do this, and the resulting confidence estimates, are well beyond what can be discussed here.
