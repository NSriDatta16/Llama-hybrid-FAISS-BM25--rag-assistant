The 2nd case presented would also have problem when a user did purchases everytime he landed on the section. That is 100% buy rate. Although from a practical purpose, we may consider assuming that the chances that a user will do a purchase every time he lands on a section is very unlikely, in that case your 2nd formulation may work. Options If there are no data points with 100% buy rate then you can probably use the 2nd formulation. If there are some data points with 100% buy rate then I think it would be good to keep the 2 features separate, scale them and then use them in your PCA/Kmeans implementation.
