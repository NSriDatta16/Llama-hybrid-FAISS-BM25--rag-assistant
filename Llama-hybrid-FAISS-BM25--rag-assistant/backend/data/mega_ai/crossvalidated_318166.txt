Since you are dealing with a small number of time series, I think recurrent neural networks are a bit over the top. I would start with a simple approach and check if the results match your expectations, if not refine it. As a start clustering could be the way to go. Since you are expecting 3 "types" of time series, you could use K-Medoid Clustering setting K to 3. As a distance metric you already mentioned DTW, but depending on your definition of similarity in this context, other distance measures might be more suitable. I know that the ELKI Data Mining Framework has both components already implemented. Also you can quickly change distance functions if you want to.
