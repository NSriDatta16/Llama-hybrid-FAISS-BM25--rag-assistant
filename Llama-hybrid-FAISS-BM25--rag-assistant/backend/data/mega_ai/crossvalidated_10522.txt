People often use the phrase "Likert scale" erroneously, not realizing that it originally described the coherent method Rensis Likert developed to do just what you're describing. Key steps are Seeing how well each item correlates with "the whole"--the average of all other items Checking variability, since an item with low variability is unlikely to contribute much information to such a scale Using steps 1 and 2, as well as tests of Cronbach's alpha (and sometimes factor analysis, as @fmark has said), to narrow down the list of items to be kept Averaging the items ultimately selected to compute the scale score for each person. An excellent and very accessible guide to this process can be found in Paul Spector's Summated Rating Scale Construction , a little green Sage book that's available for about $18 new.
