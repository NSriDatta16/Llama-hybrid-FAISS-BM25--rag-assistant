Corr of random-effects when a cross-level interaction in lme4

I had a quick question. I have a cross-level interaction in my model below ( ses*sector ). My cluster-level predictor "sector" is a binary variable ( 0=Public , 1=Private ). My level-1 predictor ses is numeric. QUESTION: The Corr = 1 is indicating the correlation between intercepts and slopes across BOTH public & private sectors (like their average) OR something else? NOTE: Regardless of size of Corr ( $.1$ or $.99$ ), I just want to know the answer to my question above. library(lme4) hsb ```
