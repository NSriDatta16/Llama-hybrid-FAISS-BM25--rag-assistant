You hit at a typical problem here. There are a few ways of solving this. If you use some automapping, you should exclude that property, if you use normal mapping (HBM files) you can just ignore the property. But with the LINQ statement it may still go wrong as you explained. Here are a few workarounds: Pragmatic: all your extensions to a POCO should be methods, not properties. That reflects what you are doing: an action that returns something. Hence, use Pony GetNewestPony() as declaration. Same way I solved this in POCOs with GetFullName() which combines first, middle, last name. Design: it is best to keep your POCOs plain and simple. That way they can be autogenerated and can evolve without hurting anybody. Just gettors/settors and that's it. To solve your issue then: use what C# introduced in 3.0: extension methods (no, extension properties do not exist). Architecture: it is common to place the DAO layer as a separate layer in a separate asssembly from the Domain layer. That way, both the business logic (getting selections, all, updating, all CRUD etc) can go in its own DAO class. To do this well, you need excessive use and understanding of C# interfaces and generalization. This concept is explained clearly and detailed by Billy McCafferty and later evolved into the now famous S#arp Architecture . For a quick fix: use nr 1 or 2. For a thorough future-looking fix, change your architecture, otherwise NHibernate will bite you in the back, instead of helping you. EDIT: Below, adriaanp hits on a sore point of using extension methods and I believe he's right. Because I almost always use autogenerated DTO's, I want them separated completely from any methods I introduce by hand. If I want them on the object though, instead of as extension methods, Microsoft introduced partial classes for exactly this purpose (to extend auto-generated classes in the class itself, without loosing roundtrip engineering). But here too: be careful with not making it messy, clear filenames can help a lot.
