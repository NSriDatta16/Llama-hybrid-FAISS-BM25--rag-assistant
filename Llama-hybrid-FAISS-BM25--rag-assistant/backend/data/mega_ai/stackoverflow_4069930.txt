ASP.NET MVC State Management

I am working on a .net mvc web application that has a bunch of web parts on the homepage. I realize that a webpart is a .net forms terminology, but wasn't sure what to name those mini sections. So anyways, for now these sections are called when that page is rendered, but eventually I will plug in JQuery and call these sections using AJAX. These mini sections or widgets will need to keep state as the user navigates between the homepage and back. With .net forms, the page state info is kept in the viewstate, but with .net mvc, that is not available (thankfully). So, is there a framework already created for such functionality for MVC? If not, what would be the best way to handle this situation? I was thinking to leverage the HttpContext object and store everything in there, but not sure if that object has any size limitations.
