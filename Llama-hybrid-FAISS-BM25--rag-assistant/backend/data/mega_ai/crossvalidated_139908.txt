Suggested method for estimating door counter stats when data is lost

I'm wondering if you have any advice about a methodology to use to estimate "door counter" stats (i.e., an automated count of visitors to our organisation, based on "break beam" door counters installed at each branch) when there are outages and data is lost. For example, let's say we had 1055 visitors last Friday and this Friday the door counter didn't work so we need to make an estimate of numbers. I assume getting an average of the past x number of Fridays is one approach, but I'm just wondering what the most rigorous and transparent approach to estimating would be?
