The answer depends on your larger needs. Here are three questions that can flesh those out: 1) How often is the data read vs. written? 2) Do you keep old versions or is only the latest required? 3) Will the data be compared to other data? In one case let's say the answer to #1 is "many more reads" and the answer to #3 is "yes". In this case it might be well worthwhile to put the XML results into a SQL table for frequent and flexible querying. However, in another case, let's say the answer to #2 is "no" and the answer to #3 is "no" -- you just keep the latest retrieval and don't compare it to anything. In this case you can just stick into a file and retrieve it as needed for display (#1 becomes kind of irrelevant). EDIT in response to question in comment: Assuming you want to put it into a database, the display you link to shows a nested set of objects/arrays. You "walk the tree" to peel out the nested objects, strip off their properties and issue individual inserts to the particular tables.
