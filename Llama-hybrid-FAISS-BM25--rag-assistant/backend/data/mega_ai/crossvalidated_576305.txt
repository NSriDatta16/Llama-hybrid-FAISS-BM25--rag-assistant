Using the WLLN for deriving an OLS estimator

I am reading an introductory econometrics book and I am having trouble understanding how they "directly applied the law of large numbers". Basically, they consider the case of simple linear regression model, trying to show how it behaves asymptotically. they begin just with the formula of the slope parameter estimator like this: and then only say that they "apply the law of large numbers" to it and somehow get: I was only taught the basic relationship regarding the LLN which is that in a limit, as n goes to infinity, the sample average should converge to the true mean of the distribution. I have no idea how to use it in this case when there is the square or that another term u in the sum. Can someone please explain? Thanks.
