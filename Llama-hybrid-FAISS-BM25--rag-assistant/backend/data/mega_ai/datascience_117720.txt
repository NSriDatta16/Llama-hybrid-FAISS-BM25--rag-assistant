Cluster products that are frequently bought together

I have a dataset of articles metadata for each article, so something like this: product_id color type 1234 red t-shirt and another containing the transactions of customers, which looks like this: date customer_id product_id 12/12/12 abcd 1234 Using the second dataset, I was able to determine which products are often bought together. As such, for each product, I have a sorted list of 10 (different) products (at most, it could be less) that are most frequently bought with it. This information is stored in a dictionary of the following form: {1234: [5678,6352,3434,34433, ...], 1435 : [7832, 9801, 1234], ...} My question is the following . Is there a way for me to create embeddings of products such that a given product is "close" to the products it is most frequently bought with ? In other words, I want to cluster articles that are bought together in a space and have vectors (embeddings) for each product. Why would I want to do this ? To see if I can see an interesting structure in my data To recommend items to users, I can look for the k-nearest neighbors of the users' latest purchases It looks to me like it is some form of supervised clustering (if that even makes sense), but I can't exactly find how I would go about doing this. If you could point to me towards an algorithm or something I am missing here, please let me know.
