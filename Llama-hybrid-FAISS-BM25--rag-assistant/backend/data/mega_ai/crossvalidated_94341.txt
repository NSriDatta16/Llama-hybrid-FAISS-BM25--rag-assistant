As I understand it, what you are after is semi-supervised learning: you learn a few, previously labelled samples, and then label the remaining unlabelled samples with the help of the trained classifier. There are a number of approaches to this problem. A very popular one are Transductive Support Vector Machines, first introduced in this paper by T. Joachim. It is implemented in SVMlight (which happens to be developed by the author of the previous paper). Another option are manifold learning algorithms like isomap or tSNE, to name just two of them.
