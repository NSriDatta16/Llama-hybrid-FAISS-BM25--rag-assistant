Mediation analysis: interpret a prop. mediated 95% upper CI > 1

I am using the R mediation package. The output of the mediate command is as follows: Causal Mediation Analysis Quasi-Bayesian Confidence Intervals Estimate 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper p-value ACME (control) -0.001633 -0.002128 0.00 As you can see the proportion mediated upper 95% CI interval for the treated group is 2.01. How should I interpret this proportion greater than 1?
