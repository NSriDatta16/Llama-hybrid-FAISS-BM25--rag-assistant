If the groups you want are always separated in blocks, like the paragraphs in your example you can find all occurrences of that block, probably using the newline as the ending item, and then display the first and last numbered matches. Or do you need the actual RegEx to match those blocks? If so, first of all I recommend http://rubular.com/ for testing out RegEx stuff since it is in real time it makes it easier to see how things affect it. Knowing what language are you doing this with or if it is a cli kind of search, i.e. egrep, would help some in the answer.
