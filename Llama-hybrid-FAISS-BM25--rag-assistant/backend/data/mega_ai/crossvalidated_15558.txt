Expectation Maximization is an iterative method used to perform statistical inference on a variety of different generative statistical models, for example a mixture of Gaussians, and other Bayesian network type models. The only connection is that HMMs are also Bayesian networks. But one would probably not use EM on HMMs because there is an exact algorithm for inference within HMMs called the Viterbi algorithm. So although one could use EM to perform inference on a HMM, you wouldn't because there's no reason to.
