ithms was Penn2Malt, which reimplemented previous work on the problem. Work in the dependency-to-constituency conversion direction benefits from the faster runtime of dependency parsing algorithms. One approach is using constrained CKY parsing, ignoring spans which obviously violate the dependency parse's structure and thus reducing runtime to O ( n 2 ) {\displaystyle O(n^{2})} . Another approach is to train a classifier to find an ordering for all the dependents of every token, which results in a structure isomorphic to the constituency parse.
