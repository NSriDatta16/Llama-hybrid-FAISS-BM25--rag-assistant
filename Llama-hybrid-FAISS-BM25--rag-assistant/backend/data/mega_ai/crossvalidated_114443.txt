Random Forest proof notation

I am having a bit of difficulty understanding the notation in equation (1) on page 4 of the following paper: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/35x3v9t4#page-4 Specifically, what do $E_{X,Y}$ and $E_\theta$ mean? It seems like it is a saying the $PE$ of the forest tends toward the $PE$ of a single tree as $k \to \infty$, but that doesn't make sense.
