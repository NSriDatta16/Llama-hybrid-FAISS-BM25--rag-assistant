Have a look at these projects: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/winsdk/SoundRecord.aspx http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/67568/Creating-a-Sound-Recorder-in-C-and-Csharp.aspx http://www.codeproject.com/KB/audio-video/cswavrec.aspx What is the best option if i have to save the audio online in terms of the file occupying storage space. May be real media (.rm). Any particular format that the file should be saved in for optimum output. Not sure but I think that depends on your player. You might also be interested in ffmpeg for converting the media and its c# wrapper library .
