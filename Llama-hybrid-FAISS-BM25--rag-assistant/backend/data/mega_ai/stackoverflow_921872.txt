You haven't described any requirement for fetching or searching fragments of scripts using SQL, so there's no need to decompose the script. So I wouldn't try to store the script cleverly in a database. Instead, just store the whole script in a text BLOB, and treat a script as a single atomic value with respect to the storage of it. Any manipulation you do to the script will be done in your application, so you need a parser. So choose a simple syntax that's easy to parse. I suggest either Python, XML, or your own Domain-Specific Language. FWIW, I have plenty of experience both with databases and with parsers. This isn't a very hard task, it's just completely unnecessary, as far as you've described your project. Bottom line: code is code, and data is data.
