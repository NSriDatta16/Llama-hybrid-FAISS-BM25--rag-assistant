fill-paragraph and auto-fill-mode deliberately don't wrap code. There are just too many ways to do it and it'd probably get it wrong. They will wrap comments, but that doesn't help you here. The only way I've ever done it to to explicitly put the where I want the text to break. Then the auto-indent should put the broken line in the right place. Are you trying to reflow a large body of existing code? Or trying to have auto-fill work on code you are writing now?
