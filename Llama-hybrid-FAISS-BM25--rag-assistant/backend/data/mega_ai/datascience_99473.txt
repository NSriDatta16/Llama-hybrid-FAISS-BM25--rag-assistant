Use clusters as dependent variables

I wanted to ask anyone was aware of a type of two-stage analysis where clusters are used as a dependent variable in prediction models? For example, suppose I had used an unsupervised model based on five categorical covariates, and I generated 3 clusters as a consequence. Is it possible to use a representation of one of these clusters as a dependent variable in another model, to evaluate how well another set of mixed covariates would predict the cluster? Sounds potentially outrageous, but would welcome comments and feedback.
