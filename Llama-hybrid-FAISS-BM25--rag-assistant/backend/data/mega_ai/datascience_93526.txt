How do I split contents in a text that would include two or more different themes (context) in NLP?

For example, a text: "The airlines have affected by Corona since march 2020 a crime has been detected in Noia village this morning" the output should be: The airline companies have affected by Corona since march 2020 a crime has been detected in Noia village this morning the text has no Breaks. I know it is not a one-click solution, but if anyone knows a methodology or techniques to solve such a problem, please provide me with resources.
