VAR model with zero coefficients

ll, I'm working with a bivariate time series $(X_{t},Y_{t})$. Looking at the two time series separately, $X_{t}$ appears to be white noise. This is supported by looking at the empirical ACF and PACF of $X_{t}$ and by performing the Ljung-Box-Test for various lags (very high p-values). My model for $X_{t}$ would therefore be: $$X_{t} = \mu + \epsilon_{t}$$ with $\epsilon_{t} \sim WN(\mu, \sigma_{\epsilon})$. Looking at the empirical ACF and PACF of the other time series $Y_{t}$ I get significant values of both ACF and PACF even for relatively high lags. This could suggest an ARMA model but using AIC and a maximum model order of $p,q = 5$ points to an AR(1) model, like so: $$Y_{t} = \alpha_{1}Y_{t-1}+\epsilon^{y}_{t}$$ Finally, I had a look at the empirical cross-correlation function of $Y_{t}$ and $X_{t}$. It shows a significant value for a lag of $h = -1$, that is a significant correlation between $Y_{t}$ and $X_{t+1}$. It would therefore seem appropriate to account for this by letting $X_{t}$ depend on $Y_{t-1}$, yielding something like $$X_{t} = \mu + \beta_{1}Y_{t-1}+ \epsilon_{t}$$ I'm wondering how I would go about fitting such a model (preferably using R). Would I have to use a package for VAR models and specify the $X_{t-1}$ coefficient for $Y_{t}$ as zero? Thanks!
