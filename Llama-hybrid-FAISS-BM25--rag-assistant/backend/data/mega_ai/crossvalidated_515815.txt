How to report a +/- standard error for logarithmic data?

I have some data $y$ which varies logarithmically which I am fitting with MCMC methods. It makes more sense to do my analysis in the logarithmic space $z = \mathrm{log}(y)$ . As I result, I end up with estimates for my logarithmic data $z$ . This results in e.g. a histogram for $z$ : I can do some statistics on this distribution and get things like the mean and standard deviation. For example, in the histogram above, the mean value of $z$ is $1.11\pm0.06$ where the $\pm$ denotes 1 standard deviation. However, even though the results are logarithmically distributed, it makes more sense to report values in $y$ units. What is the best way to report error in this case?
