In linear regression there exist two other types of equivariance: one about adding a linear function to the response (‘regression equivariance’) and one about multiplying the response by a constant factor (‘y-scale equivariance’), but these obviously do not apply to logistic regression. Page 6 of the following document: http://www.stoch.uni-bayreuth.de/de/CHRISTMANN/Christmann_files/ChristmannRousseeuw_wemel.pdf The paper studies a different type of equivariance (page 6 as well): A property shared by all logistic regression estimators is $x$-affine equivariance.
