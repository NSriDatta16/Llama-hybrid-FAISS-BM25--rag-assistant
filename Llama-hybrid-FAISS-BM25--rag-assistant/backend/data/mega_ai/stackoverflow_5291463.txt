Xcode won't recognize my new provisioning profile

My app's development provisioning profile expired a couple of weeks ago, so I went to the provisioning portal to get a fresh new one. After obtaining it, I visited the Xcode Organizer, removed the expired profile from my devices as well as my Mac, then imported the new profile. Xcode installs the profile onto my devices immediately, and my app runs again on the devices. The problem is that while the Organizer is able to see the new profile and install it as normal, the IDE gets confused between the old one and the new one. Every time I try to build the app, it fails immediately. The error console tells me that Xcode can't find the old profile, because the GUID listed belongs to the old one. That's strange; I thought Xcode would've been aware of the new profile by now. I've tried removing the new profile from my devices and my Mac, then reinstalling the profile. Doesn't work, Xcode is still trying to look for the old one. I've also tried selecting a different profile to make Xcode forget the old one, then selecting the new one. I've even tried manually entering the GUID of the new one in the Other choice. Yet Xcode still insists on looking for the old profile, which by now is already gone from my Mac. How do I convince Xcode that I've generated a new provisioning profile for my app for it to use?
