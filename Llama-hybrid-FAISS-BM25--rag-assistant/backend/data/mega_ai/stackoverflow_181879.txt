If you're wanting to try out a new methodology or something, try making a small application just for you, or perhaps for internal use only. eg: A timesheet application, a task manager, a grocery list organiser, etc. Make sure it's a real problem, so you're forced to deal with real requirements. I've found that if you just play around and try things out, you tend to just ignore certain parts when they don't work immediately.
