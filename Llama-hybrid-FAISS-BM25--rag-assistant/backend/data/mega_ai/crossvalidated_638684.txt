A recurrent Markov Chain implies its k-step version is also recurrent?

I am curious about whether a Markov Chain $X_n$ is recurrent implies that for any $k > 0$ , $X_{kn}$ is also recurrent. Here are my observations. If $X_n$ is transient, $X_{kn}$ must be transient by verifying the definition. In addition, if the state space is finite, $X_n$ and $X_{kn}$ both are positive recurrent. In my understanding, the recurrence means that we can always pick a sequence $\{n_t\}$ s.t. $X_{n_t} = i$ given $X_0 = i$ . However, there is no guarantee that there exists $n_{t_j}$ s.t. $k | n_{t_j}$ . I also did some numerical simulations e.g. 1-D random walk and the result indicates that $X_{kn}$ is also recurrent.
