According to the Pragmatic Programmer book, one of the tips for a good programmer is: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio Make learning a habit. This means that you constantly have to use, or learn about, new technologies. While becoming a master in one particular technology may be rewarding, technologies come and go, today more quickly than ever. A mastery in one particular programming language, tool or API may make you a guru today, but may mean nothing tomorrow. IIRC they also recommended developers to master several technologies, but remain versed in many - at least in the sense of having heard about them, played around with them, being able to engage in a conversation about them. So, I would say yes - specialization is necessary, but this doesn't mean one should ignore domains outside his own.
