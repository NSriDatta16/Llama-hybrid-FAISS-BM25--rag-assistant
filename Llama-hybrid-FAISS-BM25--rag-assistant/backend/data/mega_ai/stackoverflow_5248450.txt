Well this seems right. According to http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/ the .nextUntil selects all the siblings until but not including the element selected by the argument. So if you do .nextUntil('div') you select all the paragraphs (which are siblings to your #test element). If you do .nextUntil('p') nothing gets selected, because a paragraph apprears right after the #test.
