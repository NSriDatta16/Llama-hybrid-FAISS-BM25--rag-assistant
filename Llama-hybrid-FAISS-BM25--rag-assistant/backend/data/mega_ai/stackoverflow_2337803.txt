rotate large table ajax

I have a very large table (that overflows the content div) and because it's dynamic it can contain at least 20 columns. Anyway, the problem is that I'm obliged to put this table in a "tight" div. And, the idea is to avoid the overflow and, to display elegantly all the columns so that it can rotate horizontally (a slide from left to right and possibly with "previous" and "forward" buttons). Is there a ready script to help developping that? Thank you very much, Regards.
