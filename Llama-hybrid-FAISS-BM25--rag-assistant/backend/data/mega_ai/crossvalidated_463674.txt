Can i use Chi-Square or z-test for my hypothesis?

Iâ€™m new to statistics. I'm struggling to find the right hypothesis test. Data description My dataset contains 5000 JIRA tickets. Of each ticket it is known within how many days it is closed. When i plot a histogram of the closure days they are right-skewed. I took 2 random samples: 125 tickets from year 2018 125 tickets from year 2019 Sample mean The mean average time for handling tickets in 2018 = 7.52 days. The mean average time for handling tickets in 2019 = 17.5 days Data converted I also transformed the data into a 2x2 table: YEAR TRUE FALSE 2018 115 10 2019 88 37 TRUE is that the ticket has been processed within the agreed time of 14 days. FALSE is that the ticket has not been processed within the agreed time of 14 days How to test my hypothesis? I want to test a hypothesis if there is a significant difference in the mean or FALSE outcomes between year 2018 and 2019. I thought two tests would be possible: Doing a Chi-Square test for the outcomes TRUE and FALSE from year 2018 and 2019. I also thought it could be an option to compare the average handling time of 2018 and 2019 with a z-test to see if there is a difference. Is it true that I could use both tests? Or should I look at other tests?
