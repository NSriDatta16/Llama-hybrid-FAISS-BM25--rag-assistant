Split text into phrases of a person and an operator

I have about 5,000 texts without punctuation marks. Each text is a conversation between an operator and a person. For example: "Hello hello how can I help you how can I find out how much money I have in my account" How can one separate phrases between a person and an operator using machine learning methods?
