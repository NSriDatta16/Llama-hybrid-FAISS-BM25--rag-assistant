The answer to your question #1 is yes, your solution amounts to data dredging. The answer to your question #2 is yes, there are superior methods in the literature. The central problem with your approach is that you are not addressing the high-dimensional data problem, i.e. problems that arise when $n You are running an analysis that resembles principal components regression, except that you have swapped your independent and dependent variables, resulting in a large multivariate (as opposed to multiple ) regression analysis. Multivariate regression requires that your sample size be larger than the number of dependent variables, a requirement which you are thoroughly violating in your example. If you are truly committed to running PCA on your data and then using multivariate regression, you must use an appropriate method. For example, look into MRCE and related methods [1]. However, despite a few puzzling comments you have made, everything in your analysis as currently presented suggests that your ultimate goal is to identify relationships between a large set of continuous variables (metabo[,-1]) and a single categorical variable (metabo[,1]). PCA is a poor way of accomplishing this. There are two general classes of solutions to this problem in the high-dimensional case: first, solutions that assume sparsity, and solutions that assume a factor structure. Sparsity-based solutions typically assume that only a very small proportion of variables are in fact related to the categorical variable of interest, and attempt to find this small subset; for example see DALASS [2]. Factor-structure-based methods assume that your discriminator variables are manifestations of underlying latent variables with a true relationship to the categorical variable. An example of this class of methods is DLDA [3]. Note that I am not necessarily recommending any methods I have mentioned for your data; you must carefully consider your goals and a priori knowledge of the problem in selecting an appropriate method.
