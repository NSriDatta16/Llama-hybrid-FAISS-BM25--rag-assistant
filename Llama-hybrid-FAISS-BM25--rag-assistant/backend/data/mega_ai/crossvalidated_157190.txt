What is the rationale behind the "eigenvalue > 1" criterion in factor analysis or PCA?

What is the meaning of "eigenvalue > 1" criterion? I understand what eigenvalues and eigenvectors are. This question is w.r.t. this link and this statement there: By default, VARCLUS stops splitting when every cluster has only one eigenvalue greater than one, thus satisfying the most popular criterion for determining the sufficiency of a single underlying dimension. I know it is a criterion for the number of clusters but how can one visualize and understand its meaning? I have gone through this thread on principal component analysis but still do not understand it.
