Is Linear kernel SVM always better than Logistic regression?

We know that linear kernel SVM may give better results than logistic regression since maximizing the margin usually leads to more stable results/better displacement of the decision boundary. But is there any scenario in which a linear kernel SVM performs worse than a logistic regression with respect to test accuracy?
