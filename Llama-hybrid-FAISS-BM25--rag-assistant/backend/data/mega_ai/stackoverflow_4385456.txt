Windows Azure Storage Services is the closest your gonna get if your looking for a NoSQL product by Microsoft It's a cloud thing and Microsoft doesn't have a separate product that you yourself host. Windows Azure Storage Services is however, built on top of MS SQL Server, just not exposed through the normal TDS protocol. That way, they never allow access to the database without NoSQL in mind. That doesn't stop you from treating your typical SQL Server database as if it was NoSQL, and if you did, you should be able to scale really well. The idea of NoSQL is just that you don't do stuff that doesn't scale horizontally.
