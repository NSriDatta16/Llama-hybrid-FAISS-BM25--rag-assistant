As a general rule, always favor smaller storage over extra CPU. Because the driving factor of database performance is always IO and smaller data records means more records per page and this in turn means fewer IO requests. The extra CPU involved in handling the variable length is not going to be a factor. Historically, in the dark ages of '80s and even in the '90s it may have been a measurable factor, but today is just noise. Because the CPU and memory access have increased tremendously, but the IO speed has stayed pretty much constant. That's why 'old books' advice does not apply today. Unless you have a constant field like char(2) or similar, just use varchar, always.
