If you are calling SelectNodes on the XmlDocument itself and it really is an XmlDocument and not a derived class than SelectNodes won't return null. If you create a descendant class and override the CreateNavigator(XmlNode) method then SelectNodes could return null. Similarly, if you call SelectNodes on an EntityReference, DocumentType or XmlDeclaration node, you'll get null as well In short, for 100% coverage on an XmlDocument or XmlNode you didn't just create, you have to test for null.
