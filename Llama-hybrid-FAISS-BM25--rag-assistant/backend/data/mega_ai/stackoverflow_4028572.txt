How to Stop Wasting Time in PHP

As a programmer, I love developing algorithms. I love to take a problem and work out a clean, efficient, readable, elegant solution. I seem to find, however, that the majority of my time is spent validating and cleaning form data, and passing it along to prepare various SQL statements. Perhaps this is "just the way it is" but I suspect I may be doing it wrong. What do you do to avoid the deathtrap of endlessly validating input and building database interactions? Do you use a third-party library? Write your own library? Or is that simply the way it is?
