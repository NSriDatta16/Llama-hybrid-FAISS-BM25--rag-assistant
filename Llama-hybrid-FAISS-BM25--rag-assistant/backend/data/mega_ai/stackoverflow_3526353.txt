Which key-value store has decent twisted API (nonblocking)?

I need a reliable K-V storage to be run in network. Main requirements: Network connectivity has nonblocking twisted API be reliable, production ready. No data loss write performance is more important than read performance support for distributed operation and failover would be great (So I just specify list of nodes) java/ruby/erlang API would also be much appreciated Additional bonus for having auto-increment for Key (PK), so SQL (MySQl? Postgres?) are also considered, do they have twisted drivers?
