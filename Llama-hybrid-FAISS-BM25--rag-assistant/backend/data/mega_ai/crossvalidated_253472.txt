How to represent inputs in a neural network?

I am trying to build and train a neural network to recognize letters of the alphabet and numbers based upon their design using a seven segment display where each segment of the display is one input into the neural network ( I am using the basic prop simulator). I am just a bit unsure about of how to represent the input values in the pattern file. I understand that I need to have the inputs (0-9 and the alphabet A-H) and then the output should be the binary of the ASCII code. I could convert 0-9 to binary but then I am unsure about the letters ( A-H) how would I represent this in the pattern file? Character ASCII Neural Network Output (Binary) 0 48 0110000 1 49 0110001 2 50 0110010 3 51 0110011 4 52 0110100 5 53 0110101 6 54 0110110 7 55 0110111 8 56 0111000 9 57 0111001 A 65 1000001 B 66 1000010 C 67 1000011 D 68 1000100 E 69 1000101 F 70 1000110 H 72 1001000 Thank you for any clarification.
