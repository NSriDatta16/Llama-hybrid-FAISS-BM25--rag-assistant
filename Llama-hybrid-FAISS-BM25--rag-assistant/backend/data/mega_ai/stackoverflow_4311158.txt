Using the Reactive Extensions for .NET combined with F#, you can write a very elegant solution - check out the sample at http://blog.paulbetts.org/index.php/2010/11/16/making-async-io-work-for-you-reactive-style/ (this uses C#, but using F# is easy too; the key is using the Begin/End methods instead of the sync method, which even if you can make it compile, it will block up n ThreadPool threads unnecessarily, instead of the Threadpool just picking up completion routines as they come in)
