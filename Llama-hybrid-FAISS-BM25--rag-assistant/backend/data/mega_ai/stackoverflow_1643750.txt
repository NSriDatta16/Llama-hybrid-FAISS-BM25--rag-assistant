"I have a normal Django site running." Presumably under Apache using mod_wsgi or similar. If you're using mod_wsgi embedded in Apache, note that Apache is multi-threaded and your Python threads are mashed into Apache's threading. Analysis of what's blocking could get icky. If you're using mod_wsgi in daemon mode (which you should be) then your Django is a separate process. Why not continue this design pattern and make your "jabber listener" a separate process. If you'd like this process to be run any any of a number of servers, then have it be started from init.rc or cron . Because it's a separate process it will not compete for attention. Your Django process runs quickly and your Jabber listener runs independently.
