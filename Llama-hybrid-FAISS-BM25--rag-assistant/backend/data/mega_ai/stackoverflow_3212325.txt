First: I would suggest doing some exercises from here first: http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&page=1 It's extremely useful to have some "smart" skills in programming. Spend 2-3 weeks on these kind of problems to understand the basics. You'll meet a lot of projects where it's necessary to "think about the problem" and analyze it deeply rather than drag and drop a control to a form. And some of these problems will open up your mind. Second: Continue with OOP. Start with simple projects where inheritance, polymorphism etc is involved and database basic stuff is required (like: build a library application or an medical tool). Third: Go further with web or desktop programming stuff and start a complex application. (to practice linq, sql server, etc) Happy coding.
