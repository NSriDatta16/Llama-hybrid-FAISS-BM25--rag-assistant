In addition to the previous comments, you may want to consider creating a directory hierarchy for your files. Depending on volume and the particular OS hosting the files, you can easily reach a point where you have an unreasonably large number of files in a single directory. There may be limits on the number of files allowed per folder. If you ever need to do any manual QA or maintenance on your files, this may be problematic (especially if such maintenance is not scripted). I once worked on a project with a high volume of images. We decided to record a subpath in our database in addition to the filename of each file. Our folder names looked like this: a/e/2/f/9 3/3/2/b/7 Essentially, we created folders 5 deep with a single hex value as the folder name. The depth was probably excessive, but effective. I suppose this could have led to us reaching a limit on the number of folders on a volume (not sure if such a limit exists). I would also consider storing a drive in addition to a path (assuming you have a bunch of disks for storage). This way you can move images around and then update your database (assuming you have one) as part of the move.
