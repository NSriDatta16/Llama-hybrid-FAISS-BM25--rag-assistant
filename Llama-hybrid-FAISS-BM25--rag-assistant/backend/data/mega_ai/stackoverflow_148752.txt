Silverlight and Rails

Hopefully this will not spark a religious war... We have a web based app in RoR based on an earlier version we build in .net 2.0. So we currently have both .net and RoR skills in house. We want to add a RIA app that interfaces with the rails web app. This should be capable of running offine, with some (perhaps relational) persistence. Considering our inhouse experience we leaning toward leveraging the sliverlight framework over the likes of Flex etc. Would appreciate any thoughts you might have. Thanks Dominic
