How do you find the population size N based on the highest n values?

For example assume $N$ people performed a selection test like GMAT. Assume the distribution of the scores is a normal distribution (but parameters are not known). If you have a list of the $n$ highest scores (approved people), how do you estimate $N$? Intuitively, it is totally possible to make such an estimation, if $n$ is equal to $N$ then you would expect the distribution of the n scores to be a normal (a few very high scores, a lot of average scores and a few very low scores) if $n\ll N$ then you would expect to see an almost linear increase in the number of scores as you look at the lowest scores (just a few high scores and a lot of low scores, where low here means low in comparison to the other available scores). The motivation is that in my country (Brazil), many times there is a test to get a public job and sometimes they do not publish how many people participated but publish a list of the $n$ people that passed and their scores. I would like to find a way to determine the $N/n$ (candidates per job position).
