Typically it helps interpretation if you code your predictors 0-1, but apart from that (and noting that it is not required), there is nothing wrong with this. There are some other (contingency-table based) approaches, but if I recall correctly, these turn out to be equivalent to (some form of) logistic regression. So in short: I see no reason not to do this.
