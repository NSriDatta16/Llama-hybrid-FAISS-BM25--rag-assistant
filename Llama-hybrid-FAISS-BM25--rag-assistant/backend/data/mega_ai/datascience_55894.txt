What are contexts where a perceptron model could be defined?

per this post , a perceptron could use the logit function as the activation function. per wiki In the context of neural networks, a perceptron is an artificial neuron using the Heaviside step function as the activation function. so, a perceptron does no have to use Heaviside step function as the activation function. besides neural networks, what are other contexts where a perceptron is defined and would use other activation functions.
