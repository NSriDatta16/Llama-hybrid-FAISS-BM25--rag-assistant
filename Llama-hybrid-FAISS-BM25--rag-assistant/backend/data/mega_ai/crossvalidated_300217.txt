Getting started with bayesian structural models using MCMC

I'm trying to learn bayesian structural time series analysis. For a variety of reasons I need to use Python (mostly pymc3 ) not R so please do not suggest the bsts R package. Moreover, I would like to gain a conceptual understanding not use a black box. I've posted a few questions on StackOverflow regarding prediction and seasonality . The SO questions are still open and I didn't want to violate any rules/etiquette by reposting here. However, I'm beginning to think I have a conceptual misunderstanding. Can anyone recommend online tutorials or lectures for exploring Bayesian structural models using MCMC preferably in Python?
