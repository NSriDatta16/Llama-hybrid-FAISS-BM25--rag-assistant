Extract training data predictions from rpart

I'm wondering if there is any method to extract the class assignment of each sample in an rpart model from the training data? E.g. in R using random forest to get the predicted class of each sample (from the training data), you can use: data(iris) rf.iris As far as I can tell there is no way to do this for an rpart model. I could re-predict my training data using the rpart model but for obvious reasons I don't want to do this. Is it possible to extract the individual sample classifications?
