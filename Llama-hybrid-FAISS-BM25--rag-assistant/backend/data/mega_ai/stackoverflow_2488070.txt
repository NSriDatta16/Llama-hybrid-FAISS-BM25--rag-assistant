To refresh the parent on every repositioning of self , you could add self.parent.Refresh() right after your existing call to self.SetPosition in your def onMouseMove method. Right now you're refreshing the frame only in the def onDraggingDown method, i.e., the first time the mouse left button is clicked and held down, not every time the mouse is moved while said button is held down (i.e., the "dragging" action itself). I was unable to download your code for testing purposes, due to the rather "spammy peculiar" site you chose to upload it to -- the site keeps bombarding me with ads, no clear way for me to just do the download, occasionally complaining that it doesn't support my machine (I use a Mac and Google Chrome, the site at some spots insists on Windows with IE or Firefox...), etc etc. I'm sure you can find other sites, more usable than that one, for people who are trying to help you out!-)
