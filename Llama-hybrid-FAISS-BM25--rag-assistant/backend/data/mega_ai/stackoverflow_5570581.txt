How could I modify the ssh_config file on a linux host with perl?

I have a interesting problem, my script uses ssh to access my vmware server in order to pull data from it. I have discovered that if the machine running the script has never connected to the server the script will fail to run because the question asking if the host I am connected to should be added to my known hosts file. Based on reading some forums and such and people having a similar issue I came up with an idea. I wanted to modify the ssh_config file on the "script host" to exclude known host checking for the host that specified in the config file. This would be done by the config script I have made that ask you various questions that generate the xml config file. Now for the problem... I need modify the config file, I was thinking the easiest would be slurp the file into perl and manipulate it. Slurping I have done before but according to what I have read the directive for disabling certain ssh options on a perticular host has to go before the global options directive. How can I insert text in between 2 blocks of text in the current file? This is what my ssh_config looks like # This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file. See # ssh_config(5) for more information. This file provides defaults for # users, and the values can be changed in per-user configuration files # or on the command line. # Configuration data is parsed as follows: # 1. command line options # 2. user-specific file # 3. system-wide file # Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set. # Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the # configuration file, and defaults at the end. # Site-wide defaults for some commonly used options. For a comprehensive # list of available options, their meanings and defaults, please see the # ssh_config(5) man page. **--This is what my modification need to go--** Host * # ForwardAgent no # ForwardX11 no # ForwardX11Trusted yes # RhostsRSAAuthentication no # RSAAuthentication yes # PasswordAuthentication yes # HostbasedAuthentication no # GSSAPIAuthentication no # GSSAPIDelegateCredentials no # GSSAPIKeyExchange no # GSSAPITrustDNS no # BatchMode no # CheckHostIP yes # AddressFamily any # ConnectTimeout 0 # StrictHostKeyChecking ask # IdentityFile ~/.ssh/identity # IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa # IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa # Port 22 # Protocol 2,1 # Cipher 3des # Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour128,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc # MACs hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,umac-64@openssh.com,hmac-ripemd160
