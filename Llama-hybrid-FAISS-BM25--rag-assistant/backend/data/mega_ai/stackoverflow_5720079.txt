When to use framework in Objective C development

Not many libraries such as GHUnit suggest you to use them as a Framework. While most libraries such as Facebook iOS SDK just require you to drag the project into existing XCode project. So when you are building a library which suppose to be re-use by other project in the future, should you use Framework or just like many current opensource projects, don't use Framework provided by XCode.
