How to test for statistical independence on non-stationary time series?

I have multiple time series on which I want to identify statistically significant (if any) trends. To that end, I started by conducting the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test to identify which series are not stationary (thus implying an underlying trend): Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (p-value): #0: 0.7400121258386816 -> (not stationary) #1: 0.003756531421338549 -> (stationary) #2: 0.8356431503570756 -> (not stationary) #3: 1.2618571533446908e-07 -> (stationary) In order to identify relevant monotonic trends, I want to conduct the Mann-Kendall test, but I need to ensure that samples are independent and not serially correlated . ACF/PACF analysis on the time series suggest/are influenced by trends, and therefore require de-trending transformations to achieve stationarity: However, I'm struggling on 1) how to detrend non-stationarity series - using gradient vs difference; It should be noted I'm not trying to model the trend at this stage (as I'm not yet sure a trend exists) and can't perform correlation analysis on the residuals without making assumptions on an underlying model. Additionally, I'm unsure about 2) which analysis tool to use : ACF, PACF or the Ljung-Box test? I am getting very different results with each: Ljung-Box Test (p-value): org_#0 grad_#0 diff_#0 org_#1 grad_#1 diff_#1 org_#2 grad_#2 diff_#2 org_#3 grad_#3 diff_#3 1 5.832414e-06 0.652845 0.130720 0.023136 0.649813 0.000918 6.256156e-05 0.692498 0.036099 0.574666 0.882558 0.001247 2 2.251164e-08 0.005893 0.030928 0.004227 0.027847 0.003637 1.582695e-06 0.003751 0.056359 0.825435 0.090845 0.004315 3 1.014388e-10 0.012420 0.038536 0.001468 0.035400 0.010453 8.091142e-08 0.008257 0.123269 0.895700 0.187108 0.012288 4 2.102519e-12 0.011219 0.049601 0.001637 0.072348 0.022559 6.321557e-09 0.018818 0.215027 0.789189 0.262034 0.021165 5 2.409707e-13 0.005992 0.051696 0.002315 0.109543 0.032003 6.076601e-10 0.026010 0.273688 0.854404 0.367491 0.028546 6 5.651045e-14 0.004371 0.040586 0.002245 0.151084 0.044142 4.085782e-11 0.015675 0.061854 0.918215 0.313839 0.044380 7 2.305528e-14 0.002721 0.022965 0.003423 0.167607 0.073019 4.044796e-11 0.020773 0.040071 0.914727 0.420027 0.026616 8 2.235907e-14 0.003622 0.036035 0.006228 0.218115 0.109756 4.466094e-11 0.028620 0.063734 0.439324 0.164661 0.003724 9 5.095045e-14 0.004166 0.034175 0.010811 0.238909 0.159675 7.262066e-11 0.039198 0.076998 0.540013 0.226233 0.002383 10 1.516367e-13 0.004739 0.051209 0.011125 0.248227 0.155707 2.031204e-10 0.040187 0.106888 0.452840 0.289605 0.003102 Ljung-Box Test (statistical significance, pvalue For context, each sample in original time series is a metric computed from a segment of a longer series of repetitive/periodic electrical measurements, therefore I don't expect any correlation to occur as each value should be independent (no overlap between consecutive segments). Nevertheless, I'm seeing some unexpected serial correlation among the samples even after de-trending, thefore I'm not sure if I can use the MK test here. What would be the best approach?
