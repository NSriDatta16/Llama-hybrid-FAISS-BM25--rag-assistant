The jQuery UI accordion uses CSS generated by ThemeRoller . You can even further customize the CSS produced by ThemeRoller. As to your problem, I suspect it's an issue with jQuery simulating the event (it's Microsoft proprietary). The example on the jQuery site uses DIVs and paragraphs and it seems to work as advertised. You might want to try stopping the propagation of the "hover" event to see if that prevents the mouseout on the child from triggering mouseleave on the parent. EDIT : I just noticed that your hover method only has one callback. I believe it takes two, and you need to stop propagation in both. The following seems to do the trick but to make it work (since leaving the anchor on either end has the event block) I had to wrap the whole thing in a DIV with padding 5 and attach the mouseleave event to it. $(function() { $("#mainnav > li > a").hover( mouseOver, mouseOut ); $("#navContainer").mouseleave(function() { alert("mouseleave #mainnav"); }); }); function mouseOver(e) { $(this).next("ul").slideDown("fast", function() { $("li:has(ul) > a", this).hover(mouseOver, mouseOut); }); e.stopPropagation(); } function mouseOut(e) { e.stopPropagation(); } ... your list ...
