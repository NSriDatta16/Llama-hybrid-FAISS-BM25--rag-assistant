How can I ascertain the relationship between two variables with low sample-sizes?

So I have this issue. I'm working on investigating the changes in the blood as a certain disease affects the organism. I have two different variables measured on control(healthy) and infected model organism: M, E: measurement of M gives: measurement of E gives: How can I show that there is a correlation between the changes in E and M as the healthy organism becomes ill? Or maybe evaluate the statistical significance of supposing that the change in E can explain the change in M?
