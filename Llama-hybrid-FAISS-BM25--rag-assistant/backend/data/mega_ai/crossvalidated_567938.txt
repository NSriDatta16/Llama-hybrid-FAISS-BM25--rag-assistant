How to interpret a logistic regression model with negative coefficients of varying magnitudes and odds ratios <1?

I'm doing logistic regression where X has four factors (1-4) and Y has two factors (0-1). I did: model=glm(formula=y~x,family=binomial(link=logit),data=data) #x=='1' is reference level summary(model) I get: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.6740 0.3632 -4.608 4.06e-06 *** 2 -1.0916 0.5000 -2.183 0.029 * 3 -1.9369 1.0766 -1.799 0.072 . 4 -16.8921 1058.1118 -0.016 0.987 Then for my odds ratios, I get: ORs 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) 0.19 0.09 3.600000e-01 2 0.34 0.12 9.100000e-01 3 0.14 0.01 8.200000e-01 4 0.00 NA 1.057042e+21 I'm most interested in variable 2 and I'm confused how I would interpret its odds ratio. I would think that an OR would mean a lesser likelihood of outcome Y=1 , but seeing how the log-likelihood coefficient for the intercept/variable 1 is less than variable 2. I'm confused if the OR for var2 would still be considered 'lower' than var1. Any help is really appreciated. Thank you!
