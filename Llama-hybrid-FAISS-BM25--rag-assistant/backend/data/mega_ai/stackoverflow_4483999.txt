What's the best way to display a bunch of images from a web server in Android?

I need to load several thumbnails (the images on the server are full sized images, so I need to resize them in the app), and display them in a way that allows for the user to click on one (or more) and have some associated id be given back to the app for use in a larger context. so, in pseudo code... ImageObjArray ioa = loadImagesFromServer("http://server/listOfImages.php");// this returns for(ImageObj io : ioa){ drawThumbnail(io); //io contains both a jpg and a reference id } //later when a user clicks on a thumbnail clickHandler(){ passIdToBundle(this.refId); } So, I've never played with a webview before but I suspect it might be the best approach here, though I don't know how easy it is to send info back out of a webview to the larger app when the user clicks on a thumbnail. Or is there a more elegant approach? All advice welcome.
