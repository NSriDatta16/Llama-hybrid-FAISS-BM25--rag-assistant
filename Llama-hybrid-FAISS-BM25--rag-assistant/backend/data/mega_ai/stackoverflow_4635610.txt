Specify command path with dragonfly gem

I keep getting an error when i try to upload an Image with dragonfly. I know what the problem is because I solved it when I was using paperclip. But I don't know how to solve it for dragonfly. The problem is that dragonfly is executing the command "identify" and it's looking for the binary on "/usr/local" but instead it's on "/opt/local" in Paperclip, I would easily solve this with. Paperclip.options[:command_path] = "/opt/local/bin/" Anyone knows the equivalent command for dragonfly? I'm using rails 3 btw.
