IMHO you should first create a method that returns a Double from a String, embedding the null and parsing failure cases (but you must define what to do in such cases : throw an exception ? return a default value ??). Then your comparator just have to compare obtained Double instances. In other words, refactoring... But I still wonder why you need to compare strings though expecting they represent doubles. I mean, what prevents you from manipulating doubles in the code that would actually use this comparator ?
