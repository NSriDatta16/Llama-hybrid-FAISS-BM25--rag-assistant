If you want to use neural networks this post on Kaggle might help: https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/discussion/159052 It has a short list of resources for categorical embeddings and LSTM (I think). If you think your dataset has periodic patterns, and you only need to answer your questions (not deploy a model). I would take a look a FB Prophet: https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api It extracts the periodic components and fits them with sine and cosine waves. You can also add additional regressors, i.e., one-hot encoded categorical variables.
