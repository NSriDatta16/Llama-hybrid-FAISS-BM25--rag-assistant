I think you will find that this isn't possible with the YouTube API (I may be incorrect here), but I have been unable to find anything of the sort on the internet. Also, everything I found which related to YouTube play-list embedding required you to login beforehand. Update: I found this: http://www.php-help.ro/mootools-12-javascript-examples/youtube-player-embed-with-attached-playlist/ Which uses MooTools to grab a playlist for a certain user. Hope that helps! And the demo: http://php-help.ro/examples/youtube_player_mootools/
