PRISM navigation without RegionManager, only MEF

We are planning on developing a framework using MEF as the base an pulling in bits of Prism as required. One of the target assets from prism is the navigation. Can this, however be used with RagionManager ? We don't want to use RegionManager as it seems like a bit of overkill. Ours is mostly a workflow type application and does not require complex ui composition, which is the primary purpose of regionmanager
