13 data points is extremely little. There is a very rough rule of thumb that you need 20 data points per parameter to be estimated, so you just have enough for an intercept term. Also, you really don't have enough data to do holdout testing - if you hold out, say, the last three data points, then you only have ten points to fit your model to, and how much would you want to rely on a holdout set of just three points? By all means, try including regressors you believe might drive your time series. (Remember that you need to forecast future values of your regressors, too - this adds additional uncertainty!) Per above, I would not expect this to be very helpful. Best method for short time-series may be useful.
