Immediate Window automatic cleaning in Visual Studio

I have a question about debugging in Visual Studio. Is it possible to clear the Immediate Window in Visual Studio automatically before each startup of a debugged application? The >cls command and Context Menu->Clear All are useful, but they are not automatic and require personal attention each time I run the application. Again, System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print()|Write*() methods can only write messages to the Immediate Window, so >cls is not applicable. Is there any solution for the problem? (Currently I use VS 2008) Thank you for suggestions.
