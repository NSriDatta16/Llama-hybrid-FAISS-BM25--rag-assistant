How can CruiseControl.Net fail a build based on changing metrics?

I would like CruiseControl.Net to fail a build when some code metrics change in a 'wrong' direction, i.e. code coverage decreases or Gendarme defect count increases. The Gendarme metrics are already tracked in report.xml file (because they are presented on web dashboard graphs), the code coverage is only reported on build status page (and saved in build report xml). How can I achieve this?
