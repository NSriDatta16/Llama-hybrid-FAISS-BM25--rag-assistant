Censored Logistic Regression?

I'm trying to run a logistic regression with a dependent variable $y \in \{0,1\}$ and one independent variable $x$. I'm trying to find the coefficient $\beta$ in the equation $Prob(y=1)=\frac{e^{\beta x}}{1+e^{\beta x}}.$ My data is given by $(y_1,x_1),...(y_n,x_n)$. If $y_i = 1$, then I get to see $x_i$. However, if $y_i=0$, then $x_i$ is unobserved. Only the fact that $y_i = 0$ is known about observation $i$. Is there a way of recovering an unbiased and consistent estimator $\hat{\beta}$ of $\beta$?
