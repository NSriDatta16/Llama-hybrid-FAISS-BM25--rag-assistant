How to set a property by calling a method

I'd like to know how to set a custom property of a custom user control by calling a method that would serve as "data provider" for that property. What I mean is I'd like to write something like this: , where CatsUserControl is a User Control I created (which has a Property named Cats ), and FindAllCats() is a method written in C# that returns a list of Cat objects. Is this possible? I appreciate any ideas. Thanks! EDIT: The whole thing began because I wanted to be able to assign a list to a property in XAML, the same way you do (except, in my case, Value is a more complex type than a string, it's a List > ). Because I didn't find any way to do that, I thought it might be possible to call a method that returns this list and assign the returned value to the property instead. Hope that makes things clearer.
