pooled ols seems better

I would like to determine the relationship between r&d expenses and capital structure using the data of 12 industrial companies for 10 years. Running the pooled ols,it showed that 4 of my 5 independent variables are significant, random effects model says only 2 independent variable are significant, while fixed effects says 1 independent variable is significant. The pooled ols model is homoscedastic, shows no autocorrelation, and has no multicollinearity according to tests I have conducted. While the fixed effects and random effects have problems of autocorrrelation and homoscedasticity. The results of Hausman test, Breusch Pagan LM, and F-Test tells me to use the fixed effects. But I think the pooled ols model is better. How can I justify the use of the pooled ols model.Is there any way for me to use the pooled ols because the results are in line with my related literature and explains the relationship between r&d expenses and capital structure.
