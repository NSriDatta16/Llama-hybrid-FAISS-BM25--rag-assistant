You didn't specified all the requirements, but (normally) you cannot do this in an Web app because: You need access rights (ok, possible but...) You need speed The data is changing during the copy? If yes, then how? If the files are added / deleted then you need to register a watcher on drive (which means a concrete platform-specific API callback - very unlikely to be available in any Web language - Java, PHP etc.) to see what files needs to be copied after you scanned already the place in which the new file is added / deleted. If the files can be "anything" and are modified "randomly" during the copy process then you're in trouble. Because you can copy a file which is in an inconsistent state. This case is rare but it can happen. Especially if you want to mirror some kind of special HDD (eg. the main drive - the drive with the OS on it). Also, there are other tricks involved when the files are changing on the source disk (different applications have different storage engines which have different patterns on saving a file). If the disks are 'frozen' then you're ok. You can do a simple file copy (but also beware if you need to copy the file attributes, file streams etc.). But if not, I'd advise you to buy a ready made application for this task like this one .
