If the observations are true 0 values rather than missing, then they should be included in the model as 0 values. Otherwise you would bias your estimates upward. Although a Poisson model is commonly used for counts, you might need to consider a zero-inflated Poisson, quasi-Poisson, or negative binomial model to deal with over-dispersion. Pay attention to that possibility as you proceed with your analysis.
