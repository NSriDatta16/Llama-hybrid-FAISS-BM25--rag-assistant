Microsoft alternative to Jabber?

My organization is considering using Jabber as an agnostic device to device to application messaging protocol. Does anyone know of the best practice existing Microsoft competitor to Jabber? Or, an emerging competitor? And, if so, a good URL reference to get a jump start? Website for Jabber: http://www.jabber.org/web/Main_Page
