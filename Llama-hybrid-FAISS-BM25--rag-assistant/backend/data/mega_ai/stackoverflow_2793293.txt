How do I create a new thread to make pcap_loop() and gtk_main() compatible?

These two functions are both infinite loops, and the programe hangs once called in the same thread. gtk_main(); ... pcap_loop(adhandle, 0, packet_handler, NULL); When I click the "start" button,I want pcap to start working;And if I press the "stop" button, pcap stop . How do I create a child thread and run pcap_loop(adhandle, 0, packet_handler, NULL); instead?
