Below are four different interpretations using the coin toss example that was provided in the original question. Option 1 a) appears to be the appropriate interpretation under the Bayesian paradigm. If you find one of these that maps to your answer, please identify it and offer suggestions for improvement if needed. Option 1: Probability statements about $X$ and probability statements about $\theta$ are both statements of personal belief. a) $\theta$ is the limiting proportion of heads as the number of flips tends to infinity for the coin under investigation, an unknown fixed constant with value $c$ and is not a probability. The only valid probability is my belief about any given flip, which I set equal to this unknown fixed constant. Therefore, $P\{X=1|\theta=c\}=c$ is my personal belief about the coin landing heads in any given throw if I know this limiting proportion. Since I do not know what to believe, $\pi(\theta)$ is my belief about the limiting proportion (not my belief about the probability of heads). If I were to integrate the data pmf using the prior distribution I would get the prior predictive distribution. Then $P\{X=1\}=\frac{a}{a+b}$ where $\frac{a}{a+b}$ is a "known" constant. In a different sense this would be my belief about the coin landing heads when not knowing the limiting proportion. The posterior is my belief about the limiting proportion given the observed data. Nevertheless, the prior and posterior probabilities do not represent factual statements about the limiting proportion of heads for the coin under investigation, nor are they statements about the experiment. Option 1 a) amounts to Option 2 b) since this is how the posterior is operationalized in practice using Monte Carlo simulations. b) $c$ is the limiting proportion of heads as the number of flips tends to infinity for the coin under investigation, an unknown fixed constant and not a probability. The only valid probability is my belief about any given flip, which I set equal to this unknown fixed constant. Therefore $\theta=c$ , and equivalently $P\{X=1|\theta=c\}=c$ , is my personal belief about the coin landing heads in any given throw if I know this limiting proportion. Since I do not know what to believe, $\pi(\theta)$ is my belief… about my belief. If I were to integrate the data pmf using the prior distribution I would get the prior predictive distribution. Then $P\{X=1\}=\frac{a}{a+b}$ where $\frac{a}{a+b}$ is a "known" constant. In a different sense this would also be my belief about my belief. This option has us applying a belief probability measure to a belief probability measure. Similarly for $\pi(\theta|\boldsymbol{x})$ and $P\{X=1|\boldsymbol{x}\}$ . However, because of my original correspondence we can interpret prior and posterior probabilities as beliefs about the limiting proportion of heads for the coin under investigation . Nevertheless, these prior and posterior probabilities do not represent factual statements about the limiting proportion of heads for the coin under investigation, nor are they statements about the experiment. Option 1 b) amounts to Option 2 b) since this is how the posterior is operationalized in practice using Monte Carlo simulations. Option 2: Probability statements about $X$ and probability statements about $\theta$ both have a frequentist interpretation. a) $\theta=c$ , and equivalently $P\{X=1|\theta=c\}=c$ , is the limiting proportion of heads as the number of flips tends to infinity for the coin under investigation, an unknown fixed constant. The density $\pi(\theta)$ depicts a collection of $\theta$ ’s (coins) or the limiting proportions of randomly selected $\theta$ ’s (coins) as the number of draws from $\pi(\theta)$ tends to infinity. These probabilities are considered known constants. The unknown true $\theta=c$ under investigation was randomly selected from the known collection or prevalence of $\theta$ ’s according to $\pi(\theta)$ , and the observed data is used to subset this collection forming the posterior. If we are to apply these posterior probability statements to make inference on the unknown true $\theta$ (coin) under investigation we have to change our sampling frame. We must imagine instead that the unknown true $\theta$ was instead randomly selected from the posterior. This, then, has cause and effect reversed since the posterior distribution, from which we selected $\theta$ , depends on the data… but the data depended on the $\theta$ we had not yet selected from the posterior. We could imagine drawing a new $\theta$ (coin) from the posterior, but this would not be the same $\theta=c$ we started with under investigation. The challenge here is applying the probability statement in the posterior distribution to the unknown true $\theta$ (coin) under investigation in a meaningful way. b) $\theta=c$ , and equivalently $P\{X=1|\theta=c\}=c$ , is the limiting proportion of heads as the number of flips tends to infinity for the coin under investigation, an unknown fixed constant. The density $\pi(\theta)$ depicts a collection of other $\theta$ ’s (coins) I have given to myself or the limiting proportions of randomly selected $\theta$ ’s (coins) as the number of draws from $\pi(\theta)$ tends to infinity. These probabilities are considered known constants. The observed data is used to subset this collection forming the posterior. The posterior is a legitimate sampling distribution of $\theta$ 's (coins) I have given myself. The challenge here is applying the probability statements in the posterior distribution to the unknown true $\theta$ (coin) under investigation in a meaningful way since at no point was the true $\theta$ (coin) sampled from the posterior. Option 3: Probability statements about $X$ have a frequentist interpretation and probability statements about $\theta$ represent personal belief. $\theta=c$ , and equivalently $P\{X=1|\theta=c\}=c$ , is the limiting proportion of heads as the number of flips tends to infinity for the coin under investigation. Since I do not know this limiting proportion, $\pi(\theta)$ is my personal belief about this unknown fixed quantity. On the surface this seems the most reasonable. However, this would have Bayes theorem blending two different interpretations of probability as if they are compatible or equivalent, and it does not provide a clear link between posterior probability and the unknown fixed true $\theta$ under investigation. This would mean we are dealing with Option 1 or Option 2. Even if one insists on two different yet compatible interpretations of probability, Option 3 amounts to Option 2 b) since this is how the posterior is operationalized in practice using Monte Carlo simulations. Option 4: Probability statements about $X$ have a frequentist interpretation and there are no probability statements about $\theta$ . $\theta=c$ , and equivalently $P\{X=1|\theta=c\}=c$ , is the limiting proportion of heads for the coin under investigation. The reason Bayesian statistics can provide reasonable point and interval estimates despite the shortcomings above regarding interpretation is that at the core of every prior is a likelihood. Something was witnessed or observed that gave rise to a likelihood, and therefore the prior. There are in fact no probability statements about $\theta$ , belief, long-run, or otherwise. Bayes theorem amounts to multiplying independent likelihoods equivalent to a fixed effect meta-analysis , except the Bayesian normalizes the joint likelihood instead of inverting a hypothesis test. If we view the Bayesian inference machine as a frequentist meta-analytic testing procedure the shortcomings above vanish. The posterior is an asymptotic confidence distribution . Bayesian belief is more objectively viewed as confidence based on frequency probability of the experiment.
