One common way to do steganography: Think about a 1024 x 768, 24-bit color (i.e. 8 bits of red, 8 bits of yellow, 8 bits of blue) image. Now, the least-significant bit of the colors in the image doesn't matter much. Therefore, one can hide three bits of information in each pixel. That makes for 1024 * 768 * 3 / 8, or 294,912 bytes of information that can be hidden in a large image without degrading the image much.
