Strictly speaking a self-closing makes no sense, as should be used to contain a paragraph, i.e. the paragraph should be encased by and . however is a "lower level" tag that indicates a line break. So the semantically correct way to indicate paragraphs would be to use : This Foo is used to frobincate a {@link Baz}. It is quite groovy! vs. This Foo is used to frobincate a {@link Baz}. It is quite groovy! Visually the results in more whitespace between the lines, while a will just start a new line and not introduce any major whitespace.
