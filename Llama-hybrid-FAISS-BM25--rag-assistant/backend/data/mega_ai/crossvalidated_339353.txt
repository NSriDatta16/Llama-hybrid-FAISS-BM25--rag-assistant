As far as my knowledge goes, your dependent variable should be the thing you're trying to predict. Setting a clear objective to your model will help you determine this. Since your project is about horse races, I'm assuming the objective of your model is to determine the winning horse for each race. In that case, your assumption is correct, the finish position variable would be your dependent. And considering your dependent variable is organized in a binary form (0 or 1's), you should also use the logistic regression for the best results.
