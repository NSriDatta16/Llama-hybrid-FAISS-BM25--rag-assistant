The degrees of freedom to use are $n-p$ (where $n$ is the number of data points, and $p$ the number of parameters), it relates to the distribution of the residuals which is used to estimate the distribution of the errors. There are several questions that deal with this. Why are the residuals in $\mathbb{R}^{n-p}$? Why divide by $n-2$ for residual standard errors Also note that the problem of 'the distribution of the slope' might be more complicated when you consider Multiple variables like : why does the same variable have a different slope when incorporated into a linear model with multiple x variables Correlations in the distribution of errors. (there are several ways how this can happen, an example is in time series: Why do these time series appear to be dependent?
