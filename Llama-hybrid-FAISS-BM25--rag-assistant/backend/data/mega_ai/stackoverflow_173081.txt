You should take a look at Tele-Support HelpDesk . It has a known issues database that now allows attachments that you can use for your projects. The priority system allows color coding, and it has an extensive filtering system. You can even attach "contacts" to each known issue to give you a quick method of contacting the person for whom the project is for. While there is no integration with the shell the way you mention, links can be added to a known issue or inquiry using a simple drag/drop procedure.
