I would suggest you don't worry about it. It's not really a good use of time to optimize down at this level, since any decent compiler will minimize the amount of the local storage required. The stack is reusable, thousands of calls won't matter because the memory is only required for the context where it is used and will not be relevant beyond that. If it is really necessary for you to be concerned about a few bytes of temporary storage on the stack, you should probably be working in assembly. I doubt this is the case, so don't sweat it and spend your time on other more interesting and important issues!
