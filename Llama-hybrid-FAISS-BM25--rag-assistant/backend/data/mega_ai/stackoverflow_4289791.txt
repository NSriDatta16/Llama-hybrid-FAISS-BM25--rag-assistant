VS2008 Not Automatically Creating Style Class For Absolute-Positioned Elements

In www.asp.net tutorials #4 "Page Layout", Joe Stagner changes positioning of elements to Absolute and drags them to a new location. Visual Studio renders this in HTML with a new CSS class in a new section. When I duplicate the steps, I get inline CSS style instead, in the form of There is no "style1" class created, and in fact no style element created either. In VSTS 2008 Tools|Options|Html Designer|CSS, all 6 choices are "CSS(classes)", and in Tools|Options|Html Designer|CSS Styling, "auto style application" is selected, as well as 1st, 4th, and 5th options checked. How do I tell Visual Studio 2008 to generate style classes, rather than inline styles?
