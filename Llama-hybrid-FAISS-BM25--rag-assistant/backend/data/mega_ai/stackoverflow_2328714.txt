Simple Linq question: How to create query with logic operators

Just began to develop using LINQ, and still can't understand some simple things. So, LinqTable.SingleOrDefault(t=>(t.Field1=="value1")) is equal to SQL "SELECT * FROM LinqTable WHERE Field1="value1" LIMIT 1" How to create (using Linq) the query like "SELECT * FROM LinqTable WHERE Field1="value1" AND Field2="value2" LIMIT 1?
