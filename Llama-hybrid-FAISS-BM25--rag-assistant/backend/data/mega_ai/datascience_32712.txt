Taking your comment: Well I don't want to use pca..It's just a 2 dimensional data..So I thought of some manual feature extraction Something really simple you can do is just to use $y$ directly. It looks like $y \gtrapprox 23$ does a pretty good job separating the the red and green groups in the scatterplot. One could generalize this approach to other pairings of variables $(i,j)$ by fitting decision trees with a depth of 1, yielding the best single variable split to separate the two groups for each pair. These rules can be used to select a single variable to use, $i$ or $j$, or a binary variable/flag to make, such as the $y \gtrapprox 23$ suggestion above.
