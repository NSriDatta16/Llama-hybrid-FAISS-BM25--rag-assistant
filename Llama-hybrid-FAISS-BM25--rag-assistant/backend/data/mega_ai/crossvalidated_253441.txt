If reasonable, one can make the assumption that the data is missing at random or missing completely at random . If so, then for example Expectation Maximization or Variational Bayes can be used to maximize the likelihood and assess parameters. There is great collection of literature on Mike Tipping's website on the topic of sparse Bayesian modeling and the "relevance vector machine" principle. I think a good reference for your question is David Barber's book on Bayesian Reasoning . It has lots of examples that might help.
