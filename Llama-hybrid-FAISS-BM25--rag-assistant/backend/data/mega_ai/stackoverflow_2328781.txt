end tag for "param" omitted In HTML-compatible-XHTML, elements that are always empty, like and must use the self-closing syntax: (note the / . Same for all other param â€‹s.) cannot generate system identifier for general entity "color" [and the other errors] You forget to encode the & character before color=... in the URL. It should be &amp;color=... . Additionally, the old-school element is undefined in both HTML4 and XHTML1, so it won't validate anyway. See this question for some discussion on Flash embedding methods.
