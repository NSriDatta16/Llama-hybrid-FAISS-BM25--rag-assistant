Is decision threshold a hyperparameter in logistic regression?

Predicted classes from (binary) logistic regression are determined by using a threshold on the class membership probabilities generated by the model. As I understand it, typically 0.5 is used by default. But varying the threshold will change the predicted classifications. Does this mean the threshold is a hyperparameter? If so, why is it (for example) not possible to easily search over a grid of thresholds using scikit-learn's GridSearchCV method (as you would do for the regularisation parameter C ).
