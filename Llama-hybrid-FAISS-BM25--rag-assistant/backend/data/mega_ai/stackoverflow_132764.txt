How do I - in ASP.NET save the info from a page when a user leaves the page?

In our CMS, we have a place in which we enable users to play around with their site hierarchy - move pages around, add and remove pages, etc. We use drag & drop to implement moving pages around. Each move has to saved in th DB, and exported to many HTML files. If we do that in every move, it will slow down the users. Therefore we thought that it's preferable to let the users play around as much as they want, saving each change to the DB, but only when they leave the page - to export their changes to the HTML files. We thought of making the user click a "publish" button when they're ready to commit their changes, but we're afraid users won't remember to do that, because from their stand point once they've moved a page to a new place - the action is done. Another problem with the button is that it's inconsistent with the behavior of the other parts of the site (for example, when a user moves a text inside a page, the changes are saved automatically, as there is only 1 HTML file to update) So how can we automatically save user changes on leaving the page?
