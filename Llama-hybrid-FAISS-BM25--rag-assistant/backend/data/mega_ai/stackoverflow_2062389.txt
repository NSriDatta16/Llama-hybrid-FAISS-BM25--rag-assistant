Setting a variable like this $config['business']

I was looking at some source code, specifically for Paypal IPN, and I noticed the author sets two variables in this format: $config['business'] and $config['different_text'] Is there a special reason other than the obvious organization for declaring my variables this way or is this Paypal settings?
