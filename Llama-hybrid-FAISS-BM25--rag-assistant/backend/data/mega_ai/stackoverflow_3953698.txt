The collections and referenced entities are not available on the entity construction, so no partial methods or overrides are available for collections or referenced objects. But... You can simply add your partial class a Getter that will return or initiate your business logic when called as the entity is fully loaded then, and everything could be referneced as usual : public partial class Organization { .. .. public bool IsIsoCertified { get { return CheckIsoCert(); } } private bool CheckIsoCert() { return this.CertCollection.Contains(Certifications.IsoCertification); } .. ..
