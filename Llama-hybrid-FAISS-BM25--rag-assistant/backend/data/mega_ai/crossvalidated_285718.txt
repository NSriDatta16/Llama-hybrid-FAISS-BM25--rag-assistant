Seasonal Decomposition

I am having a time series which shows some kind of periodic behavior looking at the plot. In order to get this seasonal component I am using the rolling mean and use seasonal_decompose of the statsmodels Python library. sig = df_sensors['S1'].rolling(window=100).mean()[2000:4000].values decomposed = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(sig, freq=4) As you can see, I am assuming a frequency ( freq ) of the series of 4 Hz. I am doing this because the FFT of the original data of df_sensors['S1'] shows the following: So it appears that there are 2 major components. One which is at ~4 Hz and another which is at ~ 175 Hz. Plotting the result of the decomposition: decomposed.plot() shows the following: As you can see, it is not able to find the actual seasonal part of the signal. You can also see rather long seasons of 4 Hz and the rather fast seasons of 175 Hz in the original signal. I would like to understand why there was not seasonal component extracted. To the naked eye the behavior looks very seasonal - although there are irregularities. In the end I would like to try and predict the seasonal behavior but I am a bit stuck here. Any help would be appreciated and please let me know if you need more information.
