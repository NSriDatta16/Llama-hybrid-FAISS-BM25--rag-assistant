There are several issues here: Your multiple logistic regression model includes other variables that may well improve the performance of the model even if they aren't 'significant', thus increasing the power of the test of $p_1$ . If you want to learn more about this phenomenon, it may help you to read this thread: How can adding a 2nd IV make the 1st IV significant? The Mann-Whitney U-test isn't a single-variable analog of multiple logistic regression, simple logistic regression is. Reverse regression (i.e., regressing $X$ on $Y$ ) isn't the same thing as 'regular' regression (i.e., regressing $Y$ on $X$ ). Based on these facts, if you wanted to see the relationship of $p_1$ in isolation, you should fit a simple logistic regression of $y$ on $p_1$ . I suspect these data came from an observational study, not an experimental study. As a result, causal conclusions are not valid. That is, you cannot "recommend addressing $p_1$ to increase the number of people who do $y$ ". In addition, that phrasing implies that you may think of $y$ as the actual predictor variable here. If so, in combination with point 3 above, you probably should be fitting a multivariate model (such as a MANOVA ) instead.
