Meaning of axes in a clustering plot

If you have n time series of rainfall measurements every hour (x=time, y=amount of rain), and compute the distance matrix between each pair of time series based on Dynamic Time Warping, and then plot the clusters, what do the X and Y axes on the cluster plot represent? I have figured out that the values in the distance matrix would have the same measurement unit as the amount of rain in the time series (mm or inches of rain). In the k-medoids or k-means plot, is X still time, and Y still the amount of rain?
