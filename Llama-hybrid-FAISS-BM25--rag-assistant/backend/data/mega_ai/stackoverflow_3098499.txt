This question is more about tweaking your mathematical formula than anything else. It sounds like what you are asking for is popularity, rather than rating. A simple way to do this might be to multiply the average rating by the number of votes. What about this (please excuse me if my syntax is off, I'm away from a SQL server at the moment): select From_ID, AVG(Rating) * COUNT(Rating) AS Rating FROM Ratings Group BY Fruit_ID ORDER by Rating DESC Keep in mind that this formula would rate 1000 votes of 1 much higher than 1 vote of 5.
