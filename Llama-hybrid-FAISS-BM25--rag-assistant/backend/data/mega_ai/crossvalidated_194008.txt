Wikipedia states the following: After training, predictions for unseen samples $x'$ can be made by averaging the predictions from all the individual regression trees on $x'$: $$\hat{f} = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B \hat{f}_b (x')$$ or by taking the majority vote in the case of decision trees. In sum, there is an equation when regression trees are adopted. Voting is only accepted when the random forests employs decision trees.
