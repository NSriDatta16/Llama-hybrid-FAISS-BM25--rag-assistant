Making a request back to the same machine results in 403

I have an "It works on my machine" issue. When I execute the following on my machine it works fine but on my integration server I'm handed a 403 forbidden response. var cookie = page.Request.Cookies[FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName]; var authenticationCookie = new Cookie(FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName, cookie.Value, cookie.Path, page.Request.Url.Authority); var request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(appRoot + item.Path); request.UserAgent = page.Request.UserAgent; request.CookieContainer = new CookieContainer(); request.CookieContainer.Add(authenticationCookie); var response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse(); Any thoughts on what I may be missing? I can take the request address and paste in my browser and it comes up fine. Maybe I'm missing some headers? The integration server is running on a self-signed cert (https).
