Only one row returned in mysql data retrieval

Firstly, sorry about the long question... but this is doing my head in. Any help would be greatfully accepted. I've written the following function to return data from a mysql database: function injuryTable() { # get all players that are injured and their injuires... $sql = "SELECT players.id, players.injury_id, players.pname, injuries_date.name, start_date, end_date FROM players INNER JOIN injuries_date ON injury_id = injuries_date.id"; $result = sqlQuery($sql); return $result; } The sqlQuery function is as follows: function sqlQuery($sql) { $products = array(); $link = dbConnect('localhost', 'root', '', 'umarrr'); $result = mysqli_query($link, $sql); while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)) { $products[] = $row; } # return each row: return $products; #mysqli_close($link); } It's all connected to the database, and everything works fine. However when I try to iterate through the results: it only returns one row: $injury_table = injuryTable(); // make it more readable: foreach ($injury_table as $table); { echo $table['pname']; echo $table['name']; echo $table['start_date']; echo $table['end_date']; } The sql statement I wrote above works perfectly in mysql query browser, so does anyone know what the problem here might be? Output of print_r($injury_table) Array ( [0] => Array ( [0] => 1 [id] => 1 [1] => 6 [injury_id] => 6 [2] => person [pname] => person [3] => wrist [name] => wrist [4] => 2008-11-21 [start_date] => 2008-11-21 [5] => 2010-11-11 [end_date] => 2010-11-11 ) [1] => Array ( [0] => 2 [id] => 2 [1] => 5 [injury_id] => 5 [2] => woman [pname] => woman [3] => neck [name] => neck [4] => 2009-11-12 [start_date] => 2009-11-12 [5] => 2010-09-09 [end_date] => 2010-09-09 ) [2] => Array ( [0] => 3 [id] => 3 [1] => 4 [injury_id] => 4 [2] => girl [pname] => girl [3] => groin [name] => groin [4] => 2010-11-27 [start_date] => 2010-11-27 [5] => 2010-12-01 [end_date] => 2010-12-01 ) [3] => Array ( [0] => 4 [id] => 4 [1] => 1 [injury_id] => 1 [2] => boy [pname] => boy [3] => achilles [name] => achilles [4] => 2010-02-01 [start_date] => 2010-02-01 [5] => 2010-03-23 [end_date] => 2010-03-23 ) [4] => Array ( [0] => 5 [id] => 5 [1] => 2 [injury_id] => 2 [2] => man [pname] => man [3] => toe [name] => toe [4] => 2010-01-01 [start_date] => 2010-01-01 [5] => 2010-02-02 [end_date] => 2010-02-02 ) )
