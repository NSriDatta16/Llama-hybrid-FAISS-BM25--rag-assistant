My answer would be no. I consider Data mining to be one of the miscellaneous fields in Data science. Data Mining is mostly considered on yielding questions rather than answering them. It is often termed as "detecting something new", when compared to Data science, where the data scientist try to solve complex problems to be able to reach their end results. However both terms have many commonalities between them. For example..if u have an agricultural land where u aim to find the affected plants..Here spatial data mining plays a key role in doing this job.There are good chances that you may end up with not only finding out the affected plants in the land but also the extent to which they are affected.......this is something that is not possible with data science.
