Well there are a few different ways that I can/do go about these types of things. User documentation - first and foremost give them some documentation to work with, and make the systems easy for them to use. Just general usability and descriptive names/actions for everything. Provide confirmation screens with warnings. Full disclosure of what the action is going to do, with the warnings inside of a yellow box. It draws attention to it and helps prevent the need for the other items. Have a roll-back plan. For large risky operations you can either simply set "deleted" flags, or offload the data to a temporary "recycle bin" of sorts should they accidentally remove/modify data that was unintended. Require multiple approvals, for data purge operations especially go to a two-tiered approach, requiring approval from separate users. These are just a few of the ideas that I have.
