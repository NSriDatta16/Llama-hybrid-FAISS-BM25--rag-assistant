Upload file to remote server (PHP)

I have a scenario where I have a page on one server which prompts a user to upload a file. I need this file to be uploaded to a different server with a larger storage facility. I then need to get the absolute path of where the file now resides on the server sent back to the originating page. The file size that will be around 15mb, so they aren't small files, and I'd like to avoid double uploading if possible (uploading to the server, then pushing over to remote server). Any direction on this is appreciated.
