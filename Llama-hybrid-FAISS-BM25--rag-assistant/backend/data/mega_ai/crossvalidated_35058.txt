The probability mass function of the average of $n$ independent Poisson random variables can be written down explicitly, though the answer might not help you very much. As Michael Chernick noted in comments on his own answer, the sum $\sum_i X_i$ of independent Poisson random variables $X_i$ with respective parameters $\lambda_i$ is a Poisson random variable with parameter $\lambda = \sum_i \lambda_i$. Hence, $$P\left\{ \sum_{i=1}^n X_i= k\right\} = \exp(-\lambda)\frac{\lambda^k}{k!}, ~~ k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots,$$ Thus, $\hat{Y} = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ is a random variable taking on value $k/n$ with probability $\exp(-\lambda)\frac{\lambda^k}{k!}$. Note that $\hat{Y}$ is not an integer-valued random variable (though it does take on uniformly-spaced rational values). It follows easily that $Y = \lfloor \hat{Y} \rfloor$ is an integer-valued random variable taking on value $m$ with probability $$P\{Y = m\} = P\left\{\left\lfloor \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \right\rfloor = m\right\} = \exp(-\lambda)\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{\lambda^{mn+i}}{(mn+i)!}, ~~ m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots,$$ This is not the probability mass function of a Poisson random variable. Formulas for the mean and variance can be written down using this probability mass function, but they don't obviously lead to nice simple answers in terms of $\lambda$ and $n$. Approximate values can be obtained as pointed out by Henry.
