I think your h(x) is a so called mixture distribution. In your example, there are actually three distributions of h(x), either h1(x)=ax, h2(x)=c, or h3(x)=-x+w, with h1(x) and h3(x) both being uniform, and h2(x) being a point-mass. And these three are mixed with particular weights w, resulting in the total distribution of h(x). So this page will be helpful: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_distribution Look at the paragraph "Moments" where the variance formula is given. B.t.w. as I understand it now, your "distribution" graphs are somewhat confusing, as they do not show the distribution of h(x), but rather the relation between x (which I guess is uniformly distributed) and h(x).
