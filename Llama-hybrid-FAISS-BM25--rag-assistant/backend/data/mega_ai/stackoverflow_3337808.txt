We are in the middle of a migration of our Crystal Enterprise system to SQL Reporting Services. After some research and a few reads, I'm finding SSRS easy to use and grasp. It helps to get yourself organized and decide on the security structure in which you want to present reports to your users. Once I had that organized and published, I decided to take the largest and most complex Crystal Report we have and re-design it using SSRS (not using any RPT to XML tool). This task has helped me learn this new way of doing reports and I find the ability to design in VS (or Microsoft SQL Server Report Builder) easy and the flexibilty amazing. I highly recommend switching if you can!
