MathJax is an evolution of and replacement for jsMath by the same main developer, Davide Cervone, but with corporate backing. It is not built on top of jsMath but is essentially a re-engineering of it. It follows pretty much the same principles as jsMath but adds support for MathML and takes better advantage of modern browsers, webfonts, and JavaScript technology. While Davide will answer questions about jsMath, no future development will likely occur on it and its users are strongly encouraged to move to MathJax. My company, Design Science, is one of its backers.
