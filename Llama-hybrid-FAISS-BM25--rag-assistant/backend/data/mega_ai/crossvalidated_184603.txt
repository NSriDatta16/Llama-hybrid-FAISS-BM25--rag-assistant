In PCA, what is the connection between explained variance and squared error?

For an observations matrix $X$, I use PCA to reduce the dimension of the data to $L$. I know that in this case, PCA is guaranteed to minimise the mean reconstruction error. In Wikipedia notation, something like $$\|X-T_LW_L^T\|^2_2$$ where $W$ are the loadings, $T$ are the scores, and the subscript $L$ indicates that only $L$ components are used. I can also ask how much of the total variance is explained by these $L$ components. My question is, is there a mathematical relation between the two? Assuming I have only the squared error and the covariance matrix for $X$, can I compute the explained variance?
