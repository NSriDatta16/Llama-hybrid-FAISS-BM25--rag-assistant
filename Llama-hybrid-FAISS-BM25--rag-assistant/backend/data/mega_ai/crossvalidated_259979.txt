ts function in R

My time series data are separately by hourly. The length of time series is 1005 days. The start day is 2/04/2014 and the end day is 31/12/2016. I’m using R (3.1.1). I’d like to know the value of the “frequency” argument in the ts() function in R, for annual, seasons and month. Since most of the examples and cases I’ve seen so far are for months or days at the most. Thank you in advance.
