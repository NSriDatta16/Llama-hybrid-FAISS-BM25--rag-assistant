Time-Series Prediction with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Input Data Shape Problem and How To Choose Xtrain YTrain

I would like to use CNN for time-series prediction problem. I have hourly solar irradiance data for 365 days. What I would like to do is training my network with 1 week data and predict next day. Training Data: Xtrain: Day-1 Hour-1 to Hour-24, Day-2 Hour-1 to Hour-24 ... Day-6 Hour-1 to Hour-24 Ytrain: Day-7 Hour-1 to Hour-24 I have created a new dataset which takes 24 hours of a day in the rows and 7 days in the columns, so it is (8616,7) matrix. hour-1 day-1, day-2 ... day-7 hour-2 day-1, day-2 ... day-7 . . . hour-24 day-1, day-2 ... day-7 hour-1 day-2, day-3 ... day-8 hour-2 day-2, day-3 ... day-8 . . . hour-24 day-2, day-3 ... day-8 . . . hour-1 day-359, day-360 ... day-365 hour-2 day-359, day-360 ... day-365 . . . hour-24 day-359, day-360 ... day-365 First of all, is this a correct way to create a dataset? Keras Code: xtrain = dataset[0:24,0:6] # takes 24 hour for 6 days ytrain = dataset[24:48,6] # takes 24 hour of 7th day xtest = dataset[24:48,0:6] # takes 24 hours for 6 days (day2 to day7) to predict day 7 ytest = dataset[24:48,6] model = Sequential() model.add(Conv1D(6,kernel_size=3,activation='relu', input_shape=(24,6))) #input_shape=() model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=3)) model.add(Conv1D(12,kernel_size=3,activation='relu')) model.add(MaxPooling1D(pool_size=3)) model.add(Flatten()) model.add(Dense(48,activation='tanh')) model.add(Dense(24, activation='linear')) model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(), metrics=['mae']) model.fit(xtrain,ytrain,epochs=1000,verbose=2) pred_data = model.predict(xtest) When I run this code, it gives me an error "ValueError: Error when checking input: expected conv1d_15_input to have 3 dimensions, but got array with shape (24, 6)" I am really not sure what I should give as an input with 3 dimension, and I am also not sure the way a created dataset is a correct approach.
