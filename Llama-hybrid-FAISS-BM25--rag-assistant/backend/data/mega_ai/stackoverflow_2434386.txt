Have you considered using Amazon S3 to store and serve user-uploaded files? Otherwise, a central file server in your data center makes sense. You could mount the storage locally on each of your web servers using NFS or similar. However you choose to store these files, you should always serve user-provided files from a different domain to avoid cross-domain exploits.
