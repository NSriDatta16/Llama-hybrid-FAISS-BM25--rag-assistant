Your framework should define the interfaces that are used to wire things up (note that events can be defined in interfaces, so you can promote the events to the interface). Mike Scott's advice of "depend on abstractions, not implementations" is spot on, but I'd be a little stronger here - you should program by contract and use a layered design . Alternatively, you can use interfaces like INotifyPropertyChanged which provide a string that can be used to retrieve information via reflection, but that is such a fragile way to work and should be a last resort.
