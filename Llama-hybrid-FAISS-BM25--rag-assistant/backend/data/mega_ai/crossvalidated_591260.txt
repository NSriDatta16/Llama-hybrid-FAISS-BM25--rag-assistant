Studying inflation on my groceries, how to correctly show the increase of prices?

I have price data from the last two years from my online groceries purchases on an online supermarket for all the products I bought. I want to study the increase of prices for the products that I usually buy; since I didn't always buy the same products, I am taking an average of a six months period for all the products that I take into account, so my data is resampled with a period of six months. Now I am facing the problem that I don't know what is a correct way to show inflation/price change: Absolute differences don't tell much since the same absolute increase for different starting prices has a different impact Relative or percentage price increases are more suitable, however, what's a good way to show the increase of prices? If I am considering periods of six months, I could show the increase w.r.t. the previous period, but this can be misleading. For instance, if a 1\$ product increases 20%, the new price is 1.20\$, but if it now deceases 20% it will have a price of 0.96\$, so if I use relative increases I will see +20%, then -20%, which might lead to think that the price is the same as in the beginning, but that's not the case I could use the increase w.r.t. the original price, but not always the first price was the lowest. For some products, I noticed that their price went down on 2021 w.r.t. 2020 and up again in 2022. What would be a good way to show how prices changed in the last two years?
