Sending items in a LINQ sequence to a method that returns void

Often while I'm dealing with LINQ sequences, I want to send each item to a method returning void, avoiding a foreach loop. However, I haven't found an elegant way to do this. Today, I wrote the following code: private StreamWriter _sw; private void streamToFile(List errors) { if (_sw == null) { _sw = new StreamWriter(Path.Combine (Path.GetDirectoryName(_targetDatabasePath), "errors.txt")); } Func writeSelector = (e) => { _sw.WriteLine(getTabDelimititedLine(e)); return true; }; errors.Select(writeSelector); _sw.Flush(); } As you can see, I write a lambda function that just returns true, and I realize that the Select method will return a sequence of booleans- I'll just ignore that sequence. However, this seems a little bit noobish and jank. Is there any elegant way to do this? Or am I just misapplying LINQ? Thanks.
