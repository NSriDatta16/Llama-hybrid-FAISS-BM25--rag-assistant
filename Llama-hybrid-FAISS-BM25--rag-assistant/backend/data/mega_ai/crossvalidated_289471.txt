In this context, the term manifold is accurate, but is unnecessarily highfalutin. Technically, a manifold is any space (set of points with a topology) that is sufficiently smooth and continuous (in a way that can, with some effort, be made mathematically well-defined). Imagine the space of all possible values of your original factors. After a dimensional reduction technique, not all points in that space are attainable. Instead, only points on some embedded sub-space inside in that space will be attainable. That embedded sub-space happens to fulfill the mathematical definition of a manifold. For a linear dimensional reduction technique like PCA, that sub-space is just a linear sub-space (e.g. a hyper-plane), which is a relatively trivial manifold. But for non-linear dimensional reduction technique, that sub-space could be more complicated (e.g. a curved hyper-surface). For data analysis purposes, understanding that these are sub-spaces is much more important than any inference you would draw from knowing that they fulfill the definition of manifold.
