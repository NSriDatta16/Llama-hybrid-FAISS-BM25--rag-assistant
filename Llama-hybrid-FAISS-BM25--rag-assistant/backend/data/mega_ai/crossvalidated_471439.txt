It's not an elementary or trivial question. It's a philosophical one. It touches the deepest foundations of statistics. It's almost a religious question if Bayesians overhear it. There are many ways to answer it. For instance, it could mean that if our Universe forked this moment and we observed infinite number of evolutions of these universes then in 70% of cases in next 6 months US stock market will drop below March lows. Surely, this may sound extravagant, but I came to accept it as a possibility. Another answer is that it's about the subjective gauge that helps you decide whether or not to invest in US stock market. We have only one realization of reality, so 70% of chance has no means of being tested in terms of frequencies of occurrence of this event. Yet another way to answer is to assume an ergodic hypothesis which states that although we can't fork the Universe and see across all different realizations of future; we can, nevertheless, observe one Universe for long time, and that when you observe it for a long enough period it's the same as observing a set of forked universes. In practical terms it means that if you follow the forecast of whoever gave you the "70% prediction" then in 70% of the cases the advice will pay off. Over long period of time.
