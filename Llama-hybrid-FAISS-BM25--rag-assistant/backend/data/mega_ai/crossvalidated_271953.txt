Acceptance rate for Metropolis-Hastings > 0.5

How come it's possible to get Metropolis-Hastings acceptance rates close to 1 (for example, when exploring a unimodal distribution with a normal proposal distribution with too-small SD), after burn-in is over? I see it in my own MCMC chains but I don't understand how it makes sense. It seems to me that after reaching the summit acceptance rate should stabilize around values that are smaller than 0.5.
