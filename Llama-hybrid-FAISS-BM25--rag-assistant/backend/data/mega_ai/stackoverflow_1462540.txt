I tried using PagedCollectionViews as well as CollectionViewSources (I used the new collection to overwrite the existing source collection). My solution isn't the most elegant, but it works. When updating the source of the DataGrid I did my own change detection. In other words, instead of blindly overwriting the source collection I iterated through the new collection, compared each item to the existing collection, and updated the existing items where possible. Hope that helps.
