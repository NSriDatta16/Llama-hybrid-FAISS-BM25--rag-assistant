Broadly speaking, time series analysis. You can get a lot of mileage without assuming anything about the conditional distribution of the Markov kernel. For instance, if you think that the process obeys an AR(1) process (i.e. $ X_t $ is hypothesized to satisfy the difference equation $ X_t = \phi X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t $ where $ \{ \epsilon_t \}_{t=-\infty}^\infty $ is a white noise time series with variance $ \sigma^2 $) that satisfies weak stationarity, then you can estimate $ \phi $ with a variety of procedures (by solving the Yule-Walker equations, for example).
