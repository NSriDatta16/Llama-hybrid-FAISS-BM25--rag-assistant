The Global Interpreter Lock is known to have a strong impact on the performance limitations of standard CPython. Thus the multiprocessing module notes: multiprocessing is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module. The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine. It runs on both Unix and Windows. The GIL probably isn't the cause of your MemoryErrors, but it is something to be aware of.
