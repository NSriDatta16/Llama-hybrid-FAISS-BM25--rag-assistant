I took your data including three stochastic predictors into AUTOBOX ( a piece of software that is available in R which I have helped develop ). My intent here was to provide some top level guidance for you and the list which is why I wanted some dummy data (coded) to prove the point that something practical could result . Following is a picture of the actual and forecasts . I used the most recent 100 days , some 2400 observations and predicted out 7 days (168 values) . The issue here is to identify the hour of the day efffects and the day-of-the week effects .Longer series would facillitate holiday effects etc. to be conditioned for the form of the relationship between the dependent series and the three candidate input series i.e contemporaneous/lagged etc. while identifying and remeding unusual data points that would distort 1 and 2 Furthermore it is important to idenify any time trends or level shifts which untreated would provide distortion to 1 and 2 ARIMA modelling (univariate Box-Jenins) is of little or no value when dealing hourly /daily data full of holiday/weekend/economic activity. Transfer Functions i.e. regression on steroids is the play delivering assignable cause to hours of the day , day-of-the-week , week-of-the-month , days-of-the month , weeks-of-the monrth , long weekends et.al. All of the "rear-window driving mechanisms" are anachronistic (that's a pun ! ) . I am unaware of any tools that you might have access to that comprehensively solves the problem so you may have no recourse but to write your own procedures as intervention detection is broadly unavailable with causal series while identifying the presence of time trends is still rare. Decompose a time series data into deterministic trend and stochastic trend . Here is the model (with some coefficients masked ) for confidentiality reasons and here and here The plot of the model residuals seems quite correct suggesting that we have successfully separated signal and noise . I hope this helps you and motivates you to independently perform a similar analysis. In closing the future expectataions for the three candidate supporting series for the next 168 periods are VERY CRITICAL in providing the expectation of Y. EDITED AFTER INVESTIGATING ANOTHER OPTION IN AUTOBOX: Here is the actual/fit and forecast ... very improved with forecasts for the next 21 days here
