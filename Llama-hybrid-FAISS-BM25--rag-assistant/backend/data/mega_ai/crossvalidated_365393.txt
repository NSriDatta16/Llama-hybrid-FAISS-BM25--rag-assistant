For the first statement: logistic regression is used when a variable is dichotomous. Since the variable can assume only value 1 or 0, fitting a line assumes a linear relationship which cannot hold for dichotomous outcomes. It can be proved that the linear probability model will not be efficient and, furthermore, nothing ensures that the estimated dependent variable will be bounded between 0 and 1. The logit can solve these problem. Please clarify your second statement.
