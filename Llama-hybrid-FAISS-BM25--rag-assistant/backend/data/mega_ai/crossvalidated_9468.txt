How do I model the volatility of an arithmetic mean?

Suppose I have a model of stock prices developed using Brownian motion. I have a second time series derived from the first. At each price point in the first time series, I take the arithmetic mean up to that point and that is the data point for my second time series. The volatility of the second time series is lower because the arithmetic mean has a dampening effect. Are there any statistical tools to model the volatility of the second time series?
