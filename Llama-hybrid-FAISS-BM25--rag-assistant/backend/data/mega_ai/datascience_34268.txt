Interpretation of variable or feature importance in Random Forest

I'm currently using Random Forest to train some models and interpret the obtained results. One of the features I want to analyze further, is variable importance. The thing is I am not familiar on how to do a proper analysis of the results I got. Let's say I have this table: | Predictor | Importance | ---------------------------- | var_1 | num_1 | ... | var_n | num_n | What is a proper analysis that can be conducted on the values obtained from the table, in addition to saying which variable is more important than another? I was suggested something like variable ranking or using cumulative density function, but I am not sure how to begin with that.
