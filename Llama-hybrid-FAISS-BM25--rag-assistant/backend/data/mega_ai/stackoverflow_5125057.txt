You may find this helpful A list Apart's css-positioning 101 What exactly is the problem you are having? Absolute removes the element from normal "flow of the document" and allows you to position it where you want. Relative position is a lot like static but allows you to absolute position elements within it. Static follows the normal document flow. (stacking) By the way, I recommend you use a library or framework like JQuery or Prototype instead of building this by hand. It will save you hours of frustration and testing in different browsers. Edit: Since you are hellbent doing this the hard way...I hope I can be of some help. I recomend you download the the firebug addon for Firefox if that is what you use or get familiar Javascript Console under tools in Chrome. HTML Thing One Thing Two There is no parent/child relationship here did you mean for the document to be the boundry? freeMovement does not call findPos on the elements offSetParent where BoundMovement does. This is retuning undefined since the document does not have that property. Try wrapping these two paragraphs in something other than the body tag. Thing One Thing Two
