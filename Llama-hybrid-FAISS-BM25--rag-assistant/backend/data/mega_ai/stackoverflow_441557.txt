Slightly off topic (on MVC) but on topic about your issue: Why not use a less cumbersome solution? If you need to simply assign to 15 labels 15 values you could give your controller an indexed property or method that uses your Label object's design time name as key to retrieve the appropriate value from your model using a dictionary or reflection on your entity property names or a big switch statement: foreach(Control control in myLabelsPanel.Controls) { Label label = control as Label; if(label != null) { label.Text = myController.TextForKey[label.Name]; } } Edit: I just forgot to add that I dot't see as a bad thing the view accessing my model entity classes. After all, they are the model and they can become part of the ViewModel (if you are using that paradigm), and MVC encourages the View knowing about the model (bue not the other way around).
