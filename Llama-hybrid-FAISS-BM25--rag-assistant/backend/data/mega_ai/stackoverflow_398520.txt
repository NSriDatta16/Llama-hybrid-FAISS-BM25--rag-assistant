Version Control (SVN) is more than enough for me. Yet, there are some rules: I commit as often as possible (4-6 hours of work without committing already start creating this tingling sensation of something going wrong). SVN structures of solutions are always atomic. You just need a fresh CheckOut in order to be able to run "rebuild-copy-package" integration script on any solution (running tests might require providing DB connection settings before that). SVN server is reliable and backed up regularly. Changes are being propagated between the different solutions composing the application (i.e. from open source shared library to the internal code that leverages it) only via the commits (integration server picks this up and creates packages that could be used in the solutions down-stream). Sandbox projects (prototypes) are always kept in Prototypes folder of SVN (sibling of Trunk or Tags) being named "YYYY-MM-DD PrototypeName"
