Sizing a UILabel to fit?

How would one modify the following snippet (in a tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath: UITableViewController method) from the "09a - PrefsTable" recipe from Chapter 6 of The iPhone Developer's Cookbook: if (row == 1) { // Create a big word-wrapped UILabel cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@"libertyCell"]; if (!cell) { cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero reuseIdentifier:@"libertyCell"] autorelease]; [cell addSubview:[[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(20.0f, 10.0f, 280.0f, 330.0f)]]; } UILabel *sv = [[cell subviews] lastObject]; sv.text = @"When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation."; sv.textAlignment = UITextAlignmentCenter; sv.lineBreakMode = UILineBreakModeWordWrap; sv.numberOfLines = 9999; return cell; } ...to size the "sv" UILabel subview and the "cell" UITableViewCell to be sized just big enough to fit the text (and work with more or less text, and other types of text alignment)? I looked at the UILabel textRectForBounds:limitedToNumberOfLines: method, but the documentation states that it should not be called directly (and should only be overridden). I experimented with the UIView sizeToFit method, without success. Update: I asked a new question about my problem with the NSString -sizeWithFont:forWidth:lineBreakMode: method .
