Why are you assuming logs and seasonal differencing? Just because Box and Jenkins applied these transforms doesn't mean that they are applicable to other time series. Meanwhile in a specific answer to your question. If you are taking seasonal differences UP FRONT and modeling the seasonal differences using your assumed level shift variable (remember that the level shift needed may not be the de jure point) then the -.05 would reflect a 5% decrement in the logs.
