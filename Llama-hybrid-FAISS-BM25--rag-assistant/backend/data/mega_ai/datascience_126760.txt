What specific problems in what domains and fields have the need to use rule-based text classification?

I wrote a rule-based keyword detection and classification program specialized in my language (Vietnamese) and would like to know where this app is useful. Here how the program work: First you input the prompt (which is a bunch of keywords), e.g. fish 50k Then it will automatically label/classify the prompt like this: Object: fish Type of Object: food Place of transaction: market Type of place of transaction: offline Consumer: myself Type of consumer: myself Price: 50000 VND The program can make this classification based on a config you declare, e.g.: - Dimension name: Object Classification: - Food: fish, meat - Appliance: computer, speaker Default value: meat ... Which problems do you see this app will be useful? In general, where have you seen rule-based classification being applied? Especially in the context of ChatGPT and its GPT store? What domains, fields or industries have the need to use rule-based approaches? I think there should be a review on how this technique is applied in various field, but I can't find one. In my understanding, there are two types of approaches in NLP: rule-based and statistic-based. Rule-based approach is simple, understandable and need not training, while statistic-based is better if the rules are complex and you have good training data. I think rule-based classification is much cheaper and more accurate than statistical-based classification. Is that correct?
