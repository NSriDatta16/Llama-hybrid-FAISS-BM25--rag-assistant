Negative Correlation b/w timeseries x and its future averages

We have a variable x for which we have daily data (timeseries). It is observed x(t) is negatively correlated with Average(x(t+1)), Average(x(t+1), x(t+2)) â€¦ till Average(x(t+1), x(t+2), .. x(t+21)). Moreover, the magnitude of negatively correlation decreases as we move towards the end of 2nd series. I was curious on: Is this situation even possible? Can we infer something from this relation?
