Try Cython or something similar. (If you do, I would be interested in knowing if/how much that helped) Cython is a programming language to simplify writing C and C++ extension modules for the CPython Python runtime. Strictly speaking, Cython syntax is a superset of Python syntax additionally supporting: Direct calling of C functions, or C++ functions/methods, from Cython code. Strong typing of Cython variables, classes, and class attributes as C types. Cython compiles to C or C++ code rather than Python, and the result is used as a Python Extension Module or as a stand-alone application embedding the CPython runtime.
