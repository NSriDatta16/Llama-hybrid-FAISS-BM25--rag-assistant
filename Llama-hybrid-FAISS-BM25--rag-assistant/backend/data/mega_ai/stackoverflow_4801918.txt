Elegant way to modify a list of variables by reference in Python?

Let's say I have a function f() that takes a list and returns a mutation of that list. If I want to apply that function to five member variables in my class instance (i), I can do this: for x in [i.a, i.b, i.c, i.d, i.e]: x[:] = f(x) 1) Is there a more elegant way? I don't want f() to modify the passed list. 2) If my variables hold a simple integer (which won't work with the slice notation), is there also a way? (f() would also take & return an integer in this case)
