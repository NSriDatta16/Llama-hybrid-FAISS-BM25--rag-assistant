This is due to the change in interpretation of coefficients for the main effects (GDP and corruption perception, in your case) when the interaction term is added. Let's put aside the nature of your dependent variable (DV). When there is no interaction term, the coefficient on the GDP variable gives us the average change in DV for a one-unit increase in GDP, holding other covariates constant regardless of what the values of other covariates are . (And same thing is true for the corruption variable.) If you are familiar with calculus, this can be stated as the marginal effect of (or the partial derivative of DV with respect to) GDP is just the value of the coefficient on GDP. But when you add the interaction term, a one-unit increase in GDP will not produce an average change in DV equal to the value of the coefficient on GDP. The marginal effect of GDP on DV now varies by the level of corruption variable. More precisely, the marginal effect of GDP will be equal to the value of the coefficient on GDP plus the value of the coefficient on the interaction term multiplied by the value of corruption variable. So the only case when the level of corruption variable will not affect the marginal effect of GDP on DV is when its value is 0, and that's what the coefficient on GDP tells you in the model with the interaction term: what the marginal effect of GDP on DV is when the level of corruption perception is 0. In your case, that marginal effect is negative. If you have not already done so, you may want to center the main effect variables before creating the interaction term, as it may make your results more meaningful and easier to interpret. Centering means subtracting the mean of each variable from the individual values. If you do that, then the coefficient on GDP will give you the marginal effect of GDP on DV for the average level of corruption perception . And same for the marginal effect of corruption perception. Moreover, the interpretation of the intercept/constant term in the regression (if you include it) will be the expected value of DV for average levels of GDP and corruption perception.
