You might want to check xdebug's code coverage , possibly as an auto_append. However, it≈õ rather limited and it would require you to have either 100% test-cases (which I doubt as you say the project is a mess), or the tenacity to go through every possible action on the site, and even then you'll have to apply good judgement whether you can remove a portion of code because it isn't used, or leave it there because a certain condition just hasn't been met yet in your cases. On a side note: stepping through the code with xdebug's remote debugger has really helped me in the past to quickly get the different mechanisms & flows in unknown projects.
