Indirect and direct invocation are used in different places. In your sample the direct invocation is prefered. Some reasons to use pointers: When passing a large data structure to a function one can passa pointer instead of copying the whole data structure. When you want a function to be able to modify a variable in the calling function you have to pass a pointer to the original variable. If you pass it by value the called function will just modify a copy. When you don't know exactly which value you want to pass at compile time, you can set a pointer to the right value during runtime. When dynamically allocating a block of memory you have to use pointers, since the storage location is not known until runtime.
