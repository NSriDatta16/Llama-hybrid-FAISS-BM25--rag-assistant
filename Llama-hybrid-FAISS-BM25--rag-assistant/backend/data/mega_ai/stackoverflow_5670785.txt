Chrome has "Failed to load PDF document" error message on inline PDFs

I have a problem with reading pdf file in Chrome by using PHP. The following code is how I do in PHP $path = "actually file path"; header("Pragma: public"); header("Expires: 0"); header("Content-type: $content_type"); header('Cache-Control: private', FALSE); header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0'); header("Content-Disposition: inline; filename=\"$filename\""); header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary'); header('Content-Length' . filesize($path)); ob_clean(); flush(); readfile($path); In here, I set the Content-Disposition to inline. Because I want to display the pdf file if user browser have build-in pdf viewer plugin. As you may know, Chrome has build-in pdf viewer. The problem is I have bunch of pdf files on the server. Only some of them can be viewed by Chrome. I can't figure out why others can not work the same way. I have checked the permission of each files. It looks like not the permission problem. Is there anyone know what the problem is? Thank you.
