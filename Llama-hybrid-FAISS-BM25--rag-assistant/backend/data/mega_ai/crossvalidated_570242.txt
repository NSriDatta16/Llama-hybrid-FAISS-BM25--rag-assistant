Here, the symbol $\propto$ indicates that the density $\bar p$ is proportional to the quantity on the right. In other words, there exists a constant $C$ such that $$\bar p(x) = C\sigma^{-2} \exp \left(-\frac{2 e^{k}}{\sigma^{2}}\left(\frac{e^{-\alpha_{1}(x-\tau)}}{\alpha_{1}}+\frac{e^{\alpha_{2}(x-\tau)}}{\alpha_{2}}\right)\right)$$ Since $\bar p$ is a density, that constant $C$ is actually given by $$C = \left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty\sigma^{-2} \exp \left(-\frac{2 e^{k}}{\sigma^{2}}\left(\frac{e^{-\alpha_{1}(x-\tau)}}{\alpha_{1}}+\frac{e^{\alpha_{2}(x-\tau)}}{\alpha_{2}}\right)\right)dx \right)^{-1}$$ This notation is often seen in MCMC algorithms such as Metropolis Hastings , where we want to draw samples from a distribution known only up to a constant. In these cases, knowing the "shape" of the function is often enough and we don't need to compute the normalizing constant $C$ . Perhaps it is also the case for the application you have in mind.
