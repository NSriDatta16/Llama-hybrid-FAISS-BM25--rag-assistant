Well, I can't say I have any expertize with v 1.4.x since I haven't yet worked with it myself, but I happened upon a thread over at the magento boards that is probably helpful (you might want to skim it, but pay attention on the third page of comments). Also, this link was posted on one of the responses, and it seems to be useful as well. Well, at least it helped clear things up for me, who has worked with v 1.3.x. When we did our first magento site we used Yoast's blank seo theme (which is free) as a starting point. It is basically the blank theme, but then optimized for seo. If you are skilled with theming in general I would highly recommend copying it into your own custom package and then modifying it. I noticed that there is a 1.4-compatible blank seo module . If you aren't as comfortable with theming and you want to start with a theme that is mostly done, I can't say I know how to direct you. Good luck!
