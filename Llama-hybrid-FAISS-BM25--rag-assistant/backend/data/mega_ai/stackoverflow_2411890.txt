I had a very similar experience a few years ago, and stumbled upon this book: Working Effectively With Legacy Code by Michael C. Feathers It has an incredibly complete set of techniques for starting with an existing codebase that has no unit test coverage, and gradually getting it under test. If I could recommend only one book on TDD, it would be this one. Hopefully this helps... best of luck! Tyler
