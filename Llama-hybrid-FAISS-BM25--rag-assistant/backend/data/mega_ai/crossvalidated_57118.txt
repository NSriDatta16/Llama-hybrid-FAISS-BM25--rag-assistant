The reason you don't have the same epiphanic look on your face as that guy is I think that . . . the statement isn't true. A null hypothesis is the hypothesis that any difference between the control and experimental conditions is due to chance. An uninformative prior is meant to state that you have prior data on a question, but that it doesn't tell you anything about what to expect this next time round. A Bayesian is likely to maintain that there's information in any prior, even the uniform distribution. So the null hypothesis says that there's no difference between control and experimental; an uninformative prior on the other hand may or may not be possible, and if it did would indicate nothing about the difference between control and experimental (which is different from indicating that any difference is due to chance). Perhaps I am lacking in my understanding of uninformative priors, though. I look forward to other answers.
