Pros and cons of converting weekly to daily data

I am trying to forecast an economic variable called the "yield spread" in python. Among the variables in my dataset, two of them are measured on a weekly basis. These are: unemployment insurance claims (ui_claims), total assets held by the Fed (total_assets) The majority of the other variables are monthly such as: federal funds rate (ffr), Consumer Price Index (cpi) Others have daily frequency such as: TED spread (ted), term premium My question is - is it ok to convert weekly into daily data for time series forecasting? I could use cubic spline interpolation, but then the downside is that it would just be making up lot of data. So, I was wondering what the costs and benefits of converting would be.
