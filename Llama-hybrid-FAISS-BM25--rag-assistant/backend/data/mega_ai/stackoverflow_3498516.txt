Can you not pull the file locally, edit it and post it? I know this is tedious and not elegant but it seems editors are presently having issue with remote sessions. E.g., Get-Content REMOTE\Filename.txt > LOCAL\Filename.txt Make your changes locally and then Set-Content -path REMOTE\Filename.txt -value (get-content LOCAL\Filename.txt) EDIT Also if you are only replacing certain instances you can do this pretty easily. E.g., Get-Content REMOTE\Filename.txt | foreach-object { $_ -replace "OLD", "NEW" } | Set-Content REMOTE\Filename.txt
