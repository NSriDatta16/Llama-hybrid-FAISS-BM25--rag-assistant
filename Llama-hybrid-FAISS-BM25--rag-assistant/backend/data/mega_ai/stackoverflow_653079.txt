If I'm understanding the functionality correctly, I wished I had that functionality when I was working in Perl, adding an Event Logging function into an existing GUI. I wanted to ensure that the needed hand testing (sigh) gave us complete coverage, so I logged every test point to a file, and logging a __counter__ value made it easy to see what was missing in the coverage. As it was, I hand coded the equivalent.
