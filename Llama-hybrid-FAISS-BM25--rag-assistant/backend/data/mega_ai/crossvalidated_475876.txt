The question is not very clear to me. For logistic regression, the objective function (loss respect to coefficients) is convex, and the model is able to produce a number bounded from 0 to 1. Which means $$p_i = \text{Logit}^{-1}(f(x_i)) = \text{Logit}^{-1}(\beta^T x_i)$$ is bounded in 0,1 but the objective function $$\sum_i -y_i\log(p_i) - (1 - y_i)\log(1 - p_i)$$ is convex. To summarize the link function is not convex, but the objective function that we are trying to optimizing is convex.
