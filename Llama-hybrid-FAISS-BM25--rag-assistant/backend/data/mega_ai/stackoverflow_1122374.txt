xCode is demanding symbols that are already there

The voodoo involved in iPhone development never ceases to amaze me. Here's the latest hex that has been cast upon me. I am developing an app that uses the routeMe library to display maps. I'm testing things in the simulator and everything works great. The app also uses the GPS features on the iPhone so I decide to plug it into the device and take it for a stroll to see what kind of data it produces. The compiler complains that it can't find a routeMe library located in my simulator build directory, so I figure that I must have jugged adding routeMe somehow. I remove routeMe and go through all the steps on the embedding guide to get it back up and running (I wish). Now xCode is demanding a bunch of parentheses that are already there. For example, this line: -(void) centerLatLong: (CLLocationCoordinate2D) point animate: (BOOL) animate; Earns the error: ...RMTiledLayerController.h:59: error: expected ')' before 'CLLocationCoordinate2D' The line looks good to me xCode! What's the deal? Here's a full list of all errors and warnings I get, could one of these be causing the problem? I didn't write or change in any way any of the classes the compiler is complaining about, and everything compiled fine on the simulator two hours ago. I am truly stumped. /User s/timothybowen/Documents/src/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/lib/routeMe/MapView/Map/RMTiledLayerController.h:59: error: expected ')' before 'CLLocationCoordinate2D' /Users/timothybowen/Documents/src/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/lib/routeMe/MapView/Map/RMTiledLayerController.m:46: warning: no '-tileProjection' method found /Users/timothybowen/Documents/src/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/lib/routeMe/MapView/Map/RMTiledLayerController.m:108: error: expected ')' before 'CLLocationCoordinate2D' /Users/timothybowen/Documents/src/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/lib/routeMe/MapView/Map/RMTiledLayerController.m:110: error: 'RMMercator' undeclared (first use in this function) /Users/timothybowen/Documents/src/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/lib/routeMe/MapView/Map/RMTiledLayerController.m:110: warning: 'RMTiledLayerController' may not respond to '-centerMercator:animate:' i686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.2.1: /Users/timothybowen/Documents/src/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/lib/routeMe/MapView/build/Debug-iphonesimulator/libMapView.a: No such file or directory i686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.2.1: /Users/timothybowen/Documents/src/thetrailbehind/TrailTracker/lib/routeMe/MapView/build/Debug-iphonesimulator/libMapView.a: No such file or directory
