Steady state Markov Chain

is it able to count the steady state of problem with recurrent subchain.. for example if there are A B C D things and they are all recurrent. do they have steady state?? and also.. how to count steady state if the problem uses 4x4 or bigger matrix?? because ive searched about steady state and most of them only give example of 2x2 matrix..
