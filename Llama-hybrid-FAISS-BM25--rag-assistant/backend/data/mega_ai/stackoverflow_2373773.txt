adding a dataset inside a datareader in vb.net

i hope i have asked the question title correctly. let me explain my issue - i am making a table through vb.net code (htmltablecell, htmltablerow..) no this table populates with an sql query and works perfectly. but inside this table in one tablecell, i need to add a dropdownlist which shall require a completely differernt query and shall run on its own on each row. so the code is as follows Sql = "..." rd = ExecuteReader(SqlCnn, Sql) Dim newcounter As Integer = 0 While rd.Read() newcounter += 1 Dim tr As New HtmlTableRow Dim td As New HtmlTableCell Dim chkbox As New CheckBox Dim id As String = rd("id") & "" If id.Length = 0 Then id = "new" & newcounter id &= "_" & rd("col1") chkbox.Style.Add("width", "20%") chkbox.ID = "new_id_" & id chkbox.Text = rd("col1") tr.Style.Add("width", "100%") td.Style.Add("width", "10%") td.Style.Add("text-align", "left") td.Controls.Add(chkbox) tr.Cells.Add(td) td = New HtmlTableCell td.Style.Add("width", "30%") Dim ddl As New dropdownlist ddl.Style.Add("width", "80%") ddl.ID = "a1_" & id --??????? td.Controls.Add(ddl) tr.Cells.Add(td) the ??? in the code is where the dropdownlist shall get populated each time with its own datareader and while loop and query. how can i achieve this?
