How to calculate a probability that a time series takes values in a given interval?

So I have a time series $X_t$, where $X_t$ is the number of sales of a product at day t. I would like to be able to calculate some probability like this $P(X_t>10)$ for $t \in [5,20]$ : this means that over 15 days I have sold more than 10 items. This might be a dummy question and I know it strongly depends on what model I use for $X_t$. But what sort of approach could I take, lets say for example that $X_t$ follows an ARMA model.
