You're talking about two different things here. One is momentum - giving things residual motion when you release them from a drag. This is simply about remembering the velocity of a thing when the user releases it, then applying that velocity to the object every frame and also reducing the velocity every frame by some amount. How you reduce velocity every frame is what you experiment with to get the feel right. The other thing is ease-in and ease-out animation. This is about smoothly accelerating/decelerating objects when you move them between two positions, instead of just linearly interpolating. You do this by simply feeding your 'time' value through a sigmoid function before you use it to interpolate an object between two positions. One such function is smoothstep(t) = 3*t*t - 2*t*t*t [0 This gives you both ease-in and ease-out behaviour. However, you'll more commonly see only ease-out used in GUIs. That is, objects start moving snappily, then slow to a halt at their final position. To achieve that you just use the right half of the curve, ie. smoothstep_eo(t) = 2*smoothstep((t+1)/2) - 1
