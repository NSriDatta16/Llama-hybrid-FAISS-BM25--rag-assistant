Average of compound value or compound of averages?

Suppose I'm measuring the flow rate of a tube. I measure the time it takes to fill it twice. Each time, I also measure its final volume. So what is the best approach to calculate the average flow? Calculating each flow and averaging them or averaging the measurements and then calculating the flow? I'm sure I've read something about this while studying error propagation back in college, but I can't find a good resource on the topic. Any pointers are much appreciated!
