Firstly I can recommend you the book Foundations of statistical natural language processing by Manning and Sch√ºtze. The methods I would use are word-frequency distributions and ngram language models. The first works very well when you want to classify on topic and your topics are specific and expert (having keywords). Ngram modelling is the best way when you want to classify writing styles etc.
