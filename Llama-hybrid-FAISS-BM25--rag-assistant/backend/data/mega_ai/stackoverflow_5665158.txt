Depending on how you compute per fragment lighting (i.e. if you clamp your dot product in the 0-1 range or not), what you see might just be a problem of inverted normals. Depending on how you select A , B , C , the normal at a vertex could point in either direction. To tell apart the outside and the inside of a triangle you usually need some more info, e.g. the winding of the vertices. Are you taking this into account?
