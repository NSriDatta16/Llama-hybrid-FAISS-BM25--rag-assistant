You should model your database according to the data you want to store. This is called "normalization": Essentially, each piece of information should only be stored once, otherwise a table cell should point to another row or table containing the value. If, for example, you have table containing phone numbers, and one column contains the area code, you will likely have more than one phone number with the same value in the same column. Once this happens, you should set up a new table for area codes and link to its entries by referencing the primary key of the row the desired area code is stored in. So instead of id | area code | number ---+-----------+--------- 1 | 510 | 555-1234 2 | 510 | 555-1235 3 | 215 | 555-1236 4 | 215 | 555-1237 you would have id | area code id | number | area code ---+---------- ---+----------+----------- 1 | 510 1 | 555-1234 | 1 2 | 215 2 | 555-1235 | 1 3 | 555-1236 | 2 4 | 555-1237 | 2 The more occurences of the same value you have, the more likely will you save memory and get quicker performance if you organize your data in this way, especially when you're handling string values or binary data. Also, if an area code would change, all you need to do is update a single cell instead of having to perform an update operation on the whole table. Try this tutorial .
