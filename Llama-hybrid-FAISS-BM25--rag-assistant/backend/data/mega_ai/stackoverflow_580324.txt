There's no need to run P2's tests when P1's are run. If P2's code hasn't changed, running the tests again during would provide no benefit. If P2 breaks because of P1's tests, then more unit tests for P2 are required to ensure you have sufficient coverage (or perhaps you have an interface problem, which is a different issue entirely).
