Do you want to download an Excel file using your PHP script (ie- the PHP outputs a .xls file) or do you want it to produced HTML output that you can copy/paste into an Excel file without losing formatting? If the former, look into this nifty tool If you just want it to produce HTML that you can copy/paste into Excel, so long as your table is properly formatted (and from your source code, it looks like you need to add a at the end of your while loop) then you should just be able to drag and drop it Alternatively, Excel should be smart enough to recognize HTML tables so long as there is no tag encapsulating it. this article explains the process, but essentially you can send an Excel file (as per the first "nifty tool" suggestion) with just: header("Content-type: application/vnd.ms-excel"); echo " ... ";
