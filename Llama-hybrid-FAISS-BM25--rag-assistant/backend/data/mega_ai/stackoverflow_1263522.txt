Put your public structures and interface into the .h file. Put your private bits into the .c file. If I have more than one .c file that implements a logical set of functionality, I'll put the things that need to be shared among those implementation files into a *p.h file ('p' for private). Client code should not include the *p.h header. For example, if I have a set of routines that implement an XML parser, I might have the following organization: xmlparser.h - the public structures, types, enums, and function prototypes xmlparserp.h - private types, function prototypes, etc. that client code doesn't and shouldn't need xmlparser.c - implementation of the XML parser xmlutil.c - some other implementation bits (would include xmlparserp.h)
