This is what DigitalRoss and Jonathan Leffler were trying to say: echo "1234567890"|sed 's/[0-9][0-9][0-9]\([0-9][0-9][0-9]\)\([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\)/\1-\2/' This should work on all but the most brain-dead versions of sed , however it pays no attention to word boundaries, etc., or whether there are additional digits or groups of digits on the same line. It simply reformats the first ten digit sequence it finds. If you have spaces, tabs, commas or other delimiters, they can be used to further restrict the match.
