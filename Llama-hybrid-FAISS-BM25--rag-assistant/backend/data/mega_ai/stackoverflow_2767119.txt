I am not sure that I understand your goal. But if you wish to find the intersection of a collection of List objects, then you can do the following: public static List intersection(Collection > lists){ if (lists.size()==0) return Collections.emptyList(); Iterator > it = lists.iterator(); HashSet resSet = new HashSet (it.next()); while (it.hasNext()) resSet.retainAll(new HashSet (it.next())); return new ArrayList (resSet); } This code runs in linear time in the total number of items. Actually this is average linear time, because of the use of HashSet. Also, note that if you use ArrayList.contains() in a loop, it may result in quadratic complexity, since this method runs in linear time, unlike HashSet.contains() that runs in constant time.
