This kind of mathematical collinearity is not worth a lot of effort to solve as it has no consequences other than when you try to interpret a coefficient in isolation. In general, collinearity is harmful mainly when predicting on new data having collinearities that are inconsistent with the training data collinearities. Many regression programs use the QR decomposition internally, so any numerical problems are fixed without the user needing to pay attention to what's under the hood. QR is reversed to get the final coefficients and standard errors.
