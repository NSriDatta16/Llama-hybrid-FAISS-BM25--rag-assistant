I'd suggest the following. First create an algorithm that gives possible usernames, given an first name and last name. e.g. $foo->genPossibleUserNames('Dave', 'Smith'); could return dsmith (first initial, lastname) dasmith (first 2 initials . lastname) davesmith (first name . lastname) dave.smith (firstname '.' lastname) davsmith (first 3 initials . lastname) You would order this array of possible usernames by your personal preferences of course. You would then check the database for uniqueness of these names, and provide them as a list of options to your user. Of course if your user base grows large enough, having dsmith1 is inevitable, but at least this way it encourages users to choose something more preferable first.
