For large time series, I have grown to love smoothScatter (part of base R no less). I often have to include some additional data, and preserving the basic plot API is really helpful, for instance: set.seed(1) ra Which gives you (if you pardon the design): It's always available and works well with enormous datasets, so it's nice to at least take a look at what you have.
