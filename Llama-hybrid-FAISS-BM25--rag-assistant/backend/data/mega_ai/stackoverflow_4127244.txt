The Gallery application has no rights to access files in your application's storage directory. The Gallery application is not part of the Android operating system. The Gallery application is routinely replaced by device manufacturers with their own implementations, so even if you found some screwy back-door to the regular Gallery application that enabled this, it probably would not work on many devices. Android itself, in the open source project, has two Gallery applications (Gallery and Gallery3D), and I don't know which are necessarily on any device (if either) or which is the one that you think supplies "the default image gallery functionality". However, those Gallery applications are open source, and so you are welcome to copy whatever code you like out of them.
