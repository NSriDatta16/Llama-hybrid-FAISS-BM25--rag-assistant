How can I fit a polynomial given some prior knowledge but fewer observations than coefficients?

I want to fit a second degree polynomial to data from a fractional factorial design in five dimensions. Because of the cost of trials, I am initially only going to do eight runs. So I have fewer observations than the full number of first and second degree terms, including interaction terms. My goal is to find a local optimal point or region in the vicinity of my trials (if there is one) or direction of greatest increase (if there isn’t). I am saving budget for a few (I hope) confirmatory tests. For some, but less than half, of the total number of polynomial coefficients I have a very rough idea of their magnitude from a literature review. For others I know the sign, but not the value. It is my belief that I can estimate the coefficients using some kind of penalized regression. But I don’t know how to incorporate my prior knowledge, and I don’t know whether I should alter my experimental design in some way based on that knowledge (e.g. by structuring is so that the aliased interaction terms are ones where I have some prior information). I have done a lot of kinds of regression over the years, but I have not looked at anything Bayesian since I was an undergraduate, lo these many years ago. So I’d like a response that’s a little more of a how-to than “Oh, use a Bayesian LASSO” or whatever. Extra karma points for an answer with some pointers toward an R implimentation.
