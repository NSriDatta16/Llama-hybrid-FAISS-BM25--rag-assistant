XML reconciliation

Is there a design pattern for the following situation: I have a XML file generated that can be changed by the user in predefined ways (affecting attributes, not the overall structure). Upon regenerating the file, I want the changes performed by the user to be reapplied (where possible). The dumb way (though not impossible to actually implement in my case) would be to persist all user changes as XSLT fragments (small templates changing the attribute of some node identified by some XPath-expression) and use this to transform the newly generated file, but I have a feeling that there must be a more general way. (A textual diff is not what I want.)
