A very interesting presentation on the AI for games can be found here : The tutorial will give an introduction to the area of applying AI techniques, such as learning, search and planning, to video games. It will focus on past and recent applications, open problems and promising avenues for future research, and on resources available to people who would like to work in this space. Other than a good coverage of the theory you'll find links to a number of games (some open source like NERO & TORCS) that implement the ideas discussed.
