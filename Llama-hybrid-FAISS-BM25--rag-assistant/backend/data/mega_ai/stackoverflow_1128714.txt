Based on this article, it seems that DataContractSerializer does not have support for customizing the resultant xml. http://www.danrigsby.com/blog/index.php/2008/03/07/xmlserializer-vs-datacontractserializer-serialization-in-wcf/ From the MS site there is an important note: 'The DataContractAttribute attribute should not be applied to classes that already implement the ISerializable interface or that are marked with the SerializableAttribute. An exception is thrown if you try to serialize an instance of such a type.' PS: Sorry I couldn't post the second link, but the engine does not allow post more than one link to new users.
