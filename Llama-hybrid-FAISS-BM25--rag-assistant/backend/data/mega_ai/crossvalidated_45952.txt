When dealing with time series data must the time periods be equal intervals or annual?

So like the title states, do the time periods in time series data have to be of equal intervals? For example, if we wanted to have data on the level of education recorded by year, would we need observations for 1996, 1997, 1998,...,2002 or could we have data for 1996, 2000, and 2004? It seems to me that it would need to be of equal spacing intervals, but I just want to make sure that a time interval of say 1997, 1998, 2000, 2003 wouldn't be acceptable.
