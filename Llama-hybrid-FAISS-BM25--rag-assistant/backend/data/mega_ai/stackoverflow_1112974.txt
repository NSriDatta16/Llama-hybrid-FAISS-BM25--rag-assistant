Create droppable area that can accept random text/images

I'm trying to create a droppable area that can accept random text, images, or text and images. I know how to create a droppable in jQuery, but it only accepts items that are explicitly declared draggable. All I want to do is highlight random text, images, or text and images using my mouse in the browser and drag it (imagine highlighting this parenthesized statement and dragging it - no need for an actual draggable) over to the droppable area. How can I create a droppable area that accepts random things and can give me information about what is being dropped into them? Any help is greatly appreciated. Regards, David
