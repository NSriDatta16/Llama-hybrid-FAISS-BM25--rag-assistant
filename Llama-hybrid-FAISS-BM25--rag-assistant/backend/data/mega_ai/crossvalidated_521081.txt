Question regarding positive recurrence

Suppose that $\{Y_n\}$ is an irreducible discrete time Markov chain with transition matrix $P = \{P_{i,j}\}_{i,j \in S}$ . Let $\{Z_n\}$ be a discrete time Markov chain such that if it is in state $i$ , then it either moves according to $P$ with probability $p_i$ or does nothing with probability $1-p_i$ . If $\{Y_n\}$ is positive recurrent, is it true that $\{Z_n\}$ is positive recurrent? I managed to show that $\{Z_n\}$ is irreducible, but I can't seem to find a counterexample/proof to this. Is there any suggestion?
