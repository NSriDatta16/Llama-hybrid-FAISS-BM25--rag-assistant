All the applications installed under Mac OS X are registered in the Launch Services database. The Launch Services framework contains a helper shell command lsregister which among other uses can dump the information stored in the Launch Services database. Under Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 that command is located in the following folder: /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister Using a few simple grep filters one can extract the full paths of all registered applications: lsregister -dump | grep --after-context 1 "^bundle" | grep --only-matching "/.*\.app" Putting it all together, the following AppleScript will compute the user visible names of all registered applications using the info for command: property pLSRegisterPath : "/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister" set theAppPaths to every paragraph of (do shell script pLSRegisterPath & " -dump | grep --after-context 1 \"^bundle\" | grep --only-matching \"/.*\\.app\"") set theNames to {} repeat with thePath in theAppPaths try copy displayed name of (info for (thePath as POSIX file)) to end of theNames end try end repeat choose from list theNames
