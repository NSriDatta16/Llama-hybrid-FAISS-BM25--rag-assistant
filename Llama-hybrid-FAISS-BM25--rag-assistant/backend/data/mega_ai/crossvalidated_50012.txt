Cost function NN with weight derivation

In a single layered neural network with a sigmoid function (to make it easy to understand) the cost function is $E_j = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{K}(\text{target}_{jk} - \text{observed}_{jk})^2 + a\sum_{i=1}^{I}w_{ij}^2.$ So this is a two part problem and I know how to derive the first half at both the hidden and output layers. But, for the second half, I am not sure. Any advice or help would be great. Thank you.
