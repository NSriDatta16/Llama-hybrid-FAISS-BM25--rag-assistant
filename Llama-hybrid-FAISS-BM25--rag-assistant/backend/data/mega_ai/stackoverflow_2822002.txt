Why is Ruby on Rails called a domain-specific language?

Recently, when I tried to explain why Ruby on Rails is a domain-specific language (DSL) to an intern at my organisation, I was not able to articulate my reasoning to the effect I would like to. Maybe I do not understand the space well enough to teach the nuances. Redirecting him to Martin Fowler' article or the Google ranked one InfoQ or other material has not helped much either. Can some explain why Rails is a DSL with an example / parallel situation which is not voodoo stuff for someone who is fairly new to the world of code? Understanding the ideology might also help in elaborating the intricacies of the rails ecosystem?
