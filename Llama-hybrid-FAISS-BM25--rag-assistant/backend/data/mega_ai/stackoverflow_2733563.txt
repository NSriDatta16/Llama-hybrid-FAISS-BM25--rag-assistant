When you create a jquery object from html, it's immediately evaluated (because the document fragment is created), so this: $(" ") Immediately causes a fetch of the image. The way I see it you had 3 quick options (and probably others, but hard to say without more context to your question): Replace {video.image} before creating the jQuery object. Remove src="{video.image}" , just find the via the selector you already have and set the src attribute later, like this: $(ajax_data).find('img').attr('src','myImage.jpg'); Do everything you want via regex before inserting anything into the DOM.
