Ronald Fisher proposed an exact test of the maximum periodogram coordinate in R.A. Fisher, Proc. R. Soc A (1929) 125:54. The test is based on the g-statistic. Specifically, the null hypothesis of Gaussian white noise is rejected if g is significantly large, that is, if one of the values ​​of $f(\omega_k)$ is significantly higher than the average of all signals. You can get more details about the test in MB Priestley, Spectral Analysis and Time Series , Academic Press, London, 1981, page 406. In R, the package GeneCycle contains the function fisher.g.test() : library(GeneCycle) ?fisher.g.test Hope this helps.
