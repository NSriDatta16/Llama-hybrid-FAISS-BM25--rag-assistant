you don't specify if xml is a format requirement you only say it needs to be hierarchical like xml. Without more detail on the kind of data it's hard to give you very much advice. So here's a small list. b-trees there are a number of libraries supporting b-tree storage formats in mulitiple languages. they have fast lookups and are hierarchical in nature. Protocol-Buffers from google. Compact storage optimized for sending over the wire. Not neccessarily optimized as a storage format though. They are typed though and probably will do pretty well as a storage format. Zipped text formats. compact, and depending on the format chosen typed and hierarchical in nature. YAML (supporting for some complex typing, hierarchical, human readable) JSON (less typing support, fast parsing, hierarchical, human readable)
