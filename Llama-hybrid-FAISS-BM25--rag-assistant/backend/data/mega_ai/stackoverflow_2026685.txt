How to change the default output from a Maven 2 / Cobertura instrument goal?

when i instrument my classes using Maven 2 using the command mvn cobertura:instrument The output (the instrumented classes) are put in \target\generated-classes. Is there a way to change the output location to \target\classes? I checked the instrumentation tasks of the cobertura-maven plugin but this does not give me a solution sofar.
