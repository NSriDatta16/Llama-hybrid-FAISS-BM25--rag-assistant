data structure for traversal tree in PHP?

I don't have a background in CS or data structures. I want to make a PHP class that stores a modified preorder transversal tree , for manipulation and syncing with a database. Basically I need to store data like: +-------------+----------------------+-----+-----+ | category_id | name | lft | rgt | +-------------+----------------------+-----+-----+ | 1 | ELECTRONICS | 1 | 20 | | 2 | TELEVISIONS | 2 | 9 | | 3 | TUBE | 3 | 4 | | 4 | LCD | 5 | 6 | | 5 | PLASMA | 7 | 8 | | 6 | PORTABLE ELECTRONICS | 10 | 19 | | 7 | MP3 PLAYERS | 11 | 14 | | 8 | FLASH | 12 | 13 | | 9 | CD PLAYERS | 15 | 16 | | 10 | 2 WAY RADIOS | 17 | 18 | +-------------+----------------------+-----+-----+ I was thinking of using an array, but it seems cumbersome. If it were an array of arrays like this: array( 'name'=> "PORTABLE ELECTRONICS", 'lft' => 10, 'rgt' = 19 ) , then it would get cumbersome to loop through that array repeatedly to make sure all numbers are present, etc. Since PHP has a few new data structures available, I wonder if any of these would get me any benefit over using an array? SplDoubly LinkedList SplStack SplQueue SplHeap SplMaxHeap SplMinHeap SplPriorityQueue SplFixedArray SplObjectStorage Edit: This class isn't going to be a gateway to a tree stored in a database table. (If it were, I would just have a query of classes.) It's just a stand-alone mmpt in some kind of PHP data structure.
