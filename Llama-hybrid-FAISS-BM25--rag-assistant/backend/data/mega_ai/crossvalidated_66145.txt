Difference in variance of factor scores for supplementary and active observations PCA

I've been trying to find an answer to this but I haven't been successful. I encounter a problem when adding supplementary individuals to PCA. The variance of the factor scores decreases dramatically when adding supplementary observations. I am doing a PCA in R on genome data. The data table has 1645 rows (individuals) and 23,446 columns (SNPs). I use a subset of 103 rows to do the PCA and then project the remaining individuals on the PCA using the eigenvector matrix. I first standardize the matrix by subtracting the column means. I also subtract these column means from the columns of the whole sample. Taking into account that the number of columns largely exceed the number of rows I then perform the Eigen decomposition on $XX^t$ and then multiply the obtained eigenvector matrix by $X^t$ to obtain the Eigenvector/loadings matrix of $X^tX$ . I then multiply the loadings matrix with (1) the matrix of the 'active' individuals, and (2) the complete matrix (the whole sample). Now my problem: the variance of the factor scores for the 'active' individuals (red) far exceeds the variance of the factor scores for the whole sample. (~ by a factor of 10, variances take values 114 and 12 respectively). I would have expected the variances to be almost the same or rather the variance for the whole sample to be bigger. I've been looking for an explanation for quite a while now and I get the feeling that I am stuck. Anyone can help me out? I highly appreciate any hint!
