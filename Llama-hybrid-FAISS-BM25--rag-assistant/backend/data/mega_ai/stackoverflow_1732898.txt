I don't know about IEMobile's own APIs, but how about injecting some JScript into the browser control's Document and accessing navigator.userAgent ? (Be prepared for headaches with Windows Mobile 6.5 though. The WebBrowser control doesn't behave in the same way as the browser itself. And the version number of IEMobile is the same on 6.5 as it is on 6.1.4, despite the rendering between the two being very different. Sigh.)
