From Adolphe Quetelet's "A Treatise on Man and the Development of his Faculties": If man increased equally in all dimensions, his weight at different ages would be as the cube of his height. Now, this is not what we really observe. The increase of weight is slower, except during the first year after birth; then the proportion we have just pointed out is pretty regularly observed. But after this period, and until near the age of puberty, weight increases nearly as the square of the height. The development of weight again becomes very rapid at puberty, and almost stops after the twenty-fifth year. In general, we do not err much when we assume that during development the squares of the weight at different ages are as the fifth powers of the height; which naturally leads to this conclusion, in supporting the specific gravity constant, that the transverse growth of man is less than the vertical. See here . He wasn't interested in characterizing obesity but the relationship between weight and height as he was very interested in biometry and bell curves. Quetelet's findings indicated that BMI had an approximately normal distribution in the population. This signified to him that he had found the "correct" relationship. (interestingly, only a decade or two later Francis Galton would approach the issue of the "distribution of height" in populations and coin the term "Regression to the Mean"). It's worth noting that the BMI has been a scourge of biometry in modern days because of the Framingham's study's far reaching utilization of BMI as a way of identifying obesity. There is still a lack of any good predictor of obesity (and health related outcomes thereof). The waist to hip measurement ratio is a promising candidate. Hopefully as ultrasounds become cheaper and better, doctors will use them to identify not only obesity, but fatty deposits and calcification in organs and make recommendations for care based on those.
