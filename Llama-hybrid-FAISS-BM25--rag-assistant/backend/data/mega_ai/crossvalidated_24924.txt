Some great answers. I'd like to take a slightly different tack, and address the question of counter-intuitivity. (I quite agree, BTW) Here's how I make sense of it. Imagine a column of random sequential coin-toss results printed on a paper tape, consisting of the letters "H" and "T". Arbitrarily tear off a section of this tape, and make an identical copy. On a given tape, the sequence HTH and the sequence HTT will each occur as often, if the tape is long enough. But occasionally the HTH instances will run together, ie HTHTH. (or even very occasionally HTHTHTH) This overlap cannot happen with HTT instances. Use a highlighter to pick out the "stripes" of successful outcomes, HTH on one tape and HTT on the other. A few of the HTH stripes will be shorter due to the overlap. Consequently the gaps between them, on average, will be slightly longer than on the other tape. It's a bit like waiting for a bus, when averagely there's one every five minutes. If the buses are allowed to overlap each other, the interval will be slightly longer than five minutes, on average, because sometime two will go past together. If you arrive at an arbitrary time, you'll be waiting slightly longer for the next (to you, first) bus, on average, if they're allowed to overlap.
