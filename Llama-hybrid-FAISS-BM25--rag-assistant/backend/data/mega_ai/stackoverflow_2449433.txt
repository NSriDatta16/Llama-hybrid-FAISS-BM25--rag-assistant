As @kgrad says, /* */ does not nest and can cause errors. A better answer is: // LINE *of code* I WANT COMMENTED // LINE *of code* I WANT COMMENTED // LINE *of code* I WANT COMMENTED Most IDEs have a single keyboard command for doing/undoing this, so there's really no reason to use the other style any more. For example: in eclipse, select the block of text and hit Ctrl+/ To undo that type of comment, use Ctrl+\ UPDATE: The Sun (now Oracle) coding convention says that this style should not be used for block text comments: // Using the slash-slash // style of comment as shown // in this paragraph of non-code text is // against the coding convention. but // can be used 3 other ways: A single line comment A comment at the end of a line of code Commenting out a block of code
