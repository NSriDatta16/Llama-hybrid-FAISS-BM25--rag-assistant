Music analysis software

Greetings I may have imagined this but does anyone know if Last.fm previously used some form of open source project to perform analysis on music to determine similar music. As its now moved to a pay version I'd like to make something which can add known music to my playlist. (I hate scanning my computer for similar music manually) Failing that - does anyone know of any system that I could use to replace this ? Ideally I'd like some form of API / Source code that I can use to automate the whole process into batch jobs. Thanks, [edit] Ideally I was looking for something more along the lines of content matching. I'm the type of person who just throws all my music into one unorganized location. Then being lazy I would ideally expect a playlist to be generated giving me a similar music type of playlist. Last.fm uses http://www.audioscrobbler.net/ - it also provides access to its database via an API. [/edit]
