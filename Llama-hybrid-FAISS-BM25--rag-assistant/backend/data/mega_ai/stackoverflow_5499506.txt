In general: Find out what takes so much time, executing the query or retrieving the results If its the query execution, the query plan will tell you which indexes are missing, just press the display query plan button in the SSMS and you will get hints on which indexes you should create to increase performance If its the retrieval of the values, there is not much you can do about it besides upgrading hardware (ram, disk, network etc.) But: In your case it looks like the query is a full table scan , which is never good for performance, check if you really need to retrieve all this data at once. Since there are no clauses what so ever its unlikely that its the query execution that is the problem. Meaning additional indexes will not help. You will need to change the way the application access the data. Instead of loading all clients into memory and then search from them in memory you will need to pass on the search term to the database query. LinqToSql enable you to use different features for searching values, here is a blog describing most of them: http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2007/11/23/LINQToSQLLIKEOperatorGeneratingLIKESQLServer.aspx
