Are you sure Flash gets that you're embedding fonts? The following works fine for me: New FLA: put a text field on the stage and type some text into it. Set textfield to "input text" and give it an instance name of "tf". Open the "Character Embedding" and hit "Auto fill", then "OK". Add the following frame script: trans(tf); function trans( d:DisplayObject ) { var tr:Transform = d.transform; var m:Matrix = tr.matrix; m.scale( .5, 2 ); tr.matrix = m; d.transform = tr; } For me, testing movie now results in a text field that is visibly stretched. If it's not working for you, my first guess would be that Flash isn't considering the font to be embedded, which can happen for a couple of reasons (that I could take a guess at if this does indeed appear to be your problem).
