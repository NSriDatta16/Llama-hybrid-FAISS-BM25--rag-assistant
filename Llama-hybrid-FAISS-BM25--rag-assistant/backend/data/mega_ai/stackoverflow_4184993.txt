Complex items in WebForms ListView

I'm currently using a ListView in my webformsapplication. This ListView generates a table with (currently) three columns. "Username", "Organization" and "Locked". These are represented with string, string and checkbox respectively. The checkbox should postback on change, but that is (possibly) for another question... Should I use or to inject the data? This is more relevant for the checkbox... It seems very "dirty" to write /> Or should I use another container alltogether?
