Here's a paper on it that's pretty straight forward ( PDF Link ). The complexity of the Bellman-Ford algorithm depends on the number of edge examinations, or relaxation calls. (Note this is different from relaxation steps which refer to the actual changes performed.) As mentioned, the number of relaxation calls can be smaller than |V ||E| with the BGL implementation. In fact, it is much smaller than |V ||E| in the average case. It lists pseudocode and further analysis as well.
