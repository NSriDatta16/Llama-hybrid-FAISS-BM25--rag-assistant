Good Data Structure for Unit Conversion?

StackOverflow crowd. I have a very open-ended software design question. I've been looking for an elagant solution to this for a while and I was wondering if anyone here had some brilliant insight into the problem. Consider this to be like a data structures puzzle. What I am trying to do is to create a unit converter that is capable of converting from any unit to any unit. Assume that the lexing and parsing is already done. A few simple examples: Convert("days","hours") // Yields 24 Convert("revolutions", "degrees") // Yields 360 To make things a little more complicated, it must smoothly handle ambiguities between inputs: Convert("minutes","hours") // Yields (1/60) Convert("minutes","revolutions") // Yields (1/21600) To make things even more fun, it must handle complex units without needing to enumerate all possibilities: Convert("meters/second","kilometers/hour") Convert("miles/hour","knots") Convert("Newton meters","foot pounds") Convert("Acre feet","meters^3") There's no right or wrong answer, I'm looking for ideas on how to accomplish this. There's always a brute force solution, but I want something elegant that is simple and scalable.
