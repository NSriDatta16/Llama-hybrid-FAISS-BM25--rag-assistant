What you need to use is the jQuery Droppable class, which you can read about in the jQuery docs . Basically, for every element that you wish to be able to drop a draggable element on, you create a Droppable object, which will trigger once another object is dragged onto it. This is the example from the jQuery docs: $(function() { $( "#draggable" ).draggable(); $( "#droppable" ).droppable({ drop: function( event, ui ) { $( this ) .addClass( "ui-state-highlight" ) .find( "p" ) .html( "Dropped!" ); } }); }); The $(this) in that example is the element you are looking for.
