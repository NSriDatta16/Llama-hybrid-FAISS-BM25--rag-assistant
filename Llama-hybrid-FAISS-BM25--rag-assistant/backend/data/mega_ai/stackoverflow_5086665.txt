I ran into this same bug today. I was able to fix it within the organizer by deleting everything under the Projects & Sources section in the upper left corner of the organizer. If you have transferred a large amount of data from the iphone in the past, you may have lots of files still sitting in the Projects & Sources section. If you have deleted them from disk, you will see them show up in red text (indicating they have been deleted). All I had to do was delete all of these files, restart xcode and disconnect/reconnect my iphone. After that, the disclosure triangle showed up and all was right again with the organizer. I was then able to download all my application data to my desktop.
