SSH Remote Command Hangs

Does anyone know why this command, ssh -v user@address "exec ssh-agent bash" ...would hang on this output? debug1: Sending command: exec ssh-agent bash I'm trying to automatically setup a set of remote machines so they can SSH into each other without passwords. Have already scp'd over the relevant private key file. Need to run ssh-add on each instance. But first, I need to start the ssh-agent. But the command above hangs. Starting the agent manually on each instance is not really an option. Running "ps ux" on the remote machine manually confirms that the ssh-agent is running: USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND ubuntu 746 0.0 0.2 8844 1380 ?
