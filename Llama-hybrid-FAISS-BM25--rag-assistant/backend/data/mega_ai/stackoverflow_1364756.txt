There is an easy solution in the July 2009 release of the Silverlight Toolkit, the GetParentItem extension method in TreeViewExtensions. Download and install the Silverlight Toolkit . Add a reference to System.Windows.Controls.Toolkit (which can be found in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Silverlight\v3.0\Toolkit\Jul09\Bin). From the method you want to get the parent (I'm going to use the SelectedItemChanged event by way of example): private void OrgTree_SelectedItemChanged(object sender, RoutedPropertyChangedEventArgs e) { if (e.NewValue != null) { var parent = ((TreeView)sender).GetParentItem(e.NewValue); if (parent != null) { Status.Text = "Parent is " + parent.ToString(); } }; } There are quite a few great extensions hiding in there that I'd encourage you to explore for setting the selected item, expanding nodes and getting the containers of items.
