(1) This causes dummy variable trap , you should have $k-1$ dummies if there are $k$ occupations. This option will create thousands of new variables, but since you've a very large dataset, it may not be a huge problem. Still (4) is more sound to me. In cases where $n , where $n$ is number of samples and $p$ is number of total features, you need to regularise your model well. (3) I think Tenure and Years of experience are two different measurements and don't result in multicollinearity. The feature itself may or may not be useful, that I don't know. (4) This is in general better than (1) since the cluster and the title nearly determines the salary range of that person. And, you wouldn't treat Data Scientist and Data Science Specialist differently. Also, it reduces number of variables to train. (2) is a good idea. Especially if the difference between steps are really uniform.
