Getting a file from the client to the server in asp.net mvc

Getting a file from the client to the server in asp.net mvc What is the best way to get a file from the client to the server in asp.net mvc? Will hosting allow you to save a file to their server these days or do you have to save the file on their server? Or is cloud storage the only way (of course then how do you process the file without getting it from the cloud). Also, are there any really good examples of uploading a file, reading it and putting it in the database for asp.net mvc?
