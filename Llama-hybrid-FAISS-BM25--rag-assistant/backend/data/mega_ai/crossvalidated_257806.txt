Developing a Bayesian model in R (rephrased)

I wanted to rephrase an earlier question to try and be less vague. I'm essentially looking for help understanding basic Bayesian inference. Let's say I want to predict the transfer rate of a high school in its first year of existence. To do this I feel like the ideal set up would be looking at it from a Bayesian perspective. Since I don't have any historical information from the school, I want to take the transfer rates from other schools in the district (labeled rates). rates I believe that these rates would be my prior. The issue is I'm not sure what my next step would be. Without data from the school, I'm not sure where the likelihood and posterior distribution would come from. Any guidance or help would be appreciated. I feel like I'm looking at the question wrong, which if I am, feel free to say.
