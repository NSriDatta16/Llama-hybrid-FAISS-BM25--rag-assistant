To make a pane "free-floatting" just drag that pane outside the main eclipse window. If you have only one monitor, you have to resize first your eclipse window: you can not leave eclipse maximized on all the screen space. Then you have to drag your pane outside the eclipse window until you see the cursor change into a little window with a '+' in the middle . Once all your panes are in the required position, save your configuration in a new perspective . (Menu Window\Save Perspective As ) That way, you can switch between panes configurations easily. Regarding the SDI aspect however, the editor part of eclipse is made to edit several document (so, MDI only). Karl's double-click suggestion is the most effective to focus on one of those edited document.
