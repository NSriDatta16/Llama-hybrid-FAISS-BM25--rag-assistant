UserControl (Add listview GridViewColumn from another user control)

I want to add a GridViewColumn to a ListView which resides in a UserControl from another Windows screen (Parent). Example: I want to use this user control in Windows. How can I change the ListView Style, ItemContainerStyle, or add GridViewColumn? Please let me know is there any other way to design this scenario. Regards, Jegan
