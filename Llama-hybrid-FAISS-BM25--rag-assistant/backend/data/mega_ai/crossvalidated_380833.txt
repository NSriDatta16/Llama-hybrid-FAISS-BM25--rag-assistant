Std dev should be less than 0.289 (help in understanding)

In Kruschke’s book (Doing Bayesian Analysis), he talks about using mean and standard deviation as one way to establish the beta priors for Binomial Bayesian model. He advises that the std dev should be less than 0.289, “which is the standard deviation of uniform density.” That is a = 1, b = 1. My confusion is that lower std dev indicates tighter distribution. But we should be cautious about being overconfident in the prior. Can I request help in understanding this? How does larger alpha and beta values change standard deviation? Thanks!
