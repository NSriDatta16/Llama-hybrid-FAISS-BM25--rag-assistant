It is very common to build ARIMA-GARCH models, i.e. ones with an ARIMA specification for the conditional mean and GARCH for the conditional variance. You can see this from time series textbooks , academic articles and threads on Cross Validated tagged with both arima and garch . Point forecasting stock returns is notoriously difficult, so I would not expect much success with that regardless of what model you choose. However, modelling the conditional variance with GARCH can be a good way for accounting for volatility clustering, and GARCH remains a popular class of models for that.
