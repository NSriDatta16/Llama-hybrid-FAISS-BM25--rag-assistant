What an excellent and intriguing question! I would propose a different kind of transformation, though, that retains a little bit of more information. What you basically have in your survey is a human (/ are a bunch of humans) trying to predict a ground truth (= "seen before" / "not seen before") that is known only to you and you alone. For all those predictions those humans have offered a self-reported confidence level (ranging from "sure" [1,9] to "not so sure" [4,6]). I'm heavily into machine learning projects right now (and since if you show a problem to an apple tree it would always propose "apples, of course!" as the solution) I immediately thought of a confusion matrix with a variable confidence level as a possible approach. How would that work? Transformation / Feature Engineering Building the Confusion Matrix Scoring the Test 1. Transformation / Feature Engineering Assumptions: We could assume that answers with a Likert Scale value from 1 to 4 predict a "0" and answers with a value from 6 to 9 predict a "1". We could also assume that there are the following confidence levels: 4 and 6 — 25% confidence (not so sure) 3 and 7 — 50% confidence (a bit sure) 2 and 8 — 75% confidence (moderately sure) 1 and 9 — 100% confidence (sure) We could also assume that an answer with a value of 5 can be treated as "N/A", as the participant was not sure at all about their answer. Therefore we can construct a table from the answers like RespondentID, QuestionID, GroundTruth, Prediction, Confidence 1702,1,1,1,0.75 1702,2,0,1,0.25 1702,3,1,1,0.75 1702,4,1,1,1.00 1702,5,0,1,0.50 1702,7,1,1,0.25 ... We also can calculate a result column with values being either 0 or 1 (i.e., was the answer correct?) from GroundTruth and Prediction . This would look like this: RespondentID, QuestionID, GroundTruth, Prediction, Confidence, Result 1702,1,1,1,0.75,1 1702,2,0,1,0.25,0 1702,3,1,1,0.75,1 1702,4,1,1,1.00,1 1702,5,0,1,0.50,0 1702,7,1,1,0.25,1 ... Now we can calculate: How good was our participant, actually? 2. Building the Confusion Matrix A confusion matrix a fundamental tool in the evaluation of predictive systems. Your participants, for the purpose of this experiment, is such a system. So let's evaluate them! There are four central terms you have to know: True Positive - Has seen the picture before and answered correctly True Negative - Has not seen the picture before and answered correctly False Positive (False Alarm) - Has not seen the picture before and falsely remembered it False Negative (Miss) - Has seen the picture before, but could not remember True Positive and True Negative are good cases , False Positive and False Negative are bad cases . With this information you can actually find out how good the participant performed on various metrics. For this purpose, I have created an Excel file with dummy data so you can play around with it. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4QXhnd6LLcHaEl6SjkwN0NvSVhVc3VhRTNVT0NxeXhPaE9v/view?usp=sharing So, but how do we calculate a score? 3. Scoring the Test You have already proposed a method: using the confidence as a multiplier. There is nothing wrong with it, buuuuut: Was this methodology clear from the beginning? Was it communicated clearly to the participants? What does "sure" / "not so sure" mean for every participant? Are the meanings homogenous? What is more, you should ask yourself what you want to achieve with your methodology: Do you want to reward participants who are more confident? If yes, how much? Do you want to punish wrong answers? If yes, how severely? What do you want to do with participants who answered "5"? and many more... I mean, after all you could score the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of the participant's answers?! But just for completeness' sake I have added a points column, so it now reads RespondentID, QuestionID, GroundTruth, Prediction, Confidence, Result 1702,1,1,1,0.75,1,0.75 1702,2,0,1,0.25,0,0.00 1702,3,1,1,0.75,1,0.75 1702,4,1,1,1.00,1,1.00 1702,5,0,1,0.50,0,0.00 1702,7,1,1,0.25,1,0.25 ... All right, I have to go back to work. Hope I could give you some food for though. If you have any follow-up questions please do not hesitate to use the comment function.
