This page (search for RECURSIVE_TRIGGERS ) describes some of the database settings you can use to modify this behavior. Also, one way to safeguard your procedures is to use either the UPDATE() function or the COLUMNS_UPDATED() function. If, for example, you have a table with columns A , B , and C , and you want the value of C to change automagically when the value in column B is updated, you can protect the call in the trigger: CREATE TRIGGER Whatever ON TableName AFTER UPDATE AS BEGIN IF UPDATE(B) BEGIN /* Update column C here */ END END This way you avoid calling the trigger recursively when column C is updated by your trigger. COLUMNS_UPDATED() is also useful, but I find it to be fragile (relies on position of column instead of column name).
