I would add, for the sake of usability, clicking and dragging. I'll not provide the code, it's complex plugin if you want to do it "right" ;) Drag has the onCancel event, where you can check if the user actually started dragging or just clicked or long-clicked the draggable element. For the dragging you can a) set a limit, so the user doesn't open the element all the way or b) stop dragging after opening the slider for x pixels and sliding the rest of the way with an animation. This way it acts like the touch slider you know from mobile phones, where an initial short touch slide initiates opening a dropdown/menu/navigation.
