Clustering time series

I want to create forecasting for a large quantity of time series. Since they are too many, I am thinking on reducing my data by clustering it into to similar groups. However, I am using SPSS modeler and it is not possible to cluster time series (only static data). Do you think it makes sense to apply clustering on static data and fit the forecasting model on its centroide? Which software do you suggest to cluster the time series directly? Thanks!
