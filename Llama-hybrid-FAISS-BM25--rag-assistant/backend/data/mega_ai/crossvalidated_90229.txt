Each rater should hear the excerpts in a randomised order. It doesn't matter if you average scores across raters or across 'expressive' or 'non-expressive' performances, you should still randomise the order. Also the post above makes a good point about cutting the length of listening time for each excerpt - 1 minute seems too long. 20 seconds might be plenty. This will avoid fatigue
