Please do not take this the wrong way, but it sounds like you are in danger of over-engineering a solution based on the "requirement" that 'the client would like some added security'. The gatekeeper pattern that is described on page 13 of the Security Best Practices For Developing Windows Azure Applications document is a very big gun which you should only fire at large targets, i.e., scenarios where you actually need hardened applications storing highly sensitive data. Building something like this will potentially cost a lot of time & performance, so make sure you weigh pro's & con's thoroughly. Have you considered leveraging SQL Azure firewall as an additional (and possibly acceptable) security measure? You can specify access on an IP address level and even configure it programmatically through stored procedures. You can block all external access to your database, making your Azure application (web/worker roles) the only "client" that is allowed to gain access.
