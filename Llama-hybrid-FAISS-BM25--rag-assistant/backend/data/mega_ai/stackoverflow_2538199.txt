How XAMPP 1.7.3 can support PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.2 and other lower PHP

I would like to know how to setup XAMPP Server with multiple PHP versions (eg PHP 5.3, 5.2, 5, and 4), I know WAMP can easily do this, But I have problem with a WP Plugin using WAMP. Now if XAMPP can support PHP version, It would make my life easy and organize; Compare to installing both WAMP and XAMPP (that I did last time, before I formated my workstation. Now I wont do that again if I have options). note: I'm using Windows 7 and installed XAMPP 1.7.3. Thanks!
