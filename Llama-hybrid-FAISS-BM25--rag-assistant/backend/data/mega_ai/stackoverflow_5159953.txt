Android - track events of other application

I am developing an application where I pdf files in the assets folder to applicaitons internal storage and display them on screen. Onclick of each document I launch Adobe reader to display the document. I have to delete the documents once the user finishes viewing the documents. I am not sure on which event I should write the "Delete" part of the code. When I invoke the adobe reader my app is going into pause/stop state. But if I delete the files in on Pause()/onStop(), the reader is not able to access these files as I am deleting these. I need to delete the files after he exits the pdf reader. Is there a way I can handle this? Or is there a logic to code this requirement?
