The alternative does not need to be exhaustive neither the null hypothesis must necessarily mean something different than what it states. For example, consider three independent observations $X_i\sim N(\mu_i,1)$ , $i=1,2,3$ , where $(\mu_1,\mu_2,\mu_3)\in\mathbb R^3$ and the problem of testing $H_0:\mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3$ vs $H_1:\mu_1\leqslant\mu_2\leqslant\mu_3$ with at least one inequality being strict. This is a basic problem of order restricted inference, see e.g. Robertson, Wright and Dykstra (1988, Order Restricted Statistical Inference) or Silvapulle and Sen (2005, Constrained Statistical Inference: Inequality, Order, and Shape Restrictions). In this problem the null hypothesis does not mean anything else than that the three distributions coincide while the two hypotheses are not exhaustive.
