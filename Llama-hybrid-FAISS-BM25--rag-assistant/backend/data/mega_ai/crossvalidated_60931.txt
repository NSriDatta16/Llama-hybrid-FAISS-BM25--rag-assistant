Started as a comment, grew too long... it's not 'sampled' at regular intervals, so I think it doesn't qualify as a Time Series data This is an erroneous conclusion - it's certainly time series. A time series may be irregularly sampled, it just tends to require different from the usual approaches when it is. This problem appears to be related to stochastic problems like dam levels (water is generally used at a fairly stable rate over time, sometimes increasing or decreasing more or less quickly, while at other times its fairly stable), while dam levels tend to only increase rapidly (essentially in jumps), as rainfall occurs. The paper usage and replenishment patterns may be somewhat similar (though the amount ordered may tend to be much more stable and in much rounder numbers than rainfall amounts, and to occur whenever the level gets low). It's also related to insurance company capital (but kind of reversed) - aside initial capital, money from premiums (net operating costs) and investments comes in fairly steadily (sometimes more or less), while insurance policy payments tend to be made in relatively large amounts. Both of those things have been modelled, and may provide a little insight for this problem.
