If you store images files anywhere on the external storage (with the exception of locations that also contain a .nomedia file), the media scanner, and thus the built-in "Gallery" app, will locate them and display them. To be a good citizen you should place such files in the recommended location on the external storage using getExternalStoragePublicDirectory . You can pass that DIRECTORY_PICTURES for images. Be advised though, that stuff is only available as of API level 8. If you need to also support earlier API versions you can use getExternalStorageDirectory and still use the correct recommended path on your own. And, as always, you need to make sure the external storage is available before you try to write to it.
