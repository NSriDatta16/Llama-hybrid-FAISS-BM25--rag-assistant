You can use this to generate a crontab that runs at specific intervals: http://www.robertplank.com/cron/ Or this http://www.webmaster-toolkit.com/cron-generator.shtml One solution would be to setup 6 crons, 1 for each month, each would run at 7 am every day that month. It's probably the easiest way, the next one up would be to script it.
