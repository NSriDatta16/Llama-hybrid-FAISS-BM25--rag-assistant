Best way to find out -- start an open source project and see people's usage/reaction. It sounds very interesting to me -- but I personally don't find it very much useful. Perhaps we're just not at the point where concurrent programming is as prevalent and easy as it could be. With the promotion of functional programming, I guess the world would move towards avoiding thread synchronization as much as possible (thus making thread scheduling less of an impact in overall performance) From my personal subjective experience, most performance problems in software can be solved by improving one single bottleneck area that accounts for 90% of the slowdown. This optimizer may help find that out. I am not sure how much the scheduling strategy could improve overall performance, though. Don't get discouraged, though! I'm just talking out of thin air. It sounds fun, so why not just play with it anyway :)
