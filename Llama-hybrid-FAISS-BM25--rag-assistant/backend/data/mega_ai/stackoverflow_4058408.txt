I copied and pasted the same code into a new project and it works fine for me. Here is what I did: I created a View Based application in XCode. I added the following frameworks:CoreMedia, CoreVideo,AVFoundation I imported AVFoundation into my viewcontroller's header file I specified my view controller to use the AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate protocol in its interface definition In the implementation I copied the code from the app document you specified in your question I commented out this: [self setSession:session] I commented out this: UIImage *image = [self imageFromSampleBuffer:sampleBuffer]; and added this: NSLog(@"here"); In the viewDidLoad method i put [self setupCaptureSession]; Build. Run. The "here" gets printed repeatedly to the console.
