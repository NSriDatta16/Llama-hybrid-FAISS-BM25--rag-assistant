This behavior is questionable but documented. The help for "confidence" states: If standard_dev ≤ 0, CONFIDENCE returns the #NUM! error value. ... If we assume alpha equals 0.05, we need to calculate the area under the standard normal curve that equals (1 - alpha), or 95 percent. This value is ± 1.96. The confidence interval is therefore: $$\bar{x} \pm 1.96\left(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right).$$ (Yes, this is badly phrased, but that's a direct quote.) To overcome these (somewhat artificial) limitations, compute the confidence limits yourself (according to this formula) as =AVERAGE(X) + NORMSINV(1-0.05/2) * STDEV(X)/SQRT(COUNT(X)) =AVERAGE(X) - NORMSINV(1-0.05/2) * STDEV(X)/SQRT(COUNT(X)) where 'X' names a range containing your data (such as B33:I33) and '0.05' is $\alpha$ (the complement of the desired confidence), just as before. In your case, because STDEV(X) is 0, both limits will equal the mean. This is legitimate, although it has its own problems (because it almost surely fails to cover the true mean).
