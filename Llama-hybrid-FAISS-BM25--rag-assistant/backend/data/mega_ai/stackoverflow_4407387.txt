MD5 generates 2^128 possible values, so you need at least 2^128 strings hashed for complete coverage. Hashing 2^32 strings every second (which is A LOT) you will need 79228162514264337593543950336 seconds, which is 2512308552583217199186 years. Personally, I do not expect to last so long. And it's quite possible that the universe will not too.
