Yes, your understanding is correct: kernels are as deep as the input data. The weights in the rows depend entirely on the patterns in the input data and the target data. CNNs are feature detectors so, after training, the weights in the kernel will have values that lead to activation maps that are useful for the task the network was optimized for. They would probably not have the same values, because normally the input data does not have the same values in all rows and, even in that case, the random weight initialization would lead to different final values.
