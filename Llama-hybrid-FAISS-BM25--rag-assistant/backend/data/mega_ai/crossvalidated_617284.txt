How to transform t-statistic into a statistic using median and IQR?

I want to calculate similarity between various samples, but I'm limited to only knowing the IQR and medians. I came across a similar problem here but the top answer states that the newly proposed statistic follows the same distribution, but doesn't explain why it does: $$t = \frac{\text{Mean}_1 - \text{Mean}_2}{\sqrt{\dfrac{s_1^2}{N_1}+\dfrac{s_2^2}{N_2}}}$$ $$u = \frac{\text{Median}_1 - \text{Median}_2}{\sqrt{\pi/2}\,\sqrt{J_1+J_2}}$$ where $$J_1=\frac{IQR_1^2}{1.82 N_1}, \ \ J_2 = \frac{IQR_2^2}{1.82 N_2}$$ I understand that essentially, we're comparing average values against variability. Specifically, I don't understand the following parts which should make these distributions similar: Why do we divide the difference in medians by the square root of $\pi/2$ ? Why do we divide the IQR by 1.82?
