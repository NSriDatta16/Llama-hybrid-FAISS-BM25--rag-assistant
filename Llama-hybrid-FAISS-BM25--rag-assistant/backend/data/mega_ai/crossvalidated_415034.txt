You may be getting a multicollinearity issue because of this: You are structuring your PCA such that all 24 variables are loading onto a few subfactors, however, the scale you are using already has 6 main factors, of which your 24 factors are loading. To clarify, your PCA looks something like this: PCA(creativity, curiosity, judgment, love of learning, perspective, bravery, perseverance, honesty, zest, love, kindness, social intelligence, teamwork, fairness, leadership, forgiveness, humility, prudence, self-regulation,: appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, spirituality[3]) Then you are using the factors loaded for your regression. This will cause significant collinearity because each of these 24 subscales is inherently related to each other as designed by the scale. To mitigate this, I would recommend this approach: Run a PCA on this individual subscale to their hierarchical factor (e.g., Factor: Subscales) Wisdom and Knowledge: creativity, curiosity, judgment, love of learning, perspective Courage: bravery, perseverance, honesty, zest Humanity: love, kindness, social intelligence Justice: teamwork, fairness, leadership Temperance: forgiveness, humility, prudence, self-regulation Transcendence: appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, spirituality[3] So, you will end up having 6 factors for your regression which include Wisdom, Courage, Humanity, Justice, Temperance, and Transcendence. This should eliminate any multicollinearity.
