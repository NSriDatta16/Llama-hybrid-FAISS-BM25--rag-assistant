JavaScript uses lexical scoping , which basically means that your second code example will work just like how you intend it to work. Consider the following example, borrowed from David Flanagan's Definitive Guide 1 : var x = "global"; function f() { var x = "local"; function g() { alert(x); } g(); } f(); // Calling this function displays "local" Also keep in mind that unlike C, C++ and Java, JavaScript does not have block-level scope. In addition, you may also be interested in checking out the following article, which I highly recommend: Mozilla Developer Center: Working with Closures 1 David Flanagan: JavaScript - The Definitive Guide , Fourth Edition, Page 48.
