Interpretation of random Forest result obtained from 'randomForestExplainer' package

I am using Random Forest analysis on my data set where all the variables, both X and Y, are categorical in nature. I have obtained very interesting results of analysis using randomForestExpaliner package. but most of the graphs are not clear to me. So, I need help. If someone has applied this package, would you please explain the meaning of graphical representations? Thanks in advance Tanzila
