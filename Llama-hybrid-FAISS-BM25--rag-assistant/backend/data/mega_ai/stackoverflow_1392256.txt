Well, that's quite a specialized field you're asking about. And, because of that, I doubt there's any equipment you could pick up fro WalMart or Best Buy to help you out. No doubt there are medical equipment manufacturers that would make that sort of stuff but it wouldn't be readily available to your average Joe (at least not without buying some hideously expensive kit from them). That sort of equipment is generally based on the electrical signals from the brain that can be detected on the skin surface (Electroencephalographs or EEGs do this). Picking up signals from deeper within the brain is going to require some specialized equipment to be inserted inside the skull, not something I'd look at for a weekend project :-) There is an Open EEG project on the web if you're interested. It's got hardware links mostly but seems to indicate that several members have software available as well. There's also a site for a homemade EEG device , but I seriously love the warning: WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. If you download the following schematics and attempt to build this device, you must assume all responsibility for any misuse, injury or death that may ensue. This device is neither guaranteed to work nor certified to be safe. A general suggestion is to never ever power this device with AC (i.e. from the wall), only with DC (batteries). In addition, do not connect this device to anything that is connected to AC power. Consider yourself warned.
