First of all, days are not ordinal, but nominal. (The elegant way to include them in a regression is to convert them into a factor , you haven't done that, but in this particular case it doesn't matter, because right now they have character type, which will be automatically converted to factor .) So the question is, what goes on under the hood with nominal variables? (R will call them "unordered factor".) This: $$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{Tue} D_{i,Tue} + \beta_{Wed} D_{i,Wed} + \ldots + \beta_{Sun} D_{i,Sun}+\varepsilon.$$ Here $D_{i,Tue}$ is a variable which takes the value of 1, if the $i$ th day is Tuesday, zero otherwise. Likewise for the remaining days. These are usually called dummy, or indicator variables. In R, they're generated totally automatically, you don't have to do anything, except for making sure that R handles the variable as factor. Note, that there is no indicator for Monday. So, the important point is: you can now see that it is indeed a usual linear model! How it works? Just think over the interpretation of the coefficients. If the day is Monday, then every dummy takes the value of zero, every product will be zero, so we have $Y_i = \beta_0 +\varepsilon$ , i.e., $\beta_0$ will be the estimated value for Monday. (Simply the average in this case.) If we are on Tuesday, we have $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{Tue} +\varepsilon$ , so $\beta_{Tue}$ is the difference between the estimated values of Tuesday and Monday. (As $Y_i-\beta_0 = \beta_{Tue} +\varepsilon$ , but we already know that $\beta_0$ is the estimated value for Monday.) And so on! So you can see why we included one dummy less: the omitted level will be the so-called reference, what you see in the intercept, and every other one will have an interpretation of "compared to" the reference. One important remark: what will be the reference level is something that you can set yourself, by explicitly calling factor or using relevel on a variable that is already a factor, or it will be decided by R automatically, but if the original variable is a character, then it'll be the first in alphabetical order (which is not necessarily meaningful!). If we were to include all dummys, we would run into perfect collinearity as the sum of the dummys would be a constant 1 - just as the intercept. Of course we could write $Y_i = \beta_{Mon} D_{i,Mon} + \beta_{Tue} D_{i,Tue} + \beta_{Wed} D_{i,Wed} + \ldots + \beta_{Sun} D_{i,Sun}+\varepsilon$ , in this case every coefficient will take the value of the estimated response on that day - use the logic introduced above to track this! - but we don't really like this approach (just think over what would happen if we had to include two factors!). Note, that these are just the most basic ways to encode categorical variables. ?contr.treatment or this page gives you more information on the other possible options.
