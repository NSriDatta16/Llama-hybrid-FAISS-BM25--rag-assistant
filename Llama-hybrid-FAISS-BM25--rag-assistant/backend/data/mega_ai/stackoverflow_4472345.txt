Singletons have their advantages in situations where you want to control the level of access to something at process or application scope beyond what a global variable could achieve in a more elegant way. However most singleton objects provided in a library will be designed to ensure some level of thread safety and most likely access to the instance is being locked via a mutex or other critical section of some kind which can affect performance. In the case of a game or 3d application where performance is key you may want to consider making your own lightweight singleton if thread safety is not a concern and gain some performance.
