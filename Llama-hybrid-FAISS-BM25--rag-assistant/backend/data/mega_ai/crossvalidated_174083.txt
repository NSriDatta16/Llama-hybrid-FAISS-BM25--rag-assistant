What are the computational limitations of neural networks in FEM?

I started to think the computational power of neural networks and why they have not been applied widely in non-adaptive finite element methods (FEM). In industry, I have noticed that most systems use non-adaptive FEMs. I would like to understand what benefit neural networks could provide in such an application. I am particularly interested in differential computation. How can you evaluate the pros and cons of neural networks in FEM?
