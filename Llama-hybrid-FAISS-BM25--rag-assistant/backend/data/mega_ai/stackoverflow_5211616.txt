Check out: http://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/Regexp-Subexpressions.html#Regexp-Subexpressions Use regular expressions to match [0-9]+\.[0-9]{2} on the first line. You may have to fiddle with which characters are escaped. That will give you 3 load averages. The remaining output is column-based, so if you count off the string positions from w, you'll be able to just strncpy the interesting bits. Another possible theory (which sounds like it goes against the assignment, but I'd keep it in mind) is to go grab the source code of w and hack it up to just tell you the information via function calls. If you're feeling really hardcore, you can learn all the library api calls and do it directly that way.
