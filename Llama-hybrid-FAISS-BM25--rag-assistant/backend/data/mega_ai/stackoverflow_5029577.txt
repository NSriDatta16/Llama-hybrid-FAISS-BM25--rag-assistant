You're duplicating/cloning your elements, so the new one obviously won't be draggable. You could make it draggable, although that's much too much work. Just move the original via .append() . Note that when you append an existing object to another element, it will remove the original from its place. That seems to me like what you want to do. Example: http://jsfiddle.net/28SMv/7/ You might want the items to be transferable back into the original div: http://jsfiddle.net/28SMv/8/ Note that I'm using jQuery 1.4.4 there, when you switch over to 1.5 it doesn't work. Not sure if that's a bug, or a feature of jQuery. My guess is that it's a bug of 1.5.
