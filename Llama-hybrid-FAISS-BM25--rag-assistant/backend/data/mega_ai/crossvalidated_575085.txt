What is the intuition behind the odds scale?

What is an intuitive explanation of the odds scale? In a logistic regression such as $$logit(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$ we often interpret $\beta_1$ by looking at the odds ratio , $e^{\beta_1}$ , which has the interpretation that a unit increase in $x$ is associated with a change in the odds of "success" by a factor of $e^{\beta_1}$ . Say I'm making basketball shots, and my successful shots are well modeled by a logistic regression $logit(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$ where $x$ is meters from the basket. If $e^{\beta_1} = 0.5$ , then each meter that I step farther from the basket halves my odds of making the shot. This "sounds" fine, but I don't have have an intuition about what halving or doubling my odds means. I thought of one interpretation of odds, which is the following: my racehorse is in a race with 9 other horses, and all 10 are of equal ability. So each has odds of 1:9 of winning. Then one way of thinking about the odds ratio is that halving my odds, or doubling my odds-against, is like doubling the number of opposing horses to 18. In site searches I haven't found any intuitive interpretation: here says it's not intuitive, and here suggests that when people say "twice as likely" they aren't clear which scale is being used.
