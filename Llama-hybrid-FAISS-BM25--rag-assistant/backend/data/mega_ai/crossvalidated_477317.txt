Neither method of estimating confidence intervals (CI) will work well on these data, so it's not surprising that they disagree. The problem is that the nominal values of CI don't always correspond to the actual CI coverage when underlying assumptions don't hold. In such cases nominal 95% CI might actually cover the true value more frequently or less frequently than that, sometimes by surprisingly large amounts. First, the Fisher transformation used for estimating CI in the standard tests is based on the assumption that the 2 variables have a joint bivariate normal distribution. A quick look at the mtcars data should disabuse you of that notion; both the mpg and the disp values appear bimodal (associated with 4- versus 8-cylinder cars) and the joint plot is concave. So you can't count on the Fisher transformation to provide correct coverage. Second, the type of bootstrap that you use, simply taking the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles among estimates from bootstrapped samples, also can't always provide correct coverage. This is a problem when the quantity being calculated from the data isn't pivotal , a problem recognized since the beginning of bootstrapping. The probability distribution of a pivotal quantity is not a function of unknown parameters. In this case, the correlation coefficient is unknown, to be estimated from the data. The sampling distribution with bivariate normal data around a true correlation coefficient of 0 will be nicely symmetric, but as the true correlation coefficient approaches the limits of +1 and -1 (as in these sample data) the center of the sampling distribution necessarily changes and the distribution becomes more and more asymmetric as the limits are reached. The correlation coefficient isn't pivotal, so the type of analysis you used on the bootstrapped samples can't be counted on to provide correct coverage. For the correlation coefficient, this problem with nonnormal data has been explored extensively via simulations by Bishara and Hittner (Behav. Res. 49: 294-309, 2017). They examined 11 different types of CI estimates, and provide R code for the methods in a supplement. They conclude that "Only the Spearman rank-order and RIN [rank-based inverse normal] transformation methods were universally robust to nonnormality." This page provides an introduction to different ways to get CI from bootstrapping. I would recommend using the boot package in R and its boot() and boot.ci() functions in your further explorations of bootstrapping confidence intervals, as they directly provide 4 different estimates.
