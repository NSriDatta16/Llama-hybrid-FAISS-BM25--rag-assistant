Anyone written a script that turns gcov branch coverage output into compiler warning format?

Most code editors know how to take a reasonably standard format of file_path, line_number, message_text and hyperlink into code. They know how because that's how they display compiler warnings. Visual Studio does it, and Source Insight is trivial to configure for that. If I have to I will write the script myself, but maybe someone has done so already. Looking for a script that takes gcc's gcov branch coverage output and translates it into that format.
