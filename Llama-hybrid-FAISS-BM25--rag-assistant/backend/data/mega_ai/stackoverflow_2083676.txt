Magento Complex Attribute: Value(s) = (Drop-Down item + Text Field input), and need an "Add Another" button

I'm in the early stages of planning and developing a Magento-based site. My company carries around 20,000 items. One of the most valuable features on our current site is the ability to cross-reference our items based on our competitor's item number. Any one item of ours can have between 0 and 30+ Competitor Cross-References. I need to figure out how to achieve this feature in Magento. What I'd like to do is configure a 2-part attribute that is searchable, but not displayed on the product's page, and be able to have a varying number of values. In the Add Product Page, it would look sorta like this: Cross Reference(s): [Drop Down of Competitor Company Names] + [Textfield For Competitor Part No.] (+ Button to Add Another Cross Reference) It doesn't look like there's any way to do this with Magento out-of-the-box in the Admin interface, so I'm ready to extend the core with a module of my own. I've started digging around in the 10,000 files that make up a Magento install; but I could really use some help on this. Thanks in advance to any who read and reply!
