This can be easily accomplished using MS Excel, or any other spreadsheet program that includes the capability of creating a stacked bar chart. Starting with your earliest date, create a data column for the number for days later each task begins. In your example, Supervision begins 4 days later than the project start. These data points will be your base bar column in your chart, and will be formated with no fill, so they're effectively invisible. Next, add the length of each task (18 days for Supervision) as a second, stacked data series in your chart. Format as desired. Finally, add your data labels for each task and label your x-axis for the dates in your project and you have a quick, spreadsheet based Gantt chart.
