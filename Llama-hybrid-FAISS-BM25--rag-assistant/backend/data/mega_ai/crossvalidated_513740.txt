Learning resources for Bayesian Dynamic Networks?

Increasingly, I've stumbled on the term Bayesian Dynamic Network (s). The field seems to be at the intersection of probabilistic graphical models, time series, Kalman filters, etc. Because there's so much depth to it, I'm having a hard time finding a resource that motivates these complex ideas from simpler concepts. Could anyone link a course, book, etc that builds these ideas "from the ground up"?
