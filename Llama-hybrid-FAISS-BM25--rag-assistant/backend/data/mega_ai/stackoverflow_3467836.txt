Although this is just an educated guess, I would say that DragDrop.DoDragDrop() is not capable to handle multiple drag guestures in parallel. Indices: There's no possibility to pass a touch ID to the method (which would be neccessary for differentiating the ongoing drag gestures) The implementation of DoDragDrop() is static The call of DoDragDrop() is blocking until the drop occured or was canceled It is based upon the OLE version of drag and drop (which was not updated for Win7) However, I would be glad if someone could correct me in this matter, because I'm currently also searching an DND API suitable for touch support.
