With so few data points, I wouldn't get caught up in complicated formulas, test statistics and P-values. Instead, I'd keep it simple by just asking a few questions: What is the average setup time for the two alternatives? Does running standalone result in a faster/slower time than running concurrently with another machine? What is the maximum setup time? The average may not be very useful if, in the worst case, one alternative takes twice as long as the other. Similarly, what is the standard deviation or interquartile range of setup times? The idea is to see how much variability or volatility there is in setup times. If one alternative is slightly faster on average, but could sometimes be much slower, that's important to know. The objective is to arrive at a better qualitative understanding of how setup time can vary, and from that, decide how to proceed. With such a small dataset, any quantitative test you could perform is unlikely to tell you anything you couldn't figure out for yourself.
