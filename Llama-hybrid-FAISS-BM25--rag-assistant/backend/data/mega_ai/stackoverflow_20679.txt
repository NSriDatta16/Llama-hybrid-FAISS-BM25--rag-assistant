Download this: http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php Also check, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization Edit: Additional, I know it's for XEN but the instructions are the same for all VMs that want hardware support. http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/HVM_Compatible_Processors I can't try it from work, but I'm sure it can identify whether you've got the Intel VT or AMD-V instructions. Intel will have a "vmx" instruction and AMD will have a "svm". On linux you can check /proc/cpuinfo, "egrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo"
