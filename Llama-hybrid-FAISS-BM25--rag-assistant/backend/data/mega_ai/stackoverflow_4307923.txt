As I remember, even if you can get Pylons to preserve the ordering, you're not supposed to rely on that kind of behavior because not all user agents (browsers, bots, etc.) preserve ordering either and that's outside your control. If it's part of the HTTP spec, it's not reliably followed... I doubt it is. For example, suppose the user agent is a Python application which handles query parameters using dicts.
