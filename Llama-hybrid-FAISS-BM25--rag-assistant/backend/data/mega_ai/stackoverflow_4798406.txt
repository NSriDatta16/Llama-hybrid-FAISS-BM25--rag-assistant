The apparent quality of your images may also depend in the type of device you are displaying the images on. For example, if your image is saved as 72px x 72px in your image editor, then displayed with a size defined using 72 scaled pixels (sp) in android on a high pixel-density device, then the OS will stretch the image before display. As such, the pixel density of the display device can affect the apparent image quality. You can provide different resolution images for different pixel densities by using the hdpi, mdpi and ldpi folders for drawables. See these links for more info: Screens support Icon design
