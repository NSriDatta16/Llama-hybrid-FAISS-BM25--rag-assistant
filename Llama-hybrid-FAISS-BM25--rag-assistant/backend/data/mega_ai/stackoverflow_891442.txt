I ran into something very similar a couple days ago - basically there's no way to make ASP.NET generate custom exceptions. This is by design , since returning a specific type of exceptions would [...] expose implementation details/bugs to the clients. We could do something with special exception type that we let pass through, but its too late for this release [...] You could always return different HTTP status codes , and have the browser handle them as custom exceptions - for example, a 500 error would mean one thing, a 401 something else, etc. I think the best solution is to make your method return a string with the exception stack - not elegant, but at least this way the client has all the exception details. Dave Ward also has info on ASP.NET AJAX service errors .
