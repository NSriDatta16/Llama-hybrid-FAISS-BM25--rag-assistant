http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ WordSquared.com uses jQuery UI and streams in our content when the drag ends if the view needs to be refreshed. We use the drag and stop events in 'draggable' to perform these checks and update the content. Zooming is actually implemented (or not) by the browsers and kinda just works. To get google maps-ish implementation you would need to have image detail levels and blend between them. You can't catch the browser's 'zoom' event but you can get the events that are triggering the browser's zoom (mousewheel, multitouch-- search for additional jquery plugins) and do the custom zooming work yourself.
