There are two most common causes for loss function being a sum/average. First, you may simply define your loss as average of some metric. It's related to concept of risk minimization . Second reason is that you use Maximum Likelihood or something related, like Maximum A Posteriori. Additivity comes from the fact that Maximum Likelihood solves $$\arg\max_{\theta} P_{\theta}(Dataset) = \arg\max_{\theta} \prod_{x \in Dataset} P_{\theta}(x)$$ which is equal to $$\arg\min_{\theta} \sum_{x \in Dataset} -log(P_{\theta}(x)).$$ For example, if $P_{\theta}$ is Gaussian you'll get exactly mean squared error.
