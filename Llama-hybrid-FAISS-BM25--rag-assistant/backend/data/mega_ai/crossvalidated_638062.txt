I'll take an unpopular but correct stance. If you want to 'interpret' or understand, or do anything else beyond an automatic decision that would be relevant to acceptance testing of widgets, you should ignore the pre-test $\alpha$ and entirely once you have the data. The accept/reject decision of the Neymanâ€“Pearsonian hypothesis testing method deals with the long run error rate properties of the method, not the evidential meaning of the data. Sure, you can use $\alpha$ and power in pre-experiment planning, but if you want to know what the data say then the p-value is where it's at (or likelihood function, or a Bayesian analysis), not the all or none larger or smaller than $\alpha$ . You can read much more about it (and other useful things like expected p-value instead of power for sample size estimation) here: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/164_2019_286
