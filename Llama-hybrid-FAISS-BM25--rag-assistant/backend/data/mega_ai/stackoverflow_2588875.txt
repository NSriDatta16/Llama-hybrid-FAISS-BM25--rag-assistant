What's the best way to draw a fullscreen quad in OpenGL 3.2?

I'm doing ray casting in the fragment shader. I can think of a couple ways to draw a fullscreen quad for this purpose. Either draw a quad in clip space with the projection matrix set to the identity matrix, or use the geometry shader to turn a point into a triangle strip. The former uses immediate mode, deprecated in OpenGL 3.2. The latter I use out of novelty, but it still uses immediate mode to draw a point.
