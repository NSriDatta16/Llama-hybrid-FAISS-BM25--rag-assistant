calculate the standard deviation of a generic list of objects

I'm a c# noob but I really need a professional's help. I am using visual studio 2005 for a project so I don't have math.linq I need to calculate the standard deviation of a generic list of objects. The list contains just a list of float numbers, nothing too complicated. However I have never done this before so i need someone to show me that has calculated standard deviation of a generic list before. Here is my code that I tried to start on: //this is my list of objects inside. The valve data just contains a bunch of floats. public class ValveDataResults { private List m_ValveResults; public void AddValveData(ValveData valve) { m_ValveResults.Add(valve); } //this is the function where the standard deviation needs to be calculated: public float LatchTimeStdev() { //below this is a working example of how to get an average or mean //of same list and same "LatchTime" that needs to be calculated here as well. } //function to calculate average of latch time, can be copied for above st dev. public float LatchTimeMean() { float returnValue = 0; foreach (ValveData value in m_ValveResults) { returnValue += value.LatchTime; } returnValue = (returnValue / m_ValveResults.Count) * 0.02f; return returnValue; } } The "Latch Time" is a float object of the "ValveData" object which is inserted into the m_ValveResults list. That's it. Any help would much be appreciated. Thanks
