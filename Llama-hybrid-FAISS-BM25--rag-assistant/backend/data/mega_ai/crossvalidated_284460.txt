Decrease in BIC value despite very low beta-coefficient

I used the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to aide in multiple model selection. I want to predict the amount of phosphorus which is extracted by P-test A (DL-P) based on the amount that is extracted by P-test B (CAL-P) and 4 other parameters. P-test B is a fixed variable, the other variables can, but do not need to be included in the model. To assess which parameters should be included I use BIC. First equation is the simple model, below the two equations with minimum BIC value. Second line of each equation shows the beta-coeficient of the respective regressor. Question: How can I explain the high ΔBIC (equation ABC compared to A), despite the very low beta-coefficients of variable B and C Shouldnt a beta-coefficient close to zero mean that these regressor hardly influence the target variable? However, the high ΔBIC seems to indicate differently.
