To Log Or To Not Log?

I'm now building a program that is a eBook manager, reader, organizer and publisher, that is also a eBook transfer(to eReaders like Kindle), but I was developing it and a question have poped-up on my mind: "Log or not?" Then I started to think about logging. As many programs log actions, I started to seek for they and see how they log things, then I want to know: It's good to log actions or things that happend in programs(like errors)? In my case, it's good to log things? What I need to log? What is the best way to log things(text files, databases...)? There is any tool to logging for Lazarus?
