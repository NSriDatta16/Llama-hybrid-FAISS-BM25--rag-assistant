This code makes a function (createAndShowGUI()) be called in another thread. In case you don't know what a thread is, better read about it, but anyhow, think about it as code that is performed at the same time that other code is performed. The other code will be the lines that follow this Invoke() call. This is very common in graphic apps, code runs to update the graphic while other code respond to user actions. That said I haven't bothered to read the documentation about InvokeLater(), and haven't wrote too much Java in my life. As 'LumpN' said - 'this is how Swing typically creates a GUI'. The weirder (for a newbie) thing is that the invokeLater() parameter is defined in an annonymous way - 'within the code'. It is actually a nice thing since this class is so nothing-new-simple. All other answers has explained the annonymous thing. so: 1.yes. 2. You asked why and asked not to get too much technical details - but as said by 'yulkes' - because in Java you can't pass methods as parameters, so you must build this class, and its nice to build it like this. 3. With what I summed on my first paragraph, you can briefly read documentation (just search function name on Google), also get the to know 'Google code search'.
