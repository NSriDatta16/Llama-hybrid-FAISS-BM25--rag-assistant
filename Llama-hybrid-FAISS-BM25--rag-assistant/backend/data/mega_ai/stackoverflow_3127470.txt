To make your own HTTP server, I reccomend to get inspiration from other peoples code. The programmer ry famous for the node.js framework has written simple elegant code regarding this matter. Check out his libebb library, it has a parser generated with Raegel using the easy yet powerful PEG (it's based on Zed Shaw's mongrel parser). Also check the example usage . It is really clean and usable code. libebb is a lightweight HTTP server library for C. It lays the foundation for writing a web server by providing the socket juggling and request parsing. By implementing the HTTP/1.1 grammar provided in RFC2612, libebb understands most most valid HTTP/1.1 connections (persistent, pipelined, and chunked requests included) and rejects invalid or malicious requests. libebb supports SSL over HTTP. Regarding PHP-Server coupling, the easiest way is CGI but if you feel adventurous dig into php source code under SAPI (Server API) modules to see how to do it.
