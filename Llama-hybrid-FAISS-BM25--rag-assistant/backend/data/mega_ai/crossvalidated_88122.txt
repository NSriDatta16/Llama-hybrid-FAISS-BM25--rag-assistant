SVMs for nested/prioritzed text document classes.

Let's say A, B, C, D, E, F are classes of text documents (i.e. sentences). Usually they occur distinctively, say: one document is precisely C. But sometimes one document is C AND A, at the same time. Because A is more important than C, the document class is defined . So at least two questions arise: 1) How this classification would be made properly with an SVM? 2) Is this possible in R? Note: I already tried to do this with the standard approach (linear classification, 10000 features, e1071 SVM implementation). The classes distribution isn't constant (F is much more frequent than A, B, or C). Sadly here the most most important classes (A, B, C) are wrongly classified as F. 3) Is there a possibility to set a priority for an standard SVM?
