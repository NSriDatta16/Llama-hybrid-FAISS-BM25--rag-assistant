Estimating the posterior predictive distribution post regression adjustment when doing Approximate Bayesian Computation

I'm currently correcting the parameter values of the posterior distribution estimated with Approximate Bayesian Computation. The correction is obtained using a multiple weighted linear regression model to get closer to the real posterior as proposed by Beaumont et al 2002. From that corrected posterior, I want to estimate the posterior predictive distribution, but I'm worried about how to draw the parameter values from the corrected posterior?
