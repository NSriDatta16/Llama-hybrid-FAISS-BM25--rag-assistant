Ondrag ROT-13/ROT-47 decode

I have a little website where I would like to obfuscate some text to protected spoiling of users that accidentally read it untimely. Much like the keywords on imdb were, where you have to rollover to reveal them. I thought it would be a nice and interactive way to reveal the text if its marked. Example: How does a programmer express h(is)|(er) love? Zl srryvatf sbe lbh ner uneqpbqrq. Now you would drag mark the obfuscated text much like you would get ready to copy it to your clipboard, and it should reveal. Is there a way to do this? My current problem is a way to determine the current selection in javascript.
