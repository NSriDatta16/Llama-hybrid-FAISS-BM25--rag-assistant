DateTimeZone was introduced with PHP 5.2. Your Virtual Server is likely running a previous version. Check the PHP version on the server and upgrade PHP on the server. Note that support for PHP 5.2 ended on Dec, 9th, 2010. All users of PHP 5.2 are encouraged to upgrade to PHP 5.3. To prepare for upgrading to PHP 5.3, now that PHP 5.2's support ended, a migration guide available on http://php.net/migration53 , details the changes between PHP 5.2 and PHP 5.3.
