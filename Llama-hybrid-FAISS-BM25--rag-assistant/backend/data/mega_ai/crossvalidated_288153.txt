No. I do not know how XGBoost estimates probabilities, but from my experience if you have say 100 samples, the probabilities estimates will not (necessarily) be multiples of 0.01 (which would be the case for decision trees). Therefore, there must be something else in the estimation of probabilities with XGBoost.
