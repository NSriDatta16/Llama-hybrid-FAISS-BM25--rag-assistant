How to get the prediction values for two response variables from random forest?

Possible Duplicate: Prediction results for two response variable from random forest I use randomForest R package to do regression rf = randomForest(A + B ~ C + D, data, ..) . I want to know what are prediction values for A and B, and use predict(rf) . The output is an aggregate value instead of two values for A and B. Do you have any suggestion to implement a predict function to generate two predictions?
