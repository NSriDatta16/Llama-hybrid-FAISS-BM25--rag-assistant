This can be easily done using NLP and Computer Vision. These types of tasks usually come under Document Understanding domain. For your problem statement you will need to create a Pipeline with 2 majot phases. PHASE 1 : Document Classification This is the phase where the documents are classified into 1 of the 20 categories that you mentioned in the question. You can either use an NLP model (like BERT or other variations) to classify the docs or a NLP Computer Vision hybrid model (like LayoutLM series). IMO Bert based models work quite well for these types of tasks. PHASE 2 : Document data extraction Once the doc has been classified, it will then move on to the second phase where a NER (Named Entity Recognition) model will extract the relevant data from the doc. You can again use an NLP based model (Bert or its variations) or a hybrid model like LayoutLM series. PS : The answer given by @Vivek Singhal is absolutely incorrect. Deep Learning models have great generalisation capabilities if you train them on a proper dataset. So you don't need multiple models for each different formats. Just train one model for Document Classification and one for NER and you should be good! Let me know if you have any further questions Cheers!
