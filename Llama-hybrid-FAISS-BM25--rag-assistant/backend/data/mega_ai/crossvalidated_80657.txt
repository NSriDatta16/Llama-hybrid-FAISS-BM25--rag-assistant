How can I compare variables with uneven data sets?

I'm doing a stationary sport in which I use different colored equipment for different weather. I am recording my scores along with the color of the equipment and the weather in which I am using it. I would like to plot the score averages for each type of color on a bar graph and add the weather conditions as filters. This way, I want to compare the equipment in different contexts and thus see which one is the best for, say, cloudy weather. The problem: I don't have equal data sets for each type of color in each type of weather. What can I do to have an accurate comparison?
