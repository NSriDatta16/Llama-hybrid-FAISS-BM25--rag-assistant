Customizing a google map that is embedded with an iframe

So I have been looking at Google Maps and they have the feature of "making" your own map and adding in markers and things of that nature through their own interface. The way they have you embedding it on your web site is through the use of an iframe. I have been reading the documentation for Google Maps and the examples shown are when the map is created on page load using either by static input or dynamically built using a database. This is the documentation I am looking at right now... Documentation So what I am wondering is whether there is a way to customize the map built using Google's interface in the same way as building it upon page load? Levi edit: From reading more about it I came to the conclusion that there are essentially two versions of Google Maps? One for developers and one for someone who just wants a map and doesn't care how it looks or how it is made? Can anyone confirm this?
