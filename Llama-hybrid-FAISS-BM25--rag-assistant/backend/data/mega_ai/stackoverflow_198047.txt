Wanted: acts_as_nested_set, AJAX drag and drop tutorial

Can anyone suggest a tutorial or sample code that implements a nested set (or similar ordered tree structure) with associated Javascript that facilitates drag and drop? I'm looking for both the display code (view) as well as the AJAX backend controller which writes the tree to the database on change. I want it to represent a multi-layer menu where the ordering and depth of items is important.
