In logistic regression, the interpretation of coefficient $\beta_i$ is the log odds ratio for a 1 unit increase in dependent variable $X_i$ holding all other dependent variables in the model constant. When you have a different set of dependent variables in the model, the interpretation of the coefficients change. In particular, if you add dependent variables that are both correlated to the dependent variables already in the model and correlated with the response variable you will see changes. Consider the situation where $Y$ is correlated with both $X_1$ and $X_2$ - which are both correlated with each other. As an example, the temperature ($X_2$) is correlated with the murder rate $(Y)$ and the temperature is also correlated with ice cream sales $(X_1)$. As a consequence, ice cream sales is also correlated with the murder rate. If only $X_1$ is in the model, some of the variation in $Y$ that is due to $X_2$ will be captured by $X_1$. However, when we add $X_2$ to the model none of the variation in $Y$ that is due to $X_2$ will be captured by the $X_1$ coefficient since we're controlling for $X_2$ in this new model!
