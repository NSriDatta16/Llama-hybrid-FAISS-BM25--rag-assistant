Do you have to use cross-validation on simple models with a low number of features?

Say I have a logistic regression model and a dataset that's 100 samples and 10 features (i.e. # features is equal to 10% the # of samples; general rule of thumb for unregularized models). Can I evaluate the model performance on the entire dataset here, instead of doing something like cross-validation? Do I have to use cross-validation? Is there a pitfall in not doing so? Are there any papers that show that even though you follow the rule of thumb, you can overfit?
