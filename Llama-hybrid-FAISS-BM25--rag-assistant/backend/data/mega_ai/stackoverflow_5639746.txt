Taguchi designs are the same thing as covering arrays. The basic idea is that if you have F data "fields" and every one can have N different values, it is possible to construct N F different test cases. A covering array is basically a set of test cases that together cover all possible pairwise combinations of two field values, and the idea is to generate as small one as possible. E.g. if F=3 and N=3, you have 27 possible test cases, but it is enough to have nine test cases if you aim for pairwise coverage: Field A | Field B | Field C --------------------------- 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 3 3 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 1 3 1 3 3 2 1 3 3 2 In this table, you can choose any two fields and any two values and you can always find a row that contains the chosen values for the chosen fields. Generating Taguchi designs in general is a difficult combinatorial problem. You can generate Taguchi designs by various methods: Branch and bound Stochastic search (e.g. tabu search or simulated annealing) Greedy search Specific mathematical constructions for some specific structures
