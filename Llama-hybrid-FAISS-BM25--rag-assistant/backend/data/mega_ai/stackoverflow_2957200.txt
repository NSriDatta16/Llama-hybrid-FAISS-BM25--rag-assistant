In general it is bad idea to enforce global order. Aggregates are meant to form ACID-semantics boundaries. This means that two aggregates should not be updated in one transaction and there is no other means of enforcing global order. In your case it could make sense that along with creating CustomerCreatedEvent Customer should send a message to Agent aggregate telling it to assign itself. Generally inter-aggregate communication should be done via messaging.
