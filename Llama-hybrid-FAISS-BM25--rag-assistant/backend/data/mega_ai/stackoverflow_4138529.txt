Fetching iTunes RSS feed with Java

I am willing to fetch iTunes public RSS feed from a appengine java app. In dev server, here is what I try: URL url = new URL("http://ax.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStoreServices.woa/ws/RSS/topsongs/limit=10/xml"); BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(url.openStream())); And that is the response: http://ax.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStoreServices.woa/ws/RSS/topsongs/limit=10/xml iTunes Store: Top Songs 2010-11-09T12:45:58-07:00 http://phobos.apple.com/favicon.ico iTunes Store http://www.apple.com/itunes/ Copyright 2008 Apple Inc. There is a link, "http://ax.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStoreServices.woa/ws/RSS/topsongs/limit=10/xml", which is displayed. It is the same URL that the one I give to the java URL object... If I open this link in the browser, I get the correct XML response. I tried to set a different user-agent, but nothing changes. Thanks for any help.
