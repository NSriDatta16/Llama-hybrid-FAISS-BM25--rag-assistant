Spearman Correlation from 'two-ways'

I have two data sets where I am comparing where an object in the first data set, ranks in the second data set and vice versa. This leads to the assumption that the data set being compared against is the 'true' data set and thus has a perfect order. It looks like this when comparing B against A: A = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10] B = [2 1 17 4 5 6 9 3 7 14] Spearman's rho = .5030 It look like this when comparing A against B: A = [2 1 8 4 5 6 9 12 7 13] B = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10] Spearman's rho = .8061 My question is what do I take away from the two comparisons as a whole? Is it possible to average them? EDIT: I have corrected my mistake of not pairing values in both correlations. There are 10 objects in each. These ranks come from a ranked list of 30,000 names, where just the first 10 are ranked here. Though I think I now realize why I am getting different correlation results by comparing A against B and vice versa. This is because even though there are 10 ranking objects compared in each correlation, there are ranks that are contained in one list but not the other. For example, comparing A against B, there are ranks of 14 & 17 in B which are not in A and 8 & 10 in A which are not in B. This is a result of comparing a small subsample (10) of the full list (30,000), I believe. I got to this conclusion by setting up two new list of names like so and running a Spearman's correlation when comparing A against B and vice versa: A = [Fred, Joe, Bob, Smith, Parker, Drew, Ryan, Sarah, Danna, Mary] B = [Joe, Fred, Parker, Drew, Ryan, Sarah, Danna, Bob, Mary, Smith] It looks like this when comparing B against A: A = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10] B = [2 1 5 6 7 8 9 3 10 4] Spearman's rho = .4909 It look like this when comparing A against B: A = [2 1 8 10 3 4 5 6 7 9] B = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10] Spearman's rho = .4909 As one can see, Spearman's Rho is the same when comparing either way. It's just that the two list being compared must have all the same names, just in a different order. So when I compare the list of 30,000 names, it would be wise to not subsample where the two list do not contain all the same names. Please correct anything I missed. Thanks
