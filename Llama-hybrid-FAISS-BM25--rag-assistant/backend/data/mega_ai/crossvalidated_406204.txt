Arima simulation followed by modeling in R produces bad estimates

Simulate a moving average using arima.sim in R . Then estimate the coefficients using arima . Fix all coefficients to their true values, except one: set.seed(222) x Results: Call: arima(x = x, order = c(0, 0, 4), fixed = c(1, 0, 0, NA, 0), method = "ML") Coefficients: ma1 ma2 ma3 ma4 intercept 1 0 0 -3.6772 0 s.e. 0 0 0 0.2970 0 sigma^2 estimated as 0.159: log likelihood = -901.13, aic = 1806.26 I expect the estimate of ma4 to be close to $-0.8$ , but get $-3.68$ . Why is the parameter estimate so far from the true parameter?
