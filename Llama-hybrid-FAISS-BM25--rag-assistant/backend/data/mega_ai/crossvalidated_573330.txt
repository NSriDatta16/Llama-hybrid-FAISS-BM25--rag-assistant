You can create a variable that just contains the last event each participant went through. Then run a logistic regression (or another kind of regression) of the outcome on that variable. To ease interpretation, you can also employ successive difference contrast coding. This makes it so that the coefficient on the second level is equal to the difference between the second and first levels, and the coefficient on the third level is equal to the difference between the third and second level. The intercept is the average of the probabilities for all the events. In R, this can be done using MASS::contr.sdif() . I also urge you to consider not using logistic regression if you want to interpret your estimates as changes in probability and you have no other variables in the model. Using a linear probability model makes the resulting effects much easier to interpret and doesn't make any additional assumptions on the model. You just have to use a robust standard error. Putting this all together, R code to implement this would look like the following: #List of column names in original dataset correspond to events events
