Selecting specific columns with eager loading

I'm on Rails 2.3.5 and trying to figure out the syntax for selecting on certain columns with eager loading. For example, class Organizer Let's say in OrganizersController show method, I wish to use eager loading to grab certain columns from Organizer, Event, and Booking models. I believe here's the code that grabs all the columns from all 3 models Organizer.find(params[:id], :include => {:event => {:booking}}) But let's say that I only want to grab organizer.id, event.id, and booking.id, what's the syntax for doing so?
