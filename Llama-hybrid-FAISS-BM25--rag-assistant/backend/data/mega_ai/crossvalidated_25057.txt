Statistics on cause of death, by country, are collated by the World Health Organization from national reports. I couldn't find a good summary on their site for this answer but the data are there somewhere; there is a summary in Wikipedia . Worldwide, 2.1 percent of deaths are reported there to be from road traffic accidents, in 2001 at least. As the other answers and comments suggest, this doesn't mean any one individual's probability is 0.021, but this would be your starting point for estimating the probability for a world citizen about whom you know nothing other than their existence.
