Well, the setC violates the Law of Demeter , so I don't think I'd call it a best practice. ("Law" is a bit strong - for instance, it's generally not applied to fluent interfaces.) That said, getters should not always make copies IMHO. Doing a deep clone can be expensive. There are other options, such as immutable objects. And, realistically, there are pragmatic considerations. But I'd err on the side of TMI (too much information) in the JavaDoc.
