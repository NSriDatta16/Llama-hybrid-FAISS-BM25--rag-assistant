In my opinion as an undergraduate student, the i.i.d. is the assumption on the distribution of the sample data. So simply, it just wants the sample data to be random if the data is random the law of large number hold because if you collect more of the data randomly the most frequency out of all in the population will be the average(the most frequency one) and also the other less frequency will form the shape of the normal distribution as the number of samples is large. But when it is clustering, for example, you use data that collect from New York City to represent the whole population of the USA it will be wrong because that clustering will only give the most frequency one in New York City not the most frequency one in the USA and also the result that you give can be totally different.
