I like to do this with Parsec when it's command line options. How do I do this, given that a command line is a list of strings and not a string? First, you need to create some simple primitives for parsing lists of String (instead of lists of Char ): http://github.com/solidsnack/system-uuid/blob/master/Options.hs Then you can compose those to parse your options, as I've done at the bottom of this file: http://github.com/solidsnack/system-uuid/blob/master/Main.hs This is really the most powerful way to do it and it leverages the heavy investment any Haskell programmer makes in parser combinators (just as heavy as any Perl programmer makes in regexen).
