Rails Deployment on Win32 Best Practices: Lighty + Sgci

I've received some really great guidance from users of this site, and I'm thinking some advanced Rails people could assist me in resolving the following problem. I'm attempting to deploy a simple Rails application on a win32 server. I've been carefully working through these instructions (see http://functionalelegant.blogspot.com/2008/05/deploying-rails-on-windows.html ) for win32 Rails application deployment. I started from a more-or-less clean windows install, then downloaded and installed Ruby LightTPD Rails Zed's SCGI Rails Runner Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools Ruby/DBI ADO package After that, I've done the following: I've commented out the line in the SCGI gem (which actually was causing trouble.) I created the directory structure as suggested, with folders for logs. I modified the scgi.yaml file and the Lighty config files to reflect my environmental settings. After this, I wrote the batch scripts to start up Lighty and the SGCI process. They appear to run correctly. However, inside app-errors.log the following lines appear: 2009-05-15 16:48:06: (mod_scgi.c.2645) fcgi: got a FDEVENT_ERR. Don't know why. 2009-05-15 16:48:06: (mod_scgi.c.2469) emergency exit: scgi: connection-fd: 7 fcgi-fd: 8 Finally, when I navigate to http://localhost:xxxx/ I just see a blank page. Update : I just realized the blank page only appeared to be. Viewing the source revealed the following issue: 2C:/Ruby/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:573:in `load'":C:/Ruby/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:612:in `recv_request'":C:/Ruby/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:911:in `recv_request'"?C:/Ruby/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1530:in `init_with_client'" Note that 'ruby script/server' runs just fine, but the page then can't be seen externally. Any ideas? Please let me know if anything jumps out at you.
