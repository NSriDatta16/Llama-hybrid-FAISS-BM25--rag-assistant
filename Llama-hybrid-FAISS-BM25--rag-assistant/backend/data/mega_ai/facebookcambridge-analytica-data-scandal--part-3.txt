Interfering in the elections in Trinidad and Tobago In the Caribbean country of Trinidad and Tobago, the majority of the population is subdivided into two groups, those of South Asian and African origin. The South Asian population constitute the largest ethnic group in the country (approximately 35.4 %), mainly descendants of indentured workers from South Asia (mostly India), brought in to replace freed African slaves who refused to continue working on the sugar plantations. Through cultural preservation, many residents of Indian descent continue to maintain the traditions of their ancestral homeland. On the other hand, the African population constitute the second largest ethnic group in the country, with approximately 34.2 % of the population identifying themselves as of African descent. In 2010, Cambridge Analytica designed a campaign called Do So, aimed at trying to increase abstention among young people of African descent. This campaign, presented as if it were something that arose spontaneously on social media, was developed as a resistance movement against traditional politics, encouraging young people not to vote as a form of protest, so that, by reducing their electoral participation, it favored the United National Congress (UNC), the party representing the Indian population. The Do So campaign had a significant impact on reducing voter turnout among young people of African descent, which contributed to the UNC's electoral victory in 2010. Alleged usage Russia In 2018, the Parliament of the United Kingdom questioned SCL Group director Alexander Nix in a hearing about Cambridge Analytica's connections with Russian oil company Lukoil. Nix stated he had no connections to the two companies despite concerns that the oil company was interested in how the company's data was used to target American voters. Cambridge Analytica had become a point of focus in politics since its involvement in Trump's campaign at this point. Democratic officials made it a point of emphasis for improved investigation over concerns of Russian ties with Cambridge Analytica. It was later confirmed by Christopher Wylie that Lukoil was interested in the company's data regarding political targeting. Brexit Cambridge Analytica was allegedly hired as a consultant company for Leave.EU and the UK Independence Party during 2016, as an effort to convince people to support Brexit. These rumors were the result of the leaked internal emails that were shared with the British parliament. Brittany Kaiser declared that the datasets that Leave.EU used to create databases were provided by Cambridge Analytica. These datasets composed of the data obtained from Facebook were said to be work done as an initial job deliverable for them. Although Arron Banks, co-founder of Leave.EU, denied any involvement with the company, he later declared "When we said we'd hired Cambridge Analytica, maybe a better choice of words could have been deployed." The official investigation by the UK Information Commissioner found that Cambridge Analytica was not involved "beyond some initial enquiries" and the regulator did not identify any "significant breaches" of data protection legislation or privacy or marketing regulations "which met the threshold for formal regulatory action". Responses Facebook and other companies Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg first apologized for the situation with Cambridge Analytica on CNN, calling it an "issue", a "mistake" and a "breach of trust". He explained that he was responding to the Facebook community's concerns and that the company's initial focus on data portability had shifted to locking down data; he also reminded the platform's users of their right of access to personal data. Other Facebook officials argued against calling it a "data breach," arguing those who took the personality quiz originally consented to give away their
