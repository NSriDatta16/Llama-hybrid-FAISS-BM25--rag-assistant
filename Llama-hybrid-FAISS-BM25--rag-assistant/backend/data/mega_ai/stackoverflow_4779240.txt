1.) It seems like you import the header file with your "#define birdSize" also in your iPad View Controller. Maybe indirectly? If you could show us your imports, it would be easier to say... 2.) I don't know about the "best way", but here is how I solved this: Target Options for iPad -> Build Settings -> GCC CFLAGS -DIPAD then you can easily have one definition of birdSize somewhere, that would look like: #ifdef IPAD #define birdSize 400 #else #define birdSize 175 #endif Maybe not the most elegant way, but it works fine for me.
