java - xml generation from excel sheet content

I have a xsd and a MS-Excel spreadsheet. The excel sheet contains Xpath like representation of all the elements/fields of the xsd along with the corresponding data type as specified in the xsd. For example if xsd contains a element as follows: The excel sheet content is as follows: Column 2 (element/field name) Column 3 (data type) person.name String person.age String I have a requirement to check if the content of the excel sheet is valid and complete. Thus I want to a generate xml file from a MS-Excel spreadsheet and validate it aganist an existing xsd. The requirement details are as follows: Read the content of the second and third column of a MS-Excel spreadsheet. Ignore the rows whose content does not contain a dot separator generate xml validate it aganist the user specified xsd How can this be done in a java program?
