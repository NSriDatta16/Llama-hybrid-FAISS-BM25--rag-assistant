Access sql query Circular Reference error

I'm creating a sql select query for an access database, and receiving a circular reference error, because my alias name is the same as a column name in my expression. Here is the fragment of my query: switch([CULET]='N','NONE', [CULET]='S', 'SMALL',[CULET]='VS','VERY SMALL', [CULET]='SL',' ',[CULET]='MD',' ') AS [Culet] This specific alias name is part of the requirements for the output. Is there any way to get around this without changing the alias name? TIA
