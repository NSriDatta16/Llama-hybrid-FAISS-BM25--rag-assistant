Memory and pointers

I have need some some help with some thinking around a task. My task is to create one memory area void *memory = malloc(320); and then use pointers to store texts into this storage place: We want to divide this area into data blocks of 32 bytes, sow we can store: 320/32 = 10 data blocks a 32 bytes. Into one data block I can store (1 ASCSII char = 1 bytes) 32 characters. I have a bitmap that is 10 long where every bit indicates if data block is used(1) or not(0). But what if I want to store a text that is 60 characters long? Then i need 2 data blocks (2 x 32 bytes). The bitmap shows that data block 2 and 6 are free, 1 and 6 is not side by side. How can I achieve this? struct data { char * text; }; typedef struct data d; d->text = ???
