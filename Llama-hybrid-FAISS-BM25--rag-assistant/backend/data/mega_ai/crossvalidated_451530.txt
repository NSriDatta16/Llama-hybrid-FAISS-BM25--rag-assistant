What exactly does it mean "conditional to random effect"?

I understand, that in (generalized) mixed models, the calculated $\beta$ s are not population ones, but rather "conditional to the random effect". Let's say, I have a model, where I assess a set of animals, several times, so the model includes the animal ID as the random effect: response ~ Treatment + Time + (1|AnimalID) . I was told, that the interpretation will be: the change (say ratio of the log odds) between two treatments for a certain animal. OK, but WHICH CERTAIN animal ? I have just single $\beta_{treatment}$ returned by the GLMM. Yes, there is a long list of model coefficients (intercept and slopes) per EACH ANIMAL, returned by functions like the lmer in R - so the variance of them can be calculated, but I am asking about the part displayed by default : Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.3605 0.2276 -5.978 2.26e-09 *** trtB -0.9762 0.3033 -3.219 0.001288 ** If there is just one $\beta$ , it must be, somehow, averaged over the animals . How does it work exactly? Response_for_animal_1 averaged with Response_for_animal_2...? But how this differs from GEE, where it's averaged over all animals? What I obtain is not: $\beta_1$ for change in animal #1 $\beta_2$ for change in animal #2 $\beta_...$ for change in animal #...
