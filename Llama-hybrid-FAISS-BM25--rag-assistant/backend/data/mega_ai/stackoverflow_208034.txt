I have no idea to accomplish such task, but Microsoft has its PPT viewer that is for free and very small, maybe in .NET (C#) you can use some kinda function to save into a intermediate file that you need... and by the way, how are you handling slide transictions? I found a software that does that but you need MS PPT installed. this was just an idea, now regarding your actually question: you can create your own installation of OO, just jump to the Installation project and follow the lines. I did not read 'til the end, but from the 1st paragraph it seams what you are searching for.
