Inheritance..infact Multiple Inheritance (as in parent-child "inheritance" not 1-to-1 relation inheritance which many web frameworks implement when working with postgres). PostGIS (spatial extension), a wonderful add-on that offers comprehensive set of geometry functions and coordinates storage out of the box. Widely used in many open-source geo libs (e.g. OpenLayers,MapServer,Mapnik etc) and definitely way better than MySQL's spatial extensions. Writing procedures in different languages e.g. C, Python,Perl etc (makes your life easir to code if you're a developer and not a db-admin). Also all procedures can be stored externally (as modules) and can be called or imported at runtime by specified arguments. That way you can source control the code and debug the code easily. A huge and comprehensive catalogue on all objects implemented in your database (i.e. tables,constraints,indexes,etc). I always find it immensely helpful to run few queries and get all meta info e.g. ,constraint names and fields on which they have been implemented on, index names etc. For me it all becomes extremely handy when I have to load new data or do massive updates in big tables (I would automatically disable triggers and drop indexes) and then recreate them again easily after processing has finished. Someone did an excellent job of writing handful of these queries. http://www.alberton.info/postgresql_meta_info.html Multiple schemas under one database, you can use it if your database has large number of tables, you can think of schemas as categories. All tables (regardless of it's schema) have access to all other tables and functions present in parent db.
