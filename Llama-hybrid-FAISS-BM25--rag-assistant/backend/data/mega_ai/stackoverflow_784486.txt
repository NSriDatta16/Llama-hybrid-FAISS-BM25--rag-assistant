What is the "best" way to store scripts?

I have hundreds of scripts for testing a component. Each of these scripts contain a set of subscripts and individual records. Subscripts can be used in multiple TC_Level scripts and even in other subscripts. Every script has a unique name. Example: TC_1 | (1) Subscript_a | | | (1) Record i | | | (2) Record ii | (2) Subscript_b | | | (1) Subscript_c | | | | | (1) Record_i | | | | | (2) Record_iii | | | (2) Record_ii | (3) Record_iv | (4) Record_v | ... I would like to store my scripts in a container. read them into a tree view within my script engine. What type of container should I use? Possible containers (but not limited to) : directory, database, XML file, spreadsheet, flat file, ... Please, when making suggestions, also include a short sample (not necessarily code) of storage structure. I have seen c# examples of populating treeviews form databases but I do not think I can use a reference to a parentID (for the subscripts) since a subscript can have more than one parentID.
