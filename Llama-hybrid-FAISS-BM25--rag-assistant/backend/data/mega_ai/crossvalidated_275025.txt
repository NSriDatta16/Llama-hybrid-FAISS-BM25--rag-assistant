That is fine way to structure the data, yes. Your trepidation comes from your data taking on a multilevel structure: Dogs are nested within races. You can test if you "need" to account for this multilevel structure by doing multilevel modeling. You can specify a model with a random intercept at the race level (Level 2) and one without this random intercept. Then you can compare these two models to see if the addition of the random intercept accounts for a significant proportion of the variance in your outcome. The lme4 package in R is my go-to for running multilevel models, and it handles logistic regression by using the glmer() function along with the family= argument, specifying binomial.
