To add to the previous responses. You should definitely check out the recent work by Tibshirani and colleagues. They have developed a rigorous framework for inferring selection-corrected p-values and confidence intervals for lasso-type methods and also provide an R-package. See: Lee, Jason D., et al. "Exact post-selection inference, with application to the lasso." The Annals of Statistics 44.3 (2016): 907-927. ( https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1460381681 ) Taylor, Jonathan, and Robert J. Tibshirani. "Statistical learning and selective inference." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 112.25 (2015): 7629-7634.
