What happens if the neighborhood radius in SOM set to zero?

In a project about the self-organizing map, in which I used miniSom library when I used 0 for the neighborhood radius (sigma) only one node was the winner (node 0,0). I would like to know if it is due to the implementation or if it is an expected result based on the way SOM works?
