Correlation with seasonal data

I've got 5+ years of data, with multiple observations per week. I'd like to understand if there is a correlation between my dependent and independent variables. The catch is that I know this data is highly seasonal, with lows in winter and highs in summer. My concern is that the correlation could be thrown off by this. My first thought was to group the data by season and perform the correlation within each season, but I assumed there was a better statistical method for this. So far, everything I've seen seems to be based on the idea of rolling the data up by month, running ARIMA or SEATS on the data, and then projecting. What I haven't seen is how one would apply this to my original problem. Is it legitimate to average my data up by month, use ARIMA or SEATS to get the seasonal component by month, and then subtract that out of each individual element so I can correlate across seasons? If not, any input on how to tackle this problem would be greatly appreciated.
