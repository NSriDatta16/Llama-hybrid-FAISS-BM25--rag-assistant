Top ten ordering in Excel based on complex team rules

I have an excel spreadsheet in a format similar to the following... | NAME | CLUB | STATUS | SCORE | | Fred | a | Gent | 145 | | Bert | a | Gent | 150 | | Harry | a | Gent | 195 | | Jim | a | Gent | 150 | | Clare | a | Lady | 99 | | Simon | a | Junior | 130 | | John | b | Junior | 130 | : : | Henry | z | Gent | 200 | I need to convert this table into a list of the "Top Ten" teams. The rules are Each team score is taken from the sum of four members of that club. These totals should be of the best four scores except... Each team must consist of at least one Junior or Lady For example in the table above the team score for club A would be 625 not 640 as you would take the scores for Harry(190), Bert(150), Jim(150), and Simon(130). You could not take Fred's(145) score as that would give you only Gents. My question is, can this be done easily as a series of Excel formula, or will I need to resort to using something more procedural? Ideally the solution needs to be automatic in the team selections, I don't want to have to create separate hand crafted formula for each team. I also will not necessarily have a neatly ordered list of each clubs members. Although I could probably generate the list via an extra calculation sheet.
