Change LINQ2SQL property in partial class?

I have a table in my LINQ2SQL diagram with a column called DayOfWeek in table JourneyBooking. The designer.cs has the definition of this as: [Column(Storage="_DayOfWeek", DbType="TinyInt NOT NULL")] public int DayOfWeek { get { return this._DayOfWeek; } set { if ((this._DayOfWeek != value)) { this.OnDayOfWeekChanging(value); this.SendPropertyChanging(); this._DayOfWeek = value; this.SendPropertyChanged("DayOfWeek"); this.OnDayOfWeekChanged(); } } } I have a partial class for the JourneyBooking class. Is it possible to extend/overwrite the above DayOfWeek property with my own property? The issue I am having is that DayOfWeek is 0-6 in C# but 1-7 in SQL, so I was thinking that I could overwrite the DayOfWeek property to subtract or add 1 depending on whether it was a get or set, is this possible or would I need to re-write all of the above code in my partial class?
