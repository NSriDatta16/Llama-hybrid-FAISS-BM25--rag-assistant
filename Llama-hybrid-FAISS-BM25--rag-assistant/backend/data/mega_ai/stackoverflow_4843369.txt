Storing hexadecimal values from a std::string in a std::vector and vise versa?

Let's say you've got a std::string("DEADBEEF") , what would be the most elegant way to store each two values in a std::vector (most likely a std::vector , if possible) so the std::vector would look a little like { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF } (if it was an array)? And what would be the nicest way to undo that ( std::vector -> std::string ).
