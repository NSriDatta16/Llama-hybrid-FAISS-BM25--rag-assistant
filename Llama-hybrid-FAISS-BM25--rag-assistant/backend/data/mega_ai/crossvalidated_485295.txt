One way to look at this is that your probability of "success" (occurrence of your dependent variable) is a function of time. When you introduce the dummy at a fixed time point, you introduce a discontinuity into the time trend. In your model, this appears to be estimated as a drop at that time point, which I gather is not what you were hoping for. On the other hand, one does not expect things to happen instantaneously, as your discontinuity model would suggest. It is somewhat encouraging from your perspective that your interaction is positive, because that suggests a steeper trend after than before. Some caveats. First, time trends are not linear. They can be tricky to estimate because they generally do not follow nice function forms. Some kind of non- or semi-parametric smoothing trick might be preferred to estimate the time function. Second, you have one time function before the law, and another after the law. How to string those together will be tricky. A dummy variable introduces an instantaneous jump that seems inappropriate given that things take time to have an effect. Third, it seems that you really don't have enough data to do estimate everything as well as you would like to. Fourth, causality will be hard to claim in this context.
