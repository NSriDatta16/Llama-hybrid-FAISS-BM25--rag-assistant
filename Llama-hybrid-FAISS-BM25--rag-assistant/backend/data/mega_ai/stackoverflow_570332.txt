The answer depends on the language. JavaScript for instance can naturally handle viewing the HTML DOM and there are libraries such as ProtoType that would make quick work of it. Similarly, Garann's answer would get you on your way. In other languages, I would suggest using regular expressions to find tags that have paragraph tags in them. This would likely involve turning the entire html into a single string and processing it. Assuming that it is properly formatted HTML, you could strip out all the content, leaving only the tags. Doing that first would make the subsequent steps move faster. Then it is likely a matter of some loops and some counters.
