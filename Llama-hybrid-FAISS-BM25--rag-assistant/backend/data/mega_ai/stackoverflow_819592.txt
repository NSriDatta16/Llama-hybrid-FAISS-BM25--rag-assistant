OMA Email Notification WAP Push trouble

I'm trying to send an OMA Email Notification( EMN ) 1.0 WAP-Push, to a mobile device in order to make it fetch the newest emails for a given mailbox. My problem is that nothing happens when the mobile receives the SMS. I tested with an Nokia E71, which ought to have the specification implemented according to Nokia's own technical specs. On the device i have set up an IMAP email account for the email adresss 'my_email@gmail.com'. I read somewhere that it was also necessary to set 'Email Notifications' to 'auto-update' in the 'automatic retrieval' menu. So with the setup explained, here's what I tried to send: The header: UDH=WDP+WSP WDP=0605040B8423F0 06 - Length of WDP in octets 05 - information element identifier, application port addressing scheme, 16-bit address 04 - information element length in octets 0B84 - Destination port (2948) 23F0 - Source port (9200) WSP=250603030A09 25 - transaction id (connectionless WSP) 06 - PDU Type: Push 03 - Length of headers in octets 030A - Content-type: application/vnd.wap.emn+wbxml 09 - Application-id: x-wap-application:emn.ua The body: 030D6A008507036D795F656D61696C40676D61696C2E636F6D0005C30620090504121501 03 - WBXML version 1.3 0D - EMN 1.0 public identifier 6A - Encoding UTF-8 00 - String table length = 0 85 - -tag with attributes 07 - Mailbox=mailat: (Attribute) 03 - Inline string follows 6D795F656D61696C40676D61696C2E636F6D - 'my_email@gmail.com' 00 - End of string 05 - Timestamp (Attribute) C3 - Opaque data follows 06 - data is 6 octets long 200905041215 - 20090504T12:15:00Z 01 - I know this is a very specific question and might be difficult to answer, but I hope somebody is capable of pointing out what I'm doing wrong...
