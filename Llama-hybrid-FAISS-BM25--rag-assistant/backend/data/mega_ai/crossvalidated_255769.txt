No. Random Forests are based on tree partitioning algorithms. As such, there's no analogue to a coefficient one obtain in general regression strategies, which would depend on the units of the independent variables. Instead, one obtain a collection of partition rules, basically a decision given a threshold, and this shouldn't change with scaling. In other words, the trees only see ranks in the features. Basically, any monotonic transformation of your data shouldn't change the forest at all (in the most common implementations). Also, decision trees are usually robust to numerical instabilities that sometimes impair convergence and precision in other algorithms.
