How to take string value of XML including other tags from within an xml object

Using PHP and simplexml if possible, I'd like to parse the following example document to extract the whole value of what is contained within the text tag, including the paragraph, content, and whatever else tags are there. USE IN PREGNANCY When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, ACE inhibitors can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. When pregnancy is detected, quinapril tablets USP&#160;should be discontinued as soon as possible. See WARNINGS , Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality . When I reference it in php/simplexml as such, it returns nothing. $message .= $xml->section->text; This is a simple example for a huge project where the contents of the text tag vary greatly, so I cannot just solve this one example specifically. I'd like the output to be: When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, ACE inhibitors can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. When pregnancy is detected, quinapril tablets USP&#160;should be discontinued as soon as possible. See WARNINGS , Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality . Many thanks, as I'm sure there is a simple solution that I'm overlooking.
