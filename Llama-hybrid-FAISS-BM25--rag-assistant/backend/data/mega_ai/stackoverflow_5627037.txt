How can I embed an SQLite database into an application?

I think I have some basic understanding problem so maybe someone's able to help :-) I'm developing an Android application using Eclipse and this application will make use of a database (only reading from the database will be implemented). The database contains around 4,000 entries i.e. creating and populating the database via source code is not an option. Thus I have created the database in advance with all its records. But how can I "embed" this database file into my application and then access it? The databse will be around 500 kB in file size. Downloading from a remote server is not an option either as this is not allowed. Thanks, Robert
