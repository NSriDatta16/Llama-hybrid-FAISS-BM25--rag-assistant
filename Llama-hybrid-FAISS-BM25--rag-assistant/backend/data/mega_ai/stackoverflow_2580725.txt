Of course, you probably have your own reasons for wanting a feature like this, but from the design point of view I would vote strongly against this if this was my code. Writing 32 (in the worst case) different paragraphs for your example will definitely provide human-readable sentences for your end user and make them feel like someone is communicating to them. Trying to generate something automatically will rob you of much time and still will look too bland, especially if you end user should happen to see the survey results more than once.
