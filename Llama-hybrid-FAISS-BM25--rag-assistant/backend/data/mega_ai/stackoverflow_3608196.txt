to Pascal Cuoq and the 35 other people who up-voted his comment: "Wow! More than 10 million times... You mean that if you squeeze three cycles out of this function, you will save as much as 0.03s? " Such a sarcastic comment is at best rude and offensive. Optimization is frequently the cumulative result of 3% here, 2% there. 3% in overall capacity is nothing to be sneezed at. Suppose this was an almost saturated and unparallelizable stage in a pipe. Suppose CPU utilization went from 99% to 96%. Simple queuing theory tells one that such a reduction in CPU utilization would reduce the average queue length by over 75%. [the qualitative (load divided by 1-load)] Such a reduction can frequently make or break a particular hardware configuration as this has feed back effects on memory requirements, caching the queued items, lock convoying, and (horror of horrors should it be a paged system) even paging. It is precisely these sorts of effects that cause bifurcated hysteresis loop type system behavior. Arrival rates of anything seem to tend to go up and field replacement of a particular CPU or buying a faster box is frequently just not an option. Optimization is not just about wall clock time on a desktop. Anyone who thinks that it is has much reading to do about the measurement and modelling of computer program behavior. Pascal Cuoq owes the original poster an apology.
