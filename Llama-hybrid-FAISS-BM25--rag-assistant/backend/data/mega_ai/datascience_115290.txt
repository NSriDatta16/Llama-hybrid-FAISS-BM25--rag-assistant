Can I use Population Stability Index (PSI) when observations have multiple variables?

I understand from resources like this one that the Population Stability Index (PSI) can be used to test for data drift when a machine learning model is in production. However, the resources I have looked at describe PSI in terms of a single variable. Can PSI be applied when observations include multiple variables? How?
