InfoPath is a component of the Microsoft Office Suite of applications. It is an application that allows for the creation of XML based form templates and the collection of structured data. Templates can be deployed to Windows desktops or to an Office SharePoint server. The application can also leverage web services and SharePoint lists as well as SQL Server and Access databases. Infopath is discontinued on 1 jan 2014, but will be supported until 2026. Wiki links https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_InfoPath http://blogs.office.com/2014/01/31/update-on-infopath-and-sharepoint-forms/ InfoPath status in a nutshell There will be no InfoPath 2016, but InfoPath 2013 is filling that role. SharePoint 2016 works with InfoPath 2013, which will be supported until 2026 as if it were part of Office 2016. InfoPath 2013 is now available in the Microsoft Download Center. Microsoft has provided guidance that the successor to InfoPath will be PowerApps, but with caveats: feature parity with InfoPath is not a goal, and InfoPath will still be preferred for some scenarios involving offline work and rich XML documents, for example. Office 365 will support InfoPath browser forms in SharePoint Online ‘until further notice‘. There were indications that support might end one year after the release of Office 2016, but that date has now passed. InfoPath browser forms with code do not work with the Managed Solutions Gallery (SP 2010, 2013, 2016) InfoPath browser forms with code do not work on SharePoint Online. InfoPath browser forms do not work on mobile devices when SharePoint Online mobile view is enabled. There are reports of problems using InfoPath 2013 with Outlook 2016 email. Taken from this blog
