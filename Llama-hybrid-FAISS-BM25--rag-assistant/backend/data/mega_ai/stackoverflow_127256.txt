Out of curiousity, why are you passing 'this' to a member function of the same class? setTopWorldAgent() can use 'this' directly. It doesn't look like your constructor or setTopWorldAgent() are static, so I'm not sure why you would pass a member function something it already has access to. Unless I'm missing something...
