Cumulative predicted probabilities in logistic regression

I'm analyzing users' in-game data in order to model whether they're going to be paid user or not. Here's my model: Logistic Regression Model lrm(formula = becomePaid ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6, data = sn, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim. Ratio Test Indexes Indexes Obs 1e+05 LR chi2 1488.63 R2 0.147 C 0.774 0 99065 d.f. 6 g 1.141 Dxy 0.547 1 935 Pr(> chi2) |Z|) Intercept -6.7910 0.0938 -72.36 And in my model, I created couple of use cases such as: test1 test2 x1 8 9 x2 10 10 x3 250 250 x4 6 6 x5 2 2 x6 0 1 Then the probability of user test1 is to turn out to be a paid user is %.07 and % 0.84 for test2. However I want to calculate the cumulative probabilities such as users whose' x1 values are greater than 8, x2 values are between 10 and 20 and so on. Is there any way to calculate this ? Thanks !
