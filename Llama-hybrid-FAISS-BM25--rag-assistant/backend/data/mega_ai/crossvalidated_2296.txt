Papers on Bayesian factor analysis?

I am interested in fitting a factor analysis-like model on asset returns or other similar latent variable models. What are good papers to read on this topic? I am particularly interested in how to handle the fact that a factor analysis model is identical under a sign change for the "factor loadings".
