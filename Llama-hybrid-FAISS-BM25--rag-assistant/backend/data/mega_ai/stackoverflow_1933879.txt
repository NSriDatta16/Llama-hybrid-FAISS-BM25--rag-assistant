If I were you, I would code it like this in the "GridView_PageIndexChanged" method (gvTable.BottomPagerRow.FindControl("btnNextPage") as LinkButton).Enabled = true/false; Edit:Can you also try adding a setter ? set { gvTable.BottomPagerRow.FindControl("btnNextPage") as LinkButton =value; } Edit: OK my friend, I finally worked out a solution. May be not very elegant,but it works and I tested it. There are a few things to take care of: 1. We are having a "Prev" and a "Next" button and we got to handle "OnCommand" events for those since we are using our own Pager Template 2. We would have to bind data after we handle our OnCommand event. I have a static List which I populated during GET with random strings (Courtesy: http://www.kivela.be/index.php/2007/06/19/how-to-generate-a-random-string-in-c-20/ ) and bound them to my grid. You can substitute your own datasource here.Also, we have to change the grid's page index manually in our OnCommand Event. Here is my aspx/ascx grid and here is the codebehind public partial class TestPage : System.Web.UI.Page { private static Random _random = new Random(); static List lst = new List (); protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (!Page.IsPostBack) { for (int i = 1; i Hope this helps
