We use H2 as the storage engine for a very large RCP/Eclipse-based design tool. The tool itself has been in use for over 2 years now on some data-heavy projects so we've stressed H2 pretty thoroughly. We did a fairly in-depth analysis of other Java embeddable db engines and chose H2. Overall I think we're pretty happy with it. We've had very few stability issues, but, as zvikico says, the development team is VERY responsive. While the performance is good, sometimes you need to do some optimizations by hand. If you're used to working with enterprise-level databases that do a lot of this optimization for you, it may be a bit of a change. I'd recommend using the EXPLAIN command if you encounter a slow query to see what it's doing. Very often you can switch around the JOIN statements to force it to use indices more efficiently. So, in short, thumbs up from me!
