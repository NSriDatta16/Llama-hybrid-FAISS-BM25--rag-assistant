The answer by triple J here is already sufficient (+1). I would like to add perhaps another informative answer. The history behind effect sizes is interesting and has been going on for longer than is given credit. Psychologists often know effect sizes via Cohen as suggested in the other answer, but these precluded him a long time ago (Huberty, 2002). Since that time, researchers and statisticians have tried to provide informative advice about how to use effect sizes in a useful way, but best efforts have been turned into a haphazard methods. Nowhere is this more clear than the cutoff criterions made by Cohen, which were at the time well-intentioned and still useful, but nonetheless don't serve the purposes of helping researchers in every situation in modern contexts. Let us use mixed models as an example. For a long time there was no such thing as effect sizes (at least in the conventional sense) for mixed models. It was only until Nakagawa and Schielzeth published a couple papers in 2013 that this came to the forefront (see references below). But this only addressed one aspect, which was model effect size. They later addressed this in a later paper which defined part $R^2$ (Stoffel et al., 2021). And yet because partial effect sizes are still so new (I rarely see them reported in my area of research), it is very unclear what can be considered small or large. Now what does that mean for your specific scenario? We often have to ask ourselves what is considered a useful effect size in your situation. Is $\eta^2 = .02$ a common effect size in your field? If so, what would be considered a value which you would consider extreme? This would do a great job of informing you and others of what is useful in this context. I would use past research as some barometer of which effect sizes are useful. Thankfully, $\eta^2$ and partial $\eta^2$ have been around for some time, so you should be able to find a number of articles that report this, and hopefully inform you of what is useful.
