Subversion supports various keywords like $Id$ , $Author$ , $Revision$ and so on. To use those you need to set the svn:keywords property accordingly. However, you can't insert the commit comment like $Log$ does. See the subversion FAQ for the reasons about this, and I can only agree with the reasons given there. Putting the commit comments into the file is simply broken by design, and any such comment is wrong the moment you can't check it against the repository. Other version control systems also don't support this, and most of them with a similar reasoning (for example, git ). Please don't argue with something like that being a "requirement for the project". If released code has to include a change history you can add this history when creating the release with some helper script rather easily. At least, subversion simply doesn't support it. And I would strongly discourage trying to achive this with a pre-commit hook. Commit hooks should never change the data that gets committed.
