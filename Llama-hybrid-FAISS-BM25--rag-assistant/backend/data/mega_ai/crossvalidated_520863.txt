I'm not a huge fan of such plots for presentation. You have one continuous covariate and one continuous response variable, so it's easy to make a scatterplot. Use different symbols and colors to indicate the groups. Then draw the model fit over the data. Because you have no interactions, there is only one slope for all lines. You arguably have 8 different intercepts / lines, because you have 2 (treatment) X 4 (replication) combinations. However, I gather the replications are a nuisance variable, so you can plot just two lines and average over the 4 possible replication intercepts. Remember that only the intercept for the control - replication A is explicitly given; the others need to be computed as the sum of the reference level intercept and the indicated mean difference. That yields the plot below: d = structure(list(ID = 1:486, Replicate = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, ... 0.282106782, 0.170995671, 0.272186147)), row.names = c(NA, 486L), class = "data.frame") model |t|) # (Intercept) -1.1535131 0.1355653 -8.509 2.26e-16 *** # ReplicateB 0.0157737 0.0228894 0.689 0.491 # ReplicateC -0.0020325 0.0219511 -0.093 0.926 # ReplicateD 0.0156909 0.0223565 0.702 0.483 # Treatmentyes -0.0773390 0.0156616 -4.938 1.09e-06 *** # Size 0.0095294 0.0008997 10.591 $Replicate), col=ifelse(d$ Treatment=="yes", "blue", "red")) baseline = sum(rep(coef(model)[1:4], times=c(4,1,1,1)))/4 abline(a=baseline, b=coef(model)[6], lwd=2, col="red") abline(a=baseline+coef(model)[5], b=coef(model)[6], lwd=2, col="blue") legend("topleft", bty="n", col=rep(c("red","blue"), each=5), pch=c(1,2,3,4,NA,1,2,3,4,NA), lwd=c(NA,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,2), legend=c("A treat data", "B treat data", "C treat data", "D treat data", "treat model", "A ctrl data", "B ctrl data", "C ctrl data", "D ctrl data", "ctrl model")) To me, this is much more informative. It is more in keeping with what the typical reader is expecting, and doesn't need extensive explanation. I can immediately see that the blue (treated) data are lower. I can see that there is a prominent floor effect and resulting heteroscedasticity (confirmed with other plots).
