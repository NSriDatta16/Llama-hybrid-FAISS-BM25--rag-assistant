The decoder is there because their goal is to predict the future points of the time series. (And one of the focuses of the Informer model is to do that for a run of points efficiently.) If your purpose is something else, such as classification, you could use just the encoder part of the model, putting a classification head on top. By the way, using encoder+decoder is not about making it making it more general-purpose. Using a variety of training data, and usually more layers and embedding dimension, are what would do that.
