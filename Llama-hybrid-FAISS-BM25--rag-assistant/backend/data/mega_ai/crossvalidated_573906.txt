In mgcv penalized regression is used to fit models. Penalized regression requires a basis set of functions by its nature. If you don't set a basis, gam uses thin plate splines, which as said in Wood (2017) is a powerful and reasonable default. Not all smoothers are based on penalized regression and does not require a basis as a result. Hastie and Tibshirani (1990) included other types of smoothers in their framework, such as moving average/LOESS-type smoothers, which can be fit using their backfitting algorithm and is provided in the R package gam . When thinking about smoothers to use, you should be thinking about what properties you want the smooth to have, such as differentiability or working well with multiple inputs, but those issues aside, the smoother itself (basis set, LOESS, etc.) probably shouldn't matter too much, and issues such as ability to compute quickly or properties such as differentiability should drive the decision more. The bigger concern is always parameters controlling the level of smoothing. All smoothers have something that controls how smooth it is (the level of penalization, or the bandwidth for moving averages), and that has greater influence on fit quality.
