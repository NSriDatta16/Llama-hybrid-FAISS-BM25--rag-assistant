I would recommend that you determine your sample size by simulation, similar to this earlier thread . Simulate "reasonable" data. Since you are looking at sales, take a look at historical sales time series to get an idea of possible distributions or influencing factors, like seasonality or promotions. Perhaps resample existing sales time series, with or without modification. Then include an assumption about the size of the effect you want to detect with your experiment. My recommendation about what size to assume is always to use an effect you would be sorry to miss . If you are looking at the sales uplift from a changed store layout, maybe an uplift of 2% would be too small to roll out the changed layout to all stores, but an uplift of 5% would be worth it. If so, modify your simulated sales in the experimental group by 5%, e.g., by simulating negative binomial sales with a mean that is 5% higher. Run your "experiment" for a given time period, say a month. "Analyze" your data the way you plan, and see whether you find the simulated effect. Do this multiple (many) times and see, in fact, whether you find the effect as often as you want to. A power of 80% (i.e., finding the effect in 80% of the simulations) is often targeted, but you may aim for a higher or a lower power. If your power is too low, increase the sample size, by increasing the length of the "experiment" (or including more stores if you have a setup as I allude to above, or use more data in some other way appropriate to your experiment). If your power is too high, you can likely run your experiment with less resources, by reducing the sample size. A setup like this allows you to test various assumptions. Perhaps some of your experimental units may drop out - you can simulate this. Maybe you have predictors - include them (and assumptions about their distribution, and their influence on your target variable) in your data generating process and your analysis plan. Yes, this is quite some work, but you can timebox it and only be as elaborate in your simulation as your time for sample size determination allows. It's still typically better to invest a few days in this planning step, rather than find out afterwards that your study was under- or overpowered.
