Why is OnDragEnter not called?

I have added the COleDropTarget variable to my view class and registered it in the OnCreate(), which is being called at startup. I added the OnDragEnter and OnDrop virtual functions (not the others yet, as OnDragLeave). But they are not called when I drag (or drop) a piece of text over them. I just happened to think about the fact that I had already implemented the dropfiles function to the same window. Is this preventing the text drag? What else do I need? TIA, Harvey
