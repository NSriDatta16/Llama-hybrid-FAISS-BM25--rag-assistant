You can use something like the standard deviation , taking the square root of the average of the squared deviations of the ranking positions from their final value. If the final ranking is a-b-c-d-e , you'll have $\sigma_1 = \sqrt { {1+1+0+1+1} \over {5}}= 0.89 $ for b-a-c-e-d $\sigma_2 = \sqrt { {0+4+1+1+0} \over {5}} = 1.10 $ for a-d-b-c-e showing that the first model is better, even if it has four errors (while second model has three and correctly identify the first position).
