If over years of development different people code change requests and bug fixes you will sooner or later get parts of code with duplicated functionality, very similar classes, some spaghetti etc. This is mostly due to the fact that a fix is needed fast and the "new guy" doesn't know the code base. So he happily codes away something which is already there. But if you have automatic checks in place checking the style, unit test code coverage and similar you can avoid some of it.
