Where can I find a database (sqlite, csv, etc) of Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set data?

I'm writing an engine for Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set (Red and Blue Box) First Edition (1E) in Python and would like to be able to read from an existing database of what is in the players and experts guide books. I'm looking for all the numerical data and spell data for all the classes and monsters. I figure that something like this exists, and after plenty of Google'ing, I've found some for later editions, but not for the older ones. It's fine if it is in some other format, but I'd like to be able to make it into a local, offline database format (like SQLite).
