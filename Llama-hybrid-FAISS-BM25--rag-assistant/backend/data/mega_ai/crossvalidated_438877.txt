Determining the degree of confidence of a Prediction

I'm handling a text multi class classification problem using RNN LSTM and model is pretty accurate (approximately 95%). But I'm interested in finding the degree of accuracy of a Prediction. Can I make a function that can take the probabilities of a single prediction for each class and then output a degree of confidence? For example I've a 4 class classification problem. I built a model and test it over a single Prediction. Probabilities for that Prediction came out to be [0.2, 0.36, 0.1, 0.34] respectively for each class. Prediction will be 2 by the model. But class 4 and class 2 are very close and therefore the degree of confidence should be low for this Prediction as the model is not very confident. What would be the best function for the above measurement? Thanks in advance!!
