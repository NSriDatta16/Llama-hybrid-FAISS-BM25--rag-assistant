SQL Server CLR to embed business logic and schedule execution with SQL Server Agent

I have the business logic of an workflow-like application in a C# class library, but at end of each month certain process in the library needs to be invoked, i thought that the ideal mechanism to invoke this scheduled execution is using the Sql server agent (sql job preferably, althought i'm open to even go into SSIS hell if its absolutely required), but the question is how do i invoke the process of the application library from the sql job? the application library is also used from asp.net pages, so it usually has a web application context (web.config) with configured input and output databases I understand that the steps are more or less 1) embed the class library in a sql server CLR assembly, strong key sign and deploy it 2) call the library the thing i am not clear is, when deploying such a CLR assembly, what happens with the web application context? how do i exactly go to deploy the CLR with the appropiate app.config? do i have to redeploy the CLR if i need to change the connection strings? I am unsure also because the CLR needs to connect back to the database which is invoking it (for read and write table purposes) but i'm guessing one has to be extra cautious to avoid self-invoking and that sort of thing.
