It would be helpful to see more data to be clearer on why this is occuring. With that being said, here is my take on the problems you describe: 1) Have you already checked with a QQ-Plot (if you are using R, input: qqnorm(variable); qqline(variable) the distribution of your model? You need to make sure that the distribution (or the one you transform it to) makes theoretical sense, and you are not just doing so by a trial and error process. 2) A logistic regression, by its very nature, has much less variation in the dependent variable than an OLS regression, since the dependent variable is not interval. In this regard, higher numbers of observations are preferable when running a logistic regression (500 or greater according to Studenmund et. al). Does your dataset have sufficient observations to explain the variation in the dependent variable? You should think carefully about the above two factors, along with reevaluating whether your independent variables make theoretical sense in the first instance, before attempting to transform data in this manner.
