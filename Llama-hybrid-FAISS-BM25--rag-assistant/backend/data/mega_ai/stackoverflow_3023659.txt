A Captcha cannot be automated that easily. That is why they were invented!! Alas... You can use code hackers and Image Recognition patterns and scripts. It is called OCR. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition I will not write more about this as i wont encourage others for hacking ideas. But... First: Google is your friend. Second: In my testing environment we used a captcha with a static value. And then before it went live we removed set it again for the algorithm. Gergely.
