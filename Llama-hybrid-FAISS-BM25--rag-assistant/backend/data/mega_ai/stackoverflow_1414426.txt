As set by the standard, all global and function static variables automatically initialised to 0. Automatic variables are not initialised. int a[10]; // global - all elements are initialised to 0 void foo(void) { int b[10]; // automatic storage - contain junk static int c[10]; // static - initialised to 0 } However it is a good practice to always manually initialise function variable, regardless of its storage class. To set all array elements to 0 you just need to assign first array item to 0 - omitted elements will set to 0 automatically: int b[10] = {0};
