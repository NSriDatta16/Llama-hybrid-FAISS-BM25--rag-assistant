If you already have some domain knowledge what are the reasonable seasons for causing the sales change, you can engineer this into features: company. SeasonX. SeasonY. SeasonZ etc A 120%. 150%. B. 150%. 120. The percentage indicates the changes in sales compared to the previous season. Then you can apply clustering to the data and extract patterns which companies are similar in terms of their seasonality, and visualise this in PCA.
