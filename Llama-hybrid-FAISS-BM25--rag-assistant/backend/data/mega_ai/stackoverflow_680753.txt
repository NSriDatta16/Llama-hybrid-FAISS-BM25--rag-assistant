How do I send and receive encrypted email in Ruby on Rails?

I have a rails application that triggers Emails on certain events. These emails are sent to a separate company who will add some additional data to the email when replying. This is all understood and working, I am parsing the replies, extracting the data and it works fine. I have now been asked to encrypt the emails. Does anyone have any experience/ideas on the best way to do this? I can not guarantee what Email client the 3rd party will be using so I need a solution that would work generically across many email clients. The encryption must be made both by my application when I send the email and by the client application (Outlook, Thunderbird, Entourage etc) when it replies. I will then need to receive the encrypted email, decrypt and parse it to extract the new information I need. Can anyone point me at plugins/documents that would help me achieve this?
