Given that the samples are independent, I would Infer the posterior of the binomial rate in each sample, e.g., $p_A n_A \sim Binomial(n_A, p_A)$ . Compute the posterior distribution for ( $\delta_{AB} = p_A - p_B$ and $\delta_{CD} = p_C - p_D$ ). Compute the posterior distribution for $\Delta = \delta_{AB} - \delta_{CD}$ . The evidence that $\delta_{AB} > \delta_{CD}$ is now the area of the posterior where $\Delta > 0$ . Because I am lazy, I would use MCMC sampling for each of the binomial rates and subtract pairwise iterations for each of the parameters. The evidence is then the proportion of samples where $\Delta > 0$ .
