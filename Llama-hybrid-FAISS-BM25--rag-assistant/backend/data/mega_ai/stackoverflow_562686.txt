If you can afford the dependency on the stack, go for .NET Modern, elegant, powerful and as a result much quicker to develop for. But realize that you chain your app to it - to the language and the framework, if you forsee a future where you may want to escape this, then better think twice. Win32 is old and clunky, but it works on virtually any Windows version without extra dependencies, and your code can be in plain, portable, C/C++.
