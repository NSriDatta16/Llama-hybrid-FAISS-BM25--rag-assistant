A clustered index specifies the physical storage order of the table data (this is why there can only be one clustered index per table). If there is no clustered index, inserts will typically be faster since the data doesn't have to be stored in a specific order but can just be appended at the end of the table. On the other hand, index searches on the key column will typically be slower, since the searches cannot use the advantages of the clustered index.
