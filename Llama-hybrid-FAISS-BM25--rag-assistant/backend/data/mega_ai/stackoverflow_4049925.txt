Are you using embedding (that is, you build your own executable that inits the mono runtime)? In that case the possibilitites are usually two: You have a typo The compiler/linker removed during optimization the function from your binary To check for either, run: nm your_program |grep Foobar and see if a symbol with that name is present in the executable your_program. If you see a mangled name it means extern "C" was not applied correctly in your code. If you're not using embedding, you need to use the dynamic library name and not __Internal in DllImport (and check for typos and the above linker optimization issue as well).
