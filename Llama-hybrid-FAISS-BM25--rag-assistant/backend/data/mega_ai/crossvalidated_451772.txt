Before trying to answer the question, we need to clarify at least two things: "What do we mean by adjusted $R^2$ ? and "What do we mean by 'better'"? Ultimately, the goal is to estimate the true proportion of variance explained in the population $\rho^2$ . A multitude of different estimators were proposed. Gwowen Shieh $^{[1]}$ compares no less than 18 different estimators and Karch $^{[3]}$ compares 20 different estimators. A good overview can be found in $[2]$ and $[3]$ . So the term "adjusted $R^2$ " is ambiguous. It's no help that different software implement different formulas, making it difficult to compare the "adjusted $R^2$ ". R, for example, uses the Wherry Formula-1 according to the nomenclature of Yin et al. $^{[2]}$ (see here ). Now what do we mean by "better"? Shieh $^{[1]}$ and Karch $^{[3]}$ used simulations to compare the different estimators with respect to bias and mean squared error (MSE). Depending on what researches prioritize, what's the "best" estimator varies. For example, Karch $^{[3]}$ found that: The exact Olkin-Pratt estimator was optimal. It was the only estimator that was unbiased across all conditions. Additionally, it had practically identical MSE within any condition compared to other unbiased estimators within that condition. Consequently, under this perspective, the exact Olkin-Pratt estimator should always be used. But he also writes: Only if the researcher is confident that minimizing MSE is more critical than unbiasedness should a different estimator be used. In this case, I recommend an individualized choice based on the strategy described at the beginning of this discussion and if this is not feasible the positive-part version of the Ezekiel estimator. Interestingly, even the normal, unadjusted $R^2$ which is clearly positively biased had the lowest mean squared error in at least one simulation scenario.
