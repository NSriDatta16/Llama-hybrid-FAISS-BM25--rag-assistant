F# or C# for personal Silverlight project?

I'm about to start working on a rich-internet-application project for a student organization at my university. I will be the only programmer, and what technologies to use is totally up to me. I've already decided on going with Silverlight, but I'm not sure whether to use C# or F#. Here are some of the things I'm keeping in mind: C#: I already know it and have used it extensively with Silverlight at work. I have no F# and little general FP experience. Some say the OOP paradigm works better for complex stateful UIs. Maintenance: I'll be in school for three more years, but after that if the app is still in use they may have a better time finding someone else to maintain it if I use a more common language. C# experience is probably more valuable in the "real world". F#: The main reason is I want to learn something new. Functional programming languages seem pretty cool (I find myself using the FP features of C# very often, and think they're the biggest improvement in C# 3.0). I think I'd have a lot more fun if I used F#, but am I being unrealistic in thinking the cost in time and effort might not outweigh the benefits?
