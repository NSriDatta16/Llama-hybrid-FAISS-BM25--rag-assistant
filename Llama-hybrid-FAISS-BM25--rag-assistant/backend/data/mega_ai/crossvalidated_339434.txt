Thanks for the explanation of judging and the data example, which make the question helpfully concrete. I will label your judges A and B A helpful plot is difference A $-$ B versus mean (A + B)/2. In biostatistics especially this plot is often called the Bland-Altman plot after statisticians Martin Bland (1947- ) and Douglas Altman (1948- ). It has a longer history and was, for example, often mentioned by John W. Tukey (1915--2000) as a simple device. A natural reference line is A $-$ B = 0 corresponding to agreement A = B. Here is one such for your sample data. I don't think it helps much to look for clusters in this plot or the more obvious scatter plot A versus B unless they really jump out at you. The risk of over-interpreting small clusters is probably greater than that of missing genuine fine structure. A measure of agreement (rather than correlation) is concordance correlation, often attributed to Lin, who has made most of it, but explicit or implicit in earlier work by others. Here are some results from a Stata implementation for your data: Concordance correlation coefficient (Lin, 1989, 2000): rho_c SE(rho_c) Obs [ 95% CI ] P CI type 0.749 0.098 19 0.558 0.940 0.000 asymptotic 0.489 0.887 0.000 z-transform Pearson's r = 0.811 Pr(r = 0) = 0.000 C_b = rho_c/r = 0.923 Reduced major axis: Slope = 0.880 Intercept = 5.215 Difference = A - B Difference 95% Limits Of Agreement Average Std Dev. (Bland & Altman, 1986) -2.658 4.433 -11.347 6.031 Correlation between difference and mean = -0.213 Bradley-Blackwood F = 3.783 (P = 0.04374) The concordance correlation is pulled below the Pearson correlation by any systematic differences between judges. Although just a single-number summary the concordance correlation is focused on measuring agreement, not correlation! A paper of mine details here surveying this territory may be accessible to you. The examples from a different field should not be too distractingly alien: the principles here are generic. Detail: The plot here uses jittering to shake identical points apart.
