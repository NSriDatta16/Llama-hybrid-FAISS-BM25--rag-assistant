Curve fitting in Time series and creation of heatmap uncertainty

I have an univariate time series with daily values of temperature over 60 years with missing values. The size of the gaps varies from a day to a couple of years. My goal is: to impute the missing values to estimate the uncertainty at each day to generate an heatmap (x-axis: days and y-axis: year). My first thought is to fit a curve going through all the points and then calculate the absolute difference between the true value and the predicted value at each day. I am conscious that I won't have any uncertainty estimation when a value is missing. Is my approach correct? If yes, how can I do this? If no, do you have any better ideas? Note: There is definitely a trend and seasonal effect in the time series I am ready to assume stationarity I am coding in R
