The DataFormat is just describing the type of object that is being dropped on your control. For instance, if you drag a couple of items from a ListView onto some other ListView you could check to be sure the data format you're receiving is "System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem[]". If you receive a DataFormat that your control can't handle, then you can just choose to cancel the drop event, or prompt the user, etc.
