Bayes Estimator

Wikipedia has a section on the Bayes Estimator. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_estimator Isn't Bayes Estimator simply the value of the parameter that minimizes the expected loss of a loss function under the posterior distribution? What I am really trying to ask is, in the presence of a prior is there a reason to find this estimator in some other way without going through "the Bayesian update and finding the posterior first and then finding the optimal action"? What's the takeaway from this entire Wikipedia entry?
