Worst Case Analysis for Regular Expressions

Are there any tools that will take a particular regular expression and return the worst case scenario in terms of the number of operations required for a certain number of characters that the regular expression is matched against? So for example, given a (f|a)oo.*[ ]baz , how many steps might the engine possibly go though through to match 100 characters? I would also be interested if there is a tool that can take a bunch of text samples and show the average operations for each run. I realize this will depend a lot on the engine used and the implementation -- but I am ignorant as to how common this is. So if it is common for many languages (making my question too vague) I would be particularly interested in Perl and Python.
