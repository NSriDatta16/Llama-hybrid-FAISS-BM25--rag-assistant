I realise that I am addressing your original problem here rather than your proposed solution (perhaps that's better?), but to use GDB (or Insight/GDB) directly on the target, use a low-cost JTAG tool and OpenOCD . An example of such a set-up and how to implement it can be found here . If you have a larger budget, a more fully featured JTAG debugger may be useful, such as the Abatron BDI3000 with bdiGDB firmware which allows remote debugging and device programming over Ethernet with GDB and no special drivers or target debug agent.
