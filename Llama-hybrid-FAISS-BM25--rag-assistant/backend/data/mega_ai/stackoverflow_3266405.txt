Scala 2.8 and Map views

In 2.7 I could do the following: val lazyM: Map[_, _] = map.projection.mapElements(v => expCalc(v)) //MAP VIEW I can't find a way of doing this in 2.8 and actually ending up with a map : val m: Map[_, _] = map.view.map(kv => kv._1 -> expCalc(kv._2)).toMap //STRICT This seems like a significant loss of functionality and therefore I assume it's hiding in the collection library somewhere. Anyone have any ideas? Edit - stupidly I assumed that mapValues was exactly the same as the old mapElements
