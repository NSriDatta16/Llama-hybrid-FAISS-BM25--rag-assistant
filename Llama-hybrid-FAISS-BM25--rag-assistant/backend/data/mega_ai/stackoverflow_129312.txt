Windows (Vista): Set process-priority on a program shortcut

Is there any way to launch a program with a shortcut, that sets the process-priority of that program? iTunes is dragging my system to it's knees, but when I set the process-priority to "low", somehow, like magic, Windows gets back to it's normal responsive self :)
