Understanding how many biases are there in a neural network?

I am trying to understand biases in neural nets, but different websites show very different answers. For example, how many biases is there in a fully connected neural network with a single input layer with 5 units and a single output layer with 4 units? And what about a fully connected neural network with a single input layer with 5 units, a single hidden layer with 4 units, and a single output layer with 3 units? For example, if I understand this correctly, https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/17584/why-does-the-bias-need-to-be-a-vector-in-a-neural-network , the answer of the first should be 5 and for the second 4 + 3. Each neuron except for in the input-layer has a bias. However, at https://ayearofai.com/rohan-5-what-are-bias-units-828d942b4f52 , it is explained such that each layer including the input-layer has one bias. So the answer to the example above is one in the first and two in the second. What is correct? What am I misunderstanding here?
