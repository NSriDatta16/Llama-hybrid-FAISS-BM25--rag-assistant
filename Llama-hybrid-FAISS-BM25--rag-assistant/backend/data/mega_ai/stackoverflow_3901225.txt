Evaluating a units of measure expression using quotations and the F# Powerpack CodeDOM

Does anyone know if it's possible to send an f# quotation expression that includes a (unit of measure) to the F# CodeDOM (provided in the codeplex powerpack) to be compiled on the fly? The scenario that I'm trying to achieve is to have a runtime component that allows me to type a simple expression into some textbox that would then be sent off to the CodeDOM to be compiled or maybe straight to Fsc.exe. Overall I'd like to leverage the F# compiler at runtime to compile a snippet of code (like I can in C# with the C# CodeDOM provider) in order to leverage the units of measure feature. Is this sort of thing possible?
