What you've done is right and sort of duplicates the Model.get_or_insert , like Robert already explained. I don't know if this can be called a 'lock'... the way this works is optimistic concurrency - the operation will execute assuming that no one else is trying to do the same thing at the same time, and if someone is, it will give you an exception. You'll need to figure out what you want to do in that case. Maybe ask the user to choose a new name?
