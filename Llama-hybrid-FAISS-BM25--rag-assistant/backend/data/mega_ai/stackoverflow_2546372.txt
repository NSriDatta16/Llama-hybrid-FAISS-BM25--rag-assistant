jquery loop to create elements

I have had no luck with this task so far so grateful for any help. I have an html form, in which there is a small select menu (1-10) ie 1 2 ... 10 depending on what value is selected i would like jquery to create (or remove) that number of input text boxes (with different names and id's). eg if 2 was selected these inputs would be created: i look forward to your no doubt simple and elegant solutions! andy
