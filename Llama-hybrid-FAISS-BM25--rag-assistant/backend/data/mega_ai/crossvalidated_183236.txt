What is the relation between k-means clustering and PCA?

It is a common practice to apply PCA (principal component analysis) before a clustering algorithm (such as k-means). It is believed that it improves the clustering results in practice (noise reduction). However I am interested in a comparative and in-depth study of the relationship between PCA and k-means. For example, Chris Ding and Xiaofeng He, 2004, K-means Clustering via Principal Component Analysis showed that "principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster membership indicators for K-means clustering". However, I have hard time understanding this paper, and Wikipedia actually claims that it is wrong . Also, the results of the two methods are somewhat different in the sense that PCA helps to reduce the number of "features" while preserving the variance, whereas clustering reduces the number of "data-points" by summarizing several points by their expectations/means (in the case of k-means). So if the dataset consists in $N$ points with $T$ features each, PCA aims at compressing the $T$ features whereas clustering aims at compressing the $N$ data-points. I am looking for a layman explanation of the relations between these two techniques + some more technical papers relating the two techniques.
