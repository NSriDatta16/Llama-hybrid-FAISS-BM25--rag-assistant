Thinking of it as zero or non-zero is wrong. The idea that it is zero is important in null hypothesis methods, but problematic in Bayesian methods. This is because $\Pr(\beta_3=k)=0$. In this case $k=0$, but it doesn't matter what $k$ is. The measure of a single point in a continuum is zero so its probability is zero. Intuitively, think of it as $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}=0$. You have an infinite number of points and you want to put a hypothesis that it is EXACTLY one point. You cannot do that in any reasonable way. In the subjective Bayesian interpretation $\beta_3$ is never a fixed point anyway so speaking of it as equal to something means nothing. Rather, nature draws it from a distribution. Whether or not $\beta_3$ is "significant" isn't found by seeing if it is equal to zero, but rather by determining if models without it have higher posterior probabilities than models with it. Consider the model $$y=\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\beta_3x_3+\alpha.$$ There are multiple possible hypotheses. It could be that $$y=\alpha,\text{ or}$$ $$y=\beta_1x_1+\alpha,\text{ or}$$ $$y=\beta_2x_2+\alpha,\text{ or}$$ $$y=\beta_3x_3+\alpha,\text{ or}$$ $$y=\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\alpha,\text{ or}$$ $$y=\beta_1x_1+\beta_3x_3+\alpha,\text{ or}$$ $$y=\beta_2x_2+\beta_3x_3+\alpha,\text{ or}$$ $$y=\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\beta_3x_3+\alpha.$$ You would calculate the posterior probability that each of these models are the true model. Then you could choose Bayesian model selection, Bayesian model averaging or you could sum the posterior probabilities that include $\beta_3$ versus models without it. As mentioned above, there is a different practical question of scientific usefulness, which is what ROPE gets at. There is a nice video on this I came across at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6AjduOEN2k&feature=youtu.be
