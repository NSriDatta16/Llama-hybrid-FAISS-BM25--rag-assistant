After a great deal of experimenting and googling (to no avail), I've decided for a quasi-dashboard application (which this is), that having the aggregate column at left and row at top makes the most sense for my users. It's taking me-and my pivot table experience-a while to get used to it, but left-right, top-bottom organization seems to make the most sense for my other users. Still open to anyone elses comments.
