The question lacks a clear description of the problem. It seems that distance is the dependent variable and it is transformed into binary. Logistic regression with satisfaction (a categorical variable) as the independent variable is run here. Anyway, the way to interpret the results obtained from a logistic regression model by R is well described in this ucla page . Interpretations are available for both categorical and continuous covariates.
