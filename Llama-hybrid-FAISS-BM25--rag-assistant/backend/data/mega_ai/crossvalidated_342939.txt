Based on a similar problem in retail demand forecasting (my own domain) of how to forecast demand for new products or new stores that don't have any history to build a forecast from, I would use the following approach. Assume some measure of similarity of countries (do countries in the same region have similar models?) or see if there are any other groupings of the countries (based on demographics, economics indexes, etc...), calculate an "average model" for each group, and then see in which group does your new country fall. Create a bayesian model and use the average model of the group that the country belongs to as a bayesian prior, update your model as data from the new country comes in.
