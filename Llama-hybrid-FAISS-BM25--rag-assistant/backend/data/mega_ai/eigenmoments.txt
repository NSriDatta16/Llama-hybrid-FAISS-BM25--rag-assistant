EigenMoments is a set of orthogonal, noise robust, invariant to rotation, scaling and translation and distribution sensitive moments. Their application can be found in signal processing and computer vision as descriptors of the signal or image. The descriptors can later be used for classification purposes. It is obtained by performing orthogonalization, via eigen analysis on geometric moments. Framework summary EigenMoments are computed by performing eigen analysis on the moment space of an image by maximizing signal-to-noise ratio in the feature space in form of Rayleigh quotient. This approach has several benefits in Image processing applications: Dependency of moments in the moment space on the distribution of the images being transformed, ensures decorrelation of the final feature space after eigen analysis on the moment space. The ability of EigenMoments to take into account distribution of the image makes it more versatile and adaptable for different genres. Generated moment kernels are orthogonal and therefore analysis on the moment space becomes easier. Transformation with orthogonal moment kernels into moment space is analogous to projection of the image onto a number of orthogonal axes. Nosiy components can be removed. This makes EigenMoments robust for classification applications. Optimal information compaction can be obtained and therefore a few number of moments are needed to characterize the images. Problem formulation Assume that a signal vector s ∈ R n {\displaystyle s\in {\mathcal {R}}^{n}} is taken from a certain distribution having correlation C ∈ R n × n {\displaystyle C\in {\mathcal {R}}^{n\times n}} , i.e. C = E [ s s T ] {\displaystyle C=E[ss^{T}]} where E[.] denotes expected value. Dimension of signal space, n, is often too large to be useful for practical application such as pattern classification, we need to transform the signal space into a space with lower dimensionality. This is performed by a two-step linear transformation: q = W T X T s , {\displaystyle q=W^{T}X^{T}s,} where q = [ q 1 , . . . , q n ] T ∈ R k {\displaystyle q=[q_{1},...,q_{n}]^{T}\in {\mathcal {R}}^{k}} is the transformed signal, X = [ x 1 , . . . , x n ] T ∈ R n × m {\displaystyle X=[x_{1},...,x_{n}]^{T}\in {\mathcal {R}}^{n\times m}} a fixed transformation matrix which transforms the signal into the moment space, and W = [ w 1 , . . . , w n ] T ∈ R m × k {\displaystyle W=[w_{1},...,w_{n}]^{T}\in {\mathcal {R}}^{m\times k}} the transformation matrix which we are going to determine by maximizing the SNR of the feature space resided by q {\displaystyle q} . For the case of Geometric Moments, X would be the monomials. If m = k = n {\displaystyle m=k=n} , a full rank transformation would result, however usually we have m ≤ n {\displaystyle m\leq n} and k ≤ m {\displaystyle k\leq m} . This is specially the case when n {\displaystyle n} is of high dimensions. Finding W {\displaystyle W} that maximizes the SNR of the feature space: S N R t r a n s f o r m = w T X T C X w w T X T N X w , {\displaystyle SNR_{transform}={\frac {w^{T}X^{T}CXw}{w^{T}X^{T}NXw}},} where N is the correlation matrix of the noise signal. The problem can thus be formulated as w 1 , . . . , w k = a r g m a x w w T X T C X w w T X T N X w {\displaystyle {w_{1},...,w_{k}}=argmax_{w}{\frac {w^{T}X^{T}CXw}{w^{T}X^{T}NXw}}} subject to constraints: w i T X T N X w j = δ i j , {\displaystyle w_{i}^{T}X^{T}NXw_{j}=\delta _{ij},} where δ i j {\displaystyle \delta _{ij}} is the Kronecker delta. It can be observed that this maximization is Rayleigh quotient by letting A = X T C X {\displaystyle A=X^{T}CX} and B = X T N X {\displaystyle B=X^{T}NX} and therefore can be written as: w 1 , . . . , w k = a r g m a x x w T A w w T B w {\displaystyle {w_{1},...,w_{k}}={\underset {x}{\operatorname {arg\,max} }}{\frac {w^{T}Aw}{w^{T}Bw}}} , w i T B w j = δ i j {\displaystyle w_{i}^{T}Bw_{j}=\delta _{ij}} Rayleigh quotient Optimization of Rayleigh quotient has the form: max w R ( w ) =
