Measuring the effect of adding a feature descriptor?

I have a class A that is often classified as class B. I use Local Binary Patterns in conjunction with a SVM. If I concatenate a color histogram to a standard Local Binary Pattern, it increases it's performance and I don't see class A being miss classified as class B that frequently anymore. How can I see the effect of this color histogram? For example, can I measure the average distance between Class A and Class B? I expect it to increase. Would this be a valid argument in a paper to show that the effect of adding a color histogram is that it adds unique information that enables a classifier to distinguish between the two? In some sense, my question is, what is the measure of distinguishability between two classes?
