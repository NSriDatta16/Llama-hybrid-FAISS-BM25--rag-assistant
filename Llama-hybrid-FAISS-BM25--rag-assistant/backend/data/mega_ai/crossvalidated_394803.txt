Fitting a linear regression model on your training data will give a collection of values for each of the coefficients $\beta$ (notice that if your categorical variable has $N$ levels you only need $N-1$ predictors, the resulting coefficients representing the shifts with respect to the level you choose as base). Once you have trained your model you are ready to make predictions by plugging in the set of unseen features. In your example: $\beta_0$ is constant $\beta_1$ must be multiplied by the average area from within your training data $\beta_j$ = 1 only for the location of your choice
