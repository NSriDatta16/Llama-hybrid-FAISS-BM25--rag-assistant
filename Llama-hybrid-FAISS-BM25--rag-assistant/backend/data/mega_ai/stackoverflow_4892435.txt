jQuery UI: Only allow sortable within its own parent level, and not above or below

Basically using a list structure, I'm trying to make each li sortable within it's own level, but not within other levels. So if I'm dragging down Number 1 it won't mix with any of the sub ul's or li's but will only go below Number 2 . This is what I have so far, and while it does prevent li's from going ABOVE it's level, it doesn't prevent li's from mixing BELOW it's level. For example right now I can move Number 1 between Number 2.1 and Number 2.2 $(".sortable2, .sortable2 ul").sortable({ opacity: 0.5, stop:function(i){ $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: "?", data: $(this).sortable("serialize") }); } }); $(".sortable2").selectable(); $(".sortable2").disableSelection(); $('.sortable2').bind('mousedown', function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); }); Here is the ul li structure: Number 1 Number 1.1 Number 1.2 Number 2 Number 2.1 Number 2.2 Number 2.2.1 Number 2.2.2
