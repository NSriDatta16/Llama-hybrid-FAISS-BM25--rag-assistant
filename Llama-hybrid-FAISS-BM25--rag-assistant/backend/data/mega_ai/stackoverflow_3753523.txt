It depends on the circumstances/assumptions about the program in general: it's possible, given the right set of circumstances. For example: You are running this function from multiple threads, and inside the openCV library the FileStorage object interacts (shares variables, etc.) with the CascadeClassifier object. The code path in one thread causes the other thread to error on the ::load method. The times which I have seen things like this are (in order of likelihood): - The compiler didn't rebuild with changes properly - You didn't run the code you expected - The addition of lines caused some problems with multi-threaded synchronization (either in your code, or inside the library) - The addition code caused timings to change, which caused errors Hope that helps.
