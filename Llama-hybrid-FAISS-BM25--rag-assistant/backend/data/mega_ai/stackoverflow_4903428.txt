Yes, all storage calls are normalized to the REST API. Its actually very efficient when you consider the problem. You are thinking of a machine in Azure and data in azure as stored on two servers sitting in a rack. Remember in Azure, your data, your "servers", etc may be stored in different racks, different zones, and even different datacenters. With the REST API, your apps don't have to care about any of this. They just get the data with the URL. So while a tiny HTTP overhead may appear inefficient if these were two boxes next to each other, its actually a very elegant solution when they are on different continents. Factor in concepts such as CDN, and it becomes an even better fit. Layered onto this base concept is the Azure load balancer and other pieces of the internal infrastructure which can further optimize every request because they are all the same (HTTP). I also wouldn't be surprised (not sure at all, I dont work for MSFT) if the LB was doing traffic management optimizations when a request is made intra-datacenter.
