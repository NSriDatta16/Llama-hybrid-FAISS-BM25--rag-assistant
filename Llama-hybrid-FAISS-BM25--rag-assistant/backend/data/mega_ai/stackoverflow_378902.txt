I give a look to JavaFrame and it seems a good starting point. Just install Apache Ant, do ant in the javaframe directory and launch the test suite (inside test directory) with: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../build/native/ java -agentlib:frameintrospect -classpath ../build/classes/:. org.thobe.frame.Test It does not get any local variable but it tries. So, as I said, it can be an starting point. I hope to get further about its usage, but no time and no documentation (there are lots of projects named JavaFrame) are bad circumstances. Maybe some day it can be done again. Yes, again. There was Cajoon, it looked promising and shiny but its website is down and there is no trace of any downloadable jar to try. Thanks to everybody! PD.: Just for reference, some links I found while researching: How VM Agents Work JVM options
