It depends on the algorithm, the implementation, the C++ compiler and the JIT compiler. I guess in most cases the C++ implementation will be faster. But this may change. The JIT compiler can optimize your code for the platform your code is running on instead of an average for all the platforms your code might run on as the C++ compiler does. This is something newer versions of the JIT compiler are increasingly good at and may in some cases give JITted code an advantage. So the answer is not as clear as you might expect. The new Java hotspot compiler does this very well for example. Other situations where managed code may do better than C++ is where you need to allocate and deallocate lots of small objects. The .net runtime preallocates large chunks of memory that can be reused so it doesn't need to call into the os every time you need to allocate memory. I'm not sure unsafe C# runs much faster than normal C#. You'll have to try this too. If you want to know what's the best solution for your situation you'll have to try both and measure the difference. I dont think there will be more than
