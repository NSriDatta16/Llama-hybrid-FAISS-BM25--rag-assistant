The basic answer is no. The much more complicated answer is not even close . :) You can get a rough sizing guess for database space by figuring out what cantent you want in your database, and multiplying that by the target number of users. For instance, if you want users to be able to post an average webpage (say 4k), plus their user-profile, etc (perhaps another 1-2k) that would be 6K per user (in this very contrived example). if the users could upload additional content (forum posts, blog entries, friends lists, etc) this would be on top of it. This doesnt include things like your own maintenance tables, other database storage requirements, etc. This of course assumes that you aren't putting pictures, video, etc in the db which would bloat it even quicker.
