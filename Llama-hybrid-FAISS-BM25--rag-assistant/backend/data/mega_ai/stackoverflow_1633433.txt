AFAIK there is an abundance of Content Management solutions that would include various flavours of this functionality, but you're looking for it in isolation. My suspicion is that you're going to have to write it yourself. Just to clarify: when the user logs in to your application, you want it to draw specific style elements based on preferences set for their account (or for general preferences set against their organisation)? It sounds like you want to store all this information in a database and have styles inserted into the HTML on page render. If you want something that would actually create a stylesheet and write it to the filesystem, as I said before, it's likely that you'll have to build the functionality to your specific needs.
