WPF application which outputs html

I'm creating a WPF (in c#) application that will create html files based on it's output. Is there a way to use the concept of an html 'view' (from the asp.net mvc) in a desktop application without reinventing the wheel? Basically I just want to save a list of outputted items in html which is so simple in a web application (and even using binding in a wpf desktop application to show the output in window) but seems clunky for HTML output in a desktop application I feel like I'd be reinventing the wheel to include flexible html templates with my program for data output. Surely there is a quick and elegant way to do this? As an example say the output of the program were a list of names (Bill, Bob, Jill, Frank), I'd like to save the following HTML file to the disk: Bill Bob Jill Frank if the user defined a an html template such as: which could be done in ASP.NET MVC (or in a very similar way in PHP, ruby, etc) if the user defined something similar to the following: and I'd like to know if there is an easy way to create html files using that method in a desktop application?
