OpenIdSelector is defined as an extension method and you don't have to pass in the first parameter. Instead you call it like this: @Html.OpenIdSelector(new SelectorButton[] {...}) This is equivalent to the following call: @OpenIdHelper.OpenIdSelector(this.Html, new SelectorButton[] {...}) For the second Edit to your question, looks like this might help: InvalidOperationException thrown regarding DotNetOpenAuth.IEmbeddedResourceRetrieval with Razor view
