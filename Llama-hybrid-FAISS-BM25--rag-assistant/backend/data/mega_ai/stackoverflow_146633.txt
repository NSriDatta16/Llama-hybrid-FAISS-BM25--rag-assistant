.webloc files (more generically, Internet location files) are written in a format whose definition goes back to Mac OS 8.x. It is resource-based, derived from the clipping format you get when you create a file from dragged objects such as text or images. The resources written are 'url ' 256 and 'TEXT' 256, which store the URL, and optionally 'urln' 256, containing the text associated with the URL. 'drag' 128 points to the other two (or three) resources. NTWeblocFile, part of the Cocoatech Open Source framework CocoaTechFoundation (BSD licensed), supports writing these files from Objective-C. If you want to specify a title separately to the URL, you'll need to modify the class so it writes something other than the URL into the 'urln' resource. In Mac OS X 10.3 and later, the URL is also written (may also be written) into a property list in the file's data fork. See the other answer for how this works...
