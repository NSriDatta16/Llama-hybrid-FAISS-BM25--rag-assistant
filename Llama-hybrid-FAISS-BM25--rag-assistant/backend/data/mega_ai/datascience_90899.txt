Create a single time series plot of multiple devices

I have a dataset where there are stored the measurements of 30 devices. Each device has about 4000 values and it is structured as well: device01 0.02;0.13;1.15;0.10;8.30;........;4.20 device02 0.06;0.13;1.40;0.03;7.40;........;6.30 ........ device30 0.03;0.24;1.10;0.43;4.40;........;2.30 Each value is got each X seconds (I don't have the timestamp reference, I only know they are got through time). How can I plot them to get a single time series plot like the one in this picture? As you can see lots of the values do overlap, how can I make them consecutive in the plot?
