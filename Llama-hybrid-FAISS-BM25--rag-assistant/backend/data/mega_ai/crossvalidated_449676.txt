"Variance is independent of class" assumption

Reading from Logistic Regression slides by Erdem , before deriving the linear boundary equation from the GNB equation it says "What if we assume variance is independent of class i.e. $\sigma^2_{i,0}=\sigma^2_{i,1}$ and then put $\prod\limits_{i=1}^{d}P(X_i|Y=0)P(Y=0)=\prod\limits_{i=1}^{d}P(X_i|Y=1)P(Y=1)$ what is that mean and what "variance is independent of class" assumption implies?
