Can you run an SSIS task from .net?

I have scheduled sql agent task which runs an SSIS package. I want to be able to run the SSIS package from .net. Is there a way to either run the SSIS package directly or at least run the SQL agent task which would in turn run the SSIS package. If it helps it is for a .net 3.5 web app written in C# Thanks!
