Logistic Regression: Median Imputing vs Mean Imputing

Missing values need to be imputed when performing logistic regression. Missing values are often imputed by the median. The mean is the BLUE (best linear unbiased estimator). But Median is robust to outliers and is not impacted by winsorization. What are good statistical arguments to stick to median imputing over mean imputing apart from the procedural argumentation based on outliers and winsorization? My feeling is that the median is a more robust estimator given a Non-Gaussian distribution and almost identical if Gaussian, but I don't know how to show this and if true. And feel free also to convince me that mean is actually the better choice better. Some thoughts so far: Mean and median are both unbiased As the sample size increases they will both approach the true mean of the distribution. If the distribution is gaussian, it is expected that mean, median and mode will be the same in expectation. If the distribution is lognormal, the median will be where the underlying normal distribution has its mean. Maybe this can be connected to logistic regression. Median has a higher Breakdown Point than Mean. Breakdown Point measures how many observations would be needed to be transformed to outliers until the computed metric itself falls outside of the normal range. Loosely speaking MSE is connected to mean and MAE is connected to Median. So maybe it is a question of what kind of error I am willing to except in particular what is my cost function.
