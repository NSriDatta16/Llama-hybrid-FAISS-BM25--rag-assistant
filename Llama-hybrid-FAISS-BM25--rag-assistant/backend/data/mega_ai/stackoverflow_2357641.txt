WPF or WinForms for occasional programmers?

I'd like to move my project's ActiveX controls to (preferably) WPF or WinForms. My customers aren't expert .NET programmers, but they're able to use WinForms to do basic drag-drop to use my controls. I've experimented with the VS 2010 WPF designer, and it seems like the drag-drop experience is much less intuitive than WinForms. Is it realistic to expect occasional programmers to be able to use the WPF designers in Visual Studio (or Expression Blend) to build these kinds of simple GUI's? Also, what's the simplest available WPF designer?
