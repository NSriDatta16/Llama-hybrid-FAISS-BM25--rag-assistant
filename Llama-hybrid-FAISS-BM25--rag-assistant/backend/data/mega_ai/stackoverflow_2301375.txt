Please see: Version, Auto-Increment and Escrow Columns Auto increment columns are automatically incremented by ESE when a new record is inserted into the table. The value contained in the auto-increment column is unique for every record in the table and is not guaranteed to be continuous. These values are not recycled, but can be reused in certain cases. Only columns of type JET_coltypLong (Long) and JET_coltypLongLong (Currency) may be auto increment columns. Wiki: Extensible Storage Engine
