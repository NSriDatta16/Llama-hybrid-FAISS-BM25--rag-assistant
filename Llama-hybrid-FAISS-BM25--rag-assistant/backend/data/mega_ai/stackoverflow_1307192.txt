Scriptaculous Sortable.create - Can't hook the dragged element

When using Sortable.create I can't seem to get the element that is being dragged. Does Sciptaculous not fully implement all Draggable and Droppable features when you use sortable? Given: Sortable.create("sortArea", {scroll:window, onChange:orderLi}); function orderLi(){ console.log(this.draggables.each(function(e){if(e.dragging==true){return e};})); } My console always shows all the array of draggables. How do I only grab the one that is being dragged?
