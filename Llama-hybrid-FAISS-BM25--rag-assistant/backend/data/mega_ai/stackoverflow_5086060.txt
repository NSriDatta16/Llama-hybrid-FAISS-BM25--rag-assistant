mod_rewrite does not rewrite

I have the following code: RewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^user/([a-z]+)$ index.php?Agent=$1 [QSA] theoretically any visitor to my site using the format: www.site.com/user/username should be directed to: www.site.com/index.php?Agent=username they are instead being treated as if /user is a real directory and as if /user/username is a valid file and exists (which it does not). Any ideas? EDIT #1 I have modified my htaccess slightly and even stripped off the /user requirement, the following .htaccess file causes and 500 error, even when visiting the primary domain alone (www.site.com): ErrorDocument 404 /404.php RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.php -f RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.php RewriteRule ^(.+)$ index.php?Agent=$1 [QSA]
