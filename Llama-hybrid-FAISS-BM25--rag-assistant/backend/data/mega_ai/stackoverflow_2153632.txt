You might want to try using getaddrinfo() instead . The docs for gethostbyname point out that its usage is discouraged and that it's deprecated now (so there may well be bugs in it). I haven't had any experience with the problem that you're having but I know that the code that I have that uses getaddrinfo() works fine across XP through Windows 7 on x86 and x64.
