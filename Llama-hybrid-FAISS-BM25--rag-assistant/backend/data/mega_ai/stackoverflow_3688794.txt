First, a note: This isn't really a good practice. If possible, you should strive to design your website in a browser-agnostic way, so that it works consistently across all browsers without the need to maintain hacks and tricks for browser-specific problems. But if you really want to do this, it's easiest to include a file only if the browser is IE: (Includes the file only if the browser is IE6 or less.) However, if you really want to do it the other way around, here are some of your options: Use server-side browser sniffing to process the browser before the page is drawn. That is, use a server-side language (Java, PHP, whatever) to determine what the browser is (usually through the user agent string) and then conditionally include your JS files that way. (For example, you can use PHP's get_browser function.) Use client-side browser sniffing to call another JS file if the browser is not IE. You can determine the browser using JavaScript itself, and then insert another JS file into the page if the browser is anything but IE. (For example, you can use jQuery's browser function.) T.J.'s answer provides a way of doing it with I.E.'s conditional comments as well.
