How to make time series data with changing variance stationary?

I have time series data that reflects users activity on some platform, and it has clear daily seasonal pattern. I understand that in order to fit a model such as ARMA to this data I should first detrend it and remove its seasonal component, which is commonly performed using differencing. This should leave me with a time series which is stationary and I can then use models like ARMA. Yet there is an issue I don't understand - as my data describes users activity, while the mean has a clear periodical pattern, the variance is much higher in daytime comparing to late night hours. This means that after differencing the series would still remain non-stationary. Should the differencing eliminate the changing variance? I don't see why. If not, are there other methods to deal with data with such behavior?
