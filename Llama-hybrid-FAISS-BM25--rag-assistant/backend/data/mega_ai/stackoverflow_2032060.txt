Magento - Custom Products Ordered Report - How to Extend using "local" code pool?

I am trying to customize the Products Ordered report so that it only shows a summary of the products that have an SKU starting with XX. I have been following the tutorial at http://magentocoder.jigneshpatel.co.in/reports/create-custom-reports-in-magento-admin/ to extend the module, but this tutorial shows how to extend the report by adding code to the "core" code pool, which will cause problems further down the road. I have been unable to get the modifications to work using the "local" code pool, because of the confusing nature of the Magento configuration files... Has anyone successfully extended this (or a similar) report by making the modifications in the "local" code pool? There doesn't seem to be much in terms of documentation or tutorials surrounding this topic, which I find surprising. Any help is greatly appreciated.
