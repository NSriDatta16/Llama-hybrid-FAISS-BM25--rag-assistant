Performing PCA before Kmeans clustering is an acceptable practice. The number of features for your number of samples is quite high and I guess many of them are correlated. I would give PCA a try. Just change your number of PCA components and see how much of the variance is explained (maybe try n_components = [100,1000,10000]). Once you are happy with the number of components, experiment with the number of kmeans clusters and draw the entropy plot and find the elbow point. Kmeans and PCA are both unsupervised and need manual experimentation.
