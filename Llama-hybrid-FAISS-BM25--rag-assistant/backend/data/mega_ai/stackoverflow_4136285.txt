Recommend guidance for web design patterns?

I've been coding a website for the past 6 months using HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL/Javascript. I'm coding all independently and finding it hard to interact with all of these technologies. For instance, I have been writing PHP code to echo HTML output. I find this very messy and hard to maintain. Also, I'm finding myself doing redundant database calls because I don't have an easy way to call once and distribute the information to multiple other technologies (e.g. Javascript and PHP). These are just a few things that have caused me trouble. From a very high-level, are there some approaches or design patterns that are used to make this process easier and more elegant? Any books or frameworks that someone could recommend? I assume this can be done in a cleaner way. Thanks!
