Basically you need to allow the user to drag labels (objects, controls etc.) around a "form". dragging picturebox inside winform on runtime Then you need to be able to snap to a grid while dragging (coppercoder's solution): Snap to grid mouse locking up Defining an abstract "object" that encapsulates the "labels" you want your user to "drag around the form" (or panel, or whatever control you use to simulate your paper). I guess I've done this enough to find it fairly trivial, although if it's your first time implementing something like this it can be a daunting task. Get small portions of functionality working and you'll make it through. Of course you always have stackoverflow for questions.
