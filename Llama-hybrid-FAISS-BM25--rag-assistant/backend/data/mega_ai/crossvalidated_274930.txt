Just as two hints: Empirically evaluate different weight penalties using cross-validation. That is, divide your data into the training and validation sets and try different weight penalties to train the model on the training set and choose those values that have the best performance on the validation set. Use the method proposed by David MacKay to empirically obtain the values for weight penalties without cross-validation. Take a look at this coursera course for more detail: Geoffrey Hinton. "Lecture 9.6- MacKays Quick and Dirty Method of Setting Weight Costs." COURSERA: Neural networks for machine learning (2012).
