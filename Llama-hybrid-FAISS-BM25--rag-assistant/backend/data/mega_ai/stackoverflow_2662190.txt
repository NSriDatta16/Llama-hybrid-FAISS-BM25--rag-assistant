I found some very good answers here http://validator.w3.org/docs/why.html http://ianpouncey.com/weblog/2010/01/web-accessibility-myths/ Using markup improperly -- not according to specification -- hinders accessibility. Misusing markup for a presentation effect (e.g., using a table for layout or a header to change the font size) makes it difficult for users with specialized software to understand the organization of the page or to navigate through it. Furthermore, using presentation markup rather than structural markup to convey structure (e.g., constructing what looks like a table of data with an HTML PRE element) makes it difficult to render a page intelligibly to other devices (refer to the description of difference between content, structure, and presentation). http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-structure-presentation
