Are linear classifiers (SVM, Logistic Regression) deterministic?

I am just starting to learn about classification and have been playing around with some linear classifiers. I was wondering if linear classifiers are deterministic--given the same model parameters and training/testing data, should n runs of a classifier yield the same results on testing data? Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!
