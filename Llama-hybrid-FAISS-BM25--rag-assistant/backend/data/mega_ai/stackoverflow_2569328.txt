You're probably right about the JADE API, but of course you can always use standard Java to find the local IP address - try InetAddress.getLocalHost() . An Agent pushed from the Main Container when each container connects could use this to report the IP address of each container, and an Agent in the Main Container could subscribe to these messages and display them on the website. IIRC you can subscribe to the AMS and receive notification when new containers come online.
