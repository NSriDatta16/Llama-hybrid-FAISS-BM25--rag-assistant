You're probably going to need to pass the raw arrays unless you really want to jump through some hoops with the interop as the rules specify the types have to either be marhallable by the framework, or you've given the framework a specific structure it can marshall. This probably is not possible for vector. So, you can define you C++ struct as #pragma pack(push, 8) struct ReflSettings { double* Q; double* DisplayQ; } #pragma pack(pop) then you C# struct would be [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, CharSet = CharSet.Unicode, Pack = 8)] public class ModelSettings:IDisposable { [XmlIgnore] internal IntPtr Q; [XmlIgnore] internal IntPtr DisplayQ; } Hope this helps.
