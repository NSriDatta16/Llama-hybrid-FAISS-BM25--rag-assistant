What I do for IRC message splitting is (in simple terms as I don't remember the exact code in C#), is: Remove the first : Split on :, this gives you two elements, the last "message" parameter, and everything else Split the "everything else" on space, which will give you all the other parameters. Then you can use a simple method to parse the nick string into its different parts (two more splits should do it) This method, to me, is more apt than creating a regex for it, though I am unsure about the performance difference (I'd be willing to bet it doesn't really matter either way if you're just writing a client) Alternatively you could do this: Split the string on space Walk through the resulting array, and check if the element starts with :, if it does, join that and the following elements with a space to get the full string. I'm not sure which is "faster", though, but I believe the second is less elegant. These should work no matter the command you're getting in (and as such can be used for generic parsing), and you have to pay attention to the fact that not all commands will have an element that starts with :. For instance, the NICK command allows only a single word, and such does not usually come escaped with :, other commands have multiple single words before the : (the USER command has two)
