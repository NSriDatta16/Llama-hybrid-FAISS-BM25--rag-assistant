What's an example or form of non-stationarity that would exhibit long runs?

In my Forecasting class I just learned about the Runs test, which looks at the frequency of runs of a binary data set. The null hypothesis in this case is that the series is random, and if there was a trend in the sequence the series would have a pattern if it was above or below its mean. For example, we could take the continuous time series to a binary one and then used runs.test() from the tseries library like so : > library(tseries) > x y runs.test(y) Runs Test data: y Standard Normal = 0.2439, p-value = 0.8073 alternative hypothesis: two.sided I was curious as to whether there are any concrete forms or examples of non-stationarity that would exhibit long runs under this test, as I'm trying to understand the real value of it or where it may come in particularly useful.
