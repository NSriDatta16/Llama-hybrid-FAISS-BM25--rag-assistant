I'd recommend Front End Drupal: Designing, Theming, Scripting over the Drupal 6 Themes book. I put together a Drupal 6 Theming Cheat Sheet that includes links to the resources I've found most helpful. Honestly, though there are good links and books to learn from, the way I've learned quickest was to start creating a theme. Create your theme.info file, then begin converting an index.html to page.tpl.php or page-front.tpl.php using the snippets in the cheat sheet or the nerliness.com link mentioned in Robert Harvey's answer. Those two files constitute a bare-bones theme. From there, you can override additional template files as needed. You can use the Theme developer to find just what templates to override , to customize a particular part of the site. Remember to clear the theme cache , as you add new template files. Also, make sure your theme has the base template of any file you want to override. See the " Note: There is a bug which prevents derivative template files from being detected ..." section of the Core templates and suggestions page, for more details.
