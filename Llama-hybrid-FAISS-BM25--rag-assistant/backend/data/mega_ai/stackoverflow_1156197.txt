How often should you compact an SQL CE database?

Is there even a need to periodically compact SQL CE databases? Will auto shrink suffice? Our average database size is about 100Mb, with large users hitting 400-500Mb (but those are very rare). If we do have to compact manually, how do we tell when we should? Is there a way to tell the fragmentation level or percent of wasted space programmatically? If not, what other threshold can we use? The previous version of the product was built on an ( gasp ) MS Access database, so we had to periodically compact just to keep it working.
