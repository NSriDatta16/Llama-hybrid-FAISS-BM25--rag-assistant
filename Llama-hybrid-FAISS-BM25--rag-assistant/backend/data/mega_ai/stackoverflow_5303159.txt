In XSLT 1.0, the only way to create a variable containing a set of nodes from the source document is by evaluating an XPath expression in the select attribute: You can't use copy-of , apply-templates , or call-template ; those will all produce a result tree fragment. Every XSLT processor I'm aware of implements an extension function that converts result tree fragments into node sets, so unless you need your transform to be utterly cross-platform, you can do something like this (this example uses Microsoft's XSLT processor): But you don't need to do even this: as Alejandro has pointed out, you can get the result you're looking for just by writing a single XPath expression. There are applications where node selection is so complicated that you have to use a node-set() function, but yours isn't one of them.
