You mean you want to match that whole construct with one regex? That's a bad idea. Regexes can be useful as a component of a parser, but it's best to keep their role to a minimum. Don't try to match large chunks of text, especially recursive or looping structures. C# regexes are powerful enough to handle such things in many cases, but not all--and that's way beyond beginner level anyway. I suggest you try it without using regexes at all. Otherwise you'll constantly be distracting yourself, wondering how the regex technique you haven't learned yet would make the current task easier, or solve the problem more elegantly (if you'll pardon my language). Concentrate on writing solid, readable, maintainable code--that being another weakness of regexes.
