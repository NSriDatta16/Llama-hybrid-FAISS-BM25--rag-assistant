Forcing single-argument constructors to be explicit in C++?

By default, in C++, a single-argument constructor can be used as an implicit conversion operator. This can be suppressed by marking the constructor as explicit. I'd prefer to make "explicit" be the default, so that the compiler cannot silently use these constructors for conversion. Is there a way to do this in standard C++? Failing that, is there a pragma (or similar) that'll work in Microsoft C++ to do this? What about g++ (we don't use it, but it might be useful information)?
