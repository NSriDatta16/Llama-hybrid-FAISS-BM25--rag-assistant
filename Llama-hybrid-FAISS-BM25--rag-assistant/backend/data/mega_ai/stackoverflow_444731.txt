Install of Tomcat 5.5 on Ubuntu (using apt) leaves CATALINA_HOME unset

I'm setting up my development environment for writing web applications using Java, and I'm in need of some help. What I have done: Installation of Java SE 6 from Sun I installed (sudo apt-get install …) the following packages (one at a time as some of them requires user interaction) to get Java SE 6 from Sun: sun-java6-bin sun-java6-doc sun-java6-fonts sun-java6-javadb sun-java6-jdk sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-source . I also set JAVA_HOME by adding JAVA_HOME=”/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/” to /etc/environment. Began installing and configuring Tomcat 5.5 I installed (sudo apt-get install …) the following packages: tomcat5.5 tomcat5.5-admin What I have at the moment: I'm able to connect to http://localhost:8180/admin and get the admin web application which I installed by installing the tomcat5.5-admin package. The Tomcat server is running as a deamon. My problems and questions: The environment variable $CATALINA_HOME doesn't seem to be defined. How should I define it? (The same way as my $JAVA_HOME maybe? But if so, which path should I assign it?) To deploy a war, can I just copy the JAR to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps? Or do I need to change the file permissions on the war? (Here I assume $CATALINA_HOME is set correctly.) What's the user and password I need for the admin web application I installed? How do I change them? Are there any best practices for Tomcat 5.5 on Ubuntu which I should think of?
