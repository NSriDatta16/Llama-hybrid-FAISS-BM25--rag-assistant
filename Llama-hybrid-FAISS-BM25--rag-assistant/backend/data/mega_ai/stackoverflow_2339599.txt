The color range for VIBGYOR (or spectral colors) isn't the same as RGB. Check out wikipedia on color: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color Pay special attention to "Spectral colors and color reproduction" An example of the issue is that pink and magenta are nonspectral colors. In addition, the spectral color doesn't take into account intensity while RGB does.
