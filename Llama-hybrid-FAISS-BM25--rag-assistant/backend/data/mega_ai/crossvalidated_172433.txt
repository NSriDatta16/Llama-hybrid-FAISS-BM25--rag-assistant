The average of variances is probably not the best variable to use. Variance is a squared result. In many cases, the standard deviation may be the better result to use, because it is on the same scale as your original data. You can then decide on whether use the arithmetic mean, or e.g. root-mean-square again. Avoid blindly using standard toolbox functions . In your case, I already disagree with your variances. The proper variances are: 6.33, 0.33, 2.33, 1, 26.3, 9. because you must use the unbiased sample variance. Note that these estimates are much higher than yours, because of the small sample size. As you can see, there is a massive outlier here - 26.3 is way outside your range. Averaging such squared values is not sound. Take the standard deviations instead: 2.52, 0.58, 1.53, 1.00, 5.13, 3.00 The 5.13 is still large, but not as extreme anymore. The mean standard deviation of the males is 1.54, of the females it is 3.04; the average standard deviation of both is $2.29 \pm 1.66$. But you need to be aware that at this sample size, even your estimates of the mean are pretty unreliable. You have to make informed decision on a number of steps, including: variance, or standard deviation? or standard error ? more than one variance/standard deviation (biased, unbiased) more than one mean (arithmetic, harmonic, geometric, power ...) Any statistic test such as the t-test will come with some assumption on your input data; and doing the wrong choices will have a considerable impact on your result. Sorry, but I cannot save you from studying these differences yourself. The only choice where I'm fairly confident myself is that you need to use the unbiased variant. For your actual test, you may want to look at the standard error of the mean , too. This may at first appear redundant to the standard deviation, but it is not. It measures how good your estimation of the mean is. It is tighter than the standard deviation; but if you have differences within this standard error, any difference likely is just random.
