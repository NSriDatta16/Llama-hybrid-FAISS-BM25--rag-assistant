Building an image classifier( binary) using Convolution network

I have a dataset of images of birds and want to build a CNN classifier that outputs the probability that the fed image(test) is a bird, So that I can accept the image to be a bird beyond a certain threshold. How should I go about training this ? One possible way could be to have a second class of all the images/{birds} and then train a two class CNN. But this becomes a very computationally expensive task.
