What is the difference between #import and #include in Objective-C?

What are the differences between #import and #include in Objective-C and are there times where you should use one over the other? Is one deprecated? I was reading the following tutorial: http://www.otierney.net/objective-c.html#preamble and its paragraph about #import and #include seems to contradict itself or at least is unclear.
