It doesn't matter. I just inserted a 20 K image in an Excel file, copied it about 100 times using Ctrl-Drag, and it only increased the file size by 2K. Edit Even if you import it (using Insert Picture...) repeatedly, it seems to be able to tell that it's the same photo, and the file size only increases negligibly (less than 1K).
