You cannot do this on the server side. URL fragment identifiers are not sent to the server. You can however trap this value on the client side with JavaScript and send an Ajax request to the server passing the aforementioned value. An impl in jQuery perchance? $(function() { $.post('someRailsEndpoint', {hash: document.location.hash}); }); On the Rails end, you'd use params[:hash] to access this value.
