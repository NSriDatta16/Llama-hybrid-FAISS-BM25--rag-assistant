Sharing what sort of outcome you are most interested will be helpful in directing you towards a proper answer. However, consider this: If you are interested, in exploring the likelihood of will win or lose think classification algorithms: Linear Machine Learning Algorithms - Logistic regression - Linear Discriminant Analysis Non-linear Machine Learning Algorithms K-nearest neighbors Naive Bayes Support Vector Machines If you are interested in exploring the scores of each team in a given game think regression algorithms: Linear regression Logistic regression Stepwise regression Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) Locally estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) In my judgement, giving us more direction on your desired outcome we can give you more direction with a solid answer.
