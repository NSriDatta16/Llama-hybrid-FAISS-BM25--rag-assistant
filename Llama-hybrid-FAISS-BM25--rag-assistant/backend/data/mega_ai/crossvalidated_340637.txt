In a comment, the OP SpineFeast said that this was a survey, with 200 people from each of 4 countries and that the goal is to find out drivers of satisfaction. The first thing I'd be concerned about is the sample. People who respond to satisfaction surveys tend not to be representative of the overall population of users - they tend to be at the extremes of satisfaction rather than in the middle. What efforts were made to get people to respond? What efforts were made to assess how similar they are to the general user population? This problem may not be solvable. I might possibly be concerned with non-independent errors, if the product (whatever it is) is different in different countries, or if people in a particular country would tend to be more similar than people across countries. This would lead me to look at a multilevel model. Then I would think about the ordinal nature of the DV. It's good that the residuals are normal, but linear regression also assumes that the response is continuous. This might be reasonable and it might not. It's hard to say without substantive knowledge of what you are doing the survey about and whether there were anchor points or descriptions of the five levels (e.g. "Very satisfied" and so on). I'd certainly try an ordinal logistic regression, possibly a multilevel version. But I might also try other things. And if important business decisions are going to be made based on this analysis, I might hire a consultant to help.
