How do I fill text-boxes in a gui application through command line?

I'm designing an NLP (Natural Language Processing) application in python and I want to use the following UNL (Universal Networking Language) EnConverter that is an executable gui - 3rd party - application and only works on windows (I don't have its source-code) : So, what I want to know is how can I program a console application that calls this EnConverter and press the "Setting" button then manage to fill the text-boxes in the following image: When I click the " Setting " button, the previous window shows up... I want my application to fill these text-boxes, then press " OK "... When pressing the " OK " button the application returns to the first window... The last thing for the application (my application) to do is clicking the " EnConvert " button in the first window... See the the first image, please. I know this is possible because my professor have done this job in Perl ... And he refused to tell me how!!! I have researched the Internet but I got nothing!
