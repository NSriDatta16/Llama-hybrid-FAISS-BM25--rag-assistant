It can be done, the degree of elegance just varies... I understand this is for transition, so it might not have to be very beautiful. If you have to have Twisted serving the static files, then you either have to hack together in django a proxy-through for those files, or throw something in front of the whole thing. Also Perlbal with VPATH could do this, it'll take regexp's of urls and make them hit the right services. If you don't have to use Twisted, there are lots of different ways to do it. You could still use Perlbal or something similar to serve static files, something you should have anyway in the long run.
