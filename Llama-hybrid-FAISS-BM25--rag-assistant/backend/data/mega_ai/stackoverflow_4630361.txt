For those using Interface Builder to layout your UIToolBar , it is also possible to do this using Interface Builder alone. To add a UILabel to a UIToolBar you need to add a generic UIView object to your UIToolBar in IB by dragging a new UIView object over your UIToolBar . IB will automatically create a UIBarButtonItem that will be initialized with your custom UIView . Next add a UILabel to the UIView and edit the UILabel graphically to match your preferred style. You can then visually set up your fixed and/or variable spacers as desired to position your UILabel appropriately. You must also set the background of both the UILabel and the UIView to clearColor to get the UIToolBar to show through correctly under the UILabel .
