Filter across three tables using Django

I have 3 django models, where the first has a foreign key to the second, and the second has a foreign key to the third. Like this: class Book(models.Model): year_published = models.IntField() author = models.ForeignKey(Author) class Author(models.Model): author_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True) name = models.CharField(max_length=50) agent = models.ForeignKey(LitAgent) class LitAgent(models.Model): agent_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True) name = models.CharField(max_length=50) I want to ask for all the literary agents whose authors had books published in 2006, for example. How can I do this in Django? I have looked at the documentation about filters and QuerySets, and don't see an obvious way. Thanks.
