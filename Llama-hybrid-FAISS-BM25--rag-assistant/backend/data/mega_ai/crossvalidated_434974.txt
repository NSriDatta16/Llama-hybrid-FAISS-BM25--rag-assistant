Asymptotic behaviour of logistic regression

Assume that we use logistic regression with a given regression function r(x) for each sample vector x. Is is true that if we have infinite samples, we have r(x) = log(p(x)) - log(q(x)) where p(x) is the probability that vector x has label 1 and q(x) is the probability that vector x has label -1. In other words, the regression function asymptotically gives the difference of log probabilities in the two classes.
