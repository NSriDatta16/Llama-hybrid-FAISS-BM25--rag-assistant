Software can/does automatically detect changes in trend be the trend a constant in a non-stationary ( differenced ) ARIMA formulation or a Transfer Function model with a trend that is handled by input series reflecting the counting numbers e.g 1,2,3,,,, and 0,0,0,0,0,1.2.3.4 . See ARIMA model selection and stochastic vs deterministic trend/seasonality in time series forecasting . Anachronistic methods like fitting time and times squared and time cubed are not generally advisable unless there is a strong prior with respect to the subject e.g. growth models .
