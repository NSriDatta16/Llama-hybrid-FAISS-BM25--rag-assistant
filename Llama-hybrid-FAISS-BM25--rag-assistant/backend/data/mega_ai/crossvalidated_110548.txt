One relatively simple possibility: Smooth tests of goodness of fit e.g. [1] - which frame the alternative in terms of smooth deviations from the null, built by orthogonal polynomials (with respect to the null density as weight-function) would be relatively straightforward to carry over to a Bayesian framework, since the coefficients of the polynomials form a flexible-but-parametric extension of the null.
