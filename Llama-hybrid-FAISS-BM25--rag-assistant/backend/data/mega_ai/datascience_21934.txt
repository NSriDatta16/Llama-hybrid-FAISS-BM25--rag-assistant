Feature extraction of accelerometer data for machine learning

Currently, I am doing a project with the aim of classifying potholes through machine learning. The data collected is from an accelerometer in which the z-axis measures the "vertical" acceleration of the car, when a pothole is struck. I have tried to deconstruct the signals and create features using two methods: PACF along with a moving average to combat the noise Calculated a periodogram for spectral analysis Is there any other ways to differentiate a pothole from "rough" road surfaces, as I am unsure which approach to take?
