&{\mbox{if }}b=0\\1&{\mbox{otherwise,}}\end{cases}}} dual to the drastic t-norm, is the largest t-conorm (see the properties of t-conorms below). Nilpotent maximum, dual to the nilpotent minimum: ⊥ n M ( a , b ) = { max ( a , b ) if a + b < 1 1 otherwise. {\displaystyle \bot _{\mathrm {nM} }(a,b)={\begin{cases}\max(a,b)&{\mbox{if }}a+b<1\\1&{\mbox{otherwise.}}\end{cases}}} Einstein sum (compare the velocity-addition formula under special relativity) ⊥ H 2 ( a , b ) = a + b 1 + a b {\displaystyle \bot _{\mathrm {H} _{2}}(a,b)={\frac {a+b}{1+ab}}} is a dual to one of the Hamacher t-norms. Properties of t-conorms Many properties of t-conorms can be obtained by dualizing the properties of t-norms, for example: For any t-conorm ⊥, the number 1 is an annihilating element: ⊥(a, 1) = 1, for any a in [0, 1]. Dually to t-norms, all t-conorms are bounded by the maximum and the drastic t-conorm: ⊥ m a x ( a , b ) ≤ ⊥ ( a , b ) ≤ ⊥ D ( a , b ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {\bot _{max}} (a,b)\leq \bot (a,b)\leq \bot _{\mathrm {D} }(a,b)} , for any t-conorm ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } and all a, b in [0, 1]. In particular, we have that: ⊥ m a x ( a , b ) ≤ ⊥ s u m ( a , b ) ≤ ⊥ L u k ( a , b ) ≤ ⊥ D ( a , b ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {\bot _{max}} (a,b)\leq \bot _{\mathrm {sum} }(a,b)\leq \bot _{\mathrm {Luk} }(a,b)\leq \bot _{\mathrm {D} }(a,b)} , for all a, b in [0, 1]. Further properties result from the relationships between t-norms and t-conorms or their interplay with other operators, e.g.: A t-norm T distributes over a t-conorm ⊥, i.e., T(x, ⊥(y, z)) = ⊥(T(x, y), T(x, z)) for all x, y, z in [0, 1], if and only if ⊥ is the maximum t-conorm. Dually, any t-conorm distributes over the minimum, but not over any other t-norm. Non-standard negators A negator n : [ 0 , 1 ] → [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle n\colon [0,1]\to [0,1]} is a monotonically decreasing mapping such that n ( 0 ) = 1 {\displaystyle n(0)=1} and n ( 1 ) = 0 {\displaystyle n(1)=0} . A negator n is called strict in case of strict monotonocity, and strong if it is strict and involutive, that is, n ( n ( x ) ) = x {\displaystyle n(n(x))=x} for all x {\displaystyle x} in [0, 1]. The standard (canonical) negator is n ( x ) = 1 − x , x ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle n(x)=1-x,\ x\in [0,1]} , which is both strict and strong. As the standard negator is used in the above definition of a t-norm/t-conorm pair, this can be generalized as follows: A De Morgan triplet is a triple (T,⊥,n) such that T is a t-norm ⊥ is a t-conorm according to the axiomatic definition of t-conorms as mentioned above n is a strong negator ∀ a , b ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] : n ( ⊥ ( a , b ) ) = ⊤ ( n ( a ) , n ( b ) ) {\displaystyle \forall a,b\in [0,1]\colon \ n({\perp }(a,b))=\top (n(a),n(b))} .
