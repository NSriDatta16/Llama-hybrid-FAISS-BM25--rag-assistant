The book Algorithmic Composition is a good tour of the several methods used: "Topics covered are: markov models, generative grammars, transition networks, chaos and self-similarity, genetic algorithms, cellular automata, neural networks and artificial intelligence." It is a good starting point on this wide topic, however it does never describe in depth how each method works. It provides a good overview of each, but will not be enough to if you do not already have knowledge about them.
