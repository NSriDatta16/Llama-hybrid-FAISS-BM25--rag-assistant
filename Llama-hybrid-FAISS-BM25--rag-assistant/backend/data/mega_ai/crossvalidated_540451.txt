Using pivotal quantities for transformed parameters

Setup Suppose we have some iid data $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ that arises from a distribution with parameters $\theta$ and $\rho$ . $\theta$ is the parameter of interest, and $\rho$ is a nuisance parameter. Suppose further that we know a pivotal quantity $h(X_1, \ldots, X_n ; \theta)$ that has a known distribution that's free of $\theta$ and $\rho$ . To get a confidence interval interval, typically we start off by calculating some quantiles $L_{\alpha}$ and $U_{\alpha}$ such that $$ \mathbb{P}\left[h(X_1, \ldots, X_n ; \theta) \in (L_{\alpha},U_{\alpha}) \right] = 1-\alpha, $$ and then rearranging to $$ \mathbb{P}\left[\theta \in (L'(X_1,\ldots, X_N),U'(X_1,\ldots, X_N)) \right] = 1-\alpha $$ in order to find the interval $(L'(X_1,\ldots, X_N),U'(X_1,\ldots, X_N))$ . Question Now suppose I'm interested in finding intervals of the form $$ \mathbb{P}\left[ |\theta| \in [0,\tilde{U}(X_1,\ldots, X_N)) \right] = 1-\alpha $$ Is there a theorem that guarantees (or precludes) the existence of intervals of this form? I know that if I find a pivotal for $\theta' = |\theta|$ , then I can do this. But is there more to say about when I can/can't do it using the pivotal for the untransformed/canonical parameter? As another example, Bayesian credible intervals of this form are always obtainable as long as you have a proper posterior. You can just use the transformation theorem and get the posterior for the new transformed parameter.
