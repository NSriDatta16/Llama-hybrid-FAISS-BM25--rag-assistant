You can be bit more organized in this case. Consider this class as a model which will extend a base model class. Instead of directly using mysql_query , use a database class and using which u can DO database operations like querying the database. insert into database, etc. set this as the db object in your base model class. As a simple demo class model{ public function __construct() { $this->db = new Database(HOST,USER,PASS,DB); } } class Post extends model{ public $post; public function querySinglePost($value){ $this->post = $this->db->query("select query"); return $this->post; } } You will be calling like $ObjPost = new Post(); $post = $ObjPost->querySinglePost(1);
