Since you are only inserting one row, it should return 1. (Had you used INSERT INTO ... SELECT FROM... to insert multiple rows, it would be higher) In LINQ, drag the stored proc from the Server Explorer, to the LINQ diagram (much as you did for the tables). It will create a method on the DataContext for the strored proc. (You may have to open the Method pane, from the context menu)
