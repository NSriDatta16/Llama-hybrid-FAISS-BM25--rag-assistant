By definition, a ACF is $\gamma_j := E[(Y_{t}-\mu)(Y_{t-j}-\mu)]$ (for covariance) and the is $\rho_j := \frac{\gamma_j}{\gamma_0}$ (for correlation). For a closed formula wrote in function of parameters and such, you need to specify the model that you have (if you say what's your model, i can tell you how to get that formula). For example, the ACF for an MA(1) is: As for the PACF, you want the correlation after having controlled for the other lags in the model, so you need to use OLS, so PACF is defined as the $\beta_j$ on $Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1Y_{t-1} + ... + \beta_jY_{t-j} + u_t$ . For using the data of your time series to calculate the amostral counterpart of those statistics (without having to set a model as what i presented untill now), first you need to assume that your series is at least weakly stationary and ergodic, which in loose terms is like saying that the series "will not change its statistical properties with time", so that the values of the series that you observe can be meaningful to the process behind it. Obs: This is a more formal thing about statistics, ideally you should try to learn what exactly those things mean and how to see when you can make that assumption and when you can't, but it's best to ask that in another post. Then, you can get $\gamma_j$ and $\rho_j$ by the formula present in the most upvoted answer in ACF and PACF Formula . And for the PACF, there is a sistem of equations that connect the ACF correlations to it, known as the Levinson recursion (which also is explained in that answer).
