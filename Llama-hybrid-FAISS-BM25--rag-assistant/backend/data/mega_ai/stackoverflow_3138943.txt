I recommend reading Object Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition , or maybe Touch of Class , both from Bertrand Meyer. Alternatively, you could read the 1992 article Applying "Design by Contract" from the same author. To summarize: The class invariant must hold after the constructor (any of them) finishes, and before and after any public method of the class is executed. Method preconditions and postconditions are additional conditions which must hold on entering and exiting any public method, along with the invariant. So in your case, focus in the invariant. Produce a correct object (one which satisfies the class invariant), no matter which constructor is invoked. In this related answer I discussed similar topics, including an example.
