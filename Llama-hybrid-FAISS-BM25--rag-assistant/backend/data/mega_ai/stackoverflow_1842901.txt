Batch File/Script to delete Several non sequential lines from text file(s)

I have read the suggestion listed here . The batch file solution seems to work untill I get to about 5 ignore conditional strings and then the output starts to ignore very large sections of the text files(s) even things it shouldn't. Basically, I have a bunch of Windows systeminfo (run > cmd > systeminfo) parses. If you run the system info util you will see several lines there (200+). I want a way to run through them (directory at a time hopefully) and only keep or parse out about the 10 lines that matter (CPU speed, RAM amt, etc.). Like I said, I tried the solution above and it looked great until I got past a few ignore strings and all of a sudden it just started ignoring almost everything. Does anyone have a suggestion? Or even an idea as to what I was doing wrong? This is what I got up to before I realized that lines that should not have been deleted were not being printed, type *.txt | findstr /v "OS Manufacturer:" | findstr /v "OS Configuration:" | findstr /v "OS Build Type:" | findstr /v "Product ID:" | findstr /v "Original Install Date:" | findstr /v "System Up Time:" | findstr /v "System type:" | findstr /v "BIOS Version:" | findstr /v "Windows Directory:" | findstr /v "System Directory:" | findstr /v "Boot Device:" | findstr /v "System Locale:" | findstr /v "Input Locale:" | findstr /v "Time Zone:" | findstr /v "Available Physical Memory:" | findstr /v "Virtual Memory: Max Size:" | findstr /v "Virtual Memory: Available:" | findstr /v "Virtual Memory: In Use:" | findstr /v "Page File Location(s):" | findstr /v "Domain:" | findstr /v "Logon Server:" | findstr /v "Hotfix(s):" | findstr /v "NetWork Card(s):" | findstr /v "Registered Owner:" | findstr /v "Registered Organization:" > c:\zzz\final.txt
