how we can prove we have outliers in the results?

I'm working on a model for publishing in a journal. I'm removing outliers from results of my models. Suppose that I have 100 trained neural network, inserting out-of-sample data to these models and obtaining results. In this step I'm removing outliers (based on abs(x-mean(x))>= 2*s.d and use average of remaining results. How can I prove we need removing outliers in my paper? What statistically procedure or graphical presentation we need? Update. X-axis is every out-of-sample and Y-axis is outputs for every sample. Output range is 0-1 (50 samples from 8000 samples presented in figure). In this figure green filled circles are geomean , red filled circles are averaging after removing outliers using above formula and blue filled circles are arithmetic mean . We have three outputs here.
