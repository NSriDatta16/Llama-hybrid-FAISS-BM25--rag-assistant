Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are quite efficient at dealing with sequential information such as time-series. LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) is a type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies and overcome some problems that vanilla RNNs have. If you want to try it on your problem, I'd suggest this tutorial on LSTM for time-series prediction .
