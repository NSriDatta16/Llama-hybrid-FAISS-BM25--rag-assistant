Ruby - Find REGEX match position and w the losest match apply the regex?

I have a list of several REGEX expressions sample_text = 'lots of text' regex_1 = / stuff 1 / regex_2 = / different stuff 2 / regex_3 = / different stuff 3 / regex_4 = / different stuff 4 / regex_5 = / different stuff 5 / What I would like to know how to elegantly do is for each regex, search in the sample_text and return the match position. I then want to use the regex that has the lowest/closest match position from the start of the sample_text Thoughts? Suggestions? Thanks
