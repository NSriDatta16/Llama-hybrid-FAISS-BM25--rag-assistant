Their mechanics are the same, one neuron, uses linear combination of features, with intercept option and logit (sigmoid) function. Conceptually, they both try to find a hyperplane. If you also use the same loss function, they'll respond similarly. One difference is that a typical logistic regression implementation uses Newton Conjugate Gradient solver (that uses Hessian matrix), while in neural net implementations this is not provided as an option due to its computational complexity. See sklearn implementations and solver options: logistic-regression , MLP .
