How to decide which is right, WebForms or MVC when doing ASP.NET

So I'm about to start of a small project for my sporting club for member registrations and I'm trying to decide between WebForms or MVC. Allit will be is a user login and data capture forms (or and data retrieval), so I was initally thinking WebForms with FBA but I've wanted to have a play with MVC for a while and I was thinking that it wouldn't be too bad a choice. But not really having a lot of knowledge of MVC I don't know if it'd be a wrong fit. So what's a good way to decide if WebForms or MVC is the right choice?
