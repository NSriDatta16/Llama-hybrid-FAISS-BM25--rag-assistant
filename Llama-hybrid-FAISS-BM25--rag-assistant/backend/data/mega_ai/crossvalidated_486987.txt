Unbiased coefficients in Cox Model if proportionality violated?

If a Cox PH Model is specified we should always check the Proportionality assumption. It's obvious that, if it is violated the coefficient for the covariate this is the case for is not the efficient estimate, but only an average over time and might therefor be misleading. But what about the other coefficients in the model, which fulfill the PH assumption? I specified a Cox PH model and one of my control variables does violate the assumption. However I'm having some troubles fitting the time-dependent version. As this variable is not really of interest for me, can I skip the estimation with the time-dependent coefficient, or does the violation of the PH assumption by one variable also have an effect on the coefficients of the other variables?
