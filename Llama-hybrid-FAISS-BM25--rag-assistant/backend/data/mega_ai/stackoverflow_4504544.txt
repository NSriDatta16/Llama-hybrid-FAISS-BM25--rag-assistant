They are no events that you can use to determine whether the user has done that action. The best you can do is use an error handler and display a message to the user, perhaps politely pointing out that one possible cause might be the deletion of a site storage. According to the documentation unless the user has disabled or set set the quota to 0 the call should succeed but I wouldn't be surprise if SL doesn't like it.
