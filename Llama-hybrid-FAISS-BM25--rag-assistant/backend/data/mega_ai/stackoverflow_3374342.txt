I just tried creating two tables, one with a single int column and one with 30 bit columns then added a row to each and looked at them with SQL Server Internals Viewer CREATE TABLE T_INT(X INT DEFAULT 1073741823); CREATE TABLE T_BIT( X1 BIT DEFAULT 1, /*Other columns omitted for brevity*/ X30 BIT DEFAULT 1 ); INSERT INTO T_INT DEFAULT VALUES; INSERT INTO T_BIT DEFAULT VALUES; Single row for table with 30 Bit Columns Single row for table with one int Column From a storage point of view SQL Server combines the bit columns and the data is stored in exactly the same amount of space (yellow). You do end up losing 3 bytes a row for the NULL bitmap (purple) though as the length of this is directly proportional to the number of columns (irrespective of whether they allow nulls) Key for fields (for the int version, colour coding is the same for the bit version)
