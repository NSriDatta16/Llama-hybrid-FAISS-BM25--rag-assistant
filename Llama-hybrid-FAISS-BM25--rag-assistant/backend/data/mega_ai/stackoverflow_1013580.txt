getpwent(3) iterates through the password database (usually /etc/passwd , but not necessarily; for example, the system may be in a NIS domain). Any UID known to the system should be represented there. For demonstration, the following shell fragment and C code both should print all known UIDs on the system. $ getent passwd | cut -d: -f3 #include #include int main() { struct passwd *pw; while ((pw = getpwent())) printf("%d\n", pw->pw_uid); } UID 0 is always root and conventionally UID 65534 is nobody , but you shouldn't count on that, nor anything else. What UIDs are in use varies by OS, distribution, and even system -- for example, many system services on Gentoo allocate UIDs as they are installed. There is no central database of UIDs in use. Also, /etc/login.defs defines what "system UIDs" are. On my desktop, it is configured so that UIDs 100-999 are treated as system accounts, and UIDS 1000-60000 are user accounts, but this can easily be changed. If you are writing a service, I would suggest that the package installation be scripted to allocate a UID as needed, and that your software be configurable to use any UID/username.
