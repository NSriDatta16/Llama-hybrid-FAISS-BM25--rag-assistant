What will happen if the variance of Gaussian kernel in Gaussian kernel SVM decreases?

I prepare my self for ML exam ad I saw this question. My note tells me that the option (3) is correct, but maybe there is a trick because all of sentences look like true. (it means all of them seem correct). what is wrong in my understanding?
