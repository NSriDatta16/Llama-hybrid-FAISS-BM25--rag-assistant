How do I put more space between the axis labels and axis title in an R boxplot

I am creating a boxplot in R with the following code: boxplot(perc.OM.y ~ Depth, axes = F, ylim = c(-0.6, 0.2), xlim = c(3.5, 5.5), lwd = 0.1, col = 8, ylab = "Loss of Percent Organic Matter per Year", cex.lab = 1.5) axis(1, at = c(3.5, 4, 5, 5.5), labels = c(" ", "Shallow", "Deep", " "), cex.axis = 1.5) axis(2, cex.axis = 1.5) The problem is that the number labels on the y-axis currently overlap the axis title. Is there a way to put more space between the axis title and the axis number labels? Thanks
