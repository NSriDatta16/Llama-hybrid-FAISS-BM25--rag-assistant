Edit: This answer refers to an older version of this question, and may no longer be relevant. The variants are so numerous as to be relatively useless for most sane applications; the "system" information is derived from a number of pieces of information about the environment, usually at compile time. If you're looking to inspect the specific capabilities of the PHP configuration, you're better off querying specifics; checking configuration flags or for the existence of functions from extensions, etc. Note: You mention HTTP_USER_AGENT . User-agent isn't the same as system; a user agent is the software running on the client that's issuing requests to the server - usually a web browser. User agent sniffing is an often invaluable tool for dealing with cross-browser compatibility issues.
