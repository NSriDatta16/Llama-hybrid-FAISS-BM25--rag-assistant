"this" is a keyword, and you're trying to define it as a variable. You either go object scope this['circle'+i] = new circle(); or local scope var c:circle = new circle(); or an object scope array/vector (best) var circles:Array = new Array() // (outside the function) circles[i] = new circle() // (instead of this['circle'+i] = new circle();) Also, classes go upcase first ( Circle not circle ), and you want to loop while i , not i==5
