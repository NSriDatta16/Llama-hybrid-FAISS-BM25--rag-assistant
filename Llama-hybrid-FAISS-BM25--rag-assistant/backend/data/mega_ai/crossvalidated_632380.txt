Panel Data Estimation and Control Variables

My undergrad thesis has something to do with the relationship between emissions, mitigation-related official development assistance, and governance variables in chosen ASEAN countries. As such, my (unbalanced) dataset involves 9 countries and around 10-14 years worth of data according to estimated models. My variables include: indep: mitigation aid (5 lags), control of corruption/rule of law interaction between the two (mitigation aid * control of corruption, 5 lags) controls: lngdpc, lngdpc^2, (exports+imports)/gdp, forest area % of land area (?), and energy intensity/renewable energy consumption(?)` My options include fixed-effects, random-effects, and pooled OLS. The last two controls are new additions. Intuitively, I know that before the inclusion of these two variables, I'd go with a fixed effects model because the error term is very obviously correlated with my X (say, energy intensity and lngdpc). The Hausman test, however, suggested that I should go with random-effects (Ho) even with so few controls. Upon including the latter two controls, particularly either energy intensity or renewable energy consumption, the Hausman test varies. Controlling for energy intensity leads to the alternative hypothesis (and insignificant key variables), while controlling for renewable energy consumption leads to the null hypothesis. Controlling for the latter also leads to the Breusch-Pagan LM test to suggest that pooled OLS might be more appropriate. Signs also vary (ex: negative forest area for fixed-effects, positive for random-effects). How might one go about this, considering that data availability limits the amount of controls I can use and signs cease to follow hypothesized outcomes?
