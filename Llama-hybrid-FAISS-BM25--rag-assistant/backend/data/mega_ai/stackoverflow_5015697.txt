If current directory happens to be application directory, then no. AIR has concept of various directories: File.applicationDirectory - where app itself is installed, read-only. File.applicationStorageDirectory - buried somewhere deep (on Windows, it is C:\Documents and Settings[User name]\Application Data[Application name]\Local Store) - you can use it to store files . File.documentsDirectory - shortcut to current user's documents directory. Do not throw garbage there. File.desktopDirectory - shortcut to user's desktop, should be treated even more carefully.
