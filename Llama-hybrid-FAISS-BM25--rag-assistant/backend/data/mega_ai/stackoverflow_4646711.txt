MVC User log in and sessions

My web application requires a user to be logged in to view any webpage on it. When a user logs in I store, in sessions, their username and password for retrieval later on. This all works fine but, if I rerun my project it seems to skip past authentication and go straight to the controller for that action. What I presume is happening is that FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(userName, createPersistentCookie); is remembering that the user is logged in but my sessions aren't updated. How can I trap this scenario and update my sessions accordingly?
