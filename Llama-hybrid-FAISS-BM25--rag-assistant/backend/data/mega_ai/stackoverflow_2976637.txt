The best answer is that it really depends on what game you make. If you want the graphics to be different, go for it. Otherwise, it is typical to use one set of graphics and maybe just organize the on-screen GUI differently. The screen is really just a viewport into the game world, and as its shape changes (from tall to wide), it should not affect the physics of the world; unless of course you WANT it to change the physics rules. It's really dependent on what game you are making.
