Transform log posteriors to the original posteriors

Using a two stage RJMCMC process I obtain a vector of log posteriors pertaining to each model. My goal is to convert these to probabilities after normalization (to use in the second stage of the RJMCMC process). The problem is the log posteriors are large (ex. 1100). To convert to probabilities (not on the log scale) I would like to do: exp(log.post)/sum(exp(log.post)) However this is not possible due to the large values of the log posterior. Any suggestions on how I can convert? I would like the probabilities on the original scale, not on the log scale.
