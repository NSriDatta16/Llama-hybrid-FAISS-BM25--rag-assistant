As far as I understand your question you don't need to change anything to your code of the client. If you only want to give access to the JNLP via HTTPS you would only need to reconfigure the application server distributing the JNLP or if you have a webserver in front of the application server (as we do here: user - https -> apache -> AJP -> tomcat) you need to reconfigure the webserver to allow the access to the JNLP via HTTPS.
