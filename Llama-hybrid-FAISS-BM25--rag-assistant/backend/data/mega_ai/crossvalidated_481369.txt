Percentages. If your table just shows the average age of health industry workers, that doesn't seem to tell you much. This will give you the largest tables. If you want small tables, use the means. You could also include the standard deviations (SD). For example, treat AGE as continuous. If you had a mean of 6 and a SD of two, that would say that 95% of the the ages fall between 4 and 8, or 30-34 and 50-54. You could also use 5-number summaries. This would show the min, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, and max. It shows the distribution in a different way. This would give you a mid-size tables.
