You are asking for a code generator, which as jsd noted IB will do if you really want. However, your life will be a lot easier if you just accept what IB is, an object creation, placement, linking and storage mechanism. IB is doing all the tedious stuff for you, creating instances and setting initial values for you along with (some) relationships, then compositing them all. It freeze-dries the result so it's ready to go at runtime. It does sometime make sense to use what IB has done as a template to base other code around instead of using the views it creates directly, but if you generate code then you are potentially out of sync with IB and it makes it hard to use for maintaining the interface going forward.
