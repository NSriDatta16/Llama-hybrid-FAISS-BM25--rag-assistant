Probability of a stochastic process hitting a certain level?

Suppose I have observations of a stochastic process $\{X_t\}$ . I.e., time series data. Say presently $X_t for a level $u$ , for every $t=1,2,...,N$ . From these observations, how can I model or otherwise calculate the probability $P(X_{N + h} \geq u)$ , for some $h$ ? On the other hand, are expected hitting times easier to work with? Such as $E[\tau | X_t , where $\tau = \inf\{T: X_t \geq u\}$ ? The only thing I can think of is to build a generative model for $\{X_t\}$ , estimate its parameters from the data, then estimate the hitting times by simulating future paths of the time series, but most models assume things too many nice conditions like stationary, Gaussian noise, etc which make things tough in a non-stationary, non-Gaussian case. Is there a general literature on this type of problem?
