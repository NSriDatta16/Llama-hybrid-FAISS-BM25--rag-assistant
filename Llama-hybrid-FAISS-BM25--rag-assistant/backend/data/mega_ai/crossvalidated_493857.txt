The confidence bands give a range in which we would expect sample autocorrelation to vary based on random noise alone, if the data generating process does not include any "real" autocorrelation. As such, your ACF is consistent with no AR dynamics, and the overall mean or median is probably a strong contender in forecasting. This is a frequent finding. Modern approaches to ARIMA order selection rely more on optimizing information criteria than on inspecting (P)ACF plots, so I'd encourage you to look at auto.arima() in the forecast package for R or similar. Incidentally, the median is the optimal point forecast for the MAE, not for the MAPE. The optimal point forecast for the MAPE is the (-1)-median, per Gneiting (2011, JASA , p. 752 with $\beta=-1$ ) .
