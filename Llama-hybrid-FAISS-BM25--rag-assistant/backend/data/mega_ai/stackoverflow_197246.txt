If you are Impersonating some other user in ASP.NET, that user account must have permission to write to that directory. I highly recommend not setting a user's personal folder path as the location to store a web application's log or data. That requires the ASP.NET worker process account to have access to that user's private folder, if they are not the same account. Allocating a common area, for example D:\webapps\logapp\logfiles, is encouraged. With the appropriate permissions given, of course.
