If you're looking at ways to see outbound link hits, you could try the following: Use a script, example link.php?src= http://www.example.com that increments a counter per IP & User Agent combo when clicked. This however doesn't look very good in the status bar. It could also be saved by web crawlers. Use unobtrusive JavaScript to attach event handlers on links that are external. You could determine if they are external if the hostname is present and doesn't match the one you are on. You could then use this event handler to save the href, prevent default of click event, to increment a number much like the first script and then send the window.location to the actual href. This of course fails without JavaScript enabled/supported.
