Could it be that the formula is $y_T = \sum_t \theta^t Y_{T-t}$ ? I think that you will want your ''smoothed series'' to have values that are somewhere in between the values of your original series' values, at least that makes sense to me. If you use weights $w_i$ that are non-negative, at most one and sum up to one, i.e. $0 \le w_t \le 1, \sum_t w_t=1$, then the weighted average $\sum_t w_t Y_{T-t}$ will be a value that is somewhere in between all the values $Y_{T-t}$. ($\sum_t w_i Y_{T-t}$ is called a convex combination of the $Y_{T-t}$). You can easily see this when you do it for only two terms $a$ and $b$; in that case the weighted average will be like $ w a + (1-w) b$. If $0 \le w \le 1$ then $ w a + (1-w) b$ will always be between $a$ and $b$. You can easily try it with the R-code below: a EDIT: The R-code takes two values $a=2$ and $b=5$, and it computes $x=w_1 a + w_2 b$ where $w_1+w_2=1$ or $w_2=1-w_1$ so it computes $x=w_1a + (1-w_1)b$ for $w_1=0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, \dots , 1$. Whatever values for $w_1$ between $0$ and $1$ you take, this $x$ will always be between a(=2) and b(=5).
