can't login to blackberry developer zone id

I am trying to download the BlackBerry plugin for Eclipse Ganymede. However, It requests for a Developer Zone ID and password. I registered using this link: https://origin-bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/bdsc/?lang=na#register However, the registration does not prompt me to enter a user name. I tried logging in with the email and password I provided, but it does not seem to work. How do I get the the BlackBerry developer Zone ID?
