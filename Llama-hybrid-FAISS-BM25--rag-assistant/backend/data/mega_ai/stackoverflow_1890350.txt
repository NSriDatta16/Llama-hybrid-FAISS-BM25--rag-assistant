Looking for C# code to work with .PAR2 archives

I was looking for some C# or VB.NET code that works with .PAR2 archives (see http://www.par2.net/par2spec.php if ths doesn't ring a bell for you!). I've looked all over but I've have yet to find anything useful. If at all possible I'd like to leverage some existing work instead of writing from scratch so any suggestions would be helpful...
