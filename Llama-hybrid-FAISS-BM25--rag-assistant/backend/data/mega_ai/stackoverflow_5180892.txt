Look at public void setToScreen(int whichScreen) {} Use this function to set to a screen on a click. you should extend Draggablespace by adding a function to get the current space like: public int getCurrentScreen() { return this.mCurrentScreen; } then you can write your own functions in your activity like public void nextScreen() { draggableSpace.setToScreen(draggableSpace.getCurrentScreen() + 1)); } The same for previous screen. Now you only need to check if there is an additional screen waiting if you are going forward or backward. (Of course draggableSpace is your object of the class draggablespace...not a static call!)
