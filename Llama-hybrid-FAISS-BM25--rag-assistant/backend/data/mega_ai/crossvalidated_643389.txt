First, I'm not sure it matters a whole lot. I guess it's kind of interesting to try to make a list of biases that is as exhaustive as possible and mutually exclusive. Probably this should be a hierarchical (or nested) list. But I don't think disagreements about how this list should be organized will affect statistical practice. Second, different definitions will yield different answers. Third, to actually answer your question based on the definitions you give, as I was reading the definition of "observer bias" I was inclined to say "no" but the last line of the definition changed my mind. In assessment bias the observer definitely has an idea of what the answer should be and this idea biases their reporting.
