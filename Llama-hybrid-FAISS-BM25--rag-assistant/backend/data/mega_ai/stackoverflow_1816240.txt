What does it even mean to average source bearings? Start by answering that question, and you'll get closer to being to define what you mean by the average of angles. In my mind, an angle with tangent equal to 1/2 is the right answer. If I have a unit force pushing me in the direction of the vector (1, 0), another force pushing me in the direction of the vector (1, 0) and third force pushing me in the direction of the vector (0, 1), then the resulting force (the sum of these forces) is the force pushing me in the direction of (1, 2). These the the vectors representing the bearings 0 degrees, 0 degrees and 90 degrees. The angle represented by the vector (1, 2) has tangent equal to 1/2. Responding to your second edit: Let's say that we are measuring wind direction. Our 3 measurements were 0, 0, and 90 degrees. Since all measurements are equivalently reliable, why shouldn't our best estimate of the wind direction be 30 degrees? setting it to 25.56 degrees is a bias toward 0... Okay, here's an issue. The unit vector with angle 0 doesn't have the same mathematical properties that the real number 0 has. Using the notation 0v to represent the vector with angle 0, note that 0v + 0v = 0v is false but 0 + 0 = 0 is true for real numbers. So if 0v represents wind with unit speed and angle 0, then 0v + 0v is wind with double unit speed and angle 0. And then if we have a third wind vector (which I'll representing using the notation 90v ) which has angle 90 and unit speed, then the wind that results from the sum of these vectors does have a bias because it's traveling at twice unit speed in the horizontal direction but only unit speed in the vertical direction.
