Keras most important features for text classification

I am working on a problem where I need to classify phrases in one of the two categories (let's A & B). I used the Keras SepCNN model (similar to this ) for that and it is giving me some results. Now, I want to analyse the predictions and more specifically I want to know why the model classified a certain phrase in category A or B, which set of features played an important role in labeling that phrase as category A or B? I am not sure if this is even possible to do but need inputs on how to approach this. #----Model Structure for your reference-- Vectorize text (tfidf) SelectKBest features (using scikit-learn feature_extraction) Fit the model Predict on test set* I looked on the internet and found nothing helpful. It would be very helpful if someone can point me the right direction. I also explored eli5 library but that does not seem to work for Keras SepCNN model (at-least I could not get it to work, let me know if anyone has used successfully it?)
