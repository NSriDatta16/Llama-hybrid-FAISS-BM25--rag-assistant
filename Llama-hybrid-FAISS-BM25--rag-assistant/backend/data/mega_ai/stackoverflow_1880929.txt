Is code injection possible in Java?

nowadays you can read much about code injection, exploits, buffer-, stack- and heap-overflows etc. leading to inject and run code. I wonder what of this stuff is relevant for Java. I know, there are no pointers in the Java language. But doesn't the JVM organize data in heaps and / or stacks? I know there is no eval function (like in PHP) so you cant easily use an input as Java-code. I am not so sure whats going on on bytecode level. I think XSS is possible, for example in an Java EE application, when no inputs are filtered. But isn't this more a JavaScript injection, because the injected code runs in the browser and not in the JVM? So which code injections are possible with java and which are not? And is this true for other Java platform languages, too? Thanks in advance.
