How to know statistically for sure if respondents result on a likert scale is proofing anything..?

I have put a question what flow you get from a digital book, compared to paper from 7 (good) to 1 (bad). I only had 26 respondents, and this is the result: FLOW digitalt FLOW papper Valid 26 26 Mean 5.699 5.538 Std. Deviation 1.063 1.074 Minimum 2.833 3.167 Maximum 6.833 7.000 i wonder how can i statistically prove that the digital flow wasnt a coincident? can i just say that because the mean was above average that is evidence enough..? And how can i best present if there is a statistically any difference between digital and paper..? is there a way i can use the standard deviation to check the significance..?
