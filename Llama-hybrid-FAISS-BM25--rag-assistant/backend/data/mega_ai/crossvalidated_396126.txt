ARMAX for Bitcoin prediction via sentiment

I am looking for correlation between social sentiment of BTC and the financial value of BTC. My approach is to use a time-series model to predict the bitcoin value at t+1 based on multiple input variables: a : bitcoin price at time t, t-1, ..., t-n b : sentiment (created via sentiment analysis on tweets containing #BTC and averaged over the interval) for tweets in intervals [t, t+1], [t-1, t], ...: Gets value between -1 (negative) and 1 (positive) c : amount of tweets containing #BTC in the intervals [t, t+1], [t-1, t], ... Am I correct in the assumption that an ARMAX model with endogenous variable a and exogenous variables b and c would be the right approach? Or do I need to use a VARMA model with a,b,c as endogenous variables? edit: According to the following Model Results for my VARMA(1,1) model fitted on 1 year of hourly bitcoin price, sentiment and tweet-amount, all my p values seem to indicate statistical significance for all input variables. y1 is the amount of tweets, y2 is the sentiment and y3 is the bitcoin price
