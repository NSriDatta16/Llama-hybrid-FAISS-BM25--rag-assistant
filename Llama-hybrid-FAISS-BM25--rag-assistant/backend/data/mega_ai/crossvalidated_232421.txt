Simple explanation of a WinBUGS code

Can anyone give me a quick walkthrough of what this code is doing? I think the line log( mu[i] ) is updating mu for each iteration and then fatal[i] and pred[i] sample from this. I am not clear on exactly what is the difference between the two. How does the data for fatal fit into the model? I know how the step function works but I am not clear on what is happening in the line probpred[i] Any help would be appreciated. I have had a look at the help manual but it is a little brief for my understanding. I am brand new to Bayesian analysis and WinBUGS. model { for (i in 1:5) { fatal[i] ~ dpois(mu[i]) pred[i] ~ dpois(mu[i]) probpred[i]
