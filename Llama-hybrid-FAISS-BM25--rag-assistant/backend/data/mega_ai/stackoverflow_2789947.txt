There is a pattern called Active Object Pattern wherein each object executes in its own thread. Frameworks like ACE support this. If you have access to such frameworks, you should use those. In any case, i would believe creating a new instance of an object and allowing it to exetute in its own thread is much cleaner that invoking the copy-constructor to make a copy of the object. Else see if you can fit a solution that uses Thread Local Storage .
