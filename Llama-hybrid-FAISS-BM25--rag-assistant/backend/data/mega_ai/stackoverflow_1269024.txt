If it's not working, you can't optimize it. First make it work. At first glance, it seems that you have really mixed concepts about fields, relationships and equality/membership. First go thought the docs, and build your query piece by piece on the python shell (likely from the inside out). Just a shot in the dark: all_accepted_parts = acceptedFragment.objects.filter(fragment__in = fragment.objects.filter(categories = fragmentCategory.objects.get(id=1))) or maybe: all_accepted_parts = acceptedFragment.objects.filter(fragment__in = fragment.objects.filter(categories = 1))
