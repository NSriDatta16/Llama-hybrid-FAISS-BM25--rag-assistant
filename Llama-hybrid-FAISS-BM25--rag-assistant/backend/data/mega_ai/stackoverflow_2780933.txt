Jquery prevent dragging of text value

I have a html textbox on which I've bound a function via jQuery to the paste event to prevent users pasting a value into the textbox. This functionality works well. However it is possible to select some text from another textbox on the page and drag it into the textbox in which pastes are prevented. Is there a jQuery event that I can bind to that will prevent users dragging text into the texbox?
