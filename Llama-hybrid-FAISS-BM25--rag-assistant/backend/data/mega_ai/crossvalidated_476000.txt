The answer is in spatstat 's FAQ : How are the r values determined in Kest(X) ? The default r values for Kest are computed as follows: The maximum r value is computed by the function 'rmax.rule', rmax \ where W is the window containing the data, and lambda is the average density of points per unit area. Currently this rule takes the minimum of Ripleyâ€™s rule of thumb: rmax = one quarter of the smallest side of the enclosing rectangle large sample rule: rmax = sqrt(1000/(pi \* lambda)) r values are equally spaced from 0 to rmax with step value eps . If eps is not specified, then eps = rmax/512 so that there are 513 values or 512 intervals. You can always override the r values if you need to. This means that, for a window of (length,width)=[0,1]x[0,1] (ie: A=1 ) and assuming that the number of points is N , the array of radii values is obtained as follows (in pseudo-code): rho = N / A # density thumb = A / 4 # rule of thumb large = sqrt(1000 / (pi * rho)) # rule of large numbers rmax = min(thumb, large) Hence for N the array of radii will be an equal-spaced segmentation of the range [0, 0.25] in 512 intervals. This was also asked over at StackOverflow .
