The reason that you haven't found a canonical answer to this question is that the best measure of efficacy of dimension reduction is the measure you will ultimately use the reduced dimensions for. When fitting a model in machine learning or statistics, the feature engineering and dimension reduction are part of the model, so their efficacy is judged on the same metrics that a model is judged on (MSE, MAPE, likelihood, etc). If you are reducing dimensions to plot them and make a decision, then the efficacy of dimension reduction should be judged on how it enables the decision of interest (power, minimum detectable effect, etc.). I recommend that your next step be to define precisely what the data will ultimately be used for and use that context to determine which method of dimension reduction works the best.
