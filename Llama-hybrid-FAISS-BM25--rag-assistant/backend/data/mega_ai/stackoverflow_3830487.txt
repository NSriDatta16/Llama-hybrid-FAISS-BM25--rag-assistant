While you've got an answer, I don't think too much has been provided as to possible root cause. Here's a few possibilities, but there are others. Note, these apply to Windows. There's an apartment threaded COM object involved. Apartment threaded COM objects, which are the only type VB can create, can only be used on the thread that creates them. Security features, like impersonation, are often thread isolated. If the initialization code modified the context of the thread, future calls that expect the context to be in place will fail. Thread specific memory storage is a technique within some applications to support multi-threadedness (Java also has such a feature).
