Get the average time between first and 2nd call (postgresql)

I have the following data in table where I want to calculate the average time between 1st and 2nd call. I know how to get the average, but I have a though time to figure out how to subtract the 2nd from 1st attempt since it is in the same column and I am more familiar to subtracting things between columns.
