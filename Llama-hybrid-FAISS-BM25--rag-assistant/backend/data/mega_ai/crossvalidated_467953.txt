Component contributions in Additive Model Time Series

I have trained a model for forecasting time series in a greedy procedure: Fit the Trend component T(t) of the series on the original signal y(t) Fit a Cyclical/Seasonal S(t) component of the series on the residual of the signal : RT(t) = y(t) - T(t) Fit an auto-regressive component E(t) on the residual : RS(t) = y(t) - RT(t) Then my model for forecasting is : f(t) = T(t) + S(t) + E(t) I would like to quantify the importance of each of the three components with respect to: The predicted values of the forecast The forecast error Would you have any idea as to how I could assess the contributions ? My first idea was to compute the Shapley values of each of the three components but this approach prooved unsuccessful for the two following reasons: The Shapley value in an additive cooperative game is simply the individual component, hence no additionnal information is gained here The Shapley value computed on the Mean Squared Error does not work as in the definition of Shapley Value, the cooperative game characteristic function needs to satisfy v(âˆ…) = 0 which is not the case for the MSE.
