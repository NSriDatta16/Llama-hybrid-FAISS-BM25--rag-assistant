I don't have a definite answer for you since I find myself in a similar situation, but don't use Magento. It's even expensive when it's free. It's slow and bloat, when customized, upgrades are next to impossible. The API is notoriously slow. Also, unless you want to start a shopping club, there's little to gain from the Enterprise version either. I'd look into Veyton or OXID right now. Veyton is a brand-new shop system, pretty extensible and pleasant to work with. OXID is one of the newer players in the ecommerce scene, though they don't seem to get as much press as Magento. Last but not least - let me asure you - there's nothing wrong with using osCommerce. We have a fork in house which has a lot of functionality added (e.g. multishop, templates, sync to CRM etc.) and it's been running very well for us. I haven't checked out the new releases lately but they have come a long way. :)
