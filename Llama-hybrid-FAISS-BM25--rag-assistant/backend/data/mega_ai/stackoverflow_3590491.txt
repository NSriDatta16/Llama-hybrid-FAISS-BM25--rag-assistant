Read AuthStorage, Zend Framework

on my project website users are able to login and move from page to page on my site by being logged in. so they do not have to log in again for moving to another section on my page. to achieve that I use the storage of Zend_Auth. Following code shows how I write storage: $authAdapter->setIdentity($email) ->setCredential($password); ... $identity = $authAdapter->getResultRowObject(); $authStorage = $auth->getStorage(); $authStorage->write($identity); Now I try to read this storage in another controller: $auth = Zend_Auth::getInstance(); $authStorage = $auth->getStorage(); $user = $authStorage->read()->email; ...but $user stays null. any ideas how to solve that problem?
