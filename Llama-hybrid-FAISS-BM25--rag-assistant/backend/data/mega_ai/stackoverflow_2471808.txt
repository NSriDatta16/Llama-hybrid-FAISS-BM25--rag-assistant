printing sequence number of a sniffed packet

i am using pcap to create a packet sniffer. i have this tcp structure: typedef struct TSP_header{ unsigned short int sport; unsigned short int dport; unsigned int seqnum; unsigned int acknum; unsigned char reserved:4, offset:4; unsigned int tcp_res1:4, //little-endian tcph_hlen:4, //length of tcp header in 32-bit words tcph_fin:1, //Finish flag "fin" tcph_syn:1, //Synchronize sequence numbers to start a connection tcph_rst:1, //Reset flag tcph_psh:1, //Push, sends data to the application tcph_ack:1, //acknowledge tcph_urg:1, //urgent pointer tcph_res2:2; unsigned short int tcph_win; unsigned short int tcph_chksum; unsigned short int tcph_urgptr; }TSP_header; how can i print the sequence number? should i use htons(sequence_number)?? because it isn't working this way!! my other question is what is the number after the variable declaration? what does 4 mean in tcph_hlen:4
