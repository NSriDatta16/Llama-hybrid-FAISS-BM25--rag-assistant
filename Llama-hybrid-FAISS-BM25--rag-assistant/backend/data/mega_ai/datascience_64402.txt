Warning during training a CNN

I was training a CNN when the following appeared: after this the training continue, but I don't understand why it happens. Should I do something or leave it? [EDIT] The problem is that it does this also during the evaluation, so for example if I want to print the confusion matrix: Y_pred = model.predict_generator(test_generator, test_generator.n // batch_size+1) y_pred = np.argmax(Y_pred, axis=1) print('Confusion Matrix') print(confusion_matrix(test_generator.classes, y_pred)) I get the error: Thanks. [EDIT] I have 3200 images for training and 800 images for testing. So I don't understand what is happenining here because this error should happen for the fact that y_test and y_pred have different number of elements, so why it says that one has 832 elements, since I have only 800 images for testing?
