Unfortunately it's not that easy, because GetWindowLongPtr doesn't exist in 32bit Windows. On 32bit systems GetWindowLongPtr is just a C macro that points to GetWindowLong. If you really need to use GetWindowLongPtr on both 32 and 64 bit systems you'll have to determine the correct one to call at run time. See the description at pinvoke.net
