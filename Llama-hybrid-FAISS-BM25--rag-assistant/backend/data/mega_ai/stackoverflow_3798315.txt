CLLocation implements the NSCoding protocol so you can store them in Core Data as transformable attributes. You can use the default NSKeyedUnarchiveFromData value transformer. You would just pass the CCLocation object to the managed object attribute and it would serialize it to data and store it as a blob in the SQL store. When you need the location object back it would automatically reverse the process and return to you a fully populated CCLocation object. That might be the easiest way to get what you want.
