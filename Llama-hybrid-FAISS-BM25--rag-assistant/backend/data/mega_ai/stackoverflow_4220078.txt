Your code doesn't show you defining or opening a database connection. You need to define that first and then pass it into the recordset with the query you want to execute Details of opening a connection here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms807027.aspx A code example from that MDSN article: Sub ConnectionExample6() Dim cnn As ADODB.Connection Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset Set cnn = New ADODB.Connection ' Open a connection by referencing the ODBC driver. cnn.ConnectionString = "driver={SQL Server};" & _ "server=MySqlServer;uid=MyUserName;pwd=MyPassword;database=pubs" cnn.Open ' Create a Recordset by executing an SQL statement. Set rs = cnn.Execute("Select * From authors") ' Show the first author. MsgBox rs("au_fname") & " " & rs("au_lname") ' Close the connection. rs.Close End Sub
