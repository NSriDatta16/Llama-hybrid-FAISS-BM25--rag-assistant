Regex - replace only last part of an expression

I'm attempting to find the best methodology for finding a specific pattern and then replace the ending portion of the pattern. Here is a quick example (in C#): //Find any year value starting with a bracket or underscore string patternToFind = "[[_]2007"; Regex yearFind = new Regex(patternToFind); //I want to change any of these values to x2008 where x is the bracket or underscore originally in the text. I was trying to use Regex.Replace(), but cannot figure out if it can be applied. If all else fails, I can find Matches using the MatchCollection and then switch out the 2007 value with 2008; however, I'm hoping for something more elegant MatchCollections matches = yearFind.Matches(" 2007 [2007 _2007"); foreach (Match match in matches){ //use match to find and replace value }
