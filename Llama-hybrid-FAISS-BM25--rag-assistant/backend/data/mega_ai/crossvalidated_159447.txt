How to detect variable seasonality pattern

We have predicted and actual (daily) data for past 3 years. We use 90 days of data for prediction. Generally our predictions are very accurate, but we receive unusual traffic for few days/weeks ( like thanksgiving-for few days, Christmas - around 2 weeks) and our predictions go off. How should i go about detecting and correcting this pattern using time series data that we have? Thanks and Regards!
