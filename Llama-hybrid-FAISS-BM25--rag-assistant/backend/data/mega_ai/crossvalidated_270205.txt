Type complex vs two level

I am conducting a cfa (two level, with meaning of level 2;it is staff rating organizations and we care about organizations). My question is what is the difference is in mplus between type=complex (mlr with sandwich) and type=twolevel if mlr is selected as an estimator with no covariates in the model? These should be the same corrct?
