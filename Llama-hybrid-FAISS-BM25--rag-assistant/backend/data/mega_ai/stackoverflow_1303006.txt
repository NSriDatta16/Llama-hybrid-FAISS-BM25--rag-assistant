Touch Controls working on Simulator, not on Device

See topic. It's just with one application -- 2 of them work fine, but the third (and largest, go figure) doesn't respond to touch events. I tried changing a UIImageView's location on TouchesBegan, and that doesn't show up (but it does in the Simulator!) -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; gestureStartPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; mothership.center = CGPointMake(80,80); //etc... I've tried both debug and release modes. Any idea on what would cause this? The rest of the game runs fine (enemy ships appear and shoot at you, so I know the rest of the code is working). Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you!
