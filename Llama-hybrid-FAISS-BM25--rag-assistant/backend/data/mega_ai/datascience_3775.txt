This does not seem a Data Science problem. However there are very nice tools to do exactly that, checkout: logstash, flume and fluentd. Actually if you want to be able to filter in fast and "smart" way checkout Kibana from the guys of ElastichSearch ( http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana ). Those tools are enough to solve your problem in a very efficient way.
