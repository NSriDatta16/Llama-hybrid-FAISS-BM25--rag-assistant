SAS ARIMA forecast estimate statement

Im trying to forecast a timeseries (daily intervals) but I am unsure of the syntax of the estimate statement. I know p is for autoregression and q is for moving averages, but what do the (2)(12) and (1 3) mean, and what values should they be if the interval = day ? proc arima data=daily; i var=SUM_of_Total_Revenue2; run; e p=(2)(12) q=(1 3); f lead=365 out=daily2 id=Order_date interval=day noprint;
