Eliciting a Gamma informative prior in a Gamma–Poisson Bayesian problem

I employ the Gamma–Poisson conjugate family for my statistical model. I want to use an informative prior. From theory, I know that the values of the Gamma-distributed random variable lie within the interval $[x_0,x_1]$ . Using the shape-and-scale characterization, I need to find the values of $k$ and $\theta$ such that the corresponding Gamma density contains a ninety-five percent probability between $x_0$ and $x_1$ . Using Gamma's CDF, I get the two conditions: $$\frac{1}{\Gamma(k)} \gamma \left( k, \frac{x_0}{\theta}\right)=0.025$$ and $$\frac{1}{\Gamma(k)} \gamma \left( k, \frac{x_1}{\theta}\right)=0.975$$ that need to be solved for $k$ and $\theta$ . Both conditions involve $\gamma$ , the lower incomplete Gamma function. How can I solve for $k$ and $\theta$ ?
