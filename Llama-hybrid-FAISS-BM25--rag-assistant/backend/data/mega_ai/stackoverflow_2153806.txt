Not sure if these fragments of non-code are any use to you but; Don't forget the array sectioning features of Fortran. Don't forget that you can use vector subscripts to get array sections, for example, you might select elements of a vector v like this: v( (/1, 3, 6, 5, 10 /) ) Vector subscripting can be applied to arrays of rank greater than 1. It would hurt my head to figure out your subscripting requirements this way, but you might want to try it.
