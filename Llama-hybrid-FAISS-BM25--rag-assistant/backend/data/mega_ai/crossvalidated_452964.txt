Use a multilevel logistic regression and cross validation

I want to use a multilevel logistic regression for a double purpose, estimating the value of coefficients to explain a phenomenon. At the same time, I want to split the data through cross-validation for prediction. My question is whether is it combinable a partition in the dataset for prediction and the use of mixed linear models? Additionally, I want to try other algorithms that implement non-linear solutions, is it possible to use a mixed-level model in a multilayer perceptron, decision tree, etc?
