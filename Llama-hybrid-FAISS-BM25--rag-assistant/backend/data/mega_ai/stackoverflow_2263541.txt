What does `~` mean in Haskell?

I'm studying the mtl library and trying to do some MonadTransformers of my own. I was checking the Control.Monad.State.StateT declaration, and across all the code, I see this syntax: execStateT :: (Monad m) => StateT s m a -> s -> m s execStateT m s = do ~(_, s') What does this ~ operand mean?
