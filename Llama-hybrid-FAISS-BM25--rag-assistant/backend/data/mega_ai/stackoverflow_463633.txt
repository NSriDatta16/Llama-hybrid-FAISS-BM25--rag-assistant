CHAR takes up less storage space than VARCHAR if all your data values in that field are the same length. Now perhaps in 2009 a 800GB database is the same for all intents and purposes as a 810GB if you converted the VARCHARs to CHARs, but for short strings (1 or 2 characters), CHAR is still a industry "best practice" I would say. Now if you look at the wide variety of data types most databases provide even for integers alone (bit, tiny, int, bigint), there ARE reasons to choose one over the other. Simply choosing bigint every time is actually being a bit ignorant of the purposes and uses of the field. If a field simply represents a persons age in years, a bigint is overkill. Now it's not necessarily "wrong", but it's not efficient. But its an interesting argument, and as databases improve over time, it could be argued CHAR vs VARCHAR does get less relevant.
