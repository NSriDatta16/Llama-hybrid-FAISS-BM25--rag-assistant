A touch-down-drag is a completely different event. Apple doesn't support this directly—you'd have to code it in—start tracking the touches using the gesture responders as soon as a touch-down-inside is detected, then scroll the same amount, and stop scrolling at a touch-up-outside (or inside). This would most likely fall under the category of unusual use of interface elements, and could very well get you rejected.
