As for genders you may try encourage translators to use non-gender specific translations (which is usually possible in business applications but might be impossible here). You may have also encounter the problem somewhere else. Other (non-English) languages have multiple plural forms. For example: "Your team has acquired 2 swords". No matter how many swords you will actually receive, be it 5 or 1000, in English you will always end up with one plural sentence. But this is not the case in many languages.
