Having used a lot of different Triple Stores as storage layers in my research project I would recommend the following two: 4store - Already mentioned by dajobe and is very good and has frequent releases to fix bugs and add new features as SPARQL 1.1 continues to be standardised. Also has benefit of being totally free AllegroGraph - Free for up to 50 million Triples though tends to be be quite a RAM hog even at relatively low numbers of Triples (e.g. used around 3 of my 4GB of RAM when I had about 1.5m triples). Actual memory usage will vary with usage - in my case I was running an app that meant my entire dataset had to be loaded into memory. I haven't used Version 4 so I can't say whether they have improved this While Virtuoso is very good at some things it has a seriously bad case of feature creep and has a lot of non-standard/proprietary features which like you imply might lead to vendor lock in. Like Ian says stick to using the core language features in the SPARQL Standards and then you can easily move to a different Triple Store as your needs change. When developing your application try and design it to be storage agnostic so you can just plug in a different storage layer as your need to. How easy this is to do will depend on your programming environment/language/API but doing it will be beneficial in the long run.
