how to convert the changes that I have done in a resultset to sql queries in java?

I am comparing 2 resultsets, and I have to update one resultset according to the data in another. I can do this easily using updateRow (or insertrow, if required). But I also need to generate sql query (preferably with oracle syntax) and add into an sql file, which gives me the option of updating that later. Can anyone tell me an elegant way of doing this?
