First of all, retrieving all the data from a remote database is never a good idea. You are using an important share of bandwidth. Hopefully, the query you are using is only used for debugging purpose and should never hit production. You did not mention if it took 5 minutes before you started receiving something or if you are receiving your data over the course of that 5 minutes, at a constant rate. In the first situation, not receiving rows at all might indicating a that a lock is effective on your table, due to another operation. In the latter situation, you are constantly receiving rows, but at a slow rate. Bandwidth and server load play a big part in that. To get you a rough idea of the amount of data that you are downloading, run this stored procedure: EXEC sp_spaceused 'YourTableName'; Consider that the server has to upload that data and that you have to download the data. Binary and xml fields (also called BLOB field) usually take a lot of data and you may not be able to control the amount of data stored by the user in those field. Try checking the size of your variable length fields (varchar, xml and varbinary) by running a DATALENGTH on your column: SELECT DATALENGTH(MyField) FROM MyTable You can also get an average: SELECT AVG(DATALENGTH(MyField)) FROM MyTable A good idea concerning BLOB field is to retrieve them only when needer and not when you are loading a list of data. For example, assume a XML field stored in a PurchaseOrder table. If you wish to display the list of PO to your user, you usually don't need to retrieve that field, unless the user open the PO. Many recent ORM, like nHibernate, offers lazy loading for columns, along with paging so you can retrieve a small amount of row. Ayende posted a rent about loading unbounded result set two weeks ago.
