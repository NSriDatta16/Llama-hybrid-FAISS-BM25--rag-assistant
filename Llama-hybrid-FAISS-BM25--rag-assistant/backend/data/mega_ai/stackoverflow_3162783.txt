Snowflaking or bridge tables do make the joins more complicated, and not just from a coding perspective, it also makes it less simple for BI users. In most cases, I would put these directly in existing or additional dimension tables. For instance, you have a scores fact table, which has the user details in a dimension which may or may not hold demographics on the user (perhaps it's only a bridge). Sometimes it is better to split out demographic information. So even though the gender and age might be associated with a user entity, in the dimensional model, these might be individual dimensions or lumped into a single dimension - all depending on the usage scenarios. Perhaps your scores are attached to a state and states have regions (snowflake). It might be far more efficient for analysis to have the region dimension linked directly instead of going through the state dimension. I think what you will find is that the dimensional model is a very pragmatic denormalization approach. The main things which are non-negotiable are the facts - after that the choice of dimensions is very much informed by the behavior of the data, your foresight for common usage scenarios - and avoiding falling into the too few dimensions and too many dimensions problems.
