Best way to run remote commands thru ssh in Twisted?

I have a twisted application which now needs to monitor processes running on several boxes. The way I manually do is 'ssh and ps', now I'd like my twisted application to do. I have 2 options. Use paramiko or leverage the power of twisted.conch I really want to use twisted.conch but my research led me to believe that its primarily intended to create SSHServers and SSHClients. However my requirement is a simple remoteExecute(some_cmd) I was able to figure out how to do this using paramiko but I didnt want to stick paramiko in my twisted app before looking at how to do this using twisted.conch Code snippets using twisted on how to run remote_cmds using ssh would be highly appreciated. Thanks.
