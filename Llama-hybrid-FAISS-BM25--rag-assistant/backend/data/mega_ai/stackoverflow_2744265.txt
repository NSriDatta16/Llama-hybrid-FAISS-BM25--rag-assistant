As you surely already know, LDAP is a particular sort of database (plus a protocol to access it) for "directory services", oriented towards mostly-read-only, hierachical, distributed scenarios. It's mostly used for authentication, authorization, searching/listing of users with their roles and data (and/or other entities) of some organizations. LDAP is hated by many developers because of it's very idiosyncratic terminology/idioms, very different from relational databases and SQL. Many had hopes about its slow death, but the fact that Microsoft adopted it for Windows (Active Directory), among other facts, tells it's probably going to be around for some time. When consider to use it in web applications? Assuming you are not confortable with it, only use if you have to, I'd say. That is, if you need to authenticate/interact with some existing LDAP infrastructure (AD, for example).
