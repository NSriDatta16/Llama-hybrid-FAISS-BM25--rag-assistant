In applications with threads, I prefer to use singletons with an initialize() function and asserts to make sure that the initialize() is used before the first instance(). Call initialize() from the main thread. I don't think that lazy instantiation is really the key feature of a singleton, especially for a logger. While Arkaitz's answer is more elegant, my answers avoids threading issues on all platforms with the cost of 1 extra function and some instantiating concerns during startup for singletons with dependencees (helped by asserts and ofcourse: use singletons judiciously).
