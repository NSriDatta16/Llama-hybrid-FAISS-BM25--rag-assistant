How to show thumbnails of simple products in configurable products with Magento

I want to show each simple product's thumbnail image and option name with a radio button to select in configurable products. Default behavior is showing options in text with a widget like dropdown box. I am using Magento Community Edition 1.4.1. Are there anybody has done this before? Could you guide me for a right direction?
