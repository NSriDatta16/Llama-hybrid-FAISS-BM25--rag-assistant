Multivariate, nonlinear regression in R

I am trying to make a chemical concentration curve, but it has been so long since I have had to use any type of math I'm having trouble getting going through iterations to find the best fit. The data has one dependent variable, $y$ , and two independent variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ . However $x_1$ and $x_2$ do interact with each other. One concentration, $y$ , is represented by a nonlinear curve made up by $x_1$ and $x_2$ . Each curve in the image shown represents a different concentration. The goal is to be able to gather $x_1$ and $x_2$ and determine what concentration, $y$ the solution is. What methods should I start with? Should I just stick with polynomial or try PLS or PCA? I'm worried about over-fitting the data since in the real life application there will be some day to day testing variability that the regression needs to account for. Any help is appreciated.
