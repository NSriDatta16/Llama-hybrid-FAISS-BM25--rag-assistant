I am not sure if all uses of the adjective “adaptive” in statistics can be lumped together or if a single word can be used to described “non-adaptive” methods but I think it always implies that some decisions on data collection or experimental design are taken using data collected during the study itself instead of being fully specified in advance. For example, taking an example from psychometrics, in a traditional test, all items/questions are defined beforehand whereas in “adaptive testing”, answers to early question are used to select later questions and test takers don't see all questions. Since “adaptive testing” is still regarded as a somewhat advanced/complex method, I would describe fixed tests as “traditional tests” (as I in fact did at the beginning of this paragraph).
