In the 1980s dynamic time warping was the method used for template matching in speech recognition. The aim was to try to match time series of analyzed speech to stored templates, usually of whole words. The difficulty is people speak at different rates. DTW was used to register the unknown pattern to the template. It was called "rubber sheet" matching. Basically you search through some constrained possibilities of how the time series can locally be stretched to optimize the global fit. This approach was shown to be pretty much the same thing as hidden Markov models.
