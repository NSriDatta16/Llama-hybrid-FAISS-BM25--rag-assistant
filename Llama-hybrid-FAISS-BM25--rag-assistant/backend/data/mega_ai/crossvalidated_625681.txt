To be meaningful as probability values, you will want them to be calibrated. That is, when a prediction of $P$ is made, the event should happen about $P$ proportion of the times. Concretely, if you keep predicting an event to happen with $90\%$ probability, yet the event happens in only $60\%$ of the cases, your prediction of $0.9$ lacks calibration. It is not a given that your predictions will be calibrated probability values. The two links below discuss software tools and the statistical ideas implemented in them for assessing probability calibration. I do not know of an implementation besides R, but I once ported basic functionality of val.prob to Python without much difficulty, so it can be done.
