I had to deal with this a while back. There is something tricky with register_activation_hook, for some reason running queries did not work for me, use the dbDelta function. function bot_install() { global $wpdb; $table = $wpdb->prefix."sh_gloss"; require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php'); $structure = "CREATE TABLE $table ( id INT(9) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, phrase VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL, desc VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, UNIQUE KEY id (id));"; dbDelta($structure); // Populate table $wpdb->query("INSERT INTO $table(phrase, desc) VALUES('Scott Herbert', 'Rockstar Programmer')"); } Let me know if that doesn't work.
