Windows 7 - Programmatically configure a application to run in XP compatibility mode

My application needs administrative access and I want it to run without any hassles in Windows 7. I have the following options 1.Ask the user using the application to turn off UAC. This is a last resort option and would hate to do that. 2.Embed a manifest in the application that says elevate to adminstrator privelege. This will work but it seems that it will bring up a dialog requiring users consent every time a user runs the application. 3. Configure the application to run in Windows XP compatibility mode. This works, but i had to do this using explorer->application properties. if can I do this programmatically during installation time, I would really prefer this option. My question is if there is any way to achieve this. regards Ganesh
