Easiest technique could be multiple regression where you have monthly dummies (actually 12-1). Other technique could be ARIMAX which means you have time series model with explanatory variables and not only ARIMA. Of course there are more exotic time series models like state space models which could be used. Number of observations is quite small but sometimes I have used something like three years of data successfully, but this depends on problem on hand.
