You use subdirs if the logic and gui folders actually repesent some sort of target, eg. a library, that can be built independently of anything else. If that's the case then just use TEMPLATE = lib TARGET = logic CONFIG += dll in logic.pro. If they are not independent targets but are just folders that exist to organise the sources files then you can just use a .pri file in each instead and include them within the .pro using include(logic/logic.pri) include(gui/gui.pri) Just remember that the file paths in the .pri files are relative to the .pro file and not the .pri. BTW, the use of a .pri file is optional as you can still list the files in those folders directly in the .pro file. The .pri file just makes it that bit neater and helps keep the .pro file shorter.
