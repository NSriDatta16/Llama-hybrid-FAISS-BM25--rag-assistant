You're making this way more complicated than it needs to be. No Javascript is required to do this. Let's say you've got the following: This is a header This is a paragraph So you've got a container, with a header and paragraph. Let's say you want to have the header normal weight, and the paragraph in red normally, with a padded box around the whole thing. Here are your styles: .container { border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; } .container h3 { font-weight: normal; } .container p { color: red; } When you hover the mouse over the , you want the paragraph and header in bold and the box border to change to blue. Add this into your stylesheet (or block) below the CSS above: .container:hover { border-color: blue; } .container:hover h3 { font-weight: bold; } .container:hover p { font-weight: bold; } Note that you can save a bit of space, and make it more concise by combining the and styles into one line with a comma, since they're both the same. The whole thing would now look like this: .container { border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; } .container h3 { font-weight: normal; } .container p { color: red; } .container:hover { border-color: blue; } .container:hover h3, .container:hover p { font-weight: bold; } Remember that the "C" in "CSS" stands for "cascading": styles cascade down through both hierarchies (that is, a parent element's style also applies to a child element, unless it's got default styles like margins or whatever), and down the style sheet - that means styles you define after others will override them if they apply to the same element. The ":hover" selector in CSS can pretty much be used on anything, with very few exceptions. I use them regularly for Javascript-free drop-down menus. You can find more on the ":hover" CSS selector here: W3Schools CSS reference on ":hover" . In fact, the W3Schools site is a generally great resource for brushing up your CSS.
