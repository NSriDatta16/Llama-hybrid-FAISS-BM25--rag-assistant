Firstly, the p-value given for the Z-statistic would have to be interpreted as how likely it is that a result as extreme or more extreme than that observed would have occured under the null hypothesis. I.e. 0.96 would in principle mean that the data are providing very little evidence that the variable is needed (while small values such as, say, $p\leq 0.05$ would provide evidence for the likely relevance of the variable, as pointed out by others already). However, a lack of clear evidence that the variable is needed in the model to explain the this particular data set would not imply evidence that the variable is not needed. That would require a difference approach and with a very larege standard error one would not normally be able to say that the variable does not have an effect. Also, it is a very bad idea to decide which variables are to be included in a model based on p-values and then fitting the model with or without them as if no model selection had occurred. Secondly, as also pointed out by others, when you get this huge a coefficient (corresponds to an odds ratio of $e^{-14.29}$) and standard error from logistic regression, you typically have some problem. E.g. the algorithm did not converge or there is complete separation in the data. If your model really did only include an intercept, then perhaps there are no events at all, and all records did not have an outcome? If so, then a standard logistic regression may not be able to tell you a lot. There are some alternatives for such sparse data situations (e.g. a Bayesian analysis including the available prior information).
