Index your XML files. Look into http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/ I recently used it at my previous job to cache our SQL database for fast searching and very little overhead. It provides fast searching of content inside xml files (all depending on how you organize your cache). Very easy and straight forward to use. Much easier than trying to loop through a bunch of files.
