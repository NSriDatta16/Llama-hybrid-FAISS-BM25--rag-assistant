Yes you can do this check these papers http://arxiv-web3.library.cornell.edu/abs/1409.7164v1 http://liris.cnrs.fr/Documents/Liris-5670.pdf I think you have to do some dimensionality reduction algorithm like PCA, LDA or one of the variations to make it speedier. For your example of checking car features you can stack multiple autoencoders and use a greedy layer-wise algorithm to train it to detect features instead of having a single autoencoder for 3D features.
