How to calculate the output from this neural network

bias w0=0.15 and w01=0.5. Assume the intercept of the combination function is 0. Basically, I am studying for my exam and I don't understand how to calculate this question about neural network: 1) the output of H1 and H2 2) the output of node 1. Thank you.
