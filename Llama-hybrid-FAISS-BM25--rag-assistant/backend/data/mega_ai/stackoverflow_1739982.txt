You could use a spreadsheet if you can parse the data into individual fields, then sum by query and sort by count of executions and average. Y'know... Normal data analysis stuff. If you need to, write a regex based application to split the log up into CSV. While you're at it, you could even write a concordance engine for the log names, check averages, and make the tool you're after. Of course, someone is likely to come in and say "Duh, use 'analysisMySQLProDemon40005K+!'" after I post this.
