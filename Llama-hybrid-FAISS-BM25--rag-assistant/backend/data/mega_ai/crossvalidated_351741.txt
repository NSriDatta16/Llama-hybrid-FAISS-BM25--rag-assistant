Dealing with LSTM overfitting

I'm carrying out a project of predicting time series data with an LSTM. I tried out the experiment three times with randomly sampled data(about 920,000 lines each) I've stacked 3 layers of LSTM cells, used l1(0.01) regularization, used dropout, tried shuffling the dataset for every epoch, used ADAM optimizer.. but I get the error curve as follows, which seems to signify overfitting x-axis : epochs y-axis : error in terms of mean squared error the blue line indicates the test set, and the orange train set Can somebody give suggestions on what I should try? Maybe it's a matter on the dataset itself?
