The returns are ljung-box test statistic, it's pvalue, and box-pierce statistic and it's pvalue, for all lags up to 40. Obviously, statsmodels leaves it currently up to the user to choose an appropriate lag length. Hyndman http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/ljung-box-test/ recommends min(10, T/5) for non-seasonal time series. His simulations show that ljung-box overrejects if the lag length is too large. Stata uses min(n/2 âˆ’ 2, 40) http://www.stata.com/manuals13/tswntestq.pdf It looks like in R the default number of lags depends on which package is used. This http://www.r-bloggers.com/story-of-the-ljung-box-blues-progress-not-perfection/ shows a similar pattern of p-values decreasing with lag length. (I never looked at the question of how many lags to use for ljung-box and it's small sample properties before.)
