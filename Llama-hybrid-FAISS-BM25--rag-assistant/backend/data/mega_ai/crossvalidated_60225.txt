I don't think this is anything to do with P-values. In any case you nowhere specify what test you have in mind. The usual definition of a fair coin I take to be that heads and tails are equally probable, but nothing rules out "fairness" being a vague concept that can be made precise in several ways. In practice one should also be wary of -- to take one example -- perfect alternation between heads and tails and suspect the coin -- or more to the point perhaps, the machine or person tossing it. Other kinds of regularity can also be imagined. In that case, the thing to do is to set up a test specific to that kind of behaviour and calculate P-values (or preferably some kind of confidence interval for a key parameter). Alternatively, go as Bayesian as you want. So, I don't see anything here except the idea that the wrong question can give you an irrelevant answer.
