Efficient maths algorithm to calculate intersections

For a game I am developing I need an algorithm that can calculate intersections. I have solved the problem, but the way I have done it is really nasty and I am hoping someone here might have a more elegant solution. A pair of points represent the end points of a line drawn between them. Given two pairs of points, do the drawn lines intersect, and if so, at what point? So for example call the lines (A.x, A.y)-(B.x, B.y) and (C.x, C.y)-(D.x, D.y) Can anyone think of a solution? A solution in any language will do. Edit: A point I should have made clearer, the algorithm must return false if the point of intersection is beyond the lengths of the line segments.
