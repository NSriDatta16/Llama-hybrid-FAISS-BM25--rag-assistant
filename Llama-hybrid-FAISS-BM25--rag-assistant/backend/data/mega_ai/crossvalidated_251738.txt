Data simulations for SVM : study of parameters

I'm studying SVM for classification. The first step of my work consists in making a data simulation in order to study the influence of the cost parameter C, the choice of the kernel, for examples. Do you have any advices in order to have a good study of those parameters ? Which laws to simulate? My point is to understand which kernel use under some circumstances, how to adapt the cost parameter... I hope you understand what i'm trying to do : i want to understand what are the influences of the parameters on the classification depending of the see of datas i have. For example i saw on internet , a triangle, with points from class A inside the triangle, and points from class B outside the triangle. The shape was like a reverse parabola, so the use of the gaussian kernel, with a good value of C, was adapted. I looking for those kind of simulations. Thank you for your answers !
