I have a workaround. Use ImageMagick to convert the ico files to png files: convert favicon.ico[0] favicon.png Then those are easy to work with. ImageMagick is pre-installed on lots of shared hosts, or you can download precompiled binaries for Windows. If you leave off the [0], then you will get a series of files favicon-0.png favicon-1.png etc if there is more than one icon image stored in the .ico file. You will then need to sort through them, to choose the one that is closest to what you want: 16x16 with alpha transparency. (I include 32x32 and 48x48 in my favicon files, for IE users who drag internet shortcuts to their desktop.) ImageMagick preserves the transparency when converting to png. The stackapps.com/favicon.ico gear icon has two images. The first one has alpha transparency, and looks great on your light grey #DBDCDB background. I assume you are building a dynamic image like your https://i.stack.imgur.com/SNHfF.png at the server, rather than sending all 6 top site icons to the browser. If not, it's still a good idea to send the icons converted to png, because they were not designed to render within web pages. ...Tom
