Where should I store class files in an ASP.NET MVC project?

I'm just starting to work with MVC and trying to understand the best practices behind designing an application. In the WebForms world, I typically just created a Classes folder where I stored all of my *.cs files. However, because of the way that MVC uses the folder structure to create different namespaces, I'm not sure that's the right thing to do any more. I can't seem to find any guidance from Microsoft on this topic, so I'm hoping someone here can oint me in the right direction. Is there a right way to organize files in an MVC app? And, more generally, is there an authoritative place to look for this kind of best practice guidance?
