As you only have two classifiers there only few options that come to my mind: min/max value Logical operators: AND, OR, XOR, NOR and the like. However my suggestion is twofold: First, I will focus not on the decision but on the score associated to that decision. If you use scores (probabilities, likelihood) you may use other ways of combining information (geometric mean, harmonic mean and so on). Secondly, in case you are not interested on this former option, I would put my attention on those cases where both classifier disagree, analyze which of the former options (logical operators, min/max value) produce better performance than single classifiers and finally create a decisor-maker based on all these combinations. I wish it works.
