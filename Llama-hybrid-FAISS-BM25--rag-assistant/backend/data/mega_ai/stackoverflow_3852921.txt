http://www.zend.com/en/products/guard/ If you code for your client in PHP, this will prevent reverse engineering, and you can set the application to expire after a certain amount of time. There are numerous other licensing options available. I think you have a deeper problem though, you should really talk to your client or get a third-party mediator to resolve this. At the very least, you should receive a deposit. Contracts will also give you some legal leverage, so you should have signed one before you started work.
