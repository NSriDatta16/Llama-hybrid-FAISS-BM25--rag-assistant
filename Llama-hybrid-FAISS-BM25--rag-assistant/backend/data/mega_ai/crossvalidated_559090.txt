How to deal with zeros in neural network?

I am working on a Keras and TensorFlow in R and I try to make good predictions for a regression problem (not classification). In my dataset there are several features and my target variable has a lot of 0 (zero) values. I tried a different setting for this neural network but unfortunately my network can not predict zeros. Zeros are very important for my model and I can't omit them. So, any idea how I can solve this problem and predict values with zeros ?
