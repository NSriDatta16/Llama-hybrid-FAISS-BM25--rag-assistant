I don't know anything about Flash -- I came to this question hoping to learn a little -- but I was struck by your comment about "adding pizzazz just for the sake of it, because we can". I think a lot of web developers make those twin mistakes, (a) adding pizzazz just for the sake of pizzazz; and (b) doing something complicated or fancy because it is fun to do rather than because it serves a useful purpose. IMHO, many web sites are way too fancy. They have all sorts of animations and complicated interfaces that just make the site distracting, hard to read, and hard to figure out how to use. Personally, I prefer a simple, clean site that shows me what I want to know. When, for example, I go to my bank's web site, I want to see my balance and what checks have cleared. I'm not interested in seeing a sophisticated animation about the bank with cool dancing graphics. Those things just make it slower and distract from what I want to see. A few years ago I built a web site for an organization I worked for at the time, and one of their officers said that he wanted it to be flashier. For starters, he said, the main page should have a video that automatically starts up with all sorts of flashy graphics, a spinning 3D logo that fades into a picture of the building etc etc. To demonstrate what he had in mind, he went to the computer and brought up a web site that had a fancy video like that. He let it play for a few seconds and then closed the browser window to kill it. "Wait," I said, "Why did you stop it?" "Well," he replied, "It's a lot of advertising for their company. I didn't want to sit through the whole video." "Exactly," I said. "And neither will any of OUR visitors." Maybe other people are different than me. Maybe they'll really think your site is better if there's an animated logo at the top of the screen and shifting background colors and all that stuff. I wonder if anyone's ever done a study on this. Do sites with lots of sophisticated graphics get more visitors than sites that just plainly present their information? Hmm, I think it would be interesting to create two web sites with identical information, but one is just plain text with emphasis on formatting for maximum readability, while the other has all sorts of animations and pretty colors and the like, and see which gets more visitors.
