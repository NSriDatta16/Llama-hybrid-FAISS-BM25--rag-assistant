I haven't found a way to do it automatically as you type, but VS 2008 comes with a macro to insert line breaks on command. Go to Tools > Options > Environment > Keyboard Find the Macros.Samples.VSEditor.FillCommentParagraph command Bind it to a shortcut key. I used Alt+Q because I'm used to the Emacs command. When the cursor is in a long comment line, use the shortcut key. The first time it will ask you how long you want each line to be. Unfortunately, it seems like it only goes from a long line to a paragraph. I don't know how to make it refill the paragraph after you edit it like Emacs auto-fill.
