Does K-Means' objective function imply distance metric is Euclidean

The objective/loss function of K-Means algorithm is to minimize the sum of squared distances, written in a math form, it looks like this: $$J(X,Z) = min\ \sum_{z\in Clusters}\sum_{x \in data}||x-z||^2$$ If we have different distance metric, for instance, cosine (I realize there's a conversion between cosine and Euclidean but let's forget it for now), manhattan etc, does it mean we will have a different loss function? That is, the traditional K-Means based on expectation maximization won't be working right? Because for every iteration we revise centroids, normally, by computing the average. However, for some of the metrics other than Euclidean, average might not be a legit representation for the center.
