Set up a cms page for Magento

I've been trying to set up a CMS page in magento to be the home page, and it's just killing me - how hard should this be? no matter what I set up, I get a 404. Can somebody tell me basic steps to set up a CMS page as the home page for a Magento install, living at: http://www.mymagentoinstall.com/ I can't have the url key for the CMS page be empty, but setting the default page in the System->Config->Default Pages->CMS Home Page (which seems like it should work), still gives me a 404. thx for any help
