Two jQuery scripts are not working simultaneously on IE6

I have jQuery for 2 features: Drop down menu. Drag and drop panels. The Problem : Drop down menu use a jQuery as a fix for Internet Explorer 7 later... When I call jQuery fix for Internet Explorer 7 later in the head of the page after the drag and drop panels jQuery, drop down panels jQuery works fine, but the drag and drop panels stop working. And when I call Internet Explorer 7 later fix jQuery before the drag and drop panels, then the panels work fine but the drop down doesn't works... Its happening only in Internet Explorer 6. CHECK IN IE6 Buttons Working, but Panels Not Working http://global.redhatsalesteam.com/buttons_working/ Panels Working, But Buttons Not Working http://global.redhatsalesteam.com/drags_working/
