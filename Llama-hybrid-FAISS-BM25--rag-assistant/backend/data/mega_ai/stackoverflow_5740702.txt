Thank you all for helping me out. I am now able to display data in the crystal report file using the XSD file. The xsd file has fields which are exactly the same name as mentioned in the select query that is bringing values from DB. The following is the part of the xsd file that contains the field names in the xs:element tag. The datatypes of these fields , also needs to be mentioned. The XSD file name can be kept as desired. The name "Summary_Report_on_portal" and "Summary_Updt" does not correspond to any dataset name in code behind or query fields. It can be kept as per the user's wish. This XSD file needs to be referred into the crystal report, using the Database Expert in the Field Explorer window. The "Summary_Updt" name is visible in the new connections , which can be added to the crystal report. The fields mentioned in the xs:element field are visible for the user to drag and drop into the crystal report. When the user mentions the data source to the crystal report(dataset), the fields in the dataset are matched with the XSD field values. CODE: objBL.Rpt.SetDataSource(objBL.ds_shipment_info.Tables[0]); Hope this is detailed enough. Let me know if anyone wants more info
