Internet Explorer shows error when downloading excel file in SSL site

I get the following error when downloading excel file in SSL site: Internet Explorer cannot download xxxx.aspx from mysite.com. Internet Explorer was not able to open this Internet site. The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be found. Please try again later. After googling, I suspect that it's the problem of the response header. I try the solution in this page and set the header: http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/1020 HttpContext.Current.Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); HttpContext.Current.Response.CacheControl = "private"; But it doesn't work. Any suggestions?
