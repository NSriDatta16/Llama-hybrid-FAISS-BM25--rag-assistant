Bayesian MAP gives a point estimate $\mathbf{w}_{MAP}$ for model parameter $\mathbf{w}$ , which implies $p(\mathbf{w}|\mathbf{t},\cdots) = \left\{\begin{matrix} 1 & \mathbf{w}=\mathbf{w}_{MAP}\\ 0 &\text{o.w.} \end{matrix}\right.$ However, distribution $p(t_*|x_*, \mathbf{w}_{MAP}, \sigma^2)$ is the probabilistic model of target $t_*$ given input $x_*$ and parameters; after eq. (8), paper explicitly says $x$ 's are omitted from the givens of target likelihood $p(t|.)$ , but I think they should have been kept there to avoid confusion. It might also be helpful to remind that $(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{t}) = \{(x_1, t_1),...,(x_n, t_n)\}$ are the observed (input, target) pairs. Paper says when $\mathbf{w}_{MAP}$ is calculated, which would be the same as $\mathbf{w}_{PLS}$ , mean of target distribution will be the same as the deterministic target $t_* = y(x_*; \mathbf{w}_{PLS})$ from Penalized Least Squares. That is, $\mathbb{E}[t|x_*,\mathbf{w}_{MAP}, \sigma^2] = \int tp(t|x_*,\mathbf{w}_{MAP}, \sigma^2)dt = y(x_*; \mathbf{w}_{PLS})$ In summary, in (Penalized) Least Squares, both target and parameters are deterministic. In non-Bayesian and Bayesian MAP, parameter is deterministic but target is probabilistic. In (true) Bayesian, both target and parameters are probabilistic. In full Bayesian, hyper-parameters (parameters of distribution of parameters, e.g. $\alpha$ ) are also probabilistic.
