From jdl's answer, there are some paragraphs there: The client can see everything you store in a session, because it is stored in clear-text (actually Base64-encoded, so not encrypted). So, of course, you don’t want to store any secrets here. To prevent session hash tampering, a digest is calculated from the session with a server-side secret and inserted into the end of the cookie. That means the security of this storage depends on this secret (and on the digest algorithm, which defaults to SHA512, which has not been compromised, yet). So don’t use a trivial secret, i.e. a word from a dictionary, or one which is shorter than 30 characters. Put the secret in your environment.rb: config.action_dispatch.session = { :key => '_app_session', :secret => '0x0dkfj3927dkc7djdh36rkckdfzsg...' } note: I am not sure it is config.action_dispatch.session or config.action_controller.session , or Rails 3.0.1 is suggesting: DEPRECATION WARNING: config.action_controller.session has been deprecated. Please use Rails.application.config.session_store instead.
