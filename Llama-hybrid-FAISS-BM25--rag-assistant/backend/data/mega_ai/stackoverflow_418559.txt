A dirty hack would be to open it in Word and record a macro to grab the last line (which might involve deleting tables etc.) The following VBA code opens the google define result for "stack overflow" and removes the header and footer, leaving only the list of results: Sub getWebpage() Documents.Open FileName:="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&rls=com.microsoft%3A*&q=define%3A+stack+overflow" With Selection .MoveDown Unit:=wdLine, Count:=8, Extend:=wdExtend .Delete Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1 .MoveRight Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1 .EndKey Unit:=wdStory .MoveUp Unit:=wdParagraph, Count:=5, Extend:=wdExtend .Delete Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1 End With End Sub Then grab the result and write it somewhere. EDIT: This is pretty hideous, I just recorded and altered a little bit.
