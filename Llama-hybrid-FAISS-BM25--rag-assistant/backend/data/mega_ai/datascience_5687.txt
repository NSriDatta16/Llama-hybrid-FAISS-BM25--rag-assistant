How to approach automated text writing?

What are the tools, practices and algorithms used in automated text writing? For example, lets assume that I have access to wikipedia/wikinews and similar websites API and I would like to produce article about "Data Science with Python". I believe that this task should be divided into two segments. First would be text mining and second would be text building . I'm more or less aware how text mining is performed and there are lots of materials about it in Internet. However, amount of materials related to automated text building seems to be lower. There are plenty of articles which says that some companies are using it, but there is lack of details. Are there any common ideas about such text building?
