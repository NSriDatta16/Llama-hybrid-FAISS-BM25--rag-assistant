Correlation is linear association, so every nonlinear transformation $G:=\Phi^{-1}\circ F$ changes it in general. For centered $X_1,X_2$:$$E(X_1X_2)\neq E(G(X_1)G(X_2))$$ More details depend on $G$ or $F$. As one can check, the signs of the correlation do (not) change if $G$ is monotonous (increasing) decreasing. For further reading I encourage you to search for publications about copulae.
