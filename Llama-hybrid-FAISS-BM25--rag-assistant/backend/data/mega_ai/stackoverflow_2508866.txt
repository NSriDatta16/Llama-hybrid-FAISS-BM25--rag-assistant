It is only the compiler that converts \n etc to the actual ASCII character when it finds that sequence in a string. If you want to do it for a string that you get from somewhere, you need to manipulate the string directly and replace the string "\n" with a CR/LF etc. etc. If you do that, don't forget that "\\" becomes '\' too. Please never ever use char* buffers in C++, there is a nice std::string class that's safer and more elegant.
