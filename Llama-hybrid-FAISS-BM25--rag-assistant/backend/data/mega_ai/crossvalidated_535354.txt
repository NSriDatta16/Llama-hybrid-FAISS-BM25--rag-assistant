To add to @Alexis's answer, the issue is not with the R package but with null hypothesis testing. When using a null hypothesis test (where we want to reject the null hypothesis and will do so when p is less than some value), then it is impossible to ever accept the null hypothesis - we can only reject it. Specific equivalence tests exist to address this limitation since testing for equivalence is a different statistical question than testing for different (the primary use of null hypothesis tests). One way around this is, of course, the use of equivalence testing, but a more universal approach is also just a Bayesian methodology. While Bayes can be intimidating to get into, the brms package is very familiar to anyone running regression in R. There are many examples and tutorials of using either brms or rstanarm for mediation purposes (e.g., here ), and the bayestestR package gives a very similar layout and function to the mediation package. If you use flat priors (which are the default for brms ), then you actually get the same regression coefficient results as you would with maximum likelihood estimation from standard regression. With the bayestestR package, there is a function that will allow you to request the ROPE (region of practical equivalence) for each coefficient. The ROPE provides an interval of what we would consider practically equivalent to 0 (e.g., coefficients between -0.1 and 0.1 are practically zero). To test whether the direct effect is non-existent, you're hypothesizing that its coefficient is within this ROPE. What you get from a Bayesian mediation that you don't get from frequentist methods is that your summary is probabilistic. In other words, you're not answering with a binary "yes" or "no" as to whether your direct effect is zero; instead, you're able to say the probability that the direct effect is practically zero. You could also consider computing the Bayes factor for the null hypothesis (no effect) against the alternative hypothesis (some effect). The Bayes factor is the ratio of odds favoring one or another hypothesis. The other thing you get from a Bayesian approach is the ability to summarize evidence for and against either the null or alternative hypothesis right out of the box. With more and more helpful packages like brms , it's becoming increasingly easy to default to Bayesian methods for these kinds of flexible methods. While flat priors (technically it needs to be proper uniform priors) get you the same results as maximum likelihood, using flat priors with Bayesian methods is a bit like never driving more than 30mph in a sports car. Still, specifying priors is a vital part of Bayesian methods and gets easier once you've got some Bayes under your belt
