If you have multiple Developer folders, you can drag any of them to the trash without damaging the others. Developer folders are completely standalone. Installing Developer Tools from the download image can also install tools in /usr for Unix-style and makefile-based development. The uninstall-devtools script removes these as well. That, also, should not affect remaining Developer folders.
