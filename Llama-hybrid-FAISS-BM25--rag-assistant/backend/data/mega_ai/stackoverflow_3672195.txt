You can use http://dean.edwards.name/packer/ Check the Base62 encode and Shrink variables boxes to make the JS code hard to read. Then you have Yahoo compressor: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/ And the Google compressor: http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/ The first one is on-line, the 2 last ones need some installation on your machine. But... as the browser needs to understand the javascript it receives, a patient and decided person will be able to reverse engineer it. But the compressors above will discourage many of them.
