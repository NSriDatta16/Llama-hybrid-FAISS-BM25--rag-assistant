I've had the same problem (trying to run a coverage reported on Hudson) and resolved it by removing the "test-compile" goal from the aspectj execution goals. After that both Cobertura and also Emma worked like a charm. My AspectJ section: org.codehaus.mojo aspectj-maven-plugin 1.3 compile test-compile --> 1.6 true true My Cobertura section: org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin 2.4 xml And just in case, my Emma section: org.codehaus.mojo emma-maven-plugin 1.0-alpha-2
