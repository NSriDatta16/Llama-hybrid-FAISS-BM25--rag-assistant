You could try these. One of them is bound to work! Reset Visual Studio. Running this in the .NET Command Prompt should do it: devenv /resetsettings This will reset Visual Studio back to factory settings and you should have your missing icons back. Open up Import/Export Settings in the Tools menu and reset to General Development Settings. Use the Customize option in the Tools menu and see if you can drag the features back in place. Uninstall Visual Studio. Next, remove all the related registry keys that may not have been removed automatically. For example: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio Re-install Visual Studio and you should have the defaut layout back.
