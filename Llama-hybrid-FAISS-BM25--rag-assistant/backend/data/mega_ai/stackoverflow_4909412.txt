You need NOT and one of AND or OR to be able to do all binary logic. This is DeMorgan's Law , basically. However, this is not sufficient for Turing completeness. For that you also need random (or reducably equivalent) access (theoretically) infinite memory. Odds are, you'll be able to build a flip flop (a D flip flop is built using NANDs, so it's straightforward) using the available logic gates. From those, you can build a register, and with enough of those you'll be equipped to build some simple programs.
