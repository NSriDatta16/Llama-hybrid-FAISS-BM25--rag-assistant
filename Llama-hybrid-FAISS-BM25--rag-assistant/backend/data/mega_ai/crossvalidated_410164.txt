First, I note that you used method = "ML" . That is fine for model comparisons, but when it comes time to do post hoc comparisons of means, I recommend re-fitting with method = REML" because this reduces biases in the estimates of the fixed effects. Second, a graph of the full model is really useful for understanding the nature of the interaction and whether it can be set aside. fullR Note that the C level of F comes out as the highest, intermediate, and lowest prediction, depending on the level of E . It seems like not a good idea then to average over E to obtain estimated marginal means for F , and comparisons thereof. Instead, we should compare them separately for each E : emm (Results not shown to save space)
