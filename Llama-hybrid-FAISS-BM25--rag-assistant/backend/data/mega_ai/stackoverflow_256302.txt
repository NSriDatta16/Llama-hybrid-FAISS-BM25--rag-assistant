I'm not entirely sure you can by using the table structure you suggest in your query. The only way I can think of is to get the top 10 by way of highest average hits per day. By doing that, your query becomes: SELECT *, AVG(hits / DATEDIFF(NOW(), created)) as avg_hits FROM entries WHERE is_published = 1 GROUP BY id ORDER BY avg_hits DESC LIMIT 10 This query assumes your created field is of a DATETIME (or similar) data type.
