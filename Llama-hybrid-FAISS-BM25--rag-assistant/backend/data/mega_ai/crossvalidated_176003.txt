Testing for Partial Structural Break in R

I want to test for a partial unknown structural break in a time series. By this I mean that I want to test $H_0: \beta_{1} = \beta_{2}$ such that $Y_t = \beta_{0}^{'}X_t + \beta_{1}^{'}Z_t(t T) + e_t)$. Intuitively, this is accomplished by rolling a Wald Statistic over the data. However, in R I can not find a way to do this. Both strucchange::Fstats and gap::chowtest appear to only test the case of a full structural break (i.e. $Y_t = \beta_{1}^{'}Z_t(t T) + e_t$. Is there a way to test a partial structural break in R? I think my best solution will be to roll aod::wald.test over the sample and obtain the critical values from Andrew (1993).
