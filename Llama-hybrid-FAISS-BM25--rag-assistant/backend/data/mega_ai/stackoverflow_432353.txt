If you are using jQuery already then you should leverage the "data" method which is the recommended method for storing arbitrary data on a dom element with jQuery. To store something: $('#myElId').data('nameYourData', { foo: 'bar' }); To retrieve data: var myData = $('#myElId').data('nameYourData'); That is all that there is to it but take a look at the jQuery documentation for more info/examples.
