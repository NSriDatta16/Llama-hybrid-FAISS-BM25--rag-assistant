According to Wikipedia , A state $i$ is accessible from a state $j$ (written $j\to i$) if a system started in state $j$ has a non-zero probability of transitioning into state $i$ at some point. A state $i$ is essential if for all $j$ such that $i \to j$ it is also true that $j \to i$. A state $i$ is said to be transient if, given that we start in state $i$, there is a non-zero probability that we will never return to $i$. A Markov chain with an essential transient state can be constructed from three states $i,j,k$ for which $i\to j$, $j\to i$, $j\to k$, and $k$ never returns to $i$. The transition $j\to k$ guarantees $i$ is transient. The transition matrix is $$\pmatrix{0 & 1 & 0\\ 1-\rho & 0 & \rho \\ 0 & 0 & 1}$$ for some number $\rho$ with $0\lt \rho \lt 1$. It is the chance of never returning to $i$ when starting at $i$.
