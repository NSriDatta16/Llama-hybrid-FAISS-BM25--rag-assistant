The problem is not in your neural network. It's in your data. Often times people treat neural networks as a magical way of solving every problem. Yet, before inputting data to neural networks, much preprocessing is usually used to remove noise, highlit some features, etc., in data. For your problem, you should preprocess your data as well. The first solution that comes to mind is to use Fast Fourier Transform to remove noise. Take a look at this post on how this is done. Also there are numerous other noise removal techniques that you can use.
