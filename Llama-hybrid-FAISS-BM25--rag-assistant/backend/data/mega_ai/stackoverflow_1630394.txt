The error relates to moving an object onto a part of the screen that is not visible. For instance a comment or a graph object. In this case, having autofilter on means that each column contains a combo box, as can be seen in ActiveSheets.Shapes . Something about adding or removing the new columns is obviously changing the behaviour, but it is not clear to me why. Hopefully there is a better solution, but I have managed come up with this workaround which works even if it is not elegant. Turn of AutoFilter Remove all shapes from sheet Do Processing Turn AutoFilter back on again which in VBA looks like If ActiveSheet.AutoFilterMode = True Then ActiveSheet.AutoFilterMode = False Dim s As Shape For Each s In ActiveSheet.Shapes s.Delete Next End If Do something interesting here... If autoFilter = True Then rng.autoFilter End If
