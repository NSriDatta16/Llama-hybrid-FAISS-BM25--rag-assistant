I did something similar to this for http://bookmarkchamp.com - there I wanted to detect when a user copied something into an HTML field. The implementation I came up with was to check the field constantly to see if at any time there was suddenly a whole lot of text in there. In other words: if once milisecond ago there was no text, and now there are more than 5 chars... then the user probably pasted something in the field. If you want to see this working in Bookmarkchamp (you need to be registered), paste a URL into the URL field (or drag and drop a URL in there).
