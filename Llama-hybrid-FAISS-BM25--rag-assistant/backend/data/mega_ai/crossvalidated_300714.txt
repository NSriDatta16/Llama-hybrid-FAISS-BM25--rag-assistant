I'm a PhD candidate in Computational Neuroscience and I work with this kind of software and stuff every day. We also have many students coming in and doing their projects in this field. So I have a bit of experience. Is it reasonable for someone with shallow knowledge in math but programming skills to dive into neural network/machine learning studies? Yes, it is. You can use high level abstractions like Keras and get started right away. In my opinion you do not need to know the exact dynamics of the ANN to use it. As with everything it depends highly on you and how much time and effort you want to invest. I'd say that you need a bit of math to understand the basics of it. An example is the activation functions in a neural net . They play a crucial role but are simple to understand. If you want to get to the depths of it and really understand how and why it works you'll need pretty extensive math skills. There is no way around that. What I mean are advanced probability theory, advanced calculus and advanced algebra. For example, take a look at the Backpropagation Algorithm. . For more about maths in machine learning you can read this blog post. Is it possible to build interesting projects in this area, like those playing atari, using only high-level tools? Yes, it is. There are many great tools out there that allow you to do this. Of course as soon as you'd try to program something new you would hit your limits quite soon, for example, if you wanted to modify a neural network or an algorithm such that it improves or gets faster. As for Atari I suggest you read this nice blog post. It explains everything in such a detail that you can implement it but still shallow enough to understand it. So to add to the other answers: I've seen students coming in with low/basic maths skills but good programming skills and they were all able to implement, test and run a solid machine learning pipeline. Here a pipeline means gathering data, preprocessing, training and evaluation of the system as a whole. So, yes, you can do it.
