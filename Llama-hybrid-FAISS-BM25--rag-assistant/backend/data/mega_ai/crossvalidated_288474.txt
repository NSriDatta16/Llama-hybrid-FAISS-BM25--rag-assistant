Inference Statistics for Neural Networks

Linear regression has been around for quite some time and has developed a set of statistics for measuring its performance like $p$-values, $R^2$, $F$-statistic, and so on, in order to catch internally inconsistent/poorly performing models. These statistics have been generalized to logistic regression and general GLM models. However, when it comes to most machine learning packages, these statistics aren't included in favor of CV/OOS backtesting. In fact, most packages do not even bother to support these statistics at all. Why is that the case? Is there any software or even research in existence to support this kind of ability to do model selection?
