The IV doesn't actually seem to do anything, which concerns me. Why's that? An initialization vector is rather important - particularly when encrypting lots of small fragemnts of data. Somethnig is amiss if the encrypted data is not modified by the IV. And if you're storing the encryption key on the same filesystem as the encrypted data, it's just security by obscurity.
