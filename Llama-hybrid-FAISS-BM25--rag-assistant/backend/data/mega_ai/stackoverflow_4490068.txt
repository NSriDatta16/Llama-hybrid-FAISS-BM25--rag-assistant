If the issue is to target the clicked image you should replace the #frame img with this var test = 5; $(function() { $('#frame img').live('mousedown', function(event) { test = test + 15; $(this).rotate({ angle: test }); }); }); If you are using draggables and droppables from the jquery UI, then you will need to show us some code. ( The most likely is that you do not actually relocate in the DOM the dropped element to be physically in the droppable area. ) update The issue is that the plugin replaces the image with a canvas object and wraps it in a span which assumes the id/class of the element.. Solution is to target not the actual img tag but a class on it. So add a class to your img elements that you want rotatable and target that with your live method $('#frame .rotatable').live(...) . Keep using the $(this).rotate(...) to apply the rotations.
