Wikipedia (emphasis mine): For a univariate data set X1, X2, ..., Xn, the MAD is defined as the median of the absolute deviations from the data's median Since you have observed values in your scenario, you are likely looking for something along the lines of Mean Absolute Error or Root Mean Square Error . EDIT: (additional clarification from comments below) For a univariate data set, MAD is a measure of the variability (i.e. what is the "average" deviation from the "average" value, using the median function to determine averages). So as you compute it the first way, it tells you the variability among your errors, which isn't necessarily meaningful as a measure of how well your model fits. In the latter way, you are computing something very close to MAE, but using median instead of the mean. This is a valid way to determine your goodness of fit, but I don't know why you wouldn't use the more common measures of MAE or RMSE.
