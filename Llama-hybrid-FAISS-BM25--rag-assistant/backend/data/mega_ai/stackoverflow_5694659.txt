Organize threads in groups and set a different max threads to each group

I'm using Spring ThreadPoolTaskExecutor in order to execute my threads. I want to group my threads in several groups, and that every group will have different max allowed threads. For example, something like this: for (MyTask myTask : myTaskList){ threadPoolTaskExecutor.setMaxThreadsForGroup(myTask.getGroupName(), myTask.getMaxThreads()); threadPoolTaskExecutor.execute(myTask, myTask.getGroupName()); } Somehow the threadPoolTaskExecutor should know to allow only myTask.getMaxThreads() to every group named myTask.getGroupName(), and the max threads in all tasks all together should not exceed what defined for threadPoolTaskExecutor in the applicationContext.xml is it possible to do it in simple way? Thanks
