Inferring effect & effect modification from simulation data

I have a "black box" system (computer simulation), which takes inputs: $x_1 \in [0,1]$ , $x_2 \in [0,1]$ , and $N_i$ others $\vec\theta = \{\theta_1, \dots, \theta_{N_i}\}$ , and produces an output $y \in [0,1]$ . I know that for fixed $x_2$ and $\vec\theta$ , $y$ is monotonic increasing in $x_1$ , and similarly for fixed $x_1$ and $\vec\theta$ , $y$ is monotonic increasing in $x_2$ . Both relationships could be approximated as linear or with a low-order spline, and there should be no intercept ( $x_1=0$ and $x_2=0$ implies $y=0$ ). The other inputs $\vec\theta$ should really only act as effect modifiers, not independent predictors of $y$ . I'd like to infer a) the expected effect of $x_1$ , $x_2$ on $y$ over a known range of $\theta$ ; and b) whether this effect is modified by any elements of $\vec\theta$ . Questions What statistical model should I use? What sampling strategy for $x_1$ , $x_2$ , and $\vec\theta$ should I use to best support the model? I can get ~1000s of samples easily. Current Approach I get $N_j$ samples of $\vec\theta$ using latin-hypercube sampling to get good coverage of the space. Then, for each sample $\vec\theta_j$ , I use latin-hypercube sampling again to get $N_k$ samples of $(x_1,x_2)_{jk}$ . Running the simulation for each complete sample, I get $N_j \times N_k$ values of $y_{jk}$ , where $\vec\theta$ is shared across $k$ . Then, I use a GEE GLM model, with "ID" = $j$ , and the following equation: $$y = \beta_{1,0}~x_1 + \sum_i\beta_{1,i}~x_1\theta_i + \beta_{2,0}~x_2 + \sum_i\beta_{2,i}~x_2\theta_i + \beta_{1,2}~x_1x_2$$ ( $jk$ omitted for clarity). From this approach, the value and significance of the parameters $\beta_{1,0}$ , $\beta_{2,0}$ , and $\beta_{1,2}$ allow me to answer (a), and likewise the interaction terms $\beta_{1,i}$ , $\beta_{2,i}$ , $\dots$ allow me to answer (b). Is this a valid / efficient strategy? Thanks, Bonus: Plot If helpful, here is a plot of $y$ vs $x_1$ (left) and $y$ vs $x_2$ (right), coloured by the value of a particular $\theta_i$ .
