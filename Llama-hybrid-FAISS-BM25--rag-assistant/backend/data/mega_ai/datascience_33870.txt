There is a method that can handle multiple types of data simulataneously called Generalized Low Rank Models - actually one paper that deals with it is called PCA on a Data Frame . GLRMs in Python (and not only Python) are implemented in H2O. Other than that you could try encoding your categorical data as numeric. There are multiple approaches to this. One example is mean encoding - see this answer for details. For implementation see Category Encoders . BTW if your task is totally unsupervised (you don't have any target) you can choose any continuous feature you have for mean encoding (so you can produce many columns from each categorical column).
