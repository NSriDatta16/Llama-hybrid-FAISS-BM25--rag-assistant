I attended a course in machine-learning last semester. The cognitive science chair at our university is very interested in symbolic machine learning (That's the stuff without mathematics or statistics ;o)). I can recommend two outstanding textbooks: Machine Learning (Thomas Mitchell) Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Russel and Norvig) The first one is more focused on machine learning, but its very compact has got a very gentle learning curve. The second one is a very interesting read with many historical informations. These two titles should give you a good overview (All aspects of machine learning not just symbolic approaches), so that you can decide for yourself which aspect you want to focus on. Basically there is always mathematics involved but I find symbolic machine learning easier to start with because the ideas behind most approaches are often amazingly simple.
