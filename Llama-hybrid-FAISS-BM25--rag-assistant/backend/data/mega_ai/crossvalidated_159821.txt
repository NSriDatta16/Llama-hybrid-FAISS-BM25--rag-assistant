transitive property in statistical comparisons

I want to know if the exposure to a given dose of a toxic chemical alters the concentration of a given substance in blood in my animals. I make this super general, bear with me, because I think this is a general question. I have 100 individuals at the beginning of the trial. I then randomly select 10 individuals and measure them as the initial, pre-exposure value. Then I introduce the toxic compound and 10 minutes later I measure another 10 individuals (this is my "during exposure" value because my organisms are reacting). I wait another 10 minutes (the effect is no supposedly gone) and measure another set of 10 individuals. So at the end of the experiment I have measured 30 different animals. One factor ANOVA yields significant differences and I use tukey to know which is different from which. To my surprise I get something I can not interpret in a straightforward manner. The measured variable gets lower during exposure and then goes back to values similar to the pre-exposure state. See the plot here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/euzrqdccyyxd3xw/is%20this%20recovery.jpg?dl=0 But when I see the posthoc letters, in my mind there are two competing explanations: 1) The variable recovers: because the post-exposure values are statistically equivalent to those at the beginning. 2) The variable does not recover: because the post-exposure values are statistically equivalent to those during the exposure (which in turn are statistically different from the pre-exposure values!!). So, in math A=B and B=C therefore A=C. But does this work also in statistical comparisons??? I can't figure out if this is just a paradox and which is the appropriated interpretation (if any).
