Show an Alert Builder from a non-activity

I'm trying to show an alert dialog with my application from a non-activity. So the hard thing here is that I want to do it not in an activity but in my general application class. public class AppName extends com.github.droidfu.DroidFuApplication { public static long TIME_CONTENT_UPDATE = 60; //half hour Handler mHandler = new Handler(); @Override public void onCreate() { super.onCreate(); intent = new Intent(this, VSSyncController.class); setupTimer(); } private void setupCatalogTimer() { final Context con = this; //A handler runs on a separate thread mHandler = new Handler(new Handler.Callback() { public boolean handleMessage(Message msg) { showMyAlertDialog(con) mHandler.sendEmptyMessageDelayed(0, TIME_CONTENT_UPDATE); return true; } }); } } Basically I want to show an alert dialog from there, but I need to have a way to figure out which and IF there is any activity in the foreground, so I can call it from there. How can I possible do it? Thanks!
