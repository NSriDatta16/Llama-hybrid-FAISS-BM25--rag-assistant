The best link I've found on this issue yet is at Delay's Blog . He starts by saying "This code [...] and is specifically targeted at scenarios where an application wants to allow the user to drag an element to a folder and create a file (or files) dynamically on the drop/paste. The standard .NET APIs for drag-and-drop don't support this scenario [...]" Wow, that's the answer. For all the problems I have with C# and .NET, I run into yet another obstacle. He does have some code to workaround this. I'll be checking that out.
