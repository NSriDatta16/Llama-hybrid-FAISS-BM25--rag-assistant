Every equation has many equivalent forms. The trick here is to choose a form that supports the most intuitive understanding for you . For me , the most intuitive form is not Pearson's classic equation (although it is undoubtedly the most elegant), but an equivalent form that includes a different mix of terms: $$ \begin{align} \chi^2 &= \sum \frac{\left(x_{i}-m_{i}\right)}{m_{i}}^2 \\ &= \sum \frac{\left(x_{i}-np_{i}\right)}{np{i}}^2 \\ &= \sum \frac{\left(x_{i}-np_{i}\right)}{np{i}\left(1-p_{i}\right)}^2\left(1-p_{i}\right) \\ &= \sum Z_{i}^2\left(1-p_{i}\right) \\ \end{align} $$ Where $n$ = the sample size, $Z$ = a standardized observation, and $p$ = the probability associated with that observation. Now, it helps my understanding to consider that last arrangement as the starting point of our intuition in which case the new question becomes: "why do we multiply $Z_{i}^2$ by $\left(1-p_{i}\right)$ ?". To answer this, consider a multinomial distribution with three variables. We can plot this distribution on a 3D scatter where each axis represents $Z_{i}$ . Here, all the data resides perfectly on a 2D plane, and the contours of the distribution are often elliptical (when looking at the 2D plane from directly above): Now, if we multiply the values along each axis by $\sqrt{\left(1-p_{i}\right)}$ (represented by $T_{i}$ in the chart below) then it has the effect of transforming the elliptical distribution into a circular distribution: Moreover, this distribution is standardized in that its two principal component axes (not shown) represent independent standard normal variables (and from this we can construct the chi-square distribution for k=2). So, what Pearson discovered in his chi-square equation was a "recipe" for transforming the original axes such that the resulting distribution is circular in shape (spherical in higher dimensions), and standardized. And it just so happens that $Z_{i}^2\left(1-p_{i}\right)$ reduces to the classic form posted in your question. I too have been curious about the intuition behind the test and I've captured some insights in this post .
