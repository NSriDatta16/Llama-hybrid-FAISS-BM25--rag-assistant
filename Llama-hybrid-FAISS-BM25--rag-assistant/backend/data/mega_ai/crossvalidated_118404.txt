Bootstrapping coxph after model averaging

I have selected 7 coxph models using AIC, and did model averaging to obtain model averaged parameter estimates. I wanted to plot the survival curve from the averaged model, and I found someone with my problem, whose answer was given by Terry Therneau: You can fit a Cox model with fixed coefficients. Assume "fixbeta" are the coefficients from your model averaging, then do ffit The standard errors in sfit are incorrect of course. One could bootstrap the entire model creation process to get accurate values. My question is: how do I "bootsrap the entire model creation process" using R?
