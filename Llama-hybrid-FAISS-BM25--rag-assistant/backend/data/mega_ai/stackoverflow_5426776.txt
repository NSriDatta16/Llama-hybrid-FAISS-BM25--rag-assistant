Do you want to have a collection of all nodes flattened (IEnumerable allNodes)? If so, after a quick look at the post you linked, I think that both solutions are OK. If the cosiderations LukeH mentions don't apply to your case, I would stick to LINQ solution because of its clarity, but it's up to you. Caching is easy if you don't modify your structure. It gets very complicated if addition and deletions take place. Anyway, what do you want to achieve with caching? Have the descendants count cached? Descendants themselves? On which level? Root level or any level? If you have an abstract class, it would be more elegant to make its methods abstract rather than virtual throwing exceptions or returning empty collections. PS. The class diagram is not synchronized with the code (i.e. placement of Duration property)
