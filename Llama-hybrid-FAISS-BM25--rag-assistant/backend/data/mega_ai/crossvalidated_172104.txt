Is it OK to use the average of regression coefficients to generate a curve for missing data?

I am trying to generate a option volatility skew curve for a stock with only a couple of strikes. Given the lack of sufficient data to generate a curve, I would like instead to fall back on the data I have for other more liquid stocks with many strikes. In essence I have an equation for a given group of names, say IBM, DELL, HP, MSFT, AAPL where the equation is in the form: $$ vol = ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+\rm constant $$ I want to use the above data for a startup tech company that has only traded one strike (I have only one data point). How can I best use the information from the 5 good names to build a "best guess" 4th order curve for the startup? Is it simply a matter of averaging the a,b,c,d and constant terms?
