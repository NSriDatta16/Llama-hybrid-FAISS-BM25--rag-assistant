Model Name Conflict

I have a model by the name Filter but due to the changes in reorganizing the filters from 2.0.3, it is conflicting with the ActionController::Filters::Filter (class) In my filters_controller.rb when I try to find the filter Filter.find(:id) as rails is infering the ActionController::Filters::Filter class rather than my model class Filter. Is there any work around other than renaming my model? BTW: If I use ActiveRecord::Base::Filter.find(:id) to load my filter object, its working, but I am not quite sure if there are any unforseen implications by doing this, when rails try to unload/reload constants. Thanks in advance.
