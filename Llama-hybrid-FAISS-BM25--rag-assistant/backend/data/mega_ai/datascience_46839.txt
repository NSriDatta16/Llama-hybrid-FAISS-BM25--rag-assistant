Occam Razor is just a synonym to Parsimony principal. (KISS, Keep it simple and stupid.) Most algos work in this principal. In above question one has to think in designing the simple separable boundaries, like in first picture D1 answer is B. As it define the best line separating 2 samples, as a is polynomial and may end up in over-fitting. (if I would have used SVM that line would have come) similarly in figure 2 D2 answer is B.
