Well, you can check whether it's a valid C# identifier. If it isn't, that's a pretty good indicator that it's an automatic property. Indeed, if you know that it will have been compiled by a particular version of a particular compiler, you could rely on the naming pattern. Sounds a bit fragile though. More robustly, if you just want to know whether it's compiler-generated, check whether the FieldInfo has the CompilerGeneratedAttribute applied to it. Now there are other times when the compiler will generated extra fields for you - such as for caching delegates created with lambda expressions which don't need any extra context - but it at least shows that it's not a field explicitly declared by the developer (unless they've also explicitly applied the attribute, of course).
