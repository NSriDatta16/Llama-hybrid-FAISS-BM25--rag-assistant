McNemar's test isn't the only way to test the association between treatment and a binary outcome in matched data. You can simply run a logistic regression of the outcome on treatment and use a cluster-robust standard error that accounts for the paired nature of the data. This procedure is recommended by Abadie and Spiess (2022) who prove that it is valid. This is explained in MatchIt 's estimating effects vignette . There are a number of benefits to using a regression framework: you can include covariates in the model, you can compute a specific quantity rather than just a p-value, and you can compute a confidence interval around that quantity.
