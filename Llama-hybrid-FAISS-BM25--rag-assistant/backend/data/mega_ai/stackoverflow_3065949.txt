Combine Hibernate class with @Bindable for SwingBuilder without Griffon?

I have implemented a back-end for my application in Groovy/Gradle, and am now trying to implement a GUI. I am using Hibernate for my data storage (with HSQLDB) per http://groovy.codehaus.org/Using+Hibernate+with+Groovy (with Jasypt for encryption) and it is working quite well. I was wondering if there are any good tips for using @Bindable with, e.g., an @Entity class such as @Entity class Book { @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) public Long id @OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL) public Set authors public String title String toString() { "$title by ${authors.name.join(', ')}" } } or if I am: (i) asking for Griffon (ii) completely on the wrong track? Thank you! Misha
