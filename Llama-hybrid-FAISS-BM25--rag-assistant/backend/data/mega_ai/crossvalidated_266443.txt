Comparison of 2 glm logit models (anova.drc, F, Chisq, or Odds Ratio)

I would like to compare two logit models. One is a mixture of chemicals 'x' and 'y', the other is a model of just 'x'. I need help interpreting the 3 types of anova presented in the code/graphic below However.. *A similar, but more complex situation: I would eventually like to compare independent tests of chemicals x and y, with a mixture of x and y. objective: look for possible synergistic effects (whether mixture is more potent, than either isolated chemical) Would averaging the independent tests (x+y)/2 , making a model from averaged values, and then comparing this to a model made from the results of a true mixture of xy be folly? Additional /supporting information can be found at bottom of post #I prefer to use drc to create the glm library(drc) mod2 output: Data: mydata10 Supporting info: when comparing the models with anova.drc the log likelihoods are negative values, with a p of 0. When calculated with the argument anova(mod2, mod10, test="F") , the RSS (?) are positive values and the p is .1322. Which test should I use? Or would it be better to just compare the odd's ratios or some other method, e.g. (exp(coef(mod2)) - exp(coef(mod10)) ? Plos1 article from drc author: Supporting Info Describes the use drc's anova with some examples From the anova.drc Cran page it seems anova.drc should only be used to test nested models, but I am not certain of this - in the results below you can see it produces the same result as anova(mod2, mod10, test="Chisq"). From anova.drc Cran page" Specifying only a single object gives a test for lack-of-fit, comparing the non-linear regression model to a more general one-way or two-way ANOVA model. If two objects are specified a test for reduction from the larger to the smaller model is given. (This only makes statistical sense if the models are nested, that is: one model is a submodel of the other model.) stackoverflow recommends against use of r^2 stats.stackexchange thread recommended anova,test="Chisq" to compare 2 glm models Apologies for strange formatting , Unable to post more than 2 links due to no reputation, apologies - I normally just use stackoverflow.
