The intuition is correct at its basis. I'll try to answer in brief and intuitive way as well- Those sub populations necessarily exists because you hold them constant by: (a) sampling your subjects with regard to your speculated covariates OR (b) you put a constraint on its variability (i.e. variance = 0). This is done by taking 1 group (e.g. men only, blonds only, etc.) if its categorical variable or by taking an average of a given covariate (age, education, income and so on).
