I believe I understand your goals, however it isn't as easy as you believe it should be. The first instinct is to add an Activity to your solution (Add => New Item => Workflow => Actvity), and drag other Activities onto the design surface. This will create reusable workflows, unfortunately they will not have any Designer associated with them. So, when another user attempts to drag these workflows from the toolbox and use them in a workflow in a different solution, they'll get something like this: That isn't exactly useful. An alternative is to create a custom Activity that implements IActivityTemplateFactory . This type (I believe*) can be added to the Toolbox. When they are dragged onto the design surface, the Create method is called. Within this method, you can construct whatever workflow you want and return it. This activity tree will be added to the workflow so that all activities within it are visible. *You may also have to extend Activity in order for it to show in the Toolbox; I'm not sure about that. Think of the Activity being a dummy which actually is never used.
