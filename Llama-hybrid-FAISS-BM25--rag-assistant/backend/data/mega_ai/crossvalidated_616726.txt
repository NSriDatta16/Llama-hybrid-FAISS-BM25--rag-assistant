Fitting a nonlinear model for a CDF

I have two questions in general here. Suppose I am recording data in time and the response that I am collecting is a monotonic curve that goes from 0 to 1 (sort of a like a CDF). I was thinking of modeling the data as such but when I think of it from the regression framework it is like a modeling a nonlinear function, i.e., a model like: $$y_i(t) = \Phi\left(\frac{t - \mu}{\sigma}\right) + \epsilon_i(t)$$ where $\Phi$ might be the CDF of the standard normal, and $\epsilon$ an error ter that follows some distribution. If I wanted to fit this model, i.e., estimate the parameters of the model, do I need to use some sort of nonlinear regression procedure in a software? And is a model like this typical in the literature? Secondly, if this type of model does exist in the literature, is there something similar in the Bayesian world?
