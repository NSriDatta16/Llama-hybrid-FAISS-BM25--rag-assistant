Aggregation also works without using zoo (with random data from 2 variables for 3 days and 4 hosts like from JWM). I assume that you have data from all hosts for each hour. nHosts I'm not entirely sure if you want to average just within each hour, or within each hour over all days. I'll do both. Data$hFac The result looks like this: > head(res1) hour hosts x1 x2 1 0 host1 9.578431 2.049020 2 1 host1 10.200000 2.200000 3 2 host1 10.423077 2.153846 4 3 host1 10.241758 1.879121 5 4 host1 8.574713 2.011494 6 5 host1 9.670588 2.070588 > head(res2) hFac hosts x1 x2 1 2011-01-01 00:00:00 host1 9.192308 2.307692 2 2011-01-01 01:00:00 host1 10.677419 2.064516 3 2011-01-01 02:00:00 host1 11.041667 1.875000 4 2011-01-01 03:00:00 host1 10.448276 1.965517 5 2011-01-01 04:00:00 host1 8.555556 2.074074 6 2011-01-01 05:00:00 host1 8.809524 2.095238 I'm also not entirely sure about the type of graph you want. Here's the bare-bones version of a graph for just the first variable with separate data lines for each host. # using the data that is averaged over days as well res1L The same graph for the data that is only averaged within each hour. res2L
