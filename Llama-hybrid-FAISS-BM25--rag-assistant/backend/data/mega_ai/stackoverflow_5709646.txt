All I would say, is that obviously Romain guy is correct about using drawables to keep xml files in and then moving image resources into the relevant mdpi, hdpi and ldpi folders, the only time I'd go against this is when you wish to target 1.5 devices. The reason for this is that because 1.5 has no recognition for the -hdpi, -mdpi and -ldpi tags, it ignores them and picks resources (seemingly randomly) from each folder, so instead you have to add the following flag -hdpi-v4, -mdpi-v4, -ldpi-v4, this will then make those folders accessible by 1.6+ versions of Android forcing 1.5 to only see the drawable folder, at which point you need to have all your resources in drawable, which then removes the need to have the drawable-mdpi folder. However, since 1.5 is getting on a bit and such few devices have it, it makes more sense to target 1.6+ and ignore this complication.
