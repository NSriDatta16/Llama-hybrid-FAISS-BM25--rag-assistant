There are situations where you need the stack, others where you need the heap, others where you need the static storage, others where you need the const memory data, others where you need the free store. The stack is fast, because allocation is just an "increment" over the SP, and all "allocation" is performed at invocation time of the function you are in. Heap (or free store) allocation/deallocation is more time expensive and error prone.
