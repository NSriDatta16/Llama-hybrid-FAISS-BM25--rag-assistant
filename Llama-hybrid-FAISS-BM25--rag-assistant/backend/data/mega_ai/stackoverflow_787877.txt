Our development team all individually tweet, but we also have a Twitter account which represents the team as a whole. Usage is not completely settled yet, but so far we've tried: Announcing deployments ("just pushed 2.0.2737 to production. details at http://tinyurl.org/12345 ") Automated updates for long-running tools ("Phoenix migration is 23% done and currently averaging 13s/unit. Expect to finish 5-7-09" We've tried to focus on information that our customers care about. A useful Twitter service has to strike a delicate balance of too little and too much information. For things that happen frequently, like continuous integration builds, we just email internally. That's something every team member needs to know and the audience is well-defined, so we can push that. Things like production pushes have a much broader audience with a wide range of interest level, so a passive service like Twitter is ideal for providing that information to the people who care, at their convenience.
