To estimate $VaR$ of the one-step-ahead return (which is what you seem to need to do) you should do the following ($E_t$ denotes the conditional expectation given the values of the time series up to and including the moment $t$ have been observed): Compute the forecast of the mean. In your case of $AR(p)$ process you should do the following: $$r_{t+1|t} = E_t(r_{t+1}) = E_t( \delta + \sum^p_{k=1} \phi_k r_{t+1-k} + \sigma_{t+1} \epsilon_{t+1})$$ which reduces to $r_{t+1|t} = \delta + \sum^p_{k=1} \phi_k r_{t+1-k}$, since $\epsilon_{t+1}$ has zero mean, and $\sigma^2_{t+1}$ is known given the observations up to $t$. In your case $$r_{t+1|t} = \delta + \phi_1 r_t$$ The volatility forecast is $\sigma^2_{t+1|t} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \hat{z}^2_t + \beta \sigma^2_t$ where $\hat{z}_t = r_t - \delta - \phi_1 r_{t-1}$, and can be obtained similarly. Now to get $VaR$ at the moment $t+1$, given the history up to $t$, you should just take the quantile of the standard normal, multiply it by the square root of $\sigma^2_{t+1|t}$ and then add $r_{t+1|t}$: $$VaR = r_{t+1|t} + \sqrt{\sigma^2_{t+1|t}} z_\alpha$$
