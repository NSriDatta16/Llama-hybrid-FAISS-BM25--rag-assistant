 contained 992,316 predictions. In July 2021, UniProt-KB and InterPro has been updated to show AlphaFold predictions when available. On July 28, 2022, the team uploaded to the database the structures of around 200 million proteins from 1 million species, covering nearly every known protein on the planet. Performance, validations and limitations Despite its impressive success, AlphaFold has also shown certain limitations: AlphaFold DB provides models of individual protein chains (monomers), rather than their biologically relevant complexes. Many protein regions are predicted with low confidence score, including the intrinsically disordered protein regions. Alphafold-2 was validated for predicting effects of point mutations on structure and free energy, with a partial success. The model relies, to some extent, on co-evolutionary information from similar proteins. Therefore, it may not perform as well on synthetic proteins or proteins with very low homology to those in the training database. The model's ability to predict multiple native conformations of proteins is limited. AlphaFold 3 version can predict structures of protein complexes with a very limited set of selected cofactors and co- and post-translational modifications. Between 50% and 70% of the structures of the human proteome are incomplete without covalently-attached glycans. AlphaFill, a derived database, adds cofactors to AlphaFold models where appropriate. In the algorithm, the residues are moved freely, without any restraints. Therefore, during modeling the integrity of the chain is not maintained. As a result, AlphaFold may produce topologically wrong results, like structures with an arbitrary number of knots. Applications AlphaFold has been used to predict structures of proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The structures of these proteins were pending experimental detection in early 2020. Results were reviewed by scientists at the Francis Crick Institute in the United Kingdom before being released to the broader research community. The team also confirmed accurate prediction against the experimentally determined SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that was shared in the Protein Data Bank, an international open-access database, before releasing the computationally determined structures of the under-studied protein molecules. The team acknowledged that although these protein structures might not be the subject of ongoing therapeutical research efforts, they will add to the community's understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Specifically, AlphaFold 2's prediction of the structure of the ORF3a protein was very similar to the structure determined by researchers at University of California, Berkeley using cryo-electron microscopy. This specific protein is believed to assist the virus in breaking out of the host cell once it replicates. This protein is also believed to play a role in triggering the inflammatory response to the infection. Published works Andrew W. Senior et al.
