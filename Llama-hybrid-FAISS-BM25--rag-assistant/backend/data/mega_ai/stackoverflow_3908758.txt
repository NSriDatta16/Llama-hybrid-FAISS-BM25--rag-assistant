use of native html elements vs css

I am working on some legacy PHP code that holds a ton of in-line styling, one of our objectives is to leverage CSS so the code will be cleaner. One thing that got me thinking is the use of native html elements VS the use of CSS, such as bold and italics. For example, this is foo Or in css .bold { font-weight: bold;} this is foo While these two do the same thing, which one do you guys prefer and why?
