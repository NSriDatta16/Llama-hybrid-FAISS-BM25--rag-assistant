Quantitative Proteomic Analysis : ANOVA or MANOVA?

So, this may be a really dumb question but I'd rather ask it now than 3 weeks later when I'm neck deep into problems. The title is kind of self-explanatory but I'll expand a bit : I've been tasked of doing Proteomic analysis for one of our team's project. That's already a first for me, and while I've done plenty of basic statistical analysis, I've never done it in such huge dataset. We have 3 groups : Treatment A, Treatment B and Control. For each group, we have n=5 pair of samples. What I mean by that is that the team basically took 2 samples for each 5 individuals of each groups at the same time (imagine if it's a lung biopsy, they would have taken a biopsy from the left lung and from the right lung for each individual). Now, the samples have been processed, they're gonna send me the data matrix and we agreed on the fact that there shouldn't be any difference between samples from the same individual (there is no reason to assume the proteins in the left lung sample would be different from the right lung sample), so I'm going to calculate the average for each individual on each protein. That should be easy enough. The hard part will be the group comparisons. I'll need to know for each protein whether the average quantity is different between group or not. My first thought was ANOVA. I have 3 independant groups and I'm looking at a response variable (the quantity of a given protein). But with the THOUSANDS of proteins that will be compared, I'm not sure anymore. So in the case of a comparisons between 3 groups that involves several response variables, wouldn't a one-way MANOVA be a better fit for such analysis ? Basically the matrix would look like that : | Protein | Group A | Group B | Group C | | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | | Protein 1 | | | | | Protein 2 | | | | | ... | | | | | Protein n | | | | Sorry for rambling (and maybe making it even more confusing for you) and thanks in advance for the answers
