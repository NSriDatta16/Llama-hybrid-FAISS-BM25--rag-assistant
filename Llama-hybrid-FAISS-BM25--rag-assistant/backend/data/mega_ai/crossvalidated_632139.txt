Could classical astronomic discoveries be made using ML?

Imagine that prior to the time of Copernicus, scientists could run machine learning algorithms (somehow). Would it be possible to discover the truth of the geocentric model with their use? Would the machine learning algorithms assist in discovering Kepler's laws of planetary motion? Would they be beneficial for Newton in his discovery of the three laws of motion? The broad goal of this question is to discern how ML techniques are helpful in the scientific process. It is inspired by this stackexhcange reply .
