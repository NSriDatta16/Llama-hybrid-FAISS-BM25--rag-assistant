One option that takes different tack than tabbing subsequent lines would be to set the w flag in formatoptions. When you do that it changes the way Vim identifies new paragraphs, and lines ending in a space are understood to continue on a new line as part of same paragraph. See :h fo-table . If you set the w flag and enter your text so that continued sentence lines are the only ones ending in a space (and abandon completely practice of entering tabs at beginning of any text lines) then I think you should be able to use gqap to format text paragraphs as you want. To get visual cues to logical structure you can then set listchars to display the eol (i.e., ) character and set different highlightings for and for so that sentence/paragraph ends are easily spotted. Another benefit of this method is that you can just type your text naturally and let line breaks be entered automatically by textwidth setting. (Just make sure that LaTeX formatting lines don't break automatically in textwidth area; you want them to have non-space char as last char in line.)
