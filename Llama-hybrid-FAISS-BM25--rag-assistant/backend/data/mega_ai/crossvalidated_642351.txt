Is linear regression still relevant in a mid-level DS interview?

Iâ€™m hiring for a mid-level data scientist with 2~ years of experience. The hire will be writing SQLs, working with stakeholders to define business problems and doing analytics whether an inference problem or predictive modeling. One of our interview tasks is to examine the relationship between two variables in a table with 5 columns in total and quantify the impact of one on the other, which we mostly expect candidates to do EDA, fit a linear regression model, generate a regression table and interpret the statistics. And if they do well in the EDA, they will notice they need to include another covariate, hence fitting a multivariate linear regression, and interpret the statistics there. I have noticed that multiple people with 5+ years of data science experience and advanced projects really struggle with this section, BOTH in generating a regression table, which I can fix by giving them the code to generate the table, AND interpreting the basic statistics (eg, why would the coefficient change for this variable when we add a covariate). My question is do you think linear regression should be a basic skill for a mid-level data scientist and should it be part of the interview? Do you have a better recommendation on how to assess foundational skills of statistics?
