Q_OBJECT throwing 'undefined reference to vtable' error

I'm using Qt Creator 2.0.1 with Qt 4.7.0 (32 bit) on Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit. Consider the following code, which is a minimum to produce the error: class T : public QObject, public QGraphicsItem { Q_OBJECT public: T() {} QRectF boundingRect() const {return QRectF();} void paint(QPainter *painter, const QStyleOptionGraphicsItem *option, QWidget *widget) {} }; int main() { T t; return 0; } The above code fragment causes the following linker errors: In function `T': undefined reference to `vtable for T' undefined reference to `vtable for T' In function `~T': undefined reference to `vtable for T' undefined reference to `vtable for T' If I comment out the line that contains Q_OBJECT , it compiles fine. I need signal and slots with QGraphicsItem so I need Q_OBJECT . What is wrong with the code? Thanks.
