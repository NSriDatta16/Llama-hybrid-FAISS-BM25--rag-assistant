Like Java (which is what C# was indirectly derived from), C# does not support multiple inhertance. Which is to say that class data (member variables and properties) can only be inherited from a single parent base class . Class behavior (member methods), on the other hand, can be inherited from multiple parent base interfaces . Some experts, notably Bertrand Meyer (considered by some to be one of the fathers of object-oreiented programming), think that this disqualifies C# (and Java, and all the rest) from being a "true" object-oriented language.
