As it became clear in the comments that the categorical variable just was a binning of the continuous one , the answer is clear: Only use the continuous variable as a predictor. But beware: assuming that a continuous variable acts linearly in logistic regression, is a strong assumption, so model it with a regression spline, see Logistic Regression with regression splines in R .
