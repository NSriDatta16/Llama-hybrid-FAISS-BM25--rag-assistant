If you are asking about the average rate of success based on $n$ trials and $m$ successes, it would be $m/n$, as you point out. If you are looking for a specific probability model for this experiment, check out the Binomial distribution. If you have $N$ independent trials (in this case a trial is testing an individual processor for success or failure) and $p$ probability of success for each processor, then the average, or mean, success rate is $Np$, which is what you are looking for. See more here . For example, if you knew out of the 100 tests, that 60 passed, your average rate of success is 60%, which is your $p$. Now you can make inferences on the next test. Say the next time you ran the experiment you tested 30 processors. What is the probability that 20 will pass? from scipy.stats import binom prob_success = 0.6 print binom.pmf(20, 30, prob_success) # probability of 20 successes in 30 trials given an average success rate of 60% 0.11518537647948386
