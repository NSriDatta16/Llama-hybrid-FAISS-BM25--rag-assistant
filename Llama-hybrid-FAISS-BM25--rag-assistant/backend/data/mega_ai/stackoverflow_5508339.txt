I highly recommend layering your game. It keeps it organised and neater, reducing the amount of code in any one file. Within cocos2d, there are 3 classes you should take note of to achieve this: CCDirector, CCScene, CCLayer. What you can do is, create multiple layers within a single scene (GameScene).Eg: Have a HUD, Game Interface, Background and Foreground. These can all be split into their separate CCLayers and added together within the CCScene. So now you have split HelloWorld.m into: GameScene.m HudLayer.m GameInterfaceLayer.m Background.m Forground.m After importing all the h files into your GameScene.h, You can then add each Layer to the scene as Follows: @implementation GameScene +(CCScene){ HudLayer *hud = [HudLayer node]; [self addChild: hud z:3]; GameInterfaceLayer *game = [GameInterfaceLayer node]; [self addChild: game z:1]; ...} etc @end Once you do this, if you dont change your AppDelegate, your CCDirector will give you an error. CCDirector basically dictates which Scene is loaded. Change this to point to your GameScene. You can visualise: the Director of the Movie, Filming a Scene, filled with many Layers.
