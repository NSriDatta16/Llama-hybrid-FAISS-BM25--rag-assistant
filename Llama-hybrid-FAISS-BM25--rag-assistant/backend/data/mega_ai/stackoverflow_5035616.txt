I would consider how long the data retrieval takes and then also how often you intend to interrogate the 'intersection' data. If the answer to the former is several seconds and the latter is also (potentially) in seconds then I would strongly consider caching the data retrieved in to a simple database. You can then do the join and save in to a third table or even do the JOIN in the SELECT statement on each request. Doing it on each request should be trivial with a couple of indexes. Shouldn't be any need for a cube. Finally depending on the available attributes you may be able to use a LastModifiedDate/CreationDate or similar to be intelligent about which rows/records you refresh.
