When $t=2$ , both your $D$ 's are zeroes, so equation reduces to $$Y_{it} = \alpha + \gamma X_{it} + \epsilon_{it} $$ Now, see that setting $X_{ij}=0$ leaves only $\alpha$ and error term (that have 0 mean) in you model. So $\alpha$ is a mean of $Y$ for $t=2$ and patients with $X_{ij}=0$ resulting from your model. You asked does the OLS estimate of $\alpha$ capture the effect of $t=2$ (the treatment year) on the average value of $Y$ ? There is no such thing as "effect of $t=2$ ". It is always effect of $t=2$ compared to something (in your case to $t=1$ or $t=3$ ). Let's see effect of $t=2$ compared to $t=1$ . Imagine two patients with the same $X$ , one on $t=2$ other on $t=1$ . Or easier: one patient in $t=1$ and $t=2$ with the same $X$ on those days so for him/her $X_{i1}=X_{i2}$ . Then $Y_{i2}=\alpha+\gamma X_{i2}$ and $Y_{i1}=\alpha+\beta_1+\gamma X_{i1}$ . So $Y_{i2}-Y_{i1}=-\beta_1$ . So effect of $t=2$ compared to $t=1$ is $-\beta_1$ . And, per analogiam, effect of $t=2$ compared to $t=3$ is $-\beta_2$ .
