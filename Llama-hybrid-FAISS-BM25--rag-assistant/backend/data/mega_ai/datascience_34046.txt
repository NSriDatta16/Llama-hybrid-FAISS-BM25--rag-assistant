This is called sequence classification . An approach to attack this problem is to deploy an LSTM-RNN. The key is the preprocessing of the dataset; how you encode a written question into appropriate input for the network. The answer to this is called word embedding and detailed instructions of how to implement it can be found in this tutorial , hope it helps :)
