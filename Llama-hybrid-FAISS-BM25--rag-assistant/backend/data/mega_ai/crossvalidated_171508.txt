Why do we need to use the Markov property in solving this PDE?

Given the PDE $$\frac{\partial G}{\partial t} + 0.5\sigma^2 \frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial x^2} = 0$$ with condition $G(T,x) = x^2$, one can use the Feynman-Kac formula to arrive at $$G(t,x) = E[X_T^2 | X_t = x] = E[ (X_t \pm \sigma(W_T - W_t))^2 |X_t = x] = x^2 + (T-t)\sigma^2$$ where $W_t$ is standard Brownian motion and $X_t$ is the stochastic process satisfying either: $$dX_t = \pm \sigma dW_t$$ where the $X_t$'s and $W_t$'s are in the filtered probability space $(\Omega, \mathscr F, \{\mathscr F_t\}_{t \in [0,t]}, \mathbb P)$ where $\mathscr F_t = \mathscr F_t^W$. I am supposed to evaluate $$E[ (X_t \pm \sigma(W_T - W_t))^2 |X_t]$$ and then later plug in $X_t = x$. Apparently, in evaluating $$E[ (X_t \pm \sigma(W_T - W_t))^2 |X_t]$$ I am to use the Markov property to say that $$E[ (X_t \pm \sigma(W_T - W_t))^2 |X_t] = E[ (X_t \pm \sigma(W_T - W_t))^2 | \mathscr{F_t}]$$ Why exactly do we need to use the Markov property? I know that $W_T - W_t$ is independent of $\mathscr{F_t}$. I think that $\because X_t \in m \mathscr F_t$, $W_T - W_t$ is independent also of $X_t$. If I am wrong, why? If I am right, why is the Markov property needed? The problem seems to be taken from Bjork's Arbitrage Theory in Continuous Time. I got the problem from my class notes. Neither Bjork nor Wikipedia seems to use the Markov property
