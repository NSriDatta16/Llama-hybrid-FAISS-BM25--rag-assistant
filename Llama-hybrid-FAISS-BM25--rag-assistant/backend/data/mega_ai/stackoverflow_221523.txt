sliding UISearchBar

I would like to hide the UISearchBar most of the time and only call it to appear when user wants it. I've put a UISearchBar in Interface Builder and hide it behind a view, when user click a button, it calls the following code, which I hoped it would bring the search bar to the front and slide the keyboard to view. But it doesn't.... - (IBAction)search:(id)sender { [mySearchBar performSelector:@selector(searchBarTextDidBeginEditing:)]; } Anyone have any idea how to activate UISearchBar by code? Thanks. Thanks for your replies. I just post the complete code in case someone's interested - (IBAction)search:(id)sender { mySearchBar.hidden = NO; [mySearchBar becomeFirstResponder]; } #pragma mark UISearchBarDelegate delegate methods // called when keyboard search button pressed - (void)searchBarSearchButtonClicked:(UISearchBar *)searchBar { mySearchBar.hidden = YES; [mySearchBar resignFirstResponder]; // Do something with the mySearchBar.text } // called when cancel button pressed - (void)searchBarCancelButtonClicked:(UISearchBar *)searchBar { mySearchBar.hidden = YES; [mySearchBar resignFirstResponder]; }
