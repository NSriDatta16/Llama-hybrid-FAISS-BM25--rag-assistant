With ideal encryption methods: No. With most real-world encryption methods: No. With some stupidly simple to undo obfuscation method especially designed to allow averaging: Yes. Calling the latter method "encryption" really would be using the wrong term. If you could calculate the average of encrypted numbers without decrypting them, that would make decrypting the original numbers quite a lot easier, so I would be very surprised if this works with any serious encryption algorithm.
