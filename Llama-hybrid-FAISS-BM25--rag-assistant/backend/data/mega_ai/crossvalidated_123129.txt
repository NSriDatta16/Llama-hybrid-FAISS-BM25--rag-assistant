A very clear case (connected with the marginal likelihood approximation mentioned in the first answer) where true convergence is the example of the problem of label switching in mixture models coupled with the use of Chib's (1995) estimator . As pointed out by Radford Neal (1999), if the MCMC chain does not converge correctly, in the sense that it does explore some of the mode of the target distribution, the Monte Carlo approximation of Chib fails to reach the right numerical value.
