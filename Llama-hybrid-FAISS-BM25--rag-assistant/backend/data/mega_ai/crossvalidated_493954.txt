In a Bayesian context, the parameters are random variables, so in that context the density is actually the conditional density of $X \mid (\mu, \sigma)$ . In that setting, the notation is very natural. Outside of a Bayesian context, it is just a way to make it clear that the density depends (here I am using this word colloquially, not probabilistically) on the parameters. Some people use $f_{\mu, \sigma}(x)$ or $f(x; \mu, \sigma)$ to the same effect. This latter point can be important in the context of likelihood functions. A likelihood function is a function of the parameters $\theta$ , given some data $x$ . The likelihood is sometimes written as $L(\theta \mid x)$ or $L(\theta ; x)$ , or sometimes as $L(\theta)$ when the data $x$ is understood to be given. What is confusing is that in the case of a continuous distribution, the likelihood function is defined as the value of the density corresponding to the parameter $\theta$ , evaluated at the data $x$ , i.e. $L(\theta; x) := f_\theta(x)$ . Writing $L(\theta; x) = f(x)$ would be confusing, since the left-hand side is a function of $\theta$ , while the right-hand side ostensibly does not appear to depend on $\theta$ . While I prefer writing $L(\theta; x) := f_\theta(x)$ , some might write $L(\theta; x) := f(x \mid \theta)$ . I have not really seen much consistency in notation across different authors, although someone more well-read than I can correct me if I am wrong.
