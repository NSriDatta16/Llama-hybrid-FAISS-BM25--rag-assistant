Why don't we use normal distribution in every problem?

I was reading about normal distributions and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and I came up with a question. Why do we bother ourselves to use machine learning techniques when the CLT gives us the permission to assume that the mean of our data has a normal distribution? I can understand the usage of deep learning when we have images as data or any other type of data that does not have clear numerical representation. But when it comes to numerical-in-nature data, how can one justify the use of machine learning techniques over the simple statistical tools theoretically?
