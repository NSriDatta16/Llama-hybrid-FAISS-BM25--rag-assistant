How to calibrate models if we don't have enough data?

I am working on random forest classifiation with a dataset size of 977 records and 6 features. However, my class is imbalanced and proportion is 77:23 I was reading about calibration of models (binary classification) to improve/calibrate the predicted probabilities of actually fitted model (RF in this case). However, I also found out that calibration model has to be fit using a different dataset. But the problem is, I already used sklearn train and test split - 680 records for my train and 297 records for my test (of random forest model) Now, how can I calibrate my model (as I don't have any new data) Especially, as I am using Random forest, I wish to calibrate my model for better predicted probabilities? If you ae interested to look at my calibration curve and brier score loss, please find below update - extra trees classifier update - logistic regression update - bootstrap optimisim
