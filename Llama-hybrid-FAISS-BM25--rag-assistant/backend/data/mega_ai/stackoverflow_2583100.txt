Tiled Image for background of DIV is making IE sllllowww when scrolling

Take a look at http://www.pmverge.com at the "We're in Bootstrap Mode" DIV on the right-hand side. Having that background tile image is causing the IE browser (all versions) to drag when scrolling. What can I do to keep that tiled style but not have it slow down IE. background-image: url(http://blog.pmverge.com/assets/images/background.gif) NOTES The tile image is only a few pixels high and wide Yes this is the Stackoverflow.com engine as I'm licensing it. The background watermark image is not slowing the page down (though it has about 50k).
