How to identify too small network in reinforcement learning?

I am using Open AI's code to do a RL task on an environment that I built myself. I tried some network architectures, and they all converge, faster or slower on CartPole. On my environment, the policy seems not to converge, and the reward per episode , or even the average reward per episode keeps flickering forever. I suspect the neural network is too small, but I want to confirm my belief before going the route of researching the architecture. How can I confirm that the architecture is the problem and not anything else in a neural network reinforcement learning task?
