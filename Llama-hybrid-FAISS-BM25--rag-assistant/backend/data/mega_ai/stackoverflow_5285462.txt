Django is actually quite fast. Using caches and multiple DB backends is a doodle - you actually can utilize Django's predefined caching framework for one-line view caching or even template fragment caching. And of course - low-level cache API. And - it's fun! In my experience - deployed under nginx and uWSGI, watched over by Supervisord, with the recently hot Celery task queueing package â€“ Django is blazingly fast, easy to scale and configure and very reliable.
