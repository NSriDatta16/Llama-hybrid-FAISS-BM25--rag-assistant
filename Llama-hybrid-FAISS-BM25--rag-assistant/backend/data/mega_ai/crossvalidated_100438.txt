Setting a proper prior distribution on sigma for Bayesian Regression

I'd like to know how to set a proper prior distribution on sigma when using JAGS in a Bayesian regression. Here is what I have: model{ for( i in 1 : N ) { y[i] ~ dnorm(y_hat[i], tau ) y_hat[i] K is the number of predictor variables I have. If I have a y[i] with known range of 0 to 1 (or any known range), then how could I use that knowledge to change the distribution I've chosen on sigma? It seems a bit crazy to choose a prior distribution like I've done when there's no chance in the world that it would be anywhere close to 10,000.
