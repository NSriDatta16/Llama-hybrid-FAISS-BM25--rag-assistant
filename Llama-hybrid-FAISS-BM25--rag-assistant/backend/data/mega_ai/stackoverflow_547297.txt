How do I capture/log SQL Server 2005 "Attention" events?

This is in reference to this question here: Check Contraint Bypassing CATCH block in Distributed Transaction Apparently in that distributed transaction scenario, an "attention event" is sent to our sql server and is destroying the connection without giving us the opportunity to log the error in a CATCH block. So how can we log "attention" events? We can't have things silently failing in the background! Is there a way to log these events?
