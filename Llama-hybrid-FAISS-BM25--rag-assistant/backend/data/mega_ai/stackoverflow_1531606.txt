Workflow for maintaining local repositories of remote subversion repositories

I understand the importance of using version control and I am trying to learn as much as possible so I can setup SVN for our company web development projects. Right now we all work from a single dev copy and it is messy at best. Many of our users work remotely and the dev server is on a slow internet connection. From what I have read it is good practice for users to each run their own SVN repositories locally to track their own changes, and then sync that with the server repositories. What is the best way to accomplish this? Otherwise, is it better for each user to just have their own working copy of the server repository and only work from that? Since the server is on a slow connection, is it better for each developer (team of 7 at this time) to have their own working copy on the dev server or locally on their machine? I am also looking at GIT on Windows, but SVN is very mature and has plugins for Visual Studio we can leverage.
