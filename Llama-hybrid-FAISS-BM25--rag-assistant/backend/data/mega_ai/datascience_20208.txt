Is Excel sufficient for data science?

I'm in the process of preparing to teach an introductory course on data science using the R programming language. My audience is undergraduate students majoring in business subjects. A typical business undergrad does not have any computer programming experience, but has taken a few classes which use Excel. Personally, I am very comfortable with R (or other programming languages) because I majored in computer science. However, I have the feeling that many of my students will feel wary of learning a programming language because it may seem difficult to them. I do have some familiarity with Excel, and it is my belief that while Excel can be useful for simple data science, it is necessary for students to learn a serious programming language for data science (e.g., R or Python). How do I convince myself and the students that Excel is insufficient for a serious business student studying data science, and that it is necessary for them to learn some programming? Edited in response to comment Here are some of the topics that I will be covering: Data processing and data cleaning How to manipulate a data table, e.g., select a subset of rows (filter), add new variables (mutate), sort rows by columns SQL joins using the dplyr package How to draw plots (scatter plots, bar plots, histograms etc.) using the ggplot2 package How to estimate and interpret statistical models such as linear regression, logistic regression, classification trees, and k-nearest neighbors Because I don't know Excel very well, I don't know whether all of these tasks can be done easily in Excel.
