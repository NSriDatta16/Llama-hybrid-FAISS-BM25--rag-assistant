It is not possible to find out a priori what kind of distribution some data (especially with as low n as in your example) is coming from. If you have an idea of the process that generated your data, you might be able to get an idea of which distributions to test. Maybe your data comes from the family of gamma distributions, maybe your data comes from the family of Weibull distributions etc. Then, you can fit these general distributions and see whether they are likely to simplify to a more common distribution. For a visual representation of how well your data could approximate a certain distribution, you can use PROBPLOT . Once you have identified possible distributions, you can fit them to the data and use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to compare which fit describes the data best. Note that unless you have huge numbers of noise-free data, it is impossible to tell which fit is correct if you have several possible distributions with comparatively low BIC.
