IE8 and jQuery selectors

Today it came to my attention that a combination of jQuery selectors and the addClass() function does not work properly on IE8. For example, when I want to ensure that even-numbered rows are selected in a table, I wrote: jQuery(document).ready(function($){ $("#table1 tr:nth-child(even)").addClass("even"); } And for the CSS, I wrote: #table1 tr:nth-child(even), #table1 tr.even { background-color: #ff0; } In Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera, even without the pseudo-class selector in the CSS file, even-numbered rows are selected. However, in IE8, it is not the case. The rows don't have a different background color. This is weird because when I used: jQuery(document).ready(function($){ $("#table1 tr:nth-child(even)").css({"background-color":"#ff0"}); } The selected rows are highlighted in IE8. An example of the problem is question can be seen here - 24ways example . In Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera, the odd rows are assigned an "odd" class. However, in IE8, they are not assigned an "odd" class and are not highlighted.
