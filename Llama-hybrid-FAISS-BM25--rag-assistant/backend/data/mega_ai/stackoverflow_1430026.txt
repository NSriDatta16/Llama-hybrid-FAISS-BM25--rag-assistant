What does sizeof(char *) do?

I was reading through the c++ Primer and this code snippet came up and I was wondering what does the sizeof(char *) do and why is it so significant? char *words[] = {"stately", "plump", "buck", "mulligan"}; // calculate how many elements in words size_t words_size = sizeof(words)/sizeof(char *); // use entire array to initialize words2 list words2(words, words + words_size); Thanks in advance.
