How to run a nonlinear repeated measure multilevel regression?

I'm working with a colleague on a project that requires analysis a fair bit beyond my expertise. Background We are looking at recall of events in films. We broke down the film by Events and by shots (unbroken camera recording) within each event. There are 5 films being looked at. Each film has a different number of Events, and each Event has a different number of shots within the Event. Recall is measured per shot (1 they recalled it, 0 they didn't), with an average across all participants per shot. Hypothesis Our hypothesis is that participants will recall the beginning and end of events sig. more than middle events (and that plot-important information was placed at those locations, but that is a different part). Problem I was able to make graphs (below) from out data, highlighting the quadratic line of best fit for each Event (though it is scaled based on maximum number of Shots overall, rather than per Event. The graphs appear to support our hypothesis. However, I'm having great trouble in actually running the analysis. Data Our data looks something like this: Event Shot EventShots MeanAcc 1 1 2 .07 1 2 2 .57 2 1 1 .63 3 1 29 .63 3 2 29 .60 3 3 29 .27 3 4 29 .23 3 5 29 .27 3 6 29 .20 3 7 29 .13 3 8 29 .20 3 9 29 .20 3 10 29 .23 3 11 29 .23 3 12 29 .40 So, Shot (ShotwithEvent) is nested inside of Event and the total number of shots per event changes. R I've been trying to use lmer and nlme but I'm having difficulty figuring out the exact syntax I need to get the appropriate results. I've tried as follows (billy is the film data frame). model $MeanAcc ~ poly(billy$ ShotWithinEvent, 2, raw=TRUE) + (billy $Event|billy$ ShotWithinEvent), data=billy) But that gives me this error: Warning message: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt $par, ctrl = control$ checkConv, Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.28082 (tol = 0.002, component 1) This one appears to work without error, but doesn't seem to give me any useful data > model $MeanAcc ~ billy$ ShotWithinEvent + (1|billy$Event), data=billy) > model Linear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod'] Formula: billy $MeanAcc ~ billy$ ShotWithinEvent + (1 | billy $Event) Data: billy REML criterion at convergence: -279.3091 Random effects: Groups Name Std.Dev. billy$ Event (Intercept) 0.06212 Residual 0.19957 Number of obs: 889, groups: billy $Event, 50 Fixed Effects: (Intercept) billy$ ShotWithinEvent 0.4317315 -0.0001141 So, I'm kinda lost on what I need to do to appropriately test the nonlinear relationship of MeanAcc on ShotswithEvents (with unequal values), nested with Events. Any help would be appreciated! Clarify: There were 30 participants who all saw all 5 films.
