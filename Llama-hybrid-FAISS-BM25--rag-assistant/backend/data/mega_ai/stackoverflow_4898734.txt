Per a discussion on the MATLAB mailing list ( source ): You can set a sample time on the Constant block. If you double click on it you will see the sample time is set to -1. You can also drag in a sample and hold block. You may want to turn on sample time colours to make debugging easier. Update : Also, you may want to try using the To Instrument block instead of the Serial Send block. I've never used either, but the main difference I see is that the To Instrument block is designed for sending "simulation data", which might be more compatible with the Constant block. Maybe there's a reason that you can't use the To Instrument block, though.
