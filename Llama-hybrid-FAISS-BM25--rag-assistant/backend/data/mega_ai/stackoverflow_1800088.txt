Scrollbar's javadoc said this: When widgetSelected is called, the event object detail field contains one of the following values: SWT.NONE - for the end of a drag. SWT.DRAG. SWT.HOME. SWT.END. SWT.ARROW_DOWN. SWT.ARROW_UP. SWT.PAGE_DOWN. SWT.PAGE_UP. widgetDefaultSelected is not called. So my suggestion is get your tooltip to appear and disappear is to check for the event.detail type. public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent event) { tip.setVisible(event.detail != SWT.NONE); }
