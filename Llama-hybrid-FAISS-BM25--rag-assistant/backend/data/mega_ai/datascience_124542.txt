How to download and fine tune a large language model locally?

I want to fine tune a model locally, not using HuggingFace or any other third party tool. Basically, I want: Download a trained model (Llama-2, Falcon, whatever is easiest). Fine-tune it locally with my own data (maybe a set of mathematical theorems with proofs or customer service interactions, whatever) Then be able to ask questions on the new trained data without losing what the model had pre-learned I want to understand what model I should download (this is to learn, so it does not have to be the best available). Can I do it on a regular PC (I understand it may run for several hours)? How do I test to see if it has learned correctly? I understand this is more than can be answered here, so I am asking for links, videos, something that addresses this exercise explicitly. I am not looking for a generic course on LLMs or Transformers. I know the theory, I want practical steps on how to fine-tune a model, locally, on my own machine, with some data I have or downloaded from the internet. Something that can go further than the videos by Andrej Karpathy that I have already seen, suggesting a pre-trained LLM and going through the steps I described.
