If you declare your array static, it will be placed in the data section of the executable and initialized only once (on first access) or even not (it might be initialized in the executable already). Without static, the data will be on the stack of each of the function's invocations, and initialized every time the function is called. Just a little nitpick, when you say you've seen code where struct u2type is static, this is not really true. Although the static storage specifier appears before the struct, it really applies to the variable, in this case, the array. Even with static struct foo { ... } foos [] = { ... }; You can then do struct foo foo1={ ... }; and foo1 will be an automatic variable.
