Yes, scaffolding as a generator is useful. It creates the files you need, then you customize them. I don't think anybody uses the active scaffolding anymore, I for one discourage it. But, as I said, the generator is usesful rails g scaffold product price:float title:string description:text as it creates the migration file, model and controller you need either way. I don't like the default tests (rspec has better test generators) as I value tests too much to have stupid autogenerated ones. As for the sass and/or compass, I don't use generators for that, but you may try something like http://github.com/darthschmoo/rails-compass-sass-generator I don't autogenerate those as the views are always highly customized.
