I would echo @David. The question is what do you expect the tool to serve. May be SAS or SPSS is the way to go or even MATLAB. Each tool brings something to the table. Depending on what you need, one or more may fit the bill. Also look at your org's tech road map. If Open Source is a big push, your list may be different. Tableau is a good tool (and easy to learn) for Business Users or people who are less technical. Even though it is costly ($2000 for a single user annual license), it has a good reader (free) and once a report is generated, the users can leverage the reader and update without dependence on the license holder. The benefit will lie as long as the reports are stable and standard in nature. R has great graphic capabilities and hence users who do get involved in analytic may find it better suited. Similarly python can be a great tool especially if you need a web based solution for your users. So think about your needs and strategy.
