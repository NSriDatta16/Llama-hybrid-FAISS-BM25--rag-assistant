It depends what you want to accentuate, but I think this is both simple and effective: average score + games played You could weight the variables a bit (e.g. 2* games played, if you want to have more of an impact) - but the basic relationship seems reasonable. In your first example Peter would have 44 and Jane would have 40 - but if Peter starting losing points Jane could catch up.
