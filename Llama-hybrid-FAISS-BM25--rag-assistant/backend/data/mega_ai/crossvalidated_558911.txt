A visual inspection of your time series together with the results of the ADF tests suggest your series does not have a unit root. Therefore, it need not be differenced. Your series may contain a deterministic time trend, and that could be accounted for by including a linear (or nonlinear) trend as a regressor in your model. However, visually it is hard to tell whether any trend is present. Aside from a higher spike in 2005, it does not seem there is much of a trend in the data.
