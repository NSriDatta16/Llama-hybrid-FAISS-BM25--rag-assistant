long term session storage (php shopping cart)

this is more of a 'can you point me in the right direction' type of question. Basically I would like to offer customers a way to 'save' their shopping cart, perhaps to view later with a relative (it's a 'photo basket' for a photographers clients). When my 'photo basket' is used, it creates a single basket array that is then filled with item arrays . My idea was --- create a table for each user and then implode each array in the $_SESSION['basket'] to a string and then add this string to a row in the DB. When the user logs back in, their saved basket can then be exploded from the database to form a new basket... That's my chain of thought (not started this section yet). Just wondered if anyone could spot any obvious flaws and errors I might encounter. Thanks for any input. Shane
