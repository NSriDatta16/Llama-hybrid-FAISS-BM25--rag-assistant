Truly hiding your IP would require that you are leveraging some type of proxy service or tunneling service (VPN) which is relaying your requests on your behalf and acting as an intermediary. While your internal IP is probably private and thus truly not visible to the outside world anyway, the IP address you use through your service provider which is public cannot be obsfucated or hidden. Only if you relay can you hide your true address, but your relay will be public. Without a real address you cannot do any IP communications and thus all protocols will be unidirectional and fail. You could write a VB.NET 20005 application which simply connects you to a proxy server or tunnels your Internet traffic through a VPN which in turn hides your IP address.
