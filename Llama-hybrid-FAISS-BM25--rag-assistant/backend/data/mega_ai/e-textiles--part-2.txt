nce held in Washington, D.C. May 7, 2007. Additional smart fabric technologies were unveiled by Wainwright at two Flextech Flexible Display conferences held in Phoenix, Arizona, showing infrared digital displays machine-embedded into fabrics for IFF (Identification of Friend or Foe) which were submitted to BAE Systems for evaluation in 2006 and won an "Honorable Mention" award from NASA in 2010 on their Tech Briefs, "Design the Future" contest. MIT personnel purchased several fully animated coats for their researchers to wear at their demonstrations in 1999 to bring attention to their "Wearable Computer" research. Wainwright was commissioned to speak at the Textile and Colorists Conference in Melbourne, Australia on June 5, 2012. He was requested to demonstrate his fabric creations that change color using any smartphone, indicate callers on mobile phones without a digital display, and contain Wi-Fi security features that protect purses and personal items from theft. In the mid-1990s a team of MIT researchers led by Steve Mann, Thad Starner, and Sandy Pentland began to develop what they termed wearable computers. These devices consisted of traditional computer hardware attached to and carried on the body. In response to technical, social, and design challenges faced by these researchers, another group at MIT, which included Maggie Orth and Rehmi Post, began to explore how such devices might be more gracefully integrated into clothing and other soft substrates. In 1999, Rehmi Post came up with "E-broidery," a method for embedding electronic circuits into textiles by using conductive threads and digital embroidery. This led to the development of Plastic Threaded Chip Carriers, which then led to the integration of standard microchips into fabrics. A first application was the creation of a wearable MIDI jacket which featured embroidered touch sensors and audio components. Post's work created a foundation for more advanced e-textiles and advocated for the importance of washability and durability in e-textiles. Among other developments, this team explored integrating digital electronics with conductive fabrics and developed a method for embroidering electronic circuits. One of the first commercially available wearable Arduino based microcontrollers, called the Lilypad Arduino, was also created at the MIT Media Lab by Leah Buechley. Overview The field of e-textiles can be divided into two main categories: E-textiles with classical electronic devices such as conductors, integrated circuits, LEDs, OLEDs, and conventional batteries embedded into garments. E-textiles with electronics integrated directly into the textile substrates. This can include either passive electronics such as conductors and resistors or active components like transistors, diodes, and solar cells. E-textiles are often constructed using various types of conductive yarns, including metal wire filaments, metal-coated polymer yarns, spun yarns blended with conductive materials, wet-spun conductive polymers, and graphene-coated yarns. Most research and commercial e-textile projects are hybrids where electronic components embedded in the textile are connected to classical electronic devices or components. Some examples are touch buttons that are constructed completely in textile forms by using conducting textile weaves, which are then connected to devices such as music players or LEDs that are mounted on woven conducting fiber networks to form displays. Printed sensors for both physiological and environmental monitoring have been integrated into textiles including cotton, Gore-Tex, and neoprene. These sensors are capable of detecting parameters such as glucose levels and other biomarkers relevant to physical health. Sensors Smart textile fabric can be made from materials ranging from traditional cotton, polyester, and nylon, to advanced Kevlar with integrated functionalities. At present, however, fabrics with electrical conductivity are of interest. Electrically conductiv
