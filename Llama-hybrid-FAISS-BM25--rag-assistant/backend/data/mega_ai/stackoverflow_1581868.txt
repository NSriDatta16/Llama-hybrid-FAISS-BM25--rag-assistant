The ID and Sequence/SortOrder are separate and should not depend on each other at all. for a move-up/move-down feature: You can swapping Sequence/SortOrder Values or For a drag and drop feature: 1) Establish the new Sequence/OrderNumber for the selected record. 2) Get the selected records current sequence, then Update the selected record with the new number. 3) a) If the New Sequence number is below the current sequence number increment all the sequence numbers for the records that have a sequence number >= the new sequence number (exlcuding the selected one) b) if the New sequence number is above the current sequence number, decrement all the sequence numbers below the new selected one and above the current one. Hope this makes sense and I have though it out the right way (below is the actual implementation). I have implemented this in a single SQL statement that has some small amount of logic, not for the purists, but its works well. Here is an example (OP: you will want to change the GUID IDs to INTs): CREATE PROCEDURE [proc_UpdateCountryRowOrder] @ID UNIQUEIDENTIFIER, @NewPosition INT AS SET NOCOUNT ON DECLARE @CurrentPosition INT DECLARE @MaximumPosition INT IF (@NewPosition @MaximumPosition) SET @NewPosition = @MaximumPosition IF (@NewPosition <> @CurrentPosition) BEGIN IF (@NewPosition = @NewPosition AND [Countries].[Order] @CurrentPosition UPDATE [Countries] SET [Countries].[Order] = @NewPosition WHERE ID = @ID COMMIT TRAN END END GO
