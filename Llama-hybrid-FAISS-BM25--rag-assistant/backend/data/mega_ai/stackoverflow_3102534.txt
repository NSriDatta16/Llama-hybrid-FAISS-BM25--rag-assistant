The table will certainly query faster with Integer clustered indexes than GUID indexes. The reason being the size of the data type. If you have already decided to go with GUIDs as key then probably generate these GUIDs using newSequentialId() instead of NewId() as this would reduce the effects of fragmentation in Guid indexes as the Ids ae always increasing and you have less chances of having a page split. Adding to my point, it is a natural choice to go with this as a clustered index unless you have a potential candidate for a clustered index i.e. if you are using this guid not for key purposes. If its a relatively small table that is when you have a choice to not have an index else its always good to have indexes.
