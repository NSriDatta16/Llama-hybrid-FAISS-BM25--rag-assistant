It may be easier to cheat. All private queues are loaded from text files in the MSMQ\Storage\LQS directory. You could create a private queue on a test machine and then copy the corresponding text file to another machine. When the MSMQ service is started, the file will be read and the queue created. Only gotcha is to ensure that the security permissions will work on the new machine as the account SIDs are stored in the file too. Giving full control to the special groups "Everyone" and "Anonymous Logon" would remove security. Cheers John Breakwell
