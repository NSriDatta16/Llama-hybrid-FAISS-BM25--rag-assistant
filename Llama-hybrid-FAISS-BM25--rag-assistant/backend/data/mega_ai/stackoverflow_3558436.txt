You might want to check out the ActiveRecord::Calculations module (it does most of what you're asking, I believe): http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Calculations.html Some examples: Count: Product.group(:category_id).count Average: Product.joins(:category).group(:category_id).average(:price) Those should hopefully get you on the right path. Definitely check out the linked documentation, though, as it's incredibly useful.
