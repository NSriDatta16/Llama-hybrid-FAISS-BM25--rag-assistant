Well these days you'd be hard pressed to make any concise statement about what XML is and isn't or what it should and shouldn't be used for. There are examples of XML used for data exchange, app configuration, data storage, you name it. And that's without considering adaptations such as OML, XAML etc. It might be helpful to look back at the origins of XML, such as this article , alongside some of the criticisms often raised. And here's an interesting quote from the author of Effective XML . XML is not a database. It was never meant to be a database. It is never going to be a database. Relational databases are proven technology with more than 20 years of implementation experience. They are solid, stable, useful products. They are not going away. XML is a very useful technology for moving data between different databases or between databases and other programs. However, it is not itself a database. Don't use it like one.
