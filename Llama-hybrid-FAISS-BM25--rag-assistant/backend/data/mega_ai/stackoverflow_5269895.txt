I found the solution myself.. There was a file name configurable.php inside \app\code\core\Mage\Catalog\Model\Resource\Eav\Mysql4\Product\Type and it was wrongly named something like configurable.php0343235556 and i removed the unwanted numeric characters from the extension and it all worked after that... :) I already happened to found same naming problem in tierprice.php i dont know why magento have been releasing file with this weird filenames..!!! Hint on how i found the problem, i opened the file \app\var\log\system.log and removed all its contents and tried to create a configurable product and then viewed the same file and it has the error stating 'warning :could not load file from ... '
