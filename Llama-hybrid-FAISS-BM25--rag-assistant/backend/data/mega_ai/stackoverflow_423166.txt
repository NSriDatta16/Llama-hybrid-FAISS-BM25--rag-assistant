Flash ActiveX: How to Load Movie from memory or resource or stream?

I'm embedding a Flash ActiveX control in my C++ app (Flash.ocx, Flash10a.ocx, etc depending on your Flash version). I can load an SWF file by calling LoadMovie(0, filename), but the file needs to physically reside in the disk. How to load the SWF from memory (or resource, or stream)? I'm sure there must be a way, because commercial solutions like f-in-box 's feature Load flash movies from memory directly also uses Flash ActiveX control.
