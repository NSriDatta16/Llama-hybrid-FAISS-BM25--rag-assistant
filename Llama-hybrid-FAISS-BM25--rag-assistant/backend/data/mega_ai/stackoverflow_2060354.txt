Detect background click in jQuery

Say I have the following HTML: span text div text some more text I want to make it so that when I click on span, it will trigger some event (e.g. to make the text bold), that's easy: $('span').click( ... ) But now I when I click away from the element, I want another event to trigger (e.g. to make the text normal weight). I need to detect, somehow, a click not inside the span element. This is very similar to the blur() event, but for non INPUT elements. I don't mind if this click is only detected inside the DIV element and not the entire BODY of the page, btw. I tried to get an event to trigger in non-SPAN elements with the following: $('div').click( ... ) // triggers in the span element $('div').not('span').click( ... ) // still triggers in the span element $('div').add('span').click( ... ) // triggers first from span, then div Another solution would be to read the event's target inside the click event. Here's an example of implementing it this way: $('div').click(function(e) { if (e.target.nodeName != "span") ... }); I was wondering if there was a more elegant solution like blur() though.
