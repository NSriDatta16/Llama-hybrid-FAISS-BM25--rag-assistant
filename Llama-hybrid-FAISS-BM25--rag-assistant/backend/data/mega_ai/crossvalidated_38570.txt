How to compare results obtained by non-linear regression

I have been using non-linear regression to analyze binding between two biomolecules. Each individual experiment was done in triplicate. The average of these triplicate values (with associated error) were analyzed using regression ([L]=known). Specific binding = Bmax*[L]/(Kd+[L]) The Bmax and Kd are calculated. Both values have 95% confidence intervals and standard errors reported. I would like to compare the Kd for different pairs of Biomolecules. I.e. I would like to compare the Kd (higher or lower) for A binding to B, A binding to C and A binding to D. In addition, I would like to compare binding between AB and XY. Which test(s) would be appropriate for this analysis? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!
