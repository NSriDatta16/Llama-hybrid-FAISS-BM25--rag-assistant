I tend to be disorganized. I certainly don't arrange my variables alphabetically. And with C#, I am even less organized because some variables I use stuff_like_this, and with properties I might DoItLikeThis. It kind of drives me mad at times, but in the end I like letting the IDE features do the work for me . Visual Studio is incredibly nice, and being able to just right click on a variable to go to its definition, or see everywhere in the code that it's being used is downright awesome. I don't know what IDE you use, but hopefully it's got similar features. In the end, I care less about the organization and really need to worry if my design is fundamentally sound (and that part usually takes me a few tries to get right).
