How to handle imbalance with neural networks?

I am trying to do classification on multi-class and multi-label data using feed-forward networks. I have mostly been using keras. Here's all that I have tried to address imbalance in my text data, but to no avail. using loss functions like binary cross entropy, cross-entropy, focal loss, source using class weights. I am also looking into trying CNNs instead of feed-forward networks as demonstrated here . So, apart from the loss functions and weights, which mostly do not work, is there something else that can be done to counter the imbalance and have a good and usable classifier on all the classes?
