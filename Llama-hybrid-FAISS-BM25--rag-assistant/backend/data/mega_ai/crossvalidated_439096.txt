You’re hung up on a particular interpretation of what “+” can mean. The operator “+” acting between two random variables yields the random variable whose realizations are generated by adding the realizations of the constituents. It’s just a definition/convention. We can form linear combinations of matrices, elements of R3, elements of Hilbert spaces, generators of Lie algebras etc. etc. None of the things are numbers, but each of them have definitions for what “+” means between their elements.
