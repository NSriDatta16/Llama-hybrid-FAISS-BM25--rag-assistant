Which sample size and number of independent variables to use for adjusted R squared?

Bellow is a formula for estimation of adjusted R squared from here : where p is the number of independent variables and n is a sample size. I want to get adjusted R squared for machine learning prediction model estimated on a test set. I am estimating R squared of the model and now I need to convert it to the adjusted R squared. My question is: If I am estimating the adjusted R squared of the model on the test set, should I use n and p of the test set or the train set?
