There are many very good points which have been given already here. However, there are some that I would like to stress. One is that PCA will preserves things that tSNE will not. This may be good or bad, depending on what you are trying to achieve. Per example tSNE will not preserve cluster sizes, while PCA will (see the pictures below, from tSNE vs PCA As an heuristic, you can keep in mind that PCA will preserve large distances between points, while tSNE will preserve points which are close to each other in its representation. Therefore, the performance of each method will vastly depend on the dataset !
