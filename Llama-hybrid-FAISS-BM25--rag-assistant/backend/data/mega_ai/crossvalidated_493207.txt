Understanding p-value in terms of Density Function

I was looking at my statistics lecture notes on Bayesian inference, and they talk about a p-value. Specifically, they say that a p-value is the probability that the observed effect is due to random/spurious effects. So, if p = 0.05, there is a 5% probability that the observed effect is due to random effects. Given this, I am trying to understand this in terms of a probability density function, say $f(x)$ . How would one use this density function to determine if some event is spurious?
