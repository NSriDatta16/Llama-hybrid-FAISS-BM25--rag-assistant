Q1 - if you show an effect of the moderator then there is no overall effect. It would be like estimating the average height of humans when you have shown that men are taller than women. Q2 - the coefficient for crop applies irrespective of soil level and vice versa unless you fit an interaction. Q3 - with the sort of numbers you quote I suspect if you try to fit random effects at the site level and at the study level one of them will be based on little data and be quite unstable so I would plump for a study effect. Q4 - with 30 observations I would not want to use more than 2 degrees of freedom for my moderators or perhaps 3 if pushed.
