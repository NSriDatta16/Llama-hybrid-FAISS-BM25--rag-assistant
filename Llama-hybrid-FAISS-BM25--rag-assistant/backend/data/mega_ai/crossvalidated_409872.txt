What is a technical term for a model that takes as input the output of multiple other models?

I have 60+ models (could be basic if-else rules or complex neural networks) that describe population risk. Each of the models has at least one output (often more). What is the technical term for the top-level model that summarises every risk by taking the 60+ model outputs as inputs? I don't want a name for the whole process ;) I'm thinking 'summary' or 'integrated' model, but if there's an already existing term, that would be great.
