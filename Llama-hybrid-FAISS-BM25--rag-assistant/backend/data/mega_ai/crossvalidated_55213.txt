Are bootstrapped parameter standard errors unbiased in time series data?

I'm analyzing multivariate panel data which includes autocorrelated time series variables. The response variable is binary and I'm considering a random intercept to account for between subject variation. So a mixed effect logistic regression seems to be in order. Is it safe to say if I ignore the autocorrelation structure that my parameter estimates will still be unbiased, but their standard errors will be biased too low? To remedy this, can I use block bootstrapping to estimate unbiased standard errors for my model parameters?
