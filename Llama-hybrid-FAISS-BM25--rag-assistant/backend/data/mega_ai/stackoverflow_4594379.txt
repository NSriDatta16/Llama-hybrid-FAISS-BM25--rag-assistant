A register variable cannot be used as a "global" variable, because file scope variables have static storage, thus by definition they have an address. register variables are exactly the contrary, that are variables for which you, the programmer, promise to never take their address. So combining the two makes not much sense. BTW, the error message that you get is not very helpful. It seems that your compiler is referring to an extension that allows to fix a register variable to a particular hardware register. If you post such an error message please also give an indication which compiler and/or platform you are using.
