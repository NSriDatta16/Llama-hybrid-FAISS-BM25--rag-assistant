How to generate a random draw from the joint posterior density after MCMC has converged?

Consider a posterior density that involves two parameters: $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ given by $f(\beta)$ where $\beta = [\beta_1, \beta_2]^T$. We run a MCMC sampler to sample from the posterior and after the sampler has converged we have samples from the posterior density. I am interested in generating a random draw $\beta$ from the above posterior using the MCMC samples I have. How can I perform this draw?
