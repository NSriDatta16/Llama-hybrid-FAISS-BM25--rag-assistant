Linear and Non-Linear dimensionality reduction with missing variables

I'm trying to compare the two types of reduction by applying it to a list of ingredients for about 1000 sponge cakes. The ingredient lists do however have miss certain ingredients out for some cakes, an example A small example is: id | flour | sugar | cherries | chocolate | ... 1 300 20 50 100 2 200 15 0 100 How is it best to proceed? Should I ignore columns which aren't fully populated? Should I perhaps classify these extras into a group where they're all populated? e.g if there was another column called apples, combine these with cherries? I'm very new to this, any help would be appreciated greatly
