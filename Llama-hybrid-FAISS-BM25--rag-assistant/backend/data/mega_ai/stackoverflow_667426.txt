Resize event firing multiple times while dragging the resize handle

I was hoping this jQuery plug-in would work, but it didn't: http://andowebsit.es/blog/noteslog.com/post/how-to-fix-the-resize-event-in-ie (old link was noteslog.com/post/how-to-fix-the-resize-event-in-ie ). I added a comment to his site, but they're moderated, so you might not see it yet. But anyhow, let me explain my desire. I want a "resize" type of event to be fired when the user either pauses his resize, and/or completes his resize, not while the user is actively dragging the browser's window resize handle. I have a fairly complex and time consuming OnResizeHandled function I need to run, but not run 100 times just because the user widened the window by 100px and the event was fired for ever pixel of movement. I guess a best bet would be to handle it once the user has completed the resize.
