Dragging is easy. See Catfish's answer. But rotation? If you'd rather not resort to any of those techniques, then you pretty much can't do it. Sorry. WebKit (Safari, Chrome) and Mozilla (Firefox) implement the best solution: CSS declarations. I assume one could manipulate them through Javascript, like everything else. -webkit-transform: rotate(-15deg); -moz-transform: rotate(-15deg); However, given all the different restrictions you list (HTML5, mainly), it sounds like you're looking for something that will work every browser, so this solution is out. You could pull it off in , though it's also not globally compatible, it'd be a pain, and I'd probably qualify that as HTML5, anyway. So, no go. You pretty much list every technology that would make this possible as not being an option. Either no cross-browser compatibility, or use a plugin. The new web is coming. Things will be better. For now, deal with it.
