I agree with @Ben above, and I thought I would provide a simple example of where a Bayesian versus a Frequentist interval would be of value in the same circumstance. Imagine a factory with parallel assembly lines. It is costly to stop a line, and at the same time, they want to produce quality products. They are concerned about both false positives and false negatives over time. To the factory, it is an averaging process: both power and guaranteed protection against false positives matter. Confidence intervals, as well as tolerance intervals, matter to the factory. Nonetheless, machines will go out of alignment, that is $\theta\ne\Theta$ , and detection gear will observe spurious events. The average outcome matters while the specific outcome is an operational detail. On the opposite side of this is a single customer purchasing a single product or a single lot of products. They do not care about the repetition properties of the assembly line. They care about the one product that they purchased. Let us imagine the customer is NASA and they need the product to meet a specification, say $\gamma\le\Gamma.$ They do not care about the quality of the parts they did not purchase. They need a Bayesian interval of some form. Furthermore, a single failure could kill many astronauts and cost billions of dollars. They need to know that every single part purchased meets specifications. Averaging would be deadly. For a Saturn V rocket, a one percent defect rate would have implied 10,000 defective parts during the Apollo flights. They required 0% defects on all missions. You worry about having a confidence interval when you are working in the sample space as a factory is doing. It is creating the sample space. You worry about credible intervals when you are working in the parameter space, as a customer would be doing. If you do not care about the observations outside yours, then you are Bayesian. If you do care about the samples that were not seen, but could have been seen, then you are a Frequentist. Are you concerned with long-run averaging or the specific event?
