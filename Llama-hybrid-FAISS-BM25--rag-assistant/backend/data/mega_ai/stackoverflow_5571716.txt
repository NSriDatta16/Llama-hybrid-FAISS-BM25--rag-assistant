Since the monitoring is handled at the distributor (which you don't seem to have access to) you could try a work-around. The first makes the assumption that you have DDL right's to the replicated database. Add a trigger to one of the replicated tables, such as the the last one to finish with the updates which is likely the largest one. This will incur an overhead so keep the trigger simple. Design the trigger to update a timestamp in a simple table and used a SQL Agent job to monitor that table and when the timestamp has gone stale for like 1 hour then kick off another process or send a notification. create table Repl_Monitor ( LastUpdate datetime not null ); GO insert into Repl_Monitor(LastUpdate) select GETDATE(); --seed record GO create trigger trg_Repl_Monitor on dbo.[ ] for update, insert, delete as update Repl_Monitor set LastUpdate = GETDATE() GO If the daily push is comprised of a lot of inserted/delete records another work-around would be to monitor the "rows" in the sysindexes every minute and then notify once the "rows" count stops fluctuating after a period of time. select top 1 rows from sysindexes where id = OBJECT_ID('tableName') and rows > 0 This has the benefit of a negligible overhead but isn't as accurate as the trigger. Cheers!
