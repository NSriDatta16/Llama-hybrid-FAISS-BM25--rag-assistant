CodeIgniter permits you to organize your controllers,views and config files into sub-folders. As far as I know it doesn't permit it for models (at least documentation doesn't mention it, I've not tried myself). As your are in a Linux system, you can create a symbolic link to reference to another directory in the filesystem. So you can create the directories: application/config/public application/controllers/public application/views/public And then create in your /public_html symbolic links ponting to these directories: /public_html/config -> application/config/public /public_html/controllers -> application/controllers/public /public_html/views ->application/views/public When your customers upload files to /public_html/config, they will be also available in application/config/public. The same applies for /public_html/controllers and /public_html/views. The command syntaxis to creates symlinks is # ln -s target name i.e: # ln -s application/config/public /public_html/config If you don't have console access to your hosting you can create the links using the PHP function symlink() . To load a view/config/controller from a subfolder you only have tu prepend the directory name in the $this->load->...() function call. i.e: $this->load->view('public/my_view); Check CI documentation for more info about organizing your files into sub-folders.
