Estimating a hidden Markov model is not straightforward. Look for "particle filters" and " SMC methods " within the Bayesian literature. This is a probit model with hidden Markov dependence: the distribution of $R_t$ conditional on $X_{1:t}$ is Bernoulli with probability $$\mathbb{P}(R_t=1|X_{1:t})= 1-\mathbb{P}(R_t=0|X_{1:t})=p(X_{1:t})=\Phi(c_{0t}+c_{1t}X_{t-k})$$ What you omitted in the definition of your model is the dependence on the hidden state $s_t$: it should read $$y^{*}_{t} = -c_{0t}(s_t) -c_{1t}(s_t)\,X_{t-k} + u_{t}$$resulting into the probit model$$\mathbb{P}(R_t=1|X_{1:t},s_t)= 1-\mathbb{P}(R_t=0|X_{1:t},s_t)=p(X_{1:t},s_t)=\Phi(c_{0t}(s_t)+c_{1t}(s_t)X_{t-k})$$ Once again, this is far from a trivial problem.
