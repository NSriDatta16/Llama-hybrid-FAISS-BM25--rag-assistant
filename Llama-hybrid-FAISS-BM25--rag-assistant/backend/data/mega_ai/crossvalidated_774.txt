I really wouldn't suggest using machine learning in order to learn statistics. The mathematics employed in machine learning is often different because there's a real emphasis on the computational algorithm. Even treatment of the same concept will be different. A simple example of this would be to compare the treatment of linear regression between a basic statistics textbook and a machine learning textbook. Most machine learning texts give a heavy treatment to concepts like " gradient descent " and other optimzation techniques, while a statistics textbook will typically just cover ordinary least squares (if even that). Lastly, machine learning generally doesn't cover the same material when it comes to things like model comparison, sampling, etc. So while some of the basic models are the same, the conceptual frameworks can be very different.
