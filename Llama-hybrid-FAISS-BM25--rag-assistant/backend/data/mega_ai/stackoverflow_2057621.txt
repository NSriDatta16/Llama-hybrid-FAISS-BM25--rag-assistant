Mac OS applications should not need to be uninstalled in any way other than the user dragging them into the trash. Also, I would rethink very carefully your plan to make a cross-platform applications. Cross-platform applications that treat Mac OS as an afterthought and try to push foreign paradigms onto Mac OS are really irritating. If you want a Mac client, keep your backend code, but rewrite the front-end from scratch. Don't use something like Qt, no matter how tempting the portability is. So, long story short, you're right. The process is alien to Mac users (except for things like plugins). So my suggestion is just to go with the normal Mac OS behavior (drag to trash). Best of luck!
