@huber has questioned ny answer and I would like to address this. I simulated 300 values from a N(10,1) distribution . . The basic statistics for this simulated set is THE AVERAGE IS = 9.961 THE MEDIAN IS = 11.119 THE STD DEV IS = 1.023 THE MINIMUM IS = 6.915 THE MAXIMUM IS = 12.561 THE # OF OBS = 300 The 131'st value of this set is 11.96 with a companion x value of 1.0 ( all other values of x are 0.0) .I run an OLS model for the 300 observations and obtain: The full regression results are : Notice the "t value" for the estimated regression coefficient is 1.97 which is precisely what you would expect from ( 11.96-9.961)/1.023 . This ( at last in my opinion ) is what the OP requested . It is also clear that in this case ( independent readings / constant error variance) he could have just as easily used [(MEAN-VALUE)]/STD DEVIATION to obtain the same result.
