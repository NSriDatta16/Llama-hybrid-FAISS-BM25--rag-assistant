single test set vs. cross validation has been discussed before. As for your data, you essentially have a time series. This leads to dependence along your data. Thus, a single random split or a cross validation will not achieve independence between training and test sets. Dealing with that will depend on how your model will be used. in case you'd train on your S1-S10 data, and then start predicting S11,S12, and so on: look into sliding windows cross validation for time series . For these models, you can actually use the temporal correlation to help with your prediction. If you do not want or cannot use that temporal correlation, you may be able to obtain test data after finding out the temporal length of correlation and obtain data that is far enough away in time from all your training data so that training and test data are not correlated any more.
