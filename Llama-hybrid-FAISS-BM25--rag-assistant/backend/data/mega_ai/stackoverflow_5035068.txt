One alternative solution, and arguably a more elegant one, is to use the re library. import re word = raw_input('Enter a word:') try: print re.search('[aeiou]', word, re.I).start() except AttributeError: print 'No vowels found in word' In essence, the re library implements a regular expression matching engine. re.search() searches for the regular expression specified by the first string in the second one and returns the first match. [aeiou] means "match a or e or i or o or u" and re.I tells re.search() to make the search case-insensitive.
