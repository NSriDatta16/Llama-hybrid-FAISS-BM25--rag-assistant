How to find which time series is trending more?

Let us say I have two sets of time varying series as shown below: a Here, each value represents the number of times a person has listened to a song. Also, the data is daily which means if the first value (a[1] = 895) is for 10th Feb then the last value will be for 25th Mar. I want to find out whether a or b is trending more and by what margin, so if I have let say another series c then I can arrange them in the trending order for example c > a > b . Is there a statistical approach to do this.
