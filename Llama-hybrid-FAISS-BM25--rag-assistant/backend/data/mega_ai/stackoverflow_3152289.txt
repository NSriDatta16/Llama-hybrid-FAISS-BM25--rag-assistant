I think there are really good reasons for jQuery to adopt HTML5 and CSS3 features. Actually they implement a lot of functions that jQuery already implements, they do it natively. The result would be less code parsing and better resource handling. For example in javascript 1.6 there are a lot of new function for navigating and filtering arrays that are faster than the use of loops; the native drag and drop is surely faster that jQueryUI one; and better not talk about GPU driven CSS3 animations. These and a lot of other stuff are pretty worth for a rewriting of jQuery. And since as you said jquery is cross-browser, I think it would be pretty easy for them to trigger the new functions only in the right browsers, leaving the old one (yes, one ) with the old implementation. I don't see the discussion, this is a no brainer problem. http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/speed/quick/
