Found, after another half an hour of investigation. There's a folder in the Series 40 SDK directory that apparently caches the MIDlets it runs, and keeps older versions of the same MIDlet there too. I cleaned the entire directory and now the project starts just fine with new values in MIDlet Name and MIDlet Vendor . The directory to clean is: Nokia\Devices\S40_5th_Edition_SDK_Feature_Pack_1\bin\Storage\6500500\C\DirectLoaded\
