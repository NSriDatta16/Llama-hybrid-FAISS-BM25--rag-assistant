For Test1, you could use .difference - for Test2, you'd need to use .difference() instead. As for why you might use it, a potential use would be to replace something that was previously directly stored as a property with a dynamic calculation instead. For instance, if you used to store property obj.a , but then you expanded your implementation so that it knew instead properties obj.b and obj.c that could be used to calculate a , but could also be used to calculate different things. If you still wanted to provide backwards-compat with things that used the previous object form, you could implement obj.a as a property() that calculated a based on b and c and it'd behave to those older code fragments as it previously did, with no other code modification needed.
