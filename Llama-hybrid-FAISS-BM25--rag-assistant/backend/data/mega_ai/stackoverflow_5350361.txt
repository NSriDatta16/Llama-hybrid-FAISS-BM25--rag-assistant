Your scope is messed up, when the function in your tag is called this does not point to your object where you defined the function but to your -dom node. It's pretty hard to call member functions from within a html fragment like the fragment returned by a grid renderer. I suggest you take a look at Ext.grid.ActionColumn to solve this problem. When you look at the code in this column type you should be able to write your own column type that renders a link instead of an icon like the ActionColumn. Another option is using my Ext.ux.grid.ButtonColumn which doesn't render links but buttons in your grid. more info on scope in ExtJS (and js in general): http://www.sencha.com/learn/Tutorial:What_is_that_Scope_all_about
