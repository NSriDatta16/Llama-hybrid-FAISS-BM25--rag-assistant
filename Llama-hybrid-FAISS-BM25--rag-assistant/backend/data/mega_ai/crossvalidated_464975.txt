Convergence of sample mean of Cartesian product of 1-d samples

I want to estimate the mean of some quantity over a two-dimensional space, say the average height of some bounded geographic area. it's convenient to sample like so choose random latitudes, choose random longitudes form the Cartesian product of these lats and longs query at those points This sample is not IID, but can we still say anything about the convergence of the sample mean to the population mean. (related: Interpretation of cartesian product of the support of marginal distribution )
