No one seems to be addressing the file size issue you're really asking about, so I'll try. You should package your high quality images as a set of separate downloads, one for each type of device you plan to support. This makes your base app small, and ensures the end user's disk space is only filled by images it needs. I've not done this myself, but hopefully the idea will send you on the right search path. I imagine you design the separate download as either resources on your own server, or another set of apps in the market (i.e. "MyApp Image Pack HDPI", "... MDPI", etc.).
