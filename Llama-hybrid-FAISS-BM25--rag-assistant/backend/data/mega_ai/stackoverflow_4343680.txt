You might want to look into the strchr function which searches a string for a given character: include char *strchr (const char *s, int c); The strchr function locates the first occurrence of c (converted to a char) in the string pointed to by s. The terminating null character is considered to be part of the string. The strchr function returns a pointer to the located character, or a null pointer if the character does not occur in the string. Something like: if (strchr (",.();:-\"&?%$![]{}_<>/#*_+=", curChar) != NULL) ... You'll have to declare curChar as a char rather than a string and use: curChar = paragraph[subscript]; rather than: curChar = paragraph.substr(subscript, 1); but they're relatively minor changes and, since your stated goal was I want to change the if statement into [something] more meaningful and simple , I think you'll find that's a very good way to achieve it.
