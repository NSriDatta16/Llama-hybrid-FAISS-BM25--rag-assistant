The user agent doesn't change how Safari renders a page, it just changes what browser Safari pretends to be when making the HTTP request, and when calling navigator.userAgent in JavaScript. Some web servers and some JavaScript on web pages will change their behavior based on the user agent (which is generally a bad idea), and so sometimes if a web server gives you a page back saying "Sorry, your browser isn't supported", you may want to change your user agent to IE to see if it actually works even though they don't support it.
