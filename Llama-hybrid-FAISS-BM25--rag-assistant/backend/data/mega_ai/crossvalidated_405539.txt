Stochastic versus deterministic time series

How do you know if you have a stochastic versus a deterministic trend (non-stationary). That is how do you test for which it is? I know you can deal with non-stationarity by differencing. Do you deal with deterministic trends by specifying a cubic or quadratic form of time?
