Here's a way: Decide what width your bins will be. Let's say 10 (i.e. e.g. numbers > -5 and 5 and Create a list which holds lists to the number in each bin. I'd go with something like map * > in C++. Now iterate over the numbers, decide what bin they belong to. Check if there's already a vector for this bin in your map, if not create one. Add the number to the vector. After iterating over all the numbers, simply calculate the average of each vector.
