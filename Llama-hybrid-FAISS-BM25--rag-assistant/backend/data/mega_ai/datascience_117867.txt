The earlier two answers are great and thorough so I won't repeat any of their info; another idea that may be helpful is the dimensionality of the two functions. Firstly, an important detail: the Euclidian distance function is only the same as the RMSE when applying them to points in one dimension. In higher dimensions (or when using more than one instance for RMSE), Euclidian distance takes the sum whereas RMSE takes the average. Now lets compare the dimensions that each function take. The RMSE can only take one dimensional data, whereas Euclidian distance can take any number of dimensions. Both formulas sum the "error" (aka, the one dimentional distance between two points) but consider the difference between each error being summed: With Euclidian distance, each "error" being summed is in a different dimension, and each error corresponds to comparing the same two points in a specific dimension. The result is a straight line between the two points. With RMSE, each error being summed is in the same, single dimension (think the number line), and each error corresponds to comparing two values from different points. An example to clarify: Euclidian example: trivially, you have two points in 3D space. For each dimension, you find the difference in length between the points. Square, sum, and square root these three differences and the result is a straight line between the points. RMSE example: your ML model takes in birth year and returns predicted age, and you use the model to predict the age of three people. The RMSE is simply finding, 3 times, the difference between the actual and predicted age, and then applying some more math (square, average, square root). It's in 1D space, and is the amplified (squared) average of three separate instances; the result is not a distance, but instead, simply one way of getting the average of multiple errors. To drive this point even further, the RMSE for N-dimensional outputs is N separate RMSE values. In other words, even when there are multiple dimensions to work with, the RMSE is only applied to one dimension at a time.
