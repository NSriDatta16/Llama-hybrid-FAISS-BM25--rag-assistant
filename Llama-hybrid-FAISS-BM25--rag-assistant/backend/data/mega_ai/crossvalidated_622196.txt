How to interpret Multiple Regression where one IV is insignificant but the F-stat says the model is significant?

Edit: The question that was linked as an answer speaks of heteroskedasticity and multicollinearity, but this data set passed the Breusch-Pagan test and VIF, respectively. And in any case, I still have no idea what use the coefficient is for atr as its insignificant. How am I supposed to create a regression equation using a coefficient that isn't significant? I mean, I could technically do it, but what meaning would it have? Or is it significant within the whole context of the regression equation because the f-test is significant? If the other question actually answered my question, I am not seeing how or am completely lost. I am trying to analyze the impact of median wages ($1,000s) and average tax rates on jobs per thousand residents among a random sample of the states. But I am having trouble making sense of the results. If one of the independent variables (IVs) is insignificant, shouldn't that render the rest of the results meaningless? I.e., if the p-value for taxes is .54, does it matter what he p-value for median wages or the F-stat are? I want to say that it doesn't and the conclusion should be that the results are insignificant/meaningless regardless of the F-stat, but I cannot find anything that explains what to do in this situation. The F-stat indicates that the regression is significant, but the regression statistics indicate that 29.9% of the variation in jobs are explained by the variation in median wages and average tax rates. So my inital conclusion would normally be that taxes and median income are weakly correlated with jobs and normally I would just go with that, but the tax rate variable's p-value shows no significance. When I run univariate regression, the wages remain significant yet weakly correlated (p=0.001517, coefficient = 2.572, R^2 = .0288) while tax rates are insignificant (P=.934, coefficient = 43.138, R^2 = 0.002). For what relevance it may be, the median-wage, jobs per thousand, and residuals are normally distributed per the Shapiro-Wilks test. Average tax rates are not-normally distributed (P=0.004502), though my understanding is that IVs do not necessarily need to be so long as the residuals are, but even with top tax rates instead of average they simply don't correlate. So how do I summarize this?
