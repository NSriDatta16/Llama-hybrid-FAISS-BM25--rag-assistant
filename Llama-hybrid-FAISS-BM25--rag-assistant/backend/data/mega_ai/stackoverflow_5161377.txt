How to print .doc and .docx in java

I just learned how to do some basic .doc and .docx manipulations ussing Apache-POI. And now what i want to do is try to print those documents from within my application. Any idea how can i do so? This is how i create the documents: public void newWordDoc(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException { XWPFDocument document = new XWPFDocument(); XWPFParagraph tmpParagraph = document.createParagraph(); XWPFRun tmpRun = tmpParagraph.createRun(); tmpRun.setText("Writing to a .doc"); tmpRun.setFontSize(18); document.write(new FileOutputStream(new File(filename + ".doc"))); } public void newWordDocX(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException { XWPFDocument document = new XWPFDocument(); XWPFParagraph tmpParagraph = document.createParagraph(); XWPFRun tmpRun = tmpParagraph.createRun(); tmpRun.setText("Writing to a .docx"); tmpRun.setFontSize(18); document.write(new FileOutputStream(new File(filename + ".docx"))); } I suppose now i should create some method that reads them again and prints them, right? What would be the easiest and fastest way to print them in my printer? Do i need to use the java printing API, or is there any freeware API that can make things easier? Also i would like to mention that i rode in a post somewhere else that java cant do such thing as printing word documents and that we have to transform them first to PDF. Is that true? I hope not :(
