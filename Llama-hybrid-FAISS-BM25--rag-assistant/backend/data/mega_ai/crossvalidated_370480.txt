This does not seem to be a direct machine learning problem. Basically, in machine learning, you have two main types of approaches: supervised learning: train a model to predict something based on labelled data; to perform supervised learning on your problem, you would need to know a set of customers to whom it is worth sending the booklet unsupervised learning: analyze your data to find patterns, clusters, outliers... this does not tell you if you should send the booklet or not. I also think that your problem may be more complicated than what you explained. For instance, a customer could buy something from a booklet they received more than three weeks ago. The key here is the behaviour of customers when the booklet is not sent. You wrote that you had a small dataset, perhaps you will need to grow it to make it significant, depending on its size. Also, the data might be twisted if their is any contextual side effect (for instance, if the 9 week off period happened during summer holidays). Machine learning could actually help improving your data on what happens when the booklet is not sent. Using unsupervised learning techniques, you could cluster your customers depending on their characteristics (what is in the records), and their behaviour towards the booklet (for instance, fraction of their total order that was advertised in a recent booklet). You would expect customers from the same cluster to behave the same: then, you just need to stop sending the booklet to a few of them, and compare their behaviour with that of the other customers. Then, a good metric, to decide whether you should send the booklet to some type of customer, would be the average difference between the amount of orders from those who receive the booklet, and those who don't.
