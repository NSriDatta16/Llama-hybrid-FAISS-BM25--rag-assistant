No. First of all, Dictionary [UPDATED] uses hash code of the keys to find them in its internal storage - rather than the keys. And Hashcode is an int . For int , it is just the value of the int , for string it has to be generated. So using int is slightly faster. In fact generating hash code for a string is a pretty complex process (snippet using Reflector) [ Hope this is not taken as copyright breach because it is NOT ]: fixed (char* str = ((char*) this)) { char* chPtr = str; int num = 0x15051505; int num2 = num; int* numPtr = (int*) chPtr; for (int i = this.Length; i > 0; i -= 4) { num = (((num > 0x1b)) ^ numPtr[0]; if (i > 0x1b)) ^ numPtr[1]; numPtr += 2; } return (num + (num2 * 0x5d588b65)); }
