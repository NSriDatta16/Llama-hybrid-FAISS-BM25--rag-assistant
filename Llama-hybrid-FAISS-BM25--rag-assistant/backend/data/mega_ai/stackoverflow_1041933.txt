That depends on what you mean by "field." It sounds as though you're talking about a form, which wouldn't be PHP, but instead HTML. You could have a button [Add] post back to the server, which then refreshes the page with another set of form-inputs. You also do that via javascript without having to refresh the page. Simple Javascript (jQuery) Example: $(document).ready(function(){ $("input[value='Add']").click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); $("p.field:last").clone().insertAfter("p.field:last"); }); }); Simple PHP Example: I don't encourage you use this as-is "; print_r($_POST["firstname"]); print_r($_POST["lastname"]); print " "; } ?> " /> " />
