How to interpret variable.importance for an rpart object

How can I interpret the values for the variable.importance in an rpart object? pmodTree$variable.importance satisfaction level number of projects average monthly hours last evaluation 2161.1501546 1140.5711855 1112.0014799 1005.2704105 years at company work accident promoted last 5 years department 825.2875165 40.4288851 17.4146171 0.5501881 What exactly do these values mean? In the summary funtion they are scaled to add to 100. So could that be the percentage of how important they are in classifying? But what do the unscaled values tell me? Couldn't find anything useful on the internet. Answer: The values are calculate by summing up all the improvement measures that each variable contributes as either a surrogate or primary splitter. So the higher the value is, the more the variable contributes to improving the model. The variables with a scaled importance near to zero are left out of the final tree model. Source: 1
