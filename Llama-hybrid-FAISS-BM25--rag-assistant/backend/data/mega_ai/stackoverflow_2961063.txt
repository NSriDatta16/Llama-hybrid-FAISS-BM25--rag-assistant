jQuery.browser allows you to view the user agent version, though it's not recommended by the jQuery team. Instead look at jQuery.support which is recommended for 'feature detection' to determine which browser you're using. Using $.browser, something like (not tested): if ( !($.browser.msie && $.browser.version == 7.0) ){ ... } Would do the trick
