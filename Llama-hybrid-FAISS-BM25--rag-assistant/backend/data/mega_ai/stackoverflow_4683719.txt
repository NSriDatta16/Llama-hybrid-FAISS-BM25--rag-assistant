PHP: compare two arrays and sort by priority

I would like to compare two arrays: one is containing the list of possible options and the other array contains priorities. This is how the two arrays are organized : foreach ($varsA as $varA) { foreach ($varsB as $varB) { $options[$varA][$varB] = $id; $priority[$varA] = $priority + $priority[$varA]; } } this is what $options contains: array ( 1 => array ( 33307 => 'w', 33313 => '7', ), 2 => array ( 33307 => 'w', 33313 => '7', ), 3 => array ( 33307 => 'w', 33313 => '7', ), 4 => array ( 33307 => '4', 33313 => '7', ), ) and this is what $priority contains: array ( 1 => 5, 2 => 9, 3 => 9, 4 => 5, ) I would like to duplicate the duplicates values from $options and keep the one with the uniques with the lowest priority: The output would be: Array (1, 4) Because 1, 2, 3 are not unique and 1 has the smallest priority. I was using the following function to remove duplicates but I don't know how I can adapt it to deal with priorities: super_magic($options) { $result = array_map("unserialize", array_unique(array_map("serialize", $options))); foreach ($result as $key => $value) { if ( is_array($value) ) { $result[$key] = super_magic($value); } } return $result; }
