vector autoregression where one of the dependent variable's current values determines the other dependent variables

Take the following regressions: y1 = a1+ d1*y3+ lag(Y)B1 + XG1 + u1 y2 = a2 + d2*y3+ lag(Y)B2 + XG2 + u2 y3 = a3 + d3*y3+ lag(Y)B3 + XG3 + u3 where Y = [y1, y2, y3] is a time-ordered matrix of data, terms "a" are intercepts, X is a matrix of covariates, B and G are vectors of coefficients, and u are error terms. lag(.) is the one-period lag operator. Give the solution to the coefficient matrix [a, d, B, G] such that d3 = 0 I seem to have stumped chatgpt :D Is this even feasible using stacked OLS (probably with some clever weighting?), or would I need to use a constrained optimizer?
