I think I now understand this. My distribution is skewed, so I knew my expectation would not be the same as my mode. The thing that confused me was that the implication was that if I had 1000 experiments that each measured 10 particles then on average there would have been 109 trials, and in total 109,000 trials. This was at odds with the situation where I had a single experiment which measured 10,000 successes which would indicate that there had been 10,009 trials. The discrepancy occurs because the first case assumes 1000 independent experiments. If however I put the posterior function from the first trial in as the prior for the next trial, then put the posterior from this trial in again as the prior for the next, etc, then I get the result I expect for the 10,000 success trial. The issue here is that the first case assumes that for each trial we restart again with no knowledge, whereas the second case the knowledge increases with each success.
