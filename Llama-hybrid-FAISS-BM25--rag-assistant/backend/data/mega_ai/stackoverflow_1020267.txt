How can I retrieve jQuery change events from dynamic form elements in PHP?

In order to choose categories, I want to use dropdown lists. Each list contains one level of categories. So it's: top level, sub, subsub, subsubsub etc. Every level is dynamically retrieved through my script getcat.php , which shows a object. The retrieval so far works with the following code. However, since it's a form, I want to get the last selected value so I can have the category id. This is not working for me. I tried $("select:last option:selected") , but that's not working with newly inserted elements. After selecting the category, an input field must show up where the user can make his own subcategory (inside the category selected). This, too, is not working with the new elements. Now, I tried to play with .live but that doesn't support change events. Do you guys have any tips on how to improve it? Currently I've got the following code: $("select").bind("change", function(){ $(this).nextAll().remove(); var value = $(this).val(); $("#currentcat").val(value); if($("select:last option:selected").hasClass('makenew')) { $("#newcat").show(); } else if($("select:last option:selected").hasClass('disabled')) { } else { $.get("getcat.php", { c: value }, function(data){ $("#getcats").append(data); }); $("#newcat").hide(); } }); However, as you can see, it's not a beauty.
