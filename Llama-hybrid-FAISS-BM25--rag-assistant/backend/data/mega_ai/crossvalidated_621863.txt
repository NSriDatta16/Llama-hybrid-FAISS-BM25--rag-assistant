Comparing two different datasets using null deviance

I have two separate datasets, A and B. I have a score that I am applying in both, and I am testing how well that score predicts a disease (present or absent). One property that I think would be interesting to understand is the information content of each cohort based on the cases and controls. Intuitively I would think that the null deviance of an intercept-only logistic regression model (separate model for each cohort) would essentially provide that value. But I can't find a citation for this. That either suggests that this is not valid intuition, or that people consider another measure more valuable. Is this intuition accurate? If not, is there another measure that would be more appropriate?
