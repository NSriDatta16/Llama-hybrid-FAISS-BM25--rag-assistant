Azure Membership UI

Using AspProviders (TableStorageMembershipProvider etc) from Microsoft WCF Azure Samples . It is WCF Service Web Role, and in Azure Storage Explorer I can see Membership, Roles and Session tables appearing nicely when I try to connect. But is there any exisiting code to manage Membership and Roles? Some ASPX pages I guess, something like this for plain old ASP.NET, but more modern and Azure-tested hopefully? Thanks, Andres
