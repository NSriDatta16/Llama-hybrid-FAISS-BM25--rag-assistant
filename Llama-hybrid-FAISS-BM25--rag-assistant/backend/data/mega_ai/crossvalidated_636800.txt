Try it in a simulation! I got it to happen five times, so it is possible, yes. set.seed(2024) N $coef[2, 4] p_lpm coef[2, 4] # Increase the counter if the linear probability model is # significant at the 0.05-level but the logistic regression isn't # if (p_lr > 0.05 & p_lpm You can tweak the above to include multiple features. library(lmtest) set.seed(2024) N $`Pr(>Chisq)`[2] p_lpm `Pr(>Chisq)`[2] # Increase the counter if the linear probability model is # significant at the 0.05-level but the logistic regression isn't # if (p_lr > 0.05 & p_lpm There are further variants of this simulation that you can do.
