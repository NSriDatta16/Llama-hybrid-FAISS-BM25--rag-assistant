Dirac delta function for multivariate input (in the context of Gaussian processes)

Let's say we have a set of $N$ observations $D = \{\bf X, t\}$ where ${\bf X} = [{\bf x}_1, ..., {\bf x}_N]^T$ are the locations and ${\bf t} = [t_1, ..., t_N]^T$ are the targets. When applying a Gaussian process for the problem of regression, we start with an assumption that \begin{equation} t_i = f_i + \epsilon_i \end{equation} where $t_i$ is the observed targets, $f_i$ is a random variable that is the output at location ${\bf x}_i$ , and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ is assumed noise. We are then interested in the joint marginal distribution of ${\bf t}$ , which we find to be \begin{equation} {\bf t} \sim \mathcal{N}({\bf t}|{\bf 0}, {\bf C}) \end{equation} where the covariance matrix $\bf C$ is defined by \begin{equation} {\bf C}_{n,m} = k({\bf x}_n, {\bf x}_m) + \sigma^2\delta_{n,m} \end{equation} The book I'm reading this from ( Pattern recognition and Machine Learning , Bishop 2006, pp 306) does not explain what $\delta_{n,m}$ is, but from this thread I've come to understand that this is the Dirac delta function \begin{equation} \delta_{n,m} = \delta({\bf x}_n - {\bf x}_m) \end{equation} Any definition I've found assumes the input is univariate (one-dimensional), but the book strongly suggests that the input is multivariate. My question is this : what is the definition of the Dirac delta function for multivariate input?
