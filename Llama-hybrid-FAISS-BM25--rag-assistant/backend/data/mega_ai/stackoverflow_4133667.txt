How can I edit a specific item on my website's front page on Magento

I would like to get some help with finding a particular item that shows in my website's homepage. I'm trying to edit the page source code by using Bluehost online File Manager. The thing is I couldn't find the specific page where I can find the relevant code to edit. I bought this website source code from a company that installed it on the servers and now I want to edit inside stuff by myself.
