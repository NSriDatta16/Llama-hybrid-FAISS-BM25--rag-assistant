When using frequentist methods, it is invalid to remove the interaction from a linear model just because of a hypothesis test, because that invalidates the estimate of residual variance, i.e., it results in an underestimation of $\sigma^2$ . This is a form of model uncertainty discussed at more length in RMS . In a confirmatory randomized experiment it is commonplace to have a "no interaction" model for the primary analysis and a pre-specified secondary analysis using an interaction model. The most cohesive approach IMHO is a Bayesian analysis in which the prior distribution for the interaction effect is elicited before data analysis. This allows interactions to be "half in" and "half out" of the model.
