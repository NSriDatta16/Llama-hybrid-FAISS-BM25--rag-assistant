question about mlp() in tidymodels

I was reading tidymodels and got confused about mlp() function's description from help section. it says from R help file, mlp() defines a multilayer perceptron model (a.k.a. a single layer, feed-forward neural network). This function can fit classification and regression models. I am confused how a multilayer perception model becomes a single layer, feed-forward neural network ? Could someone enlighten me here?
