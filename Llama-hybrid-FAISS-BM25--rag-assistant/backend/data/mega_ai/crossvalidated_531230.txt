When is ok not to centre the data before using it in PCA?

I want to find out if it is ok not to center the data in a PCA when working with stock returns. Centering would remove the trend from the dataset which I believe contains valuable information. The paper copied below looks at similarities between the use of centred and uncentred data concluding that the results are more similar than expected. However, I am more interested in finding out in which case is ok not to center given that it is a widely use methodology and need to just not using it (or use it if needed). Just to clarify, by centering I am not referring only to demeaning but also to standardizing. Cadima J, Jolliffe IT. 2009. On relationships between uncentred and column-centred principal component analysis. Pak. J. Stat. 25, 473â€“503
