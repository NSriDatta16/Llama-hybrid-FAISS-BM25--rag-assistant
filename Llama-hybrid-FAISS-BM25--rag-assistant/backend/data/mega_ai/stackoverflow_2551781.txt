Version-control in a large SSIS ETL project

We're about to make data transformation from one system to another using SSIS. We are four people people who will continuously be working on this for two years and therefore we need some sort of versioning system. We can not use team foundation. We're currently configuring a SVN server, but digging into it I've seen some big risks. It seems that a solution is stored in one huge XML file. This must be a huge problem in a combined code/drag and drop environment as SSIS, as it will be impossible for SVN to merge the changes correctly, and whenever we get an error when commiting we will have to look inside that huge XML file and correct the mistakes manually. One way to solve this problem is to create many solution projects in SSIS. However, this is not really the setup we want as we are creating one big monster which will have 2 days to execute and we want to follow its progress as it executes. If we have to create several solutions are there ways to link their execution and still have a visual look of whats going on and how well the execution is doing? Has anyone had similar problems and/or do you have any suggestions as to how to solve them?
