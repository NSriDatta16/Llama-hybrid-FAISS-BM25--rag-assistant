Log each and every request (query string, etc). Log all HTTP variables 'HTTP_ACCEPT', 'HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET', 'HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING', 'HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE' 'HTTP_CONNECTION', 'HTTP_HOST', 'HTTP_REFERER', 'HTTP_USER_AGENT' (perhaps with each request). As you are interested from day 1, don't worry about information that can be derived from the raw logs. You can do whatever processing you want later. If resources are a constraint (they should not be in the beginning), you can optimize like hash on the HTTP_USER_AGENT etc.
