A Contradiction in Bayesian Statistics?

In Bayesian statistics, we usually assume that data $X_{1},...,X_{n}$ are independent to each other. But the predictive distribution shows that they are not independent because we have $p(X_{n+1}|X_{1},...,X_{n})$ depends on the historical data. So, is this a contradiction?
