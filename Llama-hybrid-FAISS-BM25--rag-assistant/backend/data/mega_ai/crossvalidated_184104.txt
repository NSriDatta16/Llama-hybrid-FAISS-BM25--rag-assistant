Using Keras LSTM RNN for variable length sequence prediction

I have a set of sequences. Each sequence is the form $\{(s_1,l_1),(s_2,l_2) \ldots\}$ where $s_i$'s are real valued numbers and $l_i$s are labels from a fixed alphabet. It is important to note that the sequences may be of different lengths . Pictorially, I would like to predict the labels corresponding to a test sequence. With reference to the picture below, I would like to predict the red $l_i$s. How do I use the LSTM framework of Keras to solve this ? Examples or reference links would also be welcome.
