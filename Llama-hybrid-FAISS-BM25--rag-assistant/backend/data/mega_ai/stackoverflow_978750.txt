I just want to clarify a bit first. Not sure if you're looking to configure sync for proper user profiles (which mundeep's answer solves nicely) or a generic SP list. If you're looking to: AD SharePoint list It's probably easier to break this problem down into two parts: AD -> SP list and: SP list -> AD For AD -> SP list Microsoft provides some guidance on monitoring the AD for changes . Unfortunately, neither of these methods is a specific event message system (if anyone knows of one, please chime in!) both are essentially polling. I would create a Windows service to handle this part of the solution. The service would (in pseudo-code): look for records that have changed for each record that has changed: get the matching SP item from the SP list (probably based on username) update/add/remove the properties of the SP item save the SP item For SP list -> AD I would create a custom event handler and attach it to the SP list. Again in pseudo-code: On SP item delete: remove the matching AD record (if that's the behaviour you want) On SP item create: create a new AD record On SP item update: find the matching record in the AD update the changed properties (which are flagged in the SP event handler) The SP side of things is a little more elegant because events are raised only when something happens. This is definitely more efficient than polling. What I'm suggesting has the added benefit of removing SQL (explicitly) from the solution. You can use the ADSI interface in the .NET framework to handle the AD update code. It's in the System.DirectoryServices assembly. The AD polling service could use the SP object model if it's installed on the WSS box or the web services if it's on another system. Again, if you're just looking to use the actual WSS/SP user profiles, use mundeep's solution.
