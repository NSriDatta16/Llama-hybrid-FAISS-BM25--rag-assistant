Standard error for the difference of coefficients in logistic regression

Suppose I fit a logistic regression where my covariates are ordinal. Can I determine the standard error for the log odds ratio between consecutive categories? I'm inclined to say yes. Since the coefficients of the model are the MLE, then they have asymptotic normal distribution. So, if I wanted the variance for the difference between $\beta_j$ and $\beta_i$, I would compute $$\operatorname{Var}(\beta_j) + \operatorname{Var}(\beta_i) - 2\operatorname{Cov}(\beta_j, \beta_i)$$ Then just take the square root of the above quantity to obtain the standard error of $\beta_j - \beta_i$. Is that correct?
