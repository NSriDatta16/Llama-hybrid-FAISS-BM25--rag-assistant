I would strongly encourage you to reconsider this design of your app. Code in separate .apks should generally be able to run independently, not have close couplings with data. If this is all one app and it is split into .apks for some kind of convenience, you are going to cause yourself all kinds of other problems -- for example, what if the user uninstalls one of the .apks, clears the data on one of them, etc...? If you are thinking about using MODE_WORLD_READABLE, stop and reconsider. First not that this is allowing any application installed on the device to read that data. It also generally indicates a design issue with a bad dependency between apps that will bite you.
