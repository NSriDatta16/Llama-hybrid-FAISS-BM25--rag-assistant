You could send the forms to different handlers with action=file1.php and action=file2.php . Are they processed using a bunch of the same code? Put that into separate files, include the commonalities, and write the unique bits in each of the handling files. Don't hack, organize. For Javascript validation, don't halt the default action then resume, instead do this: if (validation != valid) { return false; } That way if JS is turned off or the validation fails, the form action/event is intact and it behaves as expected, otherwise it bonks. And certainly, certainly retain server-side validation. That's the "real" validation, the client-side is only to please the user and save them time. Never rely on it for YOUR sake.
