A/B test : Confidence interval for Revenue per Visitor using Conversion Rate and Average Price per Order

I have an A/B test to improve number of orders. The result came back showing a positive impact on the number of orders per visitors (aka, Conversion Rate) but not significant on the average revenue per order. Using these information, can I calculate the confidence interval of revenue per visitor? Example data: confidence interval of transactions / visitors (CVR): [1.13, 1.16] confidence interval of average revenue per order: [-0.07, 0.09] Question: what would be the confidence interval of revenue per visitor?
