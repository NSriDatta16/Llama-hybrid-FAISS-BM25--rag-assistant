What is the most elegant C# .NET Data Access Layer design?

I would like to konw what is considered the most elegant C# .NET method to produce a Data Access Layer? I am using MyGeneration DooDads . Is this an elegant solution? Is it still acceptable to use the CRUD Stored Procedures + DAL Library for data access with .NET Entity Framework and NHibernate ORM tools?
