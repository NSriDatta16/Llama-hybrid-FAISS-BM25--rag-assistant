Script execution stops at serious errors. If you have multiple scripts, the others will still run; if you packed everything into one big file, a lot more code won't get executed. So combining scripts is bad for reliability, but can be good for other purposes (mainly load time). All browsers have some sort of javascript console which will show you the number of errors. Most have some sort of developer tool too (Firebug in Firefox, Dragonfly in Opera etc). I'm not sure what you mean by preloading. Since a javascript file can affect the rest of the page in various ways, browsers will fully load and execute a script tag before continuing to parse the page (which is why scripts can slow page loading down so much).
