Why does the Policy Gradient Theorem generalize to continuous action spaces

The policy gradient is generally in the shape of the following: $$ L^{PG}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \log \pi_\theta(a_t \mid s_t) A_t \right] $$ Where $\pi$ represents the probability of taking action $a_t$ at state $s_t$ and $A_t$ is an advantage estimator. This makes perfect sense to me in discrete action spaces. However, I'm unsure why this still makes sense in continuous action spaces. In every application of policy gradients to continuous action spaces that I have seen, $\pi$ always evaluates a point on the PDF instead of actually representing a probability. Why is this possible?
