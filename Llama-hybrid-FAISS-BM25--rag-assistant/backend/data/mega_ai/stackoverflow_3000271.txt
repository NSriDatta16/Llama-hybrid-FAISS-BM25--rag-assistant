There is no standard for the things you're asking about. Rather, there are conventions and these depend heavily on the size and maturity of the organization. If you're in a small organization, say a couple of programmers, then things will probably be somewhat informal with the individual developers doing coding, builds, and test. In larger organizations, there may be a dedicated build engineer and process. This kind of organization will usually do a formal build on a regular basis, say once a day, using whatever source code is checked in. The process will also usually include BVT (Build Validation Tests) and perhaps some regression tests. Developers will check out the code from the repository, work on their own portion locally, then check it in. In the largest organizations, like Microsoft or Google, they will have a completely dedicated group and full lab that will build on a more-or-less continual basis, making the results of each run available. These organizations have very formal processes and procedures in place about what gets checked in and when, what the code review processes are, etc.
