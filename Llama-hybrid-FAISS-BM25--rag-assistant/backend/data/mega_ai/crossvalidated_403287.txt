Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ( HMC ), originally called Hybrid Monte Carlo, is a form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo with a momentum term and corrections. The "Hamiltonian" refers to Hamiltonian mechanics. The use-case is stochastically (randomly) exploring high dimensions for numeric integration over a probability space. Contrast with MCMC Plain/vanilla Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) uses only the last state to determine the next state. That means that you are as likely to go forward as you are to go back over space you have already explored. MCMC also is likely to drift outside of the primary area of interest in high dimensional spaces as well. This makes MCMC very inefficient for the purposes of numeric integration over a multidimensional probability space. How HMC handles these issues By adding in a momentum term, HMC makes the exploration of the probability space more efficient, as you are now more likely to make forward progress with each step through your probability space. HMC also uses Metropolis-Hastings corrections to ensure it stays in and explores the region of greater probability. In writing up this answer, I found this presentation on HMC to be quite illuminating.
