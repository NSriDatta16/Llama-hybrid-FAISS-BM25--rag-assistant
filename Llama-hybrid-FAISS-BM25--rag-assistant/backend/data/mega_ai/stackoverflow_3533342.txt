Software exists today that will do this for free or cheap. The challenge is getting the inputs. If this is for a business and their business relies on it I suggest a Logic Express / Logic Pro or Pro Tools solution. Spend a couple of bucks and make it work right. Free software that will work well are things like: Audacity (all platforms), Garageband (Mac), Ardour (Linux, Mac), etc. Now to get twenty mono audio inputs into the system you should consider getting something with twenty inputs (or more) rather than running all 20 mics into a mixing board and recording the mix-down of one channel.
