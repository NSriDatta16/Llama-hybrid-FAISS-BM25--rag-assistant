As it is pointed out MVC is stateless. The only data storage outside server side storage (like custom DB or Asp.Net in session state) that survives GET requests and avaialbe for both server and client is cookies. Note that cookie size is limited (vairying per browser - around 4K per cookie, under 100 cookies/100K total per domain).
