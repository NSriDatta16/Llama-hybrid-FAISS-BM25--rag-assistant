It seems to me that a multilevel logistic regression model would work well. You can use glmer function to do that. Your experiment and trial, if considered as random effects, seem to be crossed (i.e. trials were equivalent across experiments, e.g. trial 1 in experiment 1 was similar to trial 1 in experiment 2 etc. If trials were somehow experiment-specific, then experiment and trial would be nested). However, in your case, I probably wouldn't put experiment and trial in as random effects, because it makes more sense to use them as factorial fixed effects as you are interested in possible differences between different experiments and trials. A possible model for your situation would go model which gives you the main effects and all interactions between country, experiment, and trial, while controlling for participant-specific variance in outcome. You'd need to specify factor(Experiment) and factor(trial) if experiment and trial are numeric in your data. You can then investigate the specific contrasts further e.g. with emmeans package functions.
