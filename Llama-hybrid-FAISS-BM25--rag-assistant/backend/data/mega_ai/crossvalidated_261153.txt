Hypothesis testing - mean difference of two samples

Let's say that I want to examine whether rain affects the number of patients that will check in a hospital with respiratory problems. So my data looks like this: Case 1: There were $\boldsymbol{n_1=100}$ days with No Rain . In each day a different number of patients were examined and diagnosed with respiratory problem, i.e. Day 1: 5/50 patients were positive Day 2: 0/45 patients were positive ... Day 100: 3/34 patients were positive. Case 2: Similarly let's say there were $\boldsymbol{n_2=30}$ days with Rain : Day 1: 0/35 patients were positive ... Day 30: 15/40 patients were positive. I need to estimate the sample mean and variance for each different case. I first consider each day as a different random variable, in this case a binomial experiment so I can estimate the probability p: Day x: $p_x=\frac{\text{# patients with resp problem}}{\text{# of patients examined}}$ , $var_x = \frac{p_x(1-p_x)}{\text{# of patients examined} }$ Then for the two cases (no rain/rain) I estimate the mean of all these single-day random variables: (No Rain): $\hat{\mu_1} = \frac{(p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_{100})}{100}$, $\hat{var_{1}} = \frac{1}{100^2}(var_1 + var_2 + ... + var_{100})$ (Rain): $\hat{\mu_2} = \frac{(p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_{30})}{30}$, $\hat{var_{2}} = \frac{1}{30^2}(var_1 + var_2 + ... + var_{30})$ Now I want to estimate what is the probability that the two means differ only due to chance (or in other words reject the null hypothesis that they are equal). What's the best metric to use in this case? Should it be Welch's t-test? In that case that would correspond to $t = \frac{\hat{\mu_1}-\hat{\mu_2}}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{var_1}}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{var_2}}{n_2}}}$, where $n_1=100$ and $n_2=30$? Or $t = \frac{\hat{\mu_1}-\hat{\mu_2}}{\sqrt{\hat{var_1}+\hat{var_2}}}$, where the division of the variances by $n_1$ and $n_2$ is omitted as I included this in the variance of the mean above? I guess I'm confused as the final samples I'm comparing are already averaged estimators of random variables. I would be glad if you could let me know if my solution is correct and how to evaluate if the difference in the two means is statistically significant.
