To my knowledge, reparameterization trick is used to make the Monte-Carlo estimated ELBO have lower variance. In your formulation you seem to use it in other cases. Also, you shouldn't consider doing calculation by hand given very few machine learning problems can be solved analytically. Have you checked the VAE's code? $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are learnt in a nerual network. To know more details about VAE, you can check my blog post .
