I personally try to use Flash only when another existing technology cannot handle it well. That normally involves advanced animation, and video embedding. Everything else I do with HTML/CSS + Javascript (with jQuery as needed) and backend tech. While it is true Flash "fixes" some of the problems you listed, I don't think you want to move this direction, for a few reasons: As @Ambrose mentioned, you will be in a very small pond moving the opposite direction of most developers. Not sure how much support you will find. EDIT: Just to be clear. I realize there is a huge Flash developer community. I am specifically speaking of others "like you" that are not moving from HTML/CSS to Flash for the reasons you provided. Mobile web use is rapidly increasing due to both the iPhone and Android platforms... Neither currently support Flash. ( EDIT See this article for Smartphone browser stats) Flash content cannot be easily repurposed for web, print, mobile in the same way as traditional technologies (CSS/HTML). I find HTML/CSS + Javascript far more forgiving and easy to learn than Flash... but thats just me :)
