Why Can't I put a Setter Inside an Event Trigger

I was trying to add some visual feed back for a list box that supports drag and drop. Seems like I should be able to add some setters to an EventSetter and be done. However, eventsetters don't support setters. Do I really have to make a storyboard to implement this behavior? What is Microsoft's rational for this? -->
