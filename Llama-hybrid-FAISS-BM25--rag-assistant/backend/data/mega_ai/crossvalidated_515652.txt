I'm not sure how stationarity would play into this, but here's one broad idea of what's going on. Two time series can both Granger cause each other. This seems to be the case from your image. Orange causes blue to rise, and blue causes orange to fall. Think about it in terms of the model. With just past values of the orange data, we couldn't predict when the orange series would start falling. That is, the coefficients of orange should be positive at time=2200, but negative at time=2600. The model will pick error-minimizing coefficients that won't be strongly negative, and thus won't help us predict when orange starts falling. If you add in lags of blue, you can make a better prediction. Your model could say the current value of orange is proportional to the value of blue 200 time-steps ago. Then at time=2200, the value of blue at time=2000 starts to fall, and the model will correctly tell us that the value of orange should also start to fall. Since we got a better prediction when we add in lags of blue, we can say that blue Granger-causes orange. Hope this helps!
