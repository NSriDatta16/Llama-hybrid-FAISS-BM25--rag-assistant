how to organize drupal content in next case

i need help how to organize nodes of drupal cms. i have three kind of users (three additional user groups). nodes are accessible only if users are logged in. users from first group can access to all nodes, that are created by all users (all users group). users from second group can access only to nodes created by them self. users from third group can access to content created by them and users from first group. important is that when users enter their content, they does not have to define who can access to which content. it have to be done by system. is it possible to organize using views module? also, it is important that users must use same link to access to nodes. do i need some extra programming for that? thank you in advance!!!
