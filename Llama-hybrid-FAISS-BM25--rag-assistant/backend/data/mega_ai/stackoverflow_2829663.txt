You should work in the appropriate level of abstraction and write your method signatures to do the same. If the public/default interface of B is modified that heavily from A, then your method signature really should be returning a B. Otherwise, ditch trying to cast it, assign the result of .converts to a variable of type A, and treat it like an A even though it's true type is really a B. You would be defeating the point of abstracting through inheritance if you are trying to downcast here. Without seeing your source code, I have no clue whether or not it makes sense to use composition in lieu of inheritance here. The above paragraph assumes what you say about "extends relationship makes more sense" is really true.
