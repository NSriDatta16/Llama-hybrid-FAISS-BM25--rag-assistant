Extract Information from PDF using DL

We are having this requirement of extracting information from a credit history document. Usually it is a PDF and a computer generated document. Because these PDFs are generated by different sources, the layout of the document will be different for each source. The columnn header labels will also be different. Presently, there are 4 sources which are generating this document, but going forward, it will be from many sources. From each of these documents, we will need to extract information such as lender name, lending amount, outstanding balance etc; I need to know what are the steps and practical approach involved in extracting the data I want such as lender name, amount, balance etc; Do we have an established Machine Learning / Deep Learning approach that can be implemented here? Just getting to know the basics of ML/DL, therefore need a direction please
