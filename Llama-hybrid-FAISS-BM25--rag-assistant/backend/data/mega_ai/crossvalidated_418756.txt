What does MA(q) model forecast? Future $X_t$ or future $\epsilon_t$

In time series, Moving Average model $MA(q)$ is defined by $$X_t = \mu + \epsilon_t + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2\epsilon_{t-2} + ... + \theta_q \epsilon_q$$ where $\mu$ is the mean of the process $\{X_t\}_t$ and $\epsilon_t$ is a white noise, that is, uncorrelated with zero mean and fixed variance for all t.$ For simplicity, assume that $\mu = 0.$ From equation above, $MA(q)$ model forecasts future using current and past random shocks (or stochastic terms). Does it mean that we can apply anything to forecasting in $MA(q)$ as long as it is white noise? I get confused because it seems like the model is not forecasting future $X_t$ but rather forecasting future random shock $\epsilon_{t+1}.$
