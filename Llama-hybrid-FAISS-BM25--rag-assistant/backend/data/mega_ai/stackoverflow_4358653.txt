Magento automatically re-compresses product images before displaying them on the frontend. Due to the nature of compression techniques you cannot easily target a specific file size as it depends a lot on the amount of detail in a picture. A plain "large" (wide and tall) image can result in a smaller file than a complex "small" (narrow and short) image. First check the file sizes being served to customers and then decide if it's worth pursuing.
