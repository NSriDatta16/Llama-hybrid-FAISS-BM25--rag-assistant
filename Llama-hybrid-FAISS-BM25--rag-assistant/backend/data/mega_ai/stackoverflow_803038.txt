Depends on any number of factors: Server hardware (Especially RAM) Server configuration Data size Number of indexes and index size Storage engine Writer/reader ratio I wouldn't expect it to scale that well. More importantly, this kind of thing is to important to speculate about. Benchmark it and see for yourself. Regarding storage engine, I wouldn't dare to use anything but InnoDB for a table of that size that is both read and written to. If you run any write query that isn't a primitive insert or single row update you'll end up locking the table using MyISAM, which yields terrible performance as a result.
