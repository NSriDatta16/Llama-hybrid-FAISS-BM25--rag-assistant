When you override touchesBegan of a UIView sub class, only the touches delivered to that UIView are handled there. For its subviews you need to set UserInteractionEnabled to TRUE. And then make a subclass for your subviews through which you can delegate the touch handling back to your SuperView. If that sounds complex, just use - (UIView *)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event
