The unit for frequency is Hz which is the same as 1/s or s^-1 . To convert from frequency to length (really time) you have to compute the reciprocal value: length = 1/frequency . What is length (in ns) of one cycle on a 50 MegaHertz (MHz) computer? 1/(50*10^6 Hz) = 2*10^-8 s = 20*10^-9 s = 20 ns If the average instruction on a 2.0 GigaHertz (GHz) computer requires 2.0 cycles, how long (in ns) does the average instruction take to execute? One cycle: 1/(2*10^9 Hz) = 0.5*10^-9 s = 0.5 ns Two cycles: 1 ns
