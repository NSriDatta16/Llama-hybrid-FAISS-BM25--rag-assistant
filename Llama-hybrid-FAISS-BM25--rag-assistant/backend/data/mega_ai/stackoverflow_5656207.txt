Is it a bad idea to hack the i18n system to generate tags?

A lot of my copy has paragraphs. It would be cumbersome to wrap each paragraph in its own i18n.translate invocation. Is it a bad idea to modify the i18n system in rails so that it generates these and wraps them in tags? I guess the hard part is determining when to generate them and when not to. Are there any known solutions to this?
