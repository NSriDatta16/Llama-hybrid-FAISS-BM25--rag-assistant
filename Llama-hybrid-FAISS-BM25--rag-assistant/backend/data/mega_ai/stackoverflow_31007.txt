Pass reference to element in C# Array

I build up an array of strings with string[] parts = string.spilt(" "); And get an array with X parts in it, I would like to get a copy of the array of strings starting at element parts[x-2] Other than the obvious brute force approach (make a new array and insert strings), is there a more elegant way to do this in C#?
