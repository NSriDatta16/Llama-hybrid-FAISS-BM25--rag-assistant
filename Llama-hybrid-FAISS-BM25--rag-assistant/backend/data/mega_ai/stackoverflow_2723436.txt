You can't iterate over the keys in the style object. It's simply impossible. The best answer is what Chris said. Use Firebug in Firefox, or similar tools in the other browsers, which can do the work for you and tell you exactly what CSS properties apply to the element. (Make sure that you tell the tool to show you "user agent styles", not just styles you've added, so you can see what styles the browser applies automatically.)
