Visual web developer 2010 express autocomplete not working

I'm working with Visual Web Developer 2010 Express. I tend to bump at very strange problem. Somehow, the autocomplete function gets disabled out of nowhere in the editor, and i have no idea how to bring it back on again. There are no errors, no warnings (a javascript file). It seems that it turns off whenever i get close to a code fragment which has a link in it (ex. var sLink = " http://www.google.com/ "). This link is sure highlighted in blue and underlined. I don't understand what is going on. Whats wrong with it. When i reload the Visual developer, i CAN use the autocomplete functionality, but only ONCE , in the function containing the link. After that, nothing is done, i start writing the name of variable and no box is popin up with a list. I can go to another function which has no links in it, and it works! I am really confused. Help would be appreciated. It's really hard to work without autocomplete.
