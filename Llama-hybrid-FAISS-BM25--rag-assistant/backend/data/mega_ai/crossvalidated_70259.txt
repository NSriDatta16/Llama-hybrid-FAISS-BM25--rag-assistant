I'm just a rookie in all of this, but it seems to me that the Bayesian "Prior * Likelihood = Posterior" model is simple and flexible, which means "convenient". For example, your priors are explicitly stated and your procedure does not change because you choose different priors. I could look at your analysis and decide that different priors seem more realistic and could otherwise use the same procedure as you. I may be oversimplifying here, but my feeling about frequentist methods is that they tend to have implicit prior-like assumptions and you choose your method based on what assumptions you accept. Priors can easily be used to keep your posteriors away from awkward boundary conditions (negative values for counts, for example). The Bayesian procedure is also naturally iterative and mirrors the scientific process: the results of prior experiments/theory become your priors, and the posteriors of your experiment naturally become priors for further experimentation. Posteriors are convenient because they are not points or even intervals, but rather distributions. This makes it convenient to do various things without complicated follow-on analysis. For example, if you want to determine if two parameters are equal, you can simply look at the differences of their posterior samples, take appropriate quantiles, and decide whether they are equal (difference near zero) or not. A frequentist test can reject or fail to reject the null. A Bayesian analysis has three possibilities: accept, reject, and not-enough-information. It's convenient when you can actually accept a hypothesis rather than failing to reject it. As EpiGrad says, Credible Intervals match human intuition and actually answer the question that most of us have. They're simple to calculate and don't require a model to do so: for a 95% CI you take the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of your posterior. Simple. As EpiGrad also says, some people may be confusing MCMC and Bayesian methods, since real-world Bayesina analysis will almost always be MCMC-based. MCMC is a nice, generic black-box procedure, which is convenient -- you could live your whole Bayesian life in BUGS, JAGS, or Stan. Convenient. Though, of course, there can be a lot of tuning and analyzing involved in determining that the MCMC procedure ha actually converged and actually explores the entire density. Which might be the dark underbelly of Bayesian statistics.
