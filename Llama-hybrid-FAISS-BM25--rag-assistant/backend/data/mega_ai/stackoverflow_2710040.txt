12 of my clients and each of them has an average of 2100 customers This is an easy call: it's a one-to-many relationship between clients and customers, so why not have two tables with a foreign key relationship between them? The JOIN won't cost you much. I'd recommend normalizing it. The number of rows is trivial. Make sure you add a UNIQUE constraint to the email address column in the customer table.
