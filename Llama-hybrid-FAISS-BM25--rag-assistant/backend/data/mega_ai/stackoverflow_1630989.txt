Convert XML to rows

Let's say i've got xml stored in a database. It contains a list of contacts, like so: Irwin Home, In a place 7771234 6311234 6352234 6352238 It's stored in an xml column in a sql server database, in a table with this structure: TABLE [Contacts]( [ID] [bigint] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, [Info] [xml] NOT NULL, [Status] [tinyint] NOT NULL, [CreateTime] [datetime] NOT NULL, ) ON [PRIMARY] I would like to write a query which converts the Contact elements into rows of a new table, matched with the ID field of the Contacts table. I've tried this: SELECT Cast(Request.query('/Person/Contact/text()') as varchar(100)) as [Number], ID FROM Contacts But it pulls all the data from a given xml fragment in the column and puts it all in one row together with the ID of that row, like this: Number, ID 7771234631123463522346352238, 1500 When what i would like to get is this: Number, ID 7771234, 1500 6311234, 1500 6352234, 1500 6352238, 1500 Can you point me in the right direction?
