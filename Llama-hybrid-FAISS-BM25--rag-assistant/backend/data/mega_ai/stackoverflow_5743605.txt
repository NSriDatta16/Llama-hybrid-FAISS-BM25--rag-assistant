Mixing PostgreSQL and MongoDB (as Django backends)

I'm thinking about shifting my site's backend to Mongo from Postgres for performance reasons, but key parts of the site rely on the GeoDjango models to calculate distances between objects in the real world (and so on). Would it be feasible to have most of the site running on Mongo but those key areas using Postgres for storage? Is this painful and / or error-prone? Is there an all-Mongo solution I'm missing? Any light you can shed on these matters for me would be much appreciated.
