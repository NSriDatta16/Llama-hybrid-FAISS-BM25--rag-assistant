Creating probabilistic model to estimate probable radiosonde landing zones from predictions

First of all I'd like to say that I'm new to statistics and machine learning, however I have basic understanding of Bayes' theorem and basic statistics and probability. My problem is as follows: I have a large dataset containing value pairs. First of them is predicted landing point of meteorogical radiosonde, second value is the actual point where the radiosonde landed, both as geographic coordinates. I wanted to create a probabilistic model that would enable me to map out the most probable zones where a radiosonde is expected to land based on single input, which would be the predicted landing point of said radiosonde. I was thinking of using multivariate normal distribution and writing iterative algorithm, but I'm not sure if this is the best approach, and if it is, I'm not sure what my Sigma would be in this case. Thanks for any help!
