For all those requirements, there's only two companies to choose from: Telerik and DevExpress . Both have fantastic support and incredible ASP.NET products. They release often, and are known to be constantly adding new controls. I had to decide between the two about a year ago, and went with DevExpress because of the productivity tools included. The difference I see between these two companies and larger competitors like Infragistics is they are dedicated to making the best quality and best performing products possible.
