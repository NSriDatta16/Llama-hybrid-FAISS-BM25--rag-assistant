Chi-Square transformation on a partially unknown matrix

This question is a follow up to Hellinger transformation with relative data . I want to chi-square-transform my species abundance table, which represents only a fraction of the total species table. I know the total count for each row (the row sums), but nothing else; the missing columns are unknown to me. Is it still possible to perform the chi square transformation? According to the vegan vignette on the R function decostand i need to know the column, row, and matrix sums. If so, what could a possible function in R look like? Thank you.
