Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem, but I don't think it has anything to do with the "page switching". If you turn on both pages at the same time and try to drag "Box 1" to a position above "Box 4", you'll see that it doesn't trigger that "Box 4"'s Sortable has received the Draggable until you go below "Box 4". This doesn't solve your problem, but perhaps will help you look in a better area for the solution. See http://jsfiddle.net/nkBNP/7/ for a JSFiddle that demonstrates what I mean.
