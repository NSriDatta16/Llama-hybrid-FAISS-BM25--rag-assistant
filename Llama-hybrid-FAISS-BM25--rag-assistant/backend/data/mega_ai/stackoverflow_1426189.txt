How can I combine overlapping path segments to get the full path in Perl?

I'm really not loving Perl but I've got to use it for my current task. Here is my problem... I have three strings, that make up elements of a full directory path (windows, but needs to work on *nix too). For example... $root = "c:\\checkout\\omega"; $client = "abc\\mainline"; $build = "omega\\abc\\mainline\\host\\make"; I want to combine these to make a full path e.g. "c:\\checkout\\omega\\abc\\mainline\\host\\make" But there is overlap between the $build string and the $root and/or $client string. How can I combine these to get the full path and ignore the overlapping. $client can probably be ignored in this example but there are other cases where $build may overlap $client but not $root . I can think of lots horrible messy ways to implement it but I assume (perhaps wrongly) that there is a simple, clean and maybe even elegant way of doing this since Perl is mainly about the text manipulation. Some kind of string OR operation maybe. I foolishly tried... ($root . $client) | $build But it is a bitwise operation and the result is junk!
