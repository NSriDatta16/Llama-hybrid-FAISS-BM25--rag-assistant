Best method for Website Automation?

Let me rephrase the question... Here's the scenario: As an insurance agent you are constantly working with multiple insurance websites. For each website I need to login and pull up a client. I am looking to automate this process. I currently have a solution built for iMacros but that requires a download/installation. I'm looking for a solution using the .NET framework that will allow the user to provide their login credentials and information about a client and I will be able to automate this process for them. This will involve knowledge of each specific website which is fine, I will have all of that information. I would like for this process to be able to happen in the background and then launch the website to the user once the action is performed.
