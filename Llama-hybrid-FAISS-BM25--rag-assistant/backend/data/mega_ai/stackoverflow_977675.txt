Custom sorting on UltraWebGrid - ASP .NET

How can I accomplish custom sorting on the Infragistics UltraWebGrid? I've tried to hadle the SortColumn event and it works, however, whenever I click the column header, the columns are sorted via JavaScript in the website before the event is fired in the server side? How do I stop the grid from sorting in the client? Thanks, Leandro Fernandez
