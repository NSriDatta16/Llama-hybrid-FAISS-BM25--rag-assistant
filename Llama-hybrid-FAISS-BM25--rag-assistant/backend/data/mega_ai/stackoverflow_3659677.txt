Yes, you are basically right. The server is listening on some port (the one you set) but when you accept a connection it will attribute a new connected socket number. If you do not see connected sockets using netstat, it's probably because you do not call it with the right options. You should have one LISTEN connection on the server port, and one ESTABLISHED connection with an allocated local port for each active remote connection. You could also have some remains of terminated connection (poorly terminated) with the TIME WAIT state. Below is some extract from my system current status (got with netstat -anlp on Linux) tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:3389 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 27002/rdpproxy tcp 0 0 10.10.4.185:3389 10.10.4.13:36725 ESTABLISHED 27233/rdpproxy The server is 10.10.4.185, and is listening on port 3389. Any remote IP and remote port is allowed to connect. The second line show a connected session. The remote address is 10.10.4.13 and reserve the port 36725 for this address. Hence you can open plenty connection from 10.10.4.185 (tenth of thousands) and still more from other systems. And, no, that does not mean your server will be able to accept infinite number of connection, your system can go out of ressources and will fail to open new connections well before that limit.
