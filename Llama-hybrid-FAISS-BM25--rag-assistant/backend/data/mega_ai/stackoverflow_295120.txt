How can I mark a C++ class method as deprecated?

I have a method in a C++ interface that I want to deprecate, with portable code. When I Googled for this all I got was a Microsoft specific solution; #pragma deprecated and __declspec(deprecated) . If a general or fully-portable deprecation solution is not available, I will accept as a "second prize solution" one that can be used multiple specific compilers, like MSVC and a GCC.
