Make a Spark TitleWindow modal without using much AS3?

I want to be able to show a Spark TitleWindow container as a modal without having to construct it by code via AS3. I tried creating the TitleWindow before-hand manually by dragging and resizing it around and adding objects, etc then hiding it. Then on a button, I set the called function to the ones below: public function doPopup():void { testWindow.visible = true; PopUpManager.addPopUp(testWindow, this, true); } Unfortunately, this only shows testWindow but not as a modal. I want it to be like this so that I can freely resize and design the layout of my TitleWindow and only have to call some function to show it as a modal one.
