I also agree on having a LoadSettings/SaveSettings set of functions that are called when creating the form/ when closing the application. As a store location for the application's settings I recommend using the Isolated Storage . As an addition, depending on the controls you are using on your form, you could have the options of saving their status in XML format format and then restoring it next time. For example Infragistics controls offer this possibility(e.g UltraDockManager , UltraToolbarManager have a SaveAsXml/LoadFromXml pair of functions).
