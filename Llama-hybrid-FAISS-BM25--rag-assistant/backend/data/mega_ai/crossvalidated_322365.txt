You are correct that logistic regression requires features that are uncorrelated in nature. There are different techniques for handling correlation for these cases like - Variable clustering ( http://facultyweb.kennesaw.edu/jpriestl/courses/binary/RBS%20PAPER.pdf ) followed by variable elimination, variable elimination using Information Value etc. After following these steps, you might still have correlation in the final model variables. To handle such cases, one must compute Variable Inflation Factor (VIF) for all the final variables. As a general rule of thumb no variable should have VIF > 2. If this is the case, remove the variable with the highest VIF, re-run the model and repeat the same steps till all variables have VIF An advantage of using standardization is comparing the relative importance of variables in the final model. If all the variables are on the same scale, the variables with the highest coefficients are more potent in predicting your target variables.
