To complements @Phil's answers and the excellent SPMF Library: Seq2Pat: Sequence-to-Pattern Generation Library might be relevant to your case. The library is written in Cython to take advantage of a fast C++ backend with a high-level Python interface. It supports constraint-based frequent sequential pattern mining. Here is an example that shows how to mine a sequence database while respecting an average constraint for the prices of the patterns found. # Example to show how to find frequent sequential patterns # from a given sequence database subject to constraints from sequential.seq2pat import Seq2Pat, Attribute # Seq2Pat over 3 sequences seq2pat = Seq2Pat(sequences=[["A", "A", "B", "A", "D"], ["C", "B", "A"], ["C", "A", "C", "D"]]) # Price attribute corresponding to each item price = Attribute(values=[[5, 5, 3, 8, 2], [1, 3, 3], [4, 5, 2, 1]]) # Average price constraint seq2pat.add_constraint(3 Notice that sequences can be of different lengths, and you can add/drop other Attributes and Constraints. The sequences can be any string, as in the example, or integers. The underlying algorithm uses Multi-valued Decision Diagrams , and in particular, the state-of-the-art algorithm from AAAI 20019 .
