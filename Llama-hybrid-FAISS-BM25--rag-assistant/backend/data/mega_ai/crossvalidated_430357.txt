I wanted to add some papers from the orthogonal/double machine learning literature that is becoming popular in the Applied Econometrics literature. Belloni, Alexandre, Victor Chernozhukov, and Christian Hansen. "Inference on treatment effects after selection among high-dimensional controls." The Review of Economic Studies 81.2 (2014): 608-650. This paper addresses the theoretical properties of an OLS estimate of the effect of a variable after selecting the "other" controls using LASSO. Victor Chernozhukov, Denis Chetverikov, Mert Demirer, Esther Duflo, Christian Hansen, Whitney Newey, James Robins, Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters, The Econometrics Journal, Volume 21, Issue 1, 1 February 2018, Pages C1â€“C68, https://doi.org/10.1111/ectj.12097 This develops the comprehensive theory for using a number of non-parametric methods (ML algorithms) to non-linearly control for a high-dimensional nuisance parameter (confounders) and then study the impact of a specific covariate on the outcome. They deal with partially-linear frameworks and completely parametric frameworks. They also consider situations where the variable of interest is confounded.
