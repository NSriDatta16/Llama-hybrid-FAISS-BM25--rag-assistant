You should note the following paragraph in the scipy manual : To derive the p-value, the exact distribution (mode == 'exact') can be used for sample sizes of up to 25. The default mode == 'auto' uses the exact distribution if there are at most 25 observations and no ties, otherwise a normal approximation is used (mode == 'approx'). (bolding is my own). The question remains why the results differ.
