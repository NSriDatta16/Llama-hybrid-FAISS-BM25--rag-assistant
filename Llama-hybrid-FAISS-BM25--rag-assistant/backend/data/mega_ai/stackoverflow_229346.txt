Why should I never use an unsafe block to modify a string?

I have a String which I would like to modify in some way. For example: reverse it or upcase it. I have discovered that the fastest way to do this is by using a unsafe block and pointers. For example: unsafe { fixed (char* str = text) { *str = 'X'; } } Are there any reasons why I should never ever do this?
