Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop uses the term $1$-of-$K$ scheme. Here is a quote from the book, Binary variables can be used to describe quantities that can take one of two possible values. Often, however, we encounter discrete variables that can take on one of $K$ possible mutually exclusive states. Although there are various alternative ways to express such variables, we shall see shortly that a particularly convenient representation is the $1$-of-$K$ scheme in which the variable is represented by a $K$-dimensional vector $\textbf{x}$ in which one of the elements $x_k$ equals $1$, and all remaining elements equal $0$. So, for instance if we have a variable that can take $K = 6$ states and a particular observation of the variable happens to correspond to the state where $x_3 = 1$, then $\textbf{x}$ will be represented by, $\textbf{x} = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)^{T}$
