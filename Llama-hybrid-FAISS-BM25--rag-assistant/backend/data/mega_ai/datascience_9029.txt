tf-idf vectors are an easy start, but it can be hard to cluster very high dimensional data. You might try topic modeling (LDA, LSI for example) to reduce the dimensionality of your features. A newer approach is paragraph vectors , which learn a distributed representation of arbitrary-length text. Here is an implementation in python. Learning a reasonable, lower dimensional representation of the text can help with the issues that arise trying to cluster high dimensional data.
