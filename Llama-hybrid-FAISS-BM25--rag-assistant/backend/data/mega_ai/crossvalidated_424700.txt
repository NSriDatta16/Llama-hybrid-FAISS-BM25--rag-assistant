There can be three alternatives 1) Starting with a toy datasets like "Habermann's survival" on Kaggle and gradually attempting more complex problems 2) If you are more comfortable with a book and your focus is how to use Python and related frameworks and libraries then you can try "Practical Machine Learning With Python" by Dipanjan Sarkar, Raghav Bali, and Tushar Sharma. This book will help you to understand feature engineering and what are the possible algorithms for specific kind of data or situations. OR another similar book is "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido 3) "An Introduction to statistical learning with application in R" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani - Code problems in this books are in "R" but they can be easily implemented in Python.
