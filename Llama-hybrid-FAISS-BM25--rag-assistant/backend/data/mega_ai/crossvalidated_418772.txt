Why do you get the impression that the future random shocks $\epsilon_{t+1}$ is predicted? That would not make any sense, since in the model the series of random shocks $\dotsc,\epsilon_t, \epsilon_{t+1},\dotsc$ is supposed to represent white noise , which by definition can't be ( usefully ) forecast, since it is independent of the past. So, what is forecast in this model is the future observation $X_{t+1}$ . For more information about MA models see Moving-average model error terms .
