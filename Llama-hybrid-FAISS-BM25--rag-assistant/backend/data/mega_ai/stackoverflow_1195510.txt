I have been using Rspec for a year or so. I switched from Test::Unit specifically because I could print in a human readable way what is being tested. It reads like prose. Which is big plus for me. But as with everything results will vary. describe Model do it "should do what I want" do this.should == that it.should be_nil that.should_not be_true end end Also reguardless of test framework you should also think about a coverage tool like RCov . It integrates with rspec and will tell you where your code lacks testing.
