Execution time limit for a Lua script called from the C API

luaL_loadfile(mState, path.c_str()); lua_pcall(mState, 0, 0, 0); Is there a way to put an execution time limit (say 10-20 seconds) for those two C++ statements, that load and then execute a lua file? Since the Lua file is untrusted I don't want a malicious user to hang the program indefinitely with an infinite loop in the Lua code. Tagging C because the Lua API is C, tagging C++ because I'm using C++
