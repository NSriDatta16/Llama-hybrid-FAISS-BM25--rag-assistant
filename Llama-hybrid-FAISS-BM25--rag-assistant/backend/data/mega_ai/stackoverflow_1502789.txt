If I understand your question correctly, you want to know what is more efficient: Use comments and expandable sections. Use moddeling techniques. I think it depends on personal style. Modeling can be great, but has dangers of spending too much time creating nice pictures. We have a large app 500k+ lines. We do not use collapsable sections because we keep our file size acceptable and we have a good file organisation structure. We sometimes use modeling if complex parts are added (class diagrams and state diagrams). And we use lots of comment to explain difficult parts.
