My understanding is that there is a function $F$ that takes examples $x_i, y_i$ and compares them $F(x_i)>F(y_i)$. However, $F$ is unknown, i.e. we do not know the values $u_i=F(x_i)$ and $v_i=F(y_i)$. The only thing we know is the preference $x_i\succ y_i$ or $x_i \prec y_i$. We have data for $i=1,\dots,n$. Under these assumptions, the only possible approach is 1. because for 2. and 3. we do not have the data $u_i,v_i$. However, you can emulate the Regression B approach in the following way: To create a MLP The last neuron is a softmax There are two neurons that go to the last one. Each of them has the same neural network behind it, one taking inputs for $x_i$, the second for $y_i$. The "same neural network" may require changes in the backpropagation. However, this change may not be necessary if you enter each pair twice (first winner, second loser) Another option could be to use Bayesian network which could lead to easily interpretable results: http://users.dsic.upv.es/~pgupta/pdf/gupta-mtech-thesis.pdf
