Instead of using Naive Bayes have you thought to use another classifier as for instance a 4.5 decision tree? Here you a have a built-in feature selection technique (information gain) that would make it possible to visualize (by looking at the inner node splits) which features contribute to which class. However, i'm not sure if decision trees are interpretable with 25k features. What about classic approaches like PCA principle component analysis) or factor analysis? What about forward/backward feature ellimination? Give them a try. Here is an comparision of several FS-techniques: http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcin_Blachnik/publication/226749677_Comparison_of_Various_Feature_Selection_Methods_in_Application_to_Prototype_Best_Rules/links/0046351d6cb319daed000000.pdf
