This page http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/JSON_Spirit.aspx speaks of two methods to link with the Json spirit library from c++. I imagine your problem is that one or more of the header files includes a #pragma to automatically link certain libraries, the compiler can't find one of these libraries, namely json_spirit_lib.lib This might be because of compiler level set up (default library directories); project set up (linker input and libray directories) or simply that you don't have the required .lib files in the source directories.
