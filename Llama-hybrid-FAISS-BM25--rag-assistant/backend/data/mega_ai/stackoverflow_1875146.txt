It sounds like you want an AJAXy type solution. Checkout the Taconite plugin for jQuery. I use this for populating pulldowns, etc. on forms. Works very nicely. As for being "generic" ... you might have standard methods on your container classes that return lists of children and then have a template fragmen t that knows how to format that in some 'standard' way.
