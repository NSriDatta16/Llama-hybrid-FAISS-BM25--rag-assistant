There's nothing built into the DataGridView that can help you do that. Your option is obviously Custom Controls. I'm sure Infragistics UltraGrid has something like that, but in case you don't want to spend the money, you could roll your own. It might actually not be that hard. Here's the simple way to do it. Always bind your datagridview to a DataTable, and then when you want to add the expression, you add a new DataColumn and set the Expression property. Here's some info on the DataColumn's expression property. From MSDN We've done something similiar to that at work and it actually works quite well. Good luck!
