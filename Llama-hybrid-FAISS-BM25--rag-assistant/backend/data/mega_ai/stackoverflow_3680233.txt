The required file is not in the maven repositories, but it is in the datanucleus zip file (that one with all dependencies). Look into the /deps folder. I unpacked it and installed it into the local maven repository with this command: ./mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/home/myUser/Downloads/db4o-7.12.126.14142-all-java5.jar -DgroupId=db4o -DartifactId=db4o -Dversion=7.12.126.14142-all-java5 -Dpackaging=jar After that it is found by maven. Now there are other problems going on. I'll try to solve them myself... Seems like the JDO or Datanucleus stuff is not well organized at the moment. I think they refactored some classes and now they can't be found at some versions and implementations are incompatible with the api and such stuff.
