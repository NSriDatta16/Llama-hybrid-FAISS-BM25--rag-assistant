Unfortunately renewing does not seem to work in my case. My Ad Hoc Distribution Profile is about to expire in 5 days. I got warnings about that on the iPhone and the Xcode Organizer shows a warning sign next to it as well. In Apple's provisioning portal it was marked as inactive and there was a button to reactivate it. But still with the same expiry date, 5 days from now. Next, I added two more iPhones to it, yet, the changed profile still expires 5 days from now. Finally, I deleted the profile in the provisioning portal and created a new one from scratch, using a different name, yet this new one still expires on April 13th, 5 days from now! That is really frustrating! So I guess I have to wait until after it expires and create a new one then. In case you are wondering if my developer subscription runs out, it is not. I just renewed it in February.
