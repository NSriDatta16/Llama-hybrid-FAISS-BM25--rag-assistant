Confusion matrix and ROC curves

I have built a model to predict Upsell probability. When I use the function confusionMatirx from caret package, I get the following results: > confusionMatrix(data = predict_svm_test_5, test_td$UpSell_Ind) Confusion Matrix and Statistics Reference Prediction 0 1 0 7976 2886 1 217 644 Accuracy : 0.7353 95% CI : (0.7272, 0.7433) No Information Rate : 0.6989 P-Value [Acc > NIR] : However, I expected to see the confusion matrix as follows: Reference Prediction 1 0 1 644 217 0 2886 7976 Specificity(TPR): 0.9735 Sensitivity(TNR): 0.1824 1 meaning there was an Upsell (Event) and 0 meaning no Upsell (No Event) based on the PDF of Caret Package. Link is here Page 24, 25 Now my question: How do I interpret the results of confusionMatrix? The values given by the function are different from values that I calculate. Thanks in advance for the help.
