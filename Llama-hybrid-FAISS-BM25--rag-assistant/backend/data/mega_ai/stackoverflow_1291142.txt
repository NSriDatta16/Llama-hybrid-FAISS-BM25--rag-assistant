NVM, no odbc interface, but it is DBI like (seeing as DBI doesn't use odbc except in DBD::ODBC) libdbi - http://libdbi.sourceforge.net/ libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C, similar to the DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code, programmers can leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple simultaneous database connections by using this framework. In order to utilize the libdbi framework, you need to install drivers for a particular type of database. The drivers officially supported by libdbi are split off into the libdbi-drivers project. The current version of libdbi (0.8.3) is supposed to work with any 0.8.x release of libdbi-drivers. Currently the following database engines are supported: * Firebird/Interbase * FreeTDS (provides access to MS SQL Server and Sybase) * MySQL * PostgreSQL * SQLite/SQLite3
