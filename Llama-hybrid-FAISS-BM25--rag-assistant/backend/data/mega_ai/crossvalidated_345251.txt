Coordinate prediction parameterization in object detection networks

State of the art object detection networks, such as RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, and YOLO, use a coordinate encoding where the bounding box regression is given relative to the anchor box: Centers: $t_x = (x-x_a)/w_a$ and $t_y = (y-y_a)/h_a$ Height and width offsets: $t_w = \log(w/w_a)$ and $t_h = \log(h/h_a)$ Why is the width and height prediction in logarithmic format ? Is there a optimization reason for this?
