That's a moderately hard problem. I think I would start by making simple things possible to rephrase a Perl slogan: Learn about the two or three sparse matrix package for R like slam, SparseM, .... Pick one you prefer and learn how to efficiently build a sparse matrix, presumably from triplets such as (x,y,value) to encode value at position (x,y) . Write Perl code to emit your sparse matrix in that form to a tempfile. Read that tempfile in R and build your sparse matrix. Fancier and faster cross-language serialization can come later. It's not a trivial problem.
