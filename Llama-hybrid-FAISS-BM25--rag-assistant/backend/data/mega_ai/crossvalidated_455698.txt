Why does logistic regression's likelihood function have no closed form?

The derivative of Log likelihood function of logistic regression with respect to theta is Why can't we equate it to zero and solve for theta so that we can obtain a 'closed form solution' for theta? Is it because of the non linearity of theta in the equation? Can OLS method in linear regression which is a closed form solution, be categorized as a 'linear optimization' technique? (unlike gradient descent which is a 'non-linear optimization' method?)
