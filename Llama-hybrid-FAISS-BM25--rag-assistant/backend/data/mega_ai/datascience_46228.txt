How mean and deviation come out with MNIST dataset?

I am a novice at the data science, and I notice some repository state the mean value and deviation in MNIST dataset are 0.1307 and 0.3081 . I cannot imagine how these two numbers come from. Based on my understanding, the MNIST dataset has 60,000 pics and each of them has (28 * 28 = 784) features. How do I convert this feature vectors to get the mean and deviation? Especially, this should classify by the label, right? For example, the number 0 should have its mean and deviation . For number 1 should also have its mean and deviation .
