OpenMP on Intel i7

I have a problem with openMP in i7 CPU. I have used openMP just to parallel a 'for' loop. Algorithm was used on several different PC's and worked without any problem. Recently, we tried to run it on i7 system and we got a problem on it. Software usually runs for some time and after several cycles it reported "not enough memory" and we tried to find a memory leak, but instead we found that the used stack size of the software was too big - there were a lot of 1Mb threads not closed. Somehow threads created by the openMP were all stuck in the stack and memory was filled with them. Did anyone experienced ever such a behavior? The code is very simple, just a 'pragma omp parallel for' with some cycle, which works ok on other PC's. I am using Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0 compiler with build-in openMP library. Thank you Sergei
