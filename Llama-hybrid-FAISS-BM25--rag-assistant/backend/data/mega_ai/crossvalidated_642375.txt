How can the random forest algorithm deal with the fact of not having strictly independent observations?

I have a data set with calls from two species of birds of the same genus. For each species there are 10 subjects and different numbers of calls for each (range of 1-8 calls per subject). Measurements of peak frequency, duration, bandwidth, etc. were made for each call. Species A (calls=48; subjects=10) Species B (calls=37; subjects=10) Predictor variables (n=9) I think I could classify the calls using random forest and thus know which variables are most important to classify both species. But I wonder: if subject 1 of species A has 3 calls, and subject 2 has 5 calls. Am I in a pseudoreplication situation? How can the random forest algorithm deal with the fact of not having strictly independent observations because they are different call's from the same subject?
