Are there any statistics to see if a categorical variable produces good segments within a scatter plot?

Within a scatterplot of two continuous variables. I am looking for a statistical method to determine if a 3rd variable that has a limited number of categories/groups (3-8) is able to produce visually well-defined segments within the original scatter plot. The following scatterplot would be a example of a good segmentation: It is clear from this scatter plot that the different scatters are well grouped and are distinct from the other. Compare that with this one: This one doesn't have any distinct groups. It may be true that there is some significant correlation/association for all three, i.e., the greater the population, the greater the area, but there are no clear "segments" here. Initially I have had the idea of measuring the average distance from centroid, and calculate the percentage of dots of a group that are not intersecting with other groups excluding outliers (e.g. IQR method). This could work, but how would I get statistics from it that would signify a good vs bad segmentation? And before I reinvent the wheel, I wanted to check if there are any known/used statistics already. Or perhaps a test for unimodality of the residuals (dip test)? If it is not unimodal I could try to get the modes? Anyhow, any pointers to robust methods appreciated. Addendum: I've applied Christian's Hennig's answer using a Calinski-Harabasz Index to dervive the stats. For reference, I published the results here (PDF). The plots are ordered by p values with the Null Hypothesis of independence. p
