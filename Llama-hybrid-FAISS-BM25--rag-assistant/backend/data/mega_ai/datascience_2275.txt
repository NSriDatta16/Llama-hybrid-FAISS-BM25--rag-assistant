What are the parameter estimation methods for the two methods in this paper?

Automated Time Series Forecasting for Biosurveillance in the above paper, page 4, two models, non-adaptive regression model, adaptive regression model, the non-adaptive regression model's parameter estimation method is "least squares", what is the parameter estimation for the adaptive regression model? is there any package in R to do parameter estimation for this kind of adaptive regression model? If I add more predictors in the adaptive regression model, can R still solve it? and how?
