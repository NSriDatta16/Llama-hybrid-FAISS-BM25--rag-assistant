var user_window=window.open('http://www.someplace.com','someplace_window_name','toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,status=yes,menubar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,width=1024,height=768'); user_window.focus(); A user click should initiate this, or it will be blocked by most popup blockers. This works in all browsers I've had to support including IE6+, FF, Opera, Safari. The focus bit ensures that the new window is brought to the front. As an alternative to a popup window, I'd suggest the Dialog plugin for Jquery. That's what I replaced 90% of my popup windows with. Your popup becomes a popover (bound within the original window), and this as far as I can tell is never blocked by a popup blocker. The Dialog plugin allows dragable popovers, appearance and disappear effects, and lots of other cool stuff.
