Suppose you wonder about the percentage of likely voters who would currently vote for Candadate X in an upcoming election. X seems to get more favorable press than his opponent, but there have not yet been any professionally conducted polls. Because elections for this office often tend to be close, you might think a reasonable prior distribution for X's share $p$ of the vote would be $\mathsf{Beta}(35, 30).$ This prior distribution has mean $\mu = 35/65 = 7/13 = 0.5385,$ and about 95% of its probability in the interval $(0.42, 0.66),$ and density function $f(x) \propto p^{36}(1-p)^{31}.$ where the symbol $\propto$ (read "proportional to") indicates that we have written the 'kernel' of the prior distribution without the "norming" constant that makes it integrate to unity over $(0,1).$ (The normalizing constant in @Tim's answer does not need to be evaluated.) qbeta(c(.025,.975), 35,30) [1] 0.4174763 0.6572035 Admittedly, many other similar prior distributions might have been chosen, but Bayesian statistics allows 'personal' probabilities, and this prior distribution, which gives a slight edge to Candidate X, while coming nowhere near suggesting he is sure to win, seems about right to you. Next, suppose a reliable poll of $n = 500$ randomly chosen voters shows $x = 335$ in favor of Candidate X. This binomial likelihood function $$g(x|p) = {500 \choose 335}p^{335}(1 - p)^{165} \propto p^{335}(1 - p)^{165}.$$ [In frequentist statistics, the maximum likelihood estimate of $p$ based only on the poll would be $\hat p = 335/500 = 0.67.]$ According to Bayes' Theorem, the posterior distribution of $p$ is found by multiplying the prior distribution by the likelihood function $$h(p|x)\, =\, f(p)\times g(x|p)\, \propto\, p^{36}(1-p)^{31} \times p^{335}(1 - p)^{165}\\ \propto\, p^{391}(1-p)^{196},$$ where we recognize the final member above as the kernel of the distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(390, 195).$ Thus the posterior mean is $390/(290+196) \approx 0.802$ and a 95% posterior probability interval (credible interval) is $(0.608, 0.688).$ So, at this stage of the campaign Candidate X has a very comfortable lead. qbeta(c(.025,.975),360,195) [1] 0.6084775 0.6878051 The relatively uninformative prior has less influence on the posterior distribution than does the poll of 500 potential voters. However, the Bayesian credible interval applies to the current election. If we believe the prior distribution was realistic and that the poll is carefully done and free of bias, we can believe the credible interval. Notes: (1) The beta prior distribution and the binomial likelihood are of compatible algebraic form. One says that they are conjugate. In this example, conjugacy makes it easy to find the posterior distribution. (2) An Agresti-Cooil 95% CI for $p$ based only on the likelihood would be $(0.628, 0.710).$ But many frequentists would not associate this CI directly with the current election, but with the long run behavior of similar elections. p.est = 337/504 p.est + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*sqrt(p.est*(1-p.est)/504) [1] 0.6275571 0.7097445
