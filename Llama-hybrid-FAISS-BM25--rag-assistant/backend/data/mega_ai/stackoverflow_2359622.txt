File upload limited to 1MB?

I can't understand why my server isn't accepting files larger than 1MB. I am using cpanel and my host has told me that I can't edit my php.ini file directly. My upload code: File Upload Thank you. The file has been successfully uploaded. Name: &nbsp;' . $fileName . ' Size: &nbsp;' . $fileSize . 'k' . ' Type: &nbsp;' . $fileType . ' '; $file_id = mysql_insert_id(); echo " Manage details View details "; exit; } ?> File Upload I was told that I could create my own php.ini file and save it on cpanel file manager to override some of the php.ini values. This is what I have on it at the moment: //Common local changes: upload_max_filesize = 20M; // (default 8 - Max, 32) post_max_size = 20M; // (Average, 20 - Max, 32) register_globals = Off; // (off by default - you can turn On) allow_url_fopen = On; // (off by default - you can turn to On) memory_limit = 24M; // (default of 8M, Max 32) but it has no effect! Any suggestions?
