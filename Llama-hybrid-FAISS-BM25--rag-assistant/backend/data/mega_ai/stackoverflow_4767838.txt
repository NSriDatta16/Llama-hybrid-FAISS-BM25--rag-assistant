I would setup 3 VMs ( VirtualBox is free), one for each platform. Install TeamCity (or Hudson) on Linux and agents on the other VMs and then it's just a matter of configuring the build system. At the very basic level you should have 2 tasks: one to checkout the sources from Subversion and another to invoke scons . I'm not too familiar with Hudson but TeamCity is certainly capable of generating reports of a build, display progress etc.
