Update I did find the following (at: http://www.databaseforum.info/8/504107.aspx ) TRIED AND IT WORKS: ContentElement, one of the base classes of Paragraph and incidentally the base class of just about everything that lives in a document defines the properties and events you are looking for. In Code void MyCode() { Paragraph p = new Paragraph(); p.MouseEnter += p_MouseEnter; } void p_MouseEnter(object sender, EventArgs e) { Paragraph p = (Paragraph)sender; p.Background = Brushes.Red; } **In Markup** **You can also trigger on properties like IsMouseOver in styles**
