Move NSView around until it hits a border

In a Cocoa-based App i'm having a canvas for drawing, inherited from NSView, as well as a rectangle, also inherited from NSView. Dragging the rectangle around inside of the canvas is no problem: -(void)mouseDragged:(NSEvent *)theEvent { NSPoint myOrigin = self.frame.origin; [self setFrameOrigin:NSMakePoint(myOrigin.x + [theEvent deltaX], myOrigin.y - [theEvent deltaY])]; } Works like a charm. The issue i'm having now: How can i prevent the rectangle from being moved outside the canvas? So, first of all i would like to fix this just for the left border, adapting the other edges afterwards. My first idea is: "check whether the x-origin of the rectangle is negative". But: once it is negative the rectangle can't be moved anymore around (naturally). I solved this with moving the rectangle to zero x-offset in the else-branch. This works but it's ... ugly. So i'm little puzzled with this one, any hints? Definitely the solution is really near and easy. That easy, that i cannot figure it out (as always with easy solutions ;). Regards Macs
