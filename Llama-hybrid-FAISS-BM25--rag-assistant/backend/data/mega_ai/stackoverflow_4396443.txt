Activating google analytics using curl?

I need to execute a google analytics script on a site using curl. What are the reporting features that will be available to me for that curl request ? To make my question more clearer, suppose i have a website www.abc.com which has analytics code on it and if i connect to www.abc.com from www.xyz.com using curl, in the analytics report of www.abc.com will the request i made using curl show ? What are the parameters that wont show ? since there is no navigator there wouldnt be screen resolutions, color depth, or any other javascript based features. any other reporting features that wouldn't be available to me ? I need the following to show up : user agent (which i will be sending by setting header) referrer (again which i will be sending by setting header) source ip address and location (using proxies for different countries) one issue that Im unsure of is Google's cookies and whether (since i might also be using proxies) these need to be cleared. The ultimate outcome is that I need to be able emulate site traffic as if it is coming from a variety of visitors.... IF the entire thing is not technically possible,is there any other way i can simulate diverse traffic into my google analytics account ?
