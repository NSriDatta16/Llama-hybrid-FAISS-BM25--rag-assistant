Use an image editing tool to slice your image into the necessary images to make your page. Knowing where and what to slice comes with experience, but here are some pointers - All images are rectangular, therefore it might help to think about "columns" and "rows" when doing the slicing. But please only use tables for table data and not for layout :) If you have a repeating pattern in an image, slice the smallest size of image that will allow the pattern to tesselate and use css to repeat it. Use the right image type for the right job e.g. .gifs for small animations, .png for overlays, .jpg for photos, etc. The wiki page may be of help here Use the right image file size and dimensions for the job. I usually try to make the images file size as small as possible without losing the overall effect of the image. Remember, larger images = more bandwidth = longer to download Once you have your images, I'd recommend looking at using Firefox with the pixel perfect plugin and Firebug to put the page together. The pixel perfect plugin allows you to overlay an image onto a web page so that you can align everything up to match the original mock-up. Once you have a basic functioning page using HTML and CSS, I would then look at this point at introducing client-side functionality via JavaScript/ a JavaScript framework. Doing it before you've done the layout can start to get confusing, so I would get to the point where you are happy with what you have, then introduce the functionality. Doing it this way also aids progressive enhancement and encourages unobtrusive JavaScript .
