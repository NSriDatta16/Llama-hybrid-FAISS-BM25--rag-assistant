Reasoning behind using Deep Learning on non-local data

I understand the using of deep learning for data that have "local" structure, for example, images/videos/texts, as the convolutional layers reduce the amount of dimensions. However, I saw that some people use it on non-local data, as on databases for example, here or here on the titanic database. My question is: as just one hidden layer with enough neurons within can theoretically creates as many dimensions as we want, why would one use several hidden layers/deep learning instead of just using a single bigger hidden layer?
