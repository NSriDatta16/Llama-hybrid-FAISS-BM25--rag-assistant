There really are only two ways to make backup, and more important recovery, run faster: 1. backup less data and/or 2. have a bigger pipe to the backup media I think you got a lot of suggestions on how to reduce the amount of data that you back up. Basically, you should be creating a backup strategy that relies on relatively infrequent full backup and much more frequent backups of changed (since last full backup) data. I encourage you to take a look at the "Configure Automatic Maintenance" wizard in the DB2 Control Center. It will help you with creating automatic backups and with other utilities like REORG that Antonio suggested. Things like compression obviously can help as the amount of data is much lower. However, not all DB2 editions offer compression. For example, DB2 Express-C does not. Frankly, doing compression on a 200GB database may not be worth while anyway and that is precisely why free DBMS like DB2 Express-C don't offer compression. As far as openign a bigger pipe for your backup you first have to decide if you are going to backup to disk or to tape. There is a big difference in speed (obviously disk is a lot faster). Second, DB2 can paralelize backups. So, if you have multiple devices to back to, it will backup to all of them at the same time i.e. your elapsed time will be a lot less depending how many devices you have to throw at the problem. Again, DB2 Control Center can help you have it set up.
