Preprocess your dataset to create a labeled dataset as follows, the dataset you are starting with must have both existing employees and the employees already left. EmployeeID Years_of_Employment Base_Pay Years_Since_Last_Increment JobTitle Has_Left 123 10 8000 1 Manager 0 456 2 11000 2 Developer 1 Here the Has_left is the binary response variable (0: the employee has left, 1: the employee is still working) that you are interested to learn from the other feature variables (add some more predictors that you think can have impact on the attrition). Now use the above dataset to train a logistic regression model. You can use the model to predict the probability that a new employee will leave, given the values of all the dependent feature variables.
