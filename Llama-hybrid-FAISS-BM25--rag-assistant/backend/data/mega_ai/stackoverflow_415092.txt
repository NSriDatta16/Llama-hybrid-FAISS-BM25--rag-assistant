Managing date formats differences between PHP and MySQL

I'm writing my first PHP app that has to directly deal with dates, and thus to directly deal with the fact that PHP and MySQL have different date formats. My question is: what's the most elegant way to manage this difference? I have the following two functions to manage the difference using php: function mysql_date($php_date) { return date( 'Y-m-d H:i:s', $php_date ); } function php_date($mysql_date) { $val = explode(" ",$mysql_date); $date = explode("-",$val[0]); $time = explode(":",$val[1]); return mktime($time[0],$time[1],$time[2],$date[1],$date[2],$date[0]); } is there a simpler way to manage this directly within my SQL queries? Or could you suggest any other more elegant way to manage this?
