Encourage your client to use scp or sftp instead. It'll encrypt the login and traffic. Get an FTP program like WSFTP. What about the database? You need a copy of the database on the server (which is presumably where the link goes). Get the login/pass from the client. It's un-doable if you have a copy or backup of the original. FTP copies files from one machine to another. Sounds like you need to install the CMS on the server. Need more information: what CMS, is it already on the server, what database?
