I saw the 0xE8008017 when dragging a .ipa file that I created into iTunes, but NOT when dragging the .app folder directly into iTunes. Update: There seem to be lots of reasons why this can occur: 1) You should use "ditto" instead of "zip" to create the .ipa file, as that is what gets used if you use Finder and choose "Compress": ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc Folder OutputFile.ipa 2) This link has a comment explaining the error is due to stale resources, i.e. you have a file in the .app bundle that has not been code signed. Check that all the files in your binary have a corresponding entry in the CodeResources file (except those explicitly excluded in ResourceRules.plist). If you are trying to debug this problem you should check if dragging the .app folder into iTunes directly works. If it does, look for a problem with your creation of the .ipa file. On another occasion when I changed my Info.plist 'Bundle identifier' from com.domain.appname to appid.com.domain.appname it made iTunes report a 0xE8008019 error instead of the 0xE8008017 one (importing the .app still worked directly). I think using appid.com.domain.appname in the Info.plist is wrong, but I mention it here in case somebody is searching for that error code!
