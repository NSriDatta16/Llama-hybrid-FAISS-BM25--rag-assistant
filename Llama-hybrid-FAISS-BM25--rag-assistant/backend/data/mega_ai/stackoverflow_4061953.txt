Your app is being compiled in release mode, but you're linking against the debug version of PCRE, which had /MTd (or similar) set, thus causing the mismatch in iterator debugging level in the CRT. Recompile PCRE in release mode to match your own application. The detect_mismatch pragma in VS 2010 is what causes this error to be emitted.
