NetBeans' auto-generated proxy factory provides two constructors. The nullary one initializes the factory to the hardcoded URI provided to the "New Web Service Client from WSDL..." dialogue. The second constructor accepts a URL to the WSDL documentation, and the service QName. When you have NetBeans insert the service call into your source code, the code fragment it generates uses the nullary constructor, but you can manually change that. // alternate constructor: SampleDomainService(URL, QName) SampleDomainService service = new SampleDomainService(); SampleDomain port = service.getSampleDomainPort(); SampleDomainRequestType request = new SampleDomainRequestType(); SampleDomainResponseType result = port.sampleOperation(request);
