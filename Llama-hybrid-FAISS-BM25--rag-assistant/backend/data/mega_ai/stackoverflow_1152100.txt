We're using CruiseControl.net as our CI server in combination with nant. Most builds (we have around 30 builds) are triggered on changes. Some less important heavy builds are only triggered once each night, this also goes for the maintenance builds which clean most of the normal builds. For our C/C++ code builds we're using a proprietary build system that is able to distribute code builds to every machine available in the company (like IncrediBuild, but much more flexible). For our C# builds we directly call devenv.com, but we use NUnit to run the unit tests. Our C++ unit tests are using our own framework, running them results in xml that's very similar to NUnit's. For some extra code checks we run pclint each night. For now, no code coverage is done yet, which is a bit of a shame. We're also using the system to prepare the finals build of our product. It's just the first step, it still needs some manual actions afterwards.
