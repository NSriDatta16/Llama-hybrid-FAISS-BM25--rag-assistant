Click and Dragging through frames AS3

I have a frame-by-frame animation. I want to be able to click and drag on the stage back and forth and traverse through the animation. I.e. I want to click and drag from left to right to make the animation go forwards and right to left to make the animation go backwards. How would I achieve this? I am making an assumption that there will be some maths involved in calculating mouse position and traversing to the correct frame, but how would I do this?
