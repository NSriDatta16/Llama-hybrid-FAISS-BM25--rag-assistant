How to interpret the Ljung-Box test output?

I am trying to forecast the univariate time series using two different neural networks. After training and testing, I have residuals (Actual - Prediction) with me for both networks say N1.R and N2.R . Now I want to perform the Ljung-Box test for both networks. I used lbqtest function implemented in MATLAB with three input parameters i.e. residuals, lags, and degree-of-freedom. The function returned four different values h, pValue, stat, and cValue. Could anyone explain how to interpret all four values and how to compare two different models' prediction accuracy based on these results? For instance, S is a univariate series of random numbers. After applying two different models N1=mean(S)*rand()+rand(10, 1) and N2=mean(S)*rand()-rand(10, 1) the forecasts and residuals are mentioned below. The computed residuals are passed to lbqtest(residuals, lags, dof) function implemented in Matlab with lags=2 and dof=1; . S = {0.6377, 0.9577, 0.2407, 0.6761, 0.2891, 0.6718, 0.6951, 0.0680, 0.2548, 0.2240} N1.forecast = {1.1593, 0.6594, 1.0954, 0.9902, 0.3216, 0.9171, 0.7017, 1.2309, 0.3160, 0.7773} N1.residuals ={-0.5216, 0.2983, -0.8547, -0.3141, -0.0325, -0.2453, -0.0065, -1.1629, -0.0612, -0.5533} N2.forecast ={-0.2608, -0.5701, -0.1224, -0.5847, -0.2713, 0.1643, 0.0242, -0.5217, -0.2734, 0.0474} N2.residuals = {0.8985, 1.5278, 0.3631, 1.2608, 0.5603, 0.5075, 0.6709, 0.5897, 0.5282, 0.1767} The values received for both models from the test are: N1.h=1, N1.p=0.0366, N1.stat=4.3702, N1.cval=3.8415 N2.h=0, N2.p=0.2199, N2.stat=1.5049, N2.cval=3.8415 My question is how to interpret these results and compare the forecast accuracy using these values? Request : If possible, please explain in simple words (without using statistics vocabulary too much). Thanks in advance.
