You have the input text, sentence, paragraph whatever. So yes, your processing of it will need to query against your DB for each check. With decent indexing on the word column though, you shouldn't have too many problems. Having said that, how big is this dictionary? After all, you would only need the words, not their definitions to check whether it's a valid word. So if at all possible (depending on the size), having a huge memory map/hashtable/dictionary with just keys (the actual words) may be an option and would be quick as lightning. At 15 million words, say average 7 characters @ 2 bytes each works out around the 200 Megabytes mark. Not too crazy. Edit: At 'only' 1 million words, you're looking at around just over 13 Megabytes, say 15 with some overhead. That's a no-brainer I would say.
