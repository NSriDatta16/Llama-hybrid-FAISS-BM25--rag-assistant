The tap events are handled not by the touches method callbacks in UIView , but as targets-actions in UIControl . UIControl is a subclass of UIView , and adds abstractions for taps, drags and other common user actions, so that you do not need to implement the logic yourself. To add a action for the user tapping a control simply do this: [myControl addTarget:self action:@selector(didSelectFoo:) forEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside]; This is usable both if you subclass UIControl yourself, or if you use any of the provided controls such as UIButton , UITextField , UILabel , etc.
