Find data points that deviate the most in 2D graph

I have a set of data points where X axis represents the percentage of disk space, and Y axis represents the memory used by an application. In general, higher the disk space, the higher memory it'll use. Sample data points (disk space percentage, memory used): (10%, 1MB), (20%, 1.5MB), (25%, 1.2MB), (60%,10MB) From this data, I'm interested in finding out top N outlier samples which are using less disk space but more memory, when compared to other data points. What statistics are suitable for this purpose? Is it even possible to apply a model without knowing what's the normal memory usage for a given disk space on an average?
