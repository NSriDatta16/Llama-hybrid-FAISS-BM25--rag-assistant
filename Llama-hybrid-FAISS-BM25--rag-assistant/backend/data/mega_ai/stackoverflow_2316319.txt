Magento : Converting currency before sending data to Google Checkout

I have a magento site with base currency in USD and Google Checkout in GBP. Google Checkout: The currency used in the cart must match the currency of the seller account. You supplied a cart with USD and the seller account is associated with GBP. Is there a way in magento to convert the amount to GBP before sending to Google Checkout ? i guess a module could be written to achieve this, but any other workaround ?
