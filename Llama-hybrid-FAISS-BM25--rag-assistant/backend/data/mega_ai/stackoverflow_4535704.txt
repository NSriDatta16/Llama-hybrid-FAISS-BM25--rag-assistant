What's the optimal way to store binary flags / boolean values in each database engine?

I've seen some possible approaches (in some database engines some of them are synonyms): TINYINT(1) BOOL BIT(1) ENUM(0,1) CHAR(0) NULL All major database engine supported by PHP should be noted, but just as a refference it'll be even better if also other engines will be noted. I'm asking for a design that is best optimized for reading . e.g. SELECTing with the flag field in the WHERE condition, or GROUP BY the flag. Performance is much more important than storage space (except when the size has an impact on performance). And some more details: While creating the table I can't know if it'll be sparse (if most flags are on or off), but I can ALTER the tables later on, so if there is something I can optimize if I know that, it should be noted. Also if it's make a difference if there is only one flag (or a few) per row, versus many (or a lot of) flags it should be noted. BTW, I've read somewhere in SO the following: Using boolean may do the same thing as using tinyint, however it has the advantage of semantically conveying what your intention is, and that's worth something. Well, in my case it doesn't worth nothing, because each table is represented by a class in my application and everything is explicitly defined in the class and well documented.
