From system-in-out-error : System.err is a PrintStream. System.err works like System.out except it is normally only used to output error texts. Some programs (like Eclipse) will show the output to System.err in red text, to make it more obvious that it is error text. From JLS : 20.18.3 public static PrintStream err; The initial value of this variable is a "standard" error output stream, already open and ready to accept output data. Typically, this corresponds to display output or another output destination specified by the host environment or user. By convention, this output stream is used to display error messages or other information that should come to the immediate attention of a user even if the principal output stream, the value of the variable out, has been redirected to a file or other destination that is typically not continuously monitored. Note that this field is not final, so its value may be updated if necessary. From Java World 02-qa-1220-console.html Other post in Stackoverflow coloring-text-with-java-in-windows
