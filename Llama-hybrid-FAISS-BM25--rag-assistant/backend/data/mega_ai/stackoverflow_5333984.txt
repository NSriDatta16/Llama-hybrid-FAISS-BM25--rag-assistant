At a higher level, you might find the lock_method gem useful: def the_method_my_cron_job_calls # something really expensive end lock_method :the_method_my_cron_job_calls It uses lockfiles stored on the local filesystem (what was being discussed above) by default, but you can also configure remote lock storage: LockMethod.config.storage = Redis.new([...]) # a remote RedisToGo instance, perhaps? Also... def the_method_my_cron_job_calls # something really expensive end lock_method :the_method_my_cron_job_calls, (60*60) # automatically expire lock after an hour
