jquery in enterprise : Things to consider

We all know Jquery has tons of benefits it has to offer. If you have used Jquery in enterprise, what was your "learning" experience?; what needs to be taken into consideration from backward compatibility, conflict with existing javascript, CSS class structures, performance, jquery size / Caching, additional plugins etc to improve and leverage the benefits of Jquery? Thanks.
