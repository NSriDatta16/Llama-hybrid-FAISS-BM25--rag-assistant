You already have the answer from Icyblade. However, I want to point out that your Average Precision formula is wrong. The formula $\frac{\#TP(c)}{\#TP(c) + \#FP(c)}$ is the definition of precision, not Average Precision . For object detection, AP is defined in here . Briefly, it summarises the precision/recall curve hence not only precision but also recall is taken into account (hence the False Negative will be penalised too).
