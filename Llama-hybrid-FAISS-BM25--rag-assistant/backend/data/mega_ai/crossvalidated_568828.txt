Aggregation of Interval Predictions

Given a montly time series, my objective is to provide my client with the next 12 point forecasts along with a yearly forecast. To obtain the yearly forecast, I simply sum up the 12 points forecasts. However, I don't know how to estimate the prediction interval associated with this sum. Any ideas on how to obtain a prediction interval for the yearly forecast based on the prediction intervals estimated for each month? Thanks
