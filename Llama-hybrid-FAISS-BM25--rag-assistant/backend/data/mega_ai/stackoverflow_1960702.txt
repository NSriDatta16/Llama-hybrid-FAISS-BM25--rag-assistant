Planning a large scale application there are some other things you probably need to consider besides rough memory usage. It depends on a Session State Provider you choose, and default in-process sessions are probably not the case at all. In case of Out-Of-Process session storage (which may be the preferred for scalable applications) the picture will be completely different, and depends on how session objects are serialized and stored. With SQL session storage, there will not be linear RAM consumption. I would recommend integration testing with an out-of-process flavour of session state Provider from the very beginning for a large-scale application.
