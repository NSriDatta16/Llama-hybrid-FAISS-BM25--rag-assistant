How does neural networks create a boundary in case of more than 3 classes?

I understand that a neural network is a universal function approximator, meaning that it can learn to approximate any function that maps inputs to outputs. For a classification task, it creates a boundary line that separates different classes of inputs. For a simple case like the AND gate, it is easy to see how it creates that boundary and makes decisions based on it. But I canâ€™t imagine how that works in a complex case like handwritten digit recognition.Can anyone explain it to me?
