The thing you can do is extract some "patterns" from your "real" data, and then compare incoming data to this pattern (take 1 - distance_between_pattern_and_input as your score). You can find more about time series patterns extraction in this document Alternatively, you can turn this problem into a supervised learning problem by generating negative examples and train your model to detect whether an input is real or fake.
