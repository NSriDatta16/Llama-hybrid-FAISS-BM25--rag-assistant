what will be different in Visual Studio development experience? Nothing, typically. In fact, if you're doing it right, this should be transparent; your IDE shouldn't care what build manager you use. That's why solutions like CruiseControl.NET and Hudson are nice. If we're creating our own MSBuild .proj files, does that mean we no longer have .csproj files? How do projects look in VS now? Your solution structure remains the same. In Visual Studio, solutions and projects do double duty as a project-organization/packaging guide and as an IDE convenience. Your build manager will introspect this to understand what needs to be built.
