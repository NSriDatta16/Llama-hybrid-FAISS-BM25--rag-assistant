"jquery 1.3.1 (UI version 1.5.3)" You should not be using this pair of versions. JQuery 1.3.x is not compatible with the UI 1.5.x series, and requires the 1.6 release candidates. The release candidate versions are quite stable if you just want the drag and drop functionality; I wouldn't be concerned at all for using them in production. I only use drag and drop, so I can't comment on the stability of the rest of the 1.6 branch of UI.
