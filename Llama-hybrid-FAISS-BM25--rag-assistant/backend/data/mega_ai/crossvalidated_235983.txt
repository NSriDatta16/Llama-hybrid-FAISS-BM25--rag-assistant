This is an answer coming so late it is presumably meaningless, but there is always an MCMC solution to the question. Namely, to project the joint density of the sample$$\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i)$$on the manifold defined by the constraints, for instance $$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i=\mu_0\qquad\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2=\sigma_0^2$$ The only issue is then in simulating values over that manifold, i.e., finding a parameterisation of the correct dimension. A 2015 paper by Bornn, Shephard and Solgi studies this very problem (with an interesting if not ultimate answer ).
