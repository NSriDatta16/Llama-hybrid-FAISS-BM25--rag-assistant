(mac c++ development), for a dynamic library, where does one specify the install_name in a Makefile.am script?

I'm building a project using the gnu autotools on the mac. Everything compiles fine but I'm having issues linking in with dynamic libraries. How do I specify install_name in my Makefile.am scripts. I thought it might be something like the following: lib_LTLIBRARIES = libphysics.la libphysics_la_SOURCES = PhysicsEngine.cpp\ PointMass.cpp\ Spring.cpp\ WaterForceGenerator.cpp AM_CPPFLAGS= @CXXFLAGS@\ -I../include\ -Iinclude\ -I../evolutionaryStuff/include\ -I../geom/include\ -I../model/include\ -I../paramsReader/include\ -I../ctrnn/include\ -I../simulationSystem/include AM_LDFLAGS= @LDFLAGS@ \ -install_name "./.libs/libphysics.0.dylib" ...yet when I do: otool -D libphysics.0.dylib in the .libs directory I get /usr/local/lib/libphysics.0.dylib (but I want it to something like .libs/libphysics.0.dylib) I know it must be something simple, any ideas? Thanks, Ben.
