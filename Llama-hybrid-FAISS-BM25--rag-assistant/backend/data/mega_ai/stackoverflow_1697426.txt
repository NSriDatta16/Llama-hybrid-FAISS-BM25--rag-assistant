I've seen setups of larger size (with InnoDB as storage engine and a GUID as a primary key), and there were no such problems. We once have all the tables from database disappeared. other mysql databases in same server were alright except one - for which only data was disappeared leaving empty tables. The tables may seem empty if the system LSN has gone below the each page's LSN . This may happen if the InnoDB logfiles are corrupt. InnoDB , however, will issue a warning in this case. A select query (among many slow queries) - which get max of a date column in one of 20m table takes about 5 mins to return result. This query used pretty frequently. Create an index on this column, the query will be instant. Please post the exact query and I'll tell you how to create the best index. I see no problem in the DB design as such, most probably it's something with your server. Is it possible to reproduce this behavior on another server with a clean vanilla MySQL installation? You may also want to try to split data between the tables. Set innodb_file_per_table and restore from the backup.
