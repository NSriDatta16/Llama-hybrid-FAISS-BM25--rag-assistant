principal components analysis versus confirmatory factor analysis

I need help answering questions for my advanced statistics course. Any direction on how to answer them or references which could help would be great! What are the primary differences in using PCA and CFA? What factors should be taken into account in interpreting model fit? How do researchers evaluate the adequacy of the fit of the obtained data to the theoretical model? How is the fit of a competing solution compared in CFA? Cheers!
