Passing data between iPhone apps

Disclaimer: This is a specific request by a client. I can't see how what I'm asking is possible, but I figured this community could give me a definitive answer. Is there a way to pass data between iPhone apps that are not in the same app suite? I understand that apps in the same app suite that use the same App ID can pass data via a shared data store, and that apps that leverage custom URLs can pass data through parameters. I am looking for a way to use an existing third-party app through my own app.
