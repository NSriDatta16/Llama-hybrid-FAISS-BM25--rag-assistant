Generalization error of PCA and kernel PCA

I've been recently reading Shawe-Taylor et al. 2005, On the Eigenspectrum of the Gram Matrix and the Generalization Error of Kernel PCA , where the authors analyze the squared residual of kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA, kPCA). I am wondering if there is any similar theory about the generalization error (in terms of reconstruction error) for standard PCA. I've searched the literature a little bit, but most of them analyze this problem in terms of the angle between the true eigenvectors (of population covariance matrix) and estimated eigenvectors of (empirical covariance matrix) and in the scenario of sparse PCA.
