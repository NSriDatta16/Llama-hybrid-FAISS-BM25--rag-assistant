The browser name, version, and OS information are supplied by the browser itself, via the user-agent string, when the page is generated. You might find Microsoft's MSDN page on the user-agent interesting. If you're using the web browser control in C#, you can override the user-agent string if you need to. If you use Firefox, you can override the user-agent in a similar way with the user-agent add-on. I'm not sure if or how you can change the user-agent in other browsers. As for the screen resolution, a quick view of the page source reveals the following Javascript: document.write(screen.width+'x'+screen.height); I suspect the browser is going to get the 'screen' variable information directly from the OS - I'm not sure how you'd override those values, nor am I certain you'd want to!
