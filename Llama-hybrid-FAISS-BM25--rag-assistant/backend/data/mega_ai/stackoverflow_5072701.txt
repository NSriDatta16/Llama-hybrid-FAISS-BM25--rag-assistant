ASP.NET Application Running Slow

There's a web app I've been assigned to, which is running very slow. It is a site that sells products so it is database driven, however even pages that do not query the database are loading very slow. The pages use master pages, and the code is in VB.NET I checked with fiddler and the time it takes to load basic (non database driven) pages are about 5.5 seconds on average. What are some tools that can help me determine the cause of the slow speeds, and any recommendations as to how to speed it up, or potential issues that could cause it? Update So I messed around with the code piece by piece as I wasn't getting anywhere with these tools. As soon as I remove master pages, and I include the same code that's on the master pages in the .aspx page itself, the speed improves drastically (approximately 5 times faster load times). What might cause the master pages to cause load times to slow down so much?
