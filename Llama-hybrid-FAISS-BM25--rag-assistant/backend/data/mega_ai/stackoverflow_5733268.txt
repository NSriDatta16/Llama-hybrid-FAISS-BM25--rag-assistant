Apple's recommendation on browser sniffing

Does Apple have any recommendation for using any technique for browser sniffing (e.g. to distinguish between desktop IE/ FF / Mobile Safari (i.e. iPad)) / Other tablets I know Apple wants us to avoid using User-agent for the same. Is the media technique foolproof way to differentiate between iPad and say Xoom?
