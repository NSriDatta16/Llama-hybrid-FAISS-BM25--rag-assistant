Why do we need regularized logistic regression?

We use regularized Linear Regression to prevent the model from overfitting (reduce model complexity). Does the same idea hold with regularized Logistic Regression ? Is regularized Logistic Regression a solution to the problem of separation? if yes, how? I am sure I had some misunderstanding, can anyone help to clarify that for me.
