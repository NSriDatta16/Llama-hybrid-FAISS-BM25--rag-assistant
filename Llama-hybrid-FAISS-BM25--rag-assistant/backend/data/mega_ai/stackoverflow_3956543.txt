What is the average resolution i.e pixel width for a standard web page?

I just finished constructing web pages and am trying to decide what the optimal lay out should look like. I am trying to decide between a fixed width for my main divs (about 1200 pixles or so) and a variable percentage width. I worry that the variable width will look awful under lower resolutions of under 1600 by 900. I am assuming Quazi Re replies: Thank you all for your valuable remarks. It turns out my problems stemmed from using a mixture of variable divs with fixed width elements. A total disaster for viewing at lower resolutions. Your comments led me in the right direction. thank you
