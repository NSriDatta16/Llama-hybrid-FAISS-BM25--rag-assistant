Performance Counter - Rate per minute type?

I have a service that processes relatively "expensive" requests. The average request rate is expected to be around 5-10 per minute. I would like to be able to monitor this rate with a custom performance counter, but all the available counter types seem to be geared toward much more frequently occurring events. What would be the best way to expose this rate through a performance counter? Perhaps I could just track the total number of events that have occurred, together with the total time elapsed, and then calculate the average and code and expose it through a NumberOfItems32? What seems a bit weird about that is that it wouldn't use the same "averaging window" as the properly managed counters.
