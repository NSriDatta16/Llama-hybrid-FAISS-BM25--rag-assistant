PulpCore is utterly cool, supports tiling, but uses a software renderer and cannot run as a desktop application. Its development paradigm is very, very similar to Flash, except it has the benefit of being Java ;). Slick also supports tiling, is hardware accelerated (OpenGL via LWJGL), and can run as applet, desktop or webstart (JNLP), but on the downside it's not nearly as clean as Pulpcore in terms of ease-of-coding. If you need serious onscreen action (as in action/arcade) then go Slick, otherwise I recommend PulpCore. If I didn't need hardware support for my game, I'd be on PulpCore in a second.
