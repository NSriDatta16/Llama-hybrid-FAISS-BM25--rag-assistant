Magento image uploader in Admin product page doesn't work

All the permissions are correct and the php.ini is fixed, and there's no problem with SSL or secure admin interface but it still won't upload. I click on a product, go to the Image section, select an image to upload and it appears to upload. However, the image doesn't appear in the list of product images and then I get kicked back out to the login page!
