You may want to use HDF5 , a file format for structured storage and a set of libraries to work with it. I still never used it, but I have to adopt it on a future project. Quoting from their site: HDF5 is a data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. It supports an unlimited variety of datatypes, and is designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and complex data. HDF5 is portable and is extensible, allowing applications to evolve in their use of HDF5. The HDF5 Technology suite includes tools and applications for managing, manipulating, viewing, and analyzing data in the HDF5 format The HDF5 technology suite includes: A versatile data model that can represent very complex data objects and a wide variety of metadata. A completely portable file format with no limit on the number or size of data objects in the collection. A software library that runs on a range of computational platforms, from laptops to massively parallel systems, and implements a high-level API with C, C++, Fortran 90, and Java interfaces. A rich set of integrated performance features that allow for access time and storage space optimizations. Tools and applications for managing, manipulating, viewing, and analyzing the data in the collection. I know they provide a wrapper for .net , andy you can also find some c# example of its use.
