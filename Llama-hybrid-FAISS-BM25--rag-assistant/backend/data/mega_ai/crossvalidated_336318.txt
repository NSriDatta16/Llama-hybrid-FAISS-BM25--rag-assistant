Dependent Binary Data (or lack thereof) Affect on Jacobian Elements (and MLE's) in Logistic Regression

I am using logistic regression to produce the logit, etc. I am using daily stock market price data as a basis for the binary dependent variable. The 10-day future price difference is recorded in percentage terms and associated with the current date. So today the dependent variable value would be equal to the price ten days from now(currently unknown) minus the price of today all divided by the price of today. This equation is then converted to a binary based on a condition of say =0%=0 Because the value of the close ten days from now is unknown I have unrecorded/unknown dependent variable values for the 9 values prior to the current date. The Jacobian Matrix is used in discovering the maximum likelihood estimate Beta value. Because the Jacobian Matrix elements are constructed using the first derivative of likelihood function and the first derivative likelihood function uses the dependent binary value as an input, how do the blank values nearest to the current date contribute to the overall quality of the discovered Maximum Likelihood Betas, Error, etc? I realize 9 absent days are generally going to have a lesser impact on the MLE when there are 1000 data points as compared to 50. The issues seems like one to investigate rather than overlook. How is best to handle this scenario? Is there a standard approach to evaluating the impact of blank dependent values on MLE's, Errors, etc? Thanks!
