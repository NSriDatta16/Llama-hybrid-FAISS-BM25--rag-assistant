In ensembles combining models, does it make sense for a model to have negative weight?

I have 13 models ranging from simple models like Seasonal Na√Øve Average to complex models like Random Forests , The weights of the models is calculated based on the LPMinimize of the error during the validation period, The constraints include restricting their weights to [0,1] and the sum of weights being equal to 1, But I did notice that using weights [-1,1] I get better results, Is it okay to use negative weights? What are the implications of such a thing? This question was asked previously here which has little to no help.
