You can do this with a multilevel model or a regression which takes clustering into account, or a structural equation model. You convert your data from wide to long, so each person has two rows in the dataset, and you have a variable that identifies a person. You could also do it with multinomial logistic regression - predict member of (say) 4 groups - minority male, minority female, majority male, majority female.
