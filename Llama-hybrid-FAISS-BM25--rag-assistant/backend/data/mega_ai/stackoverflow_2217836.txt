The obvious answer is it depends on how you will query it. The point of the index is to lessen the quantity of compares when selecting data. The clustered index helps when you consider what data you will load together and the blocking factor of the storage (you can load a bunch of data in a 64k block with one read). If you include an ID and a datetime as the primary key, but not use them in your selection criteria, they will do nothing but hinder your performance. This is why people usually drop indexes upon bulk inserts before loading data.
