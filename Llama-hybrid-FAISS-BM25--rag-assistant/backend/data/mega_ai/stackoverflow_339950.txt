As far as I was aware the CSS Pseudo-classes are for links ONLY in IE. This may have changed in IE8 but I'm not aware of it. So basically I don;t think there is an elegant way of implementing it via CSS. That's not a useful answer so I'll also add that I would implement it using images and client-side script which isn't elegant but should allow do the job across all browsers if the client-side script is right. Cheers
