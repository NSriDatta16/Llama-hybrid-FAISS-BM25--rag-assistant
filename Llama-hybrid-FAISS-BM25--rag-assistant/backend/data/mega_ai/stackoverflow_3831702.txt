Visual Studio: Simultaneously develop WCF client and server

I need to develop a WCF server (basically a web service which will eventually run in IIS) and a client application that accesses the service. I have both the client and the server project in the same Visual Studio (2008) solution. What's the recommended way to connect the client to the server during development? Two possible solutions immediately come to my mind: One is to deploy the server project to some IIS after every change, and the other one is to start two instances of Visual Studio and use a fixed TCP port for the (Visual-Studio-integrated) web server of the server project. Since none of these options seems particularly elegant to me, I was wondering if I have maybe overlooked the obvious "right way" to do this...
