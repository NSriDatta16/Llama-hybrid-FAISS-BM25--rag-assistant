How can I adjust the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) in a random forest in R

Suppose I'm use a random forest binary classifier in R. What parameter(s) can I tweak in my learned model (or model to be learned) that can help me with this tradeoff. for example: In logistic regression I would change the threshold on the probability the classifier predicts. How do I so something similar with randomforest, especially using the R package.
