Constrained optimization between two bayesian variables

I have 2 separate Bayesain networks and I was hoping to maximize Value within the constraint of the Cost . What are is a good way I can do that? Some notes about the model: Cost is observed per unit, but there is a global constraint on Cost. Value is not observed, so latent. Function between Cost and Value does not exist.
