One of the reasons MAE is used in time series or forecasting is that non-scientists find it easy to understand. So if you tell your client the MAE is 1.5 units, for example, he/she can interpret that as the average amount that the forecast is in error (in absolute units). But if you tell them the MSE you may well get a blank look because it has no such interpretation. I'm not sure what causes the confusion between MAE and mean absolute deviation, but I'd attribute it to a lack of clear definitions or explanations in the specific context where it is used.
