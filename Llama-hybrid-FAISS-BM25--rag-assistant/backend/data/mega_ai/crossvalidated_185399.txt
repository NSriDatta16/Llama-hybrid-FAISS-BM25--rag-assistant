Regression analysis terminology

I am running a machine learning algorithm where all of my independent variables are categorical. However, instead of fitting all of my features into the model all at once and getting static co-efficients, I'm iteratively running and fitting through all the data in my testing sample and getting dynamic co-efficients for predictors, depending upon the presence of other predictors. This allows me to establish a non-linear relationship between the predictors. I'm also obtaining a better R-squared and seeing visible predictive improvements. What is this type of approach to regression called?
