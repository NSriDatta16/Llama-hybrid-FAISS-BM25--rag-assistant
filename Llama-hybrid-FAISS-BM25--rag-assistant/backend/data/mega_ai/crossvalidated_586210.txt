A simpler approach to this would be to calculate whether or not an accident occurred on each day (or the number of accidents, if there are enough days with $>1$ accidents). You can then use logistic regression (or Poisson regression, if you're using the number of accidents) to test whether there's a relationship between daily humidity (the predictor) and whether an accident occurs that day (the outcome). Of course, in this case it might be that accident rates and humidity both fluctuate throughout the year but humidity doesn't directly cause accidents, so you're going to have to deal with that confound as well, but that's outside the scope of this question.
