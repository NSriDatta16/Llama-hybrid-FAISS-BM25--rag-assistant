Your error is occurring due to this line: string authenticate = (string)data.authenticate(UserName, password); You are setting authenticate equal to a true/false calculation which is returning a Boolean value. Try this instead. string authenticate = data.authenticate(UserName, password).ToString(); You can also modify the code to still return a string by doing this: bool authenticate = data.authenticate(UserName, password); return authenticate.ToString(); PREFERRED OPTION: Furthermore, I'm not sure why you are returning a string representation of true/false (bool)... If it were my function, I would probably return this: return data.authenticate(UserName, password); I would highly encourage you to simply return the Boolean value in the PREFERRED OPTION area. There is no obvious reason to keep this in a string format.
