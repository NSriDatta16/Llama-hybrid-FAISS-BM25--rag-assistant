References on simulating a raster with spatial dependence

I've simulated an N-by-N raster in the following way: define a set $S$ containing a finite number $|S| = K$ of possible raster values (in my simulation, $K=3$ and the elements of $S$ are land uses / land covers) Initialize an empty $N$-by-$N$ array of raster values; draw the $1, 1$ entry of the raster uniformly at random from $S$. I'll refer to the raster entries as $X_{i,j}$. At this point we have drawn a value for $X_{1, 1}$ Populate the first row of the raster using a conditional distribution $\Pr[X_{i,j} \,|\, X_{i,j-1}]$, i.e. populate $X_{1, j}$ for $j=2, 3, \ldots, N$ Use the same conditional distribution as above to populate the first column of the raster (i.e. $\Pr[X_{i,j} \,|\, X_{i-1,j}]$ is the same distribution as $\Pr[X_{i,j} \,|\, X_{i,j-1}]$); this allows us to populate $X_{i, 1}$ for $i=2, 3, \ldots, N$ Populate the remainder of the raster using a distribution that conditions on two neighbors: $\Pr[X_{i,j} \,|\, X_{i,j-1}, X_{i-1,j}]$. I assume that this distribution satisfies a symmetry property: the probability does not change if you switch the values of the two neighbors, i.e. $\Pr[X_{i,j} \,|\, X_{i,j-1} = r, X_{i-1,j} = s]$ = $\Pr[X_{i,j} \,|\, X_{i,j-1} = s, X_{i-1,j} = r]$, for any $s, r \in S$. Those steps generate an $N$-by-$N$ raster whose cells take values in $S$. I have several questions: The primitives of the model are the distributions $\Pr[X_{i,j} \,|\, X_{i,j-1}]$ and $\Pr[X_{i,j} \,|\, X_{i,j-1}, X_{i-1,j}]$. Do these objects imply any sort of stationary distribution over raster values $X_{i, j}$, and over the joint distribution of $X_{i, j}$ and its neighbors to the north, south, east, and west, i.e. the joint distribution of $\left(X_{i, j}, X_{i+1, j}, X_{i, j+1}, X_{i-1, j}, X_{i, j-1}\right)$? If the primitives do imply a stationary distribution, can the stationary distribution be calculated using the primitives (the same way we can calculate the stationary distribution of an one-dimensional, first-order Markov chain using an eigenvector decomposition of its transition matrix)? If there is a stationary joint distribution of $X_{i, j}$ and its neighbors to the north, south, east, and west, is that distribution "invariant to rotation", by which I mean that rotations of the neighbors around the central pixel do not change the probability? I suspect the answer is no: see the simulated raster below, which shows a sort of "streak" pattern from the 1, 1 pixel towards the top right (i.e., streaks moving in the direction in which I populated the raster in step 5). Are there any references that answer these questions? I think what I'm simulating is a Markov random field on a grid, but I'm not sure what the proper terminology is. R simulation: library(ggplot2) ## Spatial dependence: distribution of ij raster pixel depends on its neighbors to north and west S_sorted When I say that I see "streaks" in the figure above, what I mean is that there are many clumps of forest that are long in the [down left]-to-[up right] direction, and not many clumps of forest that are long in the [up left]-to-[down right] direction. My intuition is that this is a consequence of the way that I simulated the raster, and that it means that, if there is a stationary joint distribution of $\left(X_{i, j}, X_{i+1, j}, X_{i, j+1}, X_{i-1, j}, X_{i, j-1}\right)$, i.e. of a pixel and its four neighbors, that distribution is not invariant to rotation. Is that correct? Edit: has anyone reading this question read Introduction to Markov Random Fields by Andrew Blake and Pushmeet Kohli (chapter 1 available at https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262015776_sch_0001.pdf )? If so, do you know whether I can find an answer to my question(s) in that book?
