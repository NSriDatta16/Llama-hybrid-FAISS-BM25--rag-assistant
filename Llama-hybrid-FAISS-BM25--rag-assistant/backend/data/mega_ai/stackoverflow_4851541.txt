Listbox drag-reorder : Index of the dropped item

I'm using a Listbox wrapped inside a ListBoxDragDropTarget (from the Silverlight toolkit). This ListBox ca be manually reordered by the user. However the last item must always be located at the bottom of the ListBox , and can't be moved at all. I found a way to cancel this last item moves, but if I drag and drop another item below this last item, it gets moved. I can find the index of the dragged item using this code in the Drop event of the ListBox: object data = e.Data.GetData(e.Data.GetFormats()[0]); ItemDragEventArgs dragEventArgs = data as ItemDragEventArgs; SelectionCollection selectionCollection = dragEventArgs.Data as SelectionCollection; if (selectionCollection != null) { MyClass cw = selectionCollection[0].Item as MyClass; int idx = selectionCollection[0].Index.Value; } However this only gives me the index before the drag operation. My question is the following: Is there a way to know the new index of the dropped item ? This way, if the index = last position of the list, I can move it to the forelast position. Thanks in advance !
