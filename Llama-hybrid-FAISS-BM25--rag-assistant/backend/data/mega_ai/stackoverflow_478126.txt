Whats the best SAP ERP infrastructure architecture?

My company is planning to implement SAP HR in our organization. We already have the other modules running. We plan to offer ESS/MSS to approximately 200 000 users. Our current configuration is one machine with a Central Instance and 3 machines with Dialogue Instances. The DB is on the Central Instance machine. Enterprise Portal + DB is running on a separate machine. We are thinking of separating the HR module onto a separate DB so as to not to kill the other modules with load. Is this a valid concern? Is there any better way to architect the system? I was thinking along the lines of separating the DB and Central instance onto two different machines. I've tried searching on SAP market place for any advice on SAP infrastructure architecture without any luck.
