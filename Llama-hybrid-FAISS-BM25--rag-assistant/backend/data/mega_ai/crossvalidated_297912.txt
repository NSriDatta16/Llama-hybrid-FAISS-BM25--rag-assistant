This behaviour doesn't seem related to correlation between predictors. It seems more related to the actual behaviour of your data. Positive TVspend parameter means that -being all other variables equal- orders grow when TVspend grows. However, negative interaction means that when Brand_SEM_spend is larger, orders grow less with TVspend than when Brand_SEM_spend is smaller. In fact, depending on the range of your variables, it might even mean that orders decrease with TVspend when Brand_SEM_spend is large. When you don't take on account Brand_SEM_spend, your model assumes that -being all other variables equal- the effect of TVspend is the same for all values of Brand_SEM_spend. Therefore, you are adjusting a single coefficient that account for TVspend efect, and that effect is actually different for different values of Brand_SEM_spend, so data is somehow conflicting and the parameter is adjusted to the "average" effect but with a large standard error. Since standard error is larger and parameter is smaller, it becomes less significant. Just for illustration, I build a simple model that shows the same phenomenon. Let's start with data generation: > response tv nobrand orders Please notice that since $tv$ is uniformly distributed in the range (0,1), its average effect is zero, although its parameter would be 0.5 when $nobrand=0$ and -0.5 when $nobrand=1$. Adjusting a model without interaction shows that $tv$ has a parameter close to zero an not significant, as expected: > summary(lm(orders~tv+nobrand)) Call: lm(formula = orders ~ tv + nobrand) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.34751 -0.08337 -0.01841 0.09197 0.36638 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.22584 0.03600 6.274 9.84e-09 *** tv 0.05138 0.04598 1.117 0.267 nobrand 4.51445 0.04759 94.864 However, adjusting a model with interaction shows clearly significant $tv$ effect and interaction, that is, it shows that $tv$ has an effect but this effect depends on $nobrand$: > summary(lm(orders~tv*nobrand)) Call: lm(formula = orders ~ tv * nobrand) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.198747 -0.068419 -0.009158 0.068185 0.258584 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -0.02989 0.03612 -0.828 0.41 tv 0.56321 0.06080 9.263 5.69e-15 *** nobrand 5.02382 0.06120 82.083 Interestingly, both in your data and my simulation R-adjusted and all p-values are larger when the interaction is included, supporting that interaction should be included in the model.
