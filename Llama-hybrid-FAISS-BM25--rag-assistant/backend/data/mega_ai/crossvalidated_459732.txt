How is BayesianRidge different from Ridge?

https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.BayesianRidge.html https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html For me, the different is BayesianRidge keep updating alpha and lambda while Ridge only have certain alpha . But what are alpha and lambda in BayesianRidge ? Since ridge model is defined as $$ \underset{\beta}{\operatorname{arg\,min}}\; \|y - X\beta\|^2_2 + \lambda \|\beta\|^2_2 $$ I can understand alpha in sklearn.linear_model.Ridge is $\lambda$ here . But sklearn.linear_model.BayesianRidge is vague for me.
