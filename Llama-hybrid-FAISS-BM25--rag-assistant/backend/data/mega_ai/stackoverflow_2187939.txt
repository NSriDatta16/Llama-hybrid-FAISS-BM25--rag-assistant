You will be able to stress test against the external machine, however you will not be able to see any perfmon stats from the target machines. You will also probably cause serious consternation with your hosting provider as a good load test stresses the network pretty hard. You may want to talk to them before going ahead. From an external source you will also likely include network effects in your test, so different times of day will result in different network loads and different results. Ideally you would want to install a load test controller and agent on a server on the same switch as the target to get high loads on your application. This does require a hefty licence however. Visual Studion 2010 has better licencing for the Load Test Agent, but may be more expensive than you want.
