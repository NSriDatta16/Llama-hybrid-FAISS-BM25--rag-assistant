Issues on analyzing a time series, ACF and PACF quite the same

I'm attending a econometric course and I'm new to time series analysis. They gave me a time series to analyze and I'm trying to apply all the things I learnt (and understood) to an actual time series. The time series is about the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices in Austria from Janaury 2000 to September 2017, with base=100 2015 get it from Eurostat. I provide the dataset so you can reply it: x Usually I use Gretl, but in this case I'm gonna use R cause I found easier to explain the code. I follow the Box and Jenkins procedure. The first things I do is to visualize the time series. In this case, it's: Firstly I wonder if there any kind of outliers (for example Addivite, Level shift, Innovation Outliers of Temporary change), that's not the case, I suppose. Obsviously it's not mean stationary and I have some doubts on the variance of the series. So I'm gonna consider a log-transformation and a difference of order 1. d_log_x Now I have the time series with no trend. Now I should see the error part and the seasonality. The latter shows that seasonaliry increases during time: At this point I remember that if the case that seasonality is evolutive, we prefer to consider a multiplicative model for time series. Anyway I'm gonna check now the periodgram of this series and that's what I get: This should show me (if I'm not wrong) that we have a seasonaly every 6 months and 3 months. Now I think of using a season differences, but which? I behave as follows: I see the standard deviations of the series with seasonal differences and I choose the lowest: dif So seasonal difference with order 12 gaves me the lowest sd. sddlog Now I can use acf and pacf to detect the best model, here they are: Now my question are: I don't know how to interpret it. I mean I would say that's only a seasonal arma ( but didn't I erase it?) and acf and pacf are so similar. I see both of them (seasonally speaking) with significant value at 12 lag and 24th lag (acf is not significant but almost it is) and then everything disappears. I would say it's a ARIMA(0,0)(0,1), but the PACF should not die so brutally, it should go to zero slowly. Maybe should I use another kind of filter to eliminate the seasonality? Is it proper, maybe, to use a dummy variable?
