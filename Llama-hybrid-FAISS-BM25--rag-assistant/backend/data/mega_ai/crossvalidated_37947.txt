Are Bayesian approches used for classification (supervised) or for clustering (unsupervised)?

Are Bayesian approaches (static and dynamic) used for classification (which is supervised) or for clustering (which is unsupervised)? or can they be used for both ? I even see that for instance to compute the likelihood they need the class labels of data, so I was thinking that it is only convenient for supervised cases where we have the class labels
