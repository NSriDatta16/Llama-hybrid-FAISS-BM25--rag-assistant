I am on an iPad using example code made for the iPhone Is it possible that the window size in the code is hard coded to the smaller iPhone screen dimensions? Edit: This idevgames forum post looks like the same xcode issue (not OpenGL), caused by: Starting with an iPhone project in xcode Incorrect settings in the .xib file Two solutions, neither tested by me are: 1) UIWindow resizing can be achieved with manual conversion of .xib files to iPad version using Interface Builder. This is mentioned in iOS 4.0 Release Notes in Known Issues->Xcode section. This do the trick for me. 2) Save yourself a lot of trouble, just create a new iPad OGLES app in xcode, everything will already be setup and working for you, drag your files in from your old xcode project into your new one, update the xib with the correct app delate and your done. I had to start a whole new project today and do this just to get the MF# !!FS#$ *! code signing to work.
