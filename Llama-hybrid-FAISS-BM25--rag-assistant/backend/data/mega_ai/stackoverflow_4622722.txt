How can you unlock an iOS device using private frameworks?

I haven't dabbled in iOS private frameworks until now, when I randomly wanted to make an app which could lock & unlock the device.. An iOS hacker friend of mine pointed me to GraphicsServices.framework and GSEvent.h - there I found GSEventLockDevice() , which locks the iOS device -> I can't seem to find any other similar function to unlock the device, other than potentially simulating a lock button press and then simulating the touch drag on the " Slide to unlock " bar. Does anybody know of a non-touch-simulation method to unlock the device - or - can anyone point me in the right direction at all?
