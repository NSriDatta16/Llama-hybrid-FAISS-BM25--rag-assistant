How to make Taskbar Flash on Lost Focus

I stumbled on this code below and tried to implement it in my WinForm App to help my users as many are very NOT tech-savy. Unfortunately, it does nothing. It does not generate any errors or anything. It just doesn't make it Flash. Can anyone offer any insight? I have tried it on Win 7(x64) & Win XP (x86) with the same results on both. I am calling it like so --> TaskbarFlasher.FlashWindow(this); From my Main Form. [DllImport("user32.dll")] private extern static bool FlashWindow(IntPtr hwnd, bool bInvert); [DllImport("user32.dll")] private extern static IntPtr GetForegroundWindow(); /// /// Notifies the user that the application requests attention /// by flashing the taskbar if the form is not the current window. /// /// The form in question. public static void FlashWindow(Form myForm) { // if the current foreground window isn't this window, // flash this window in task bar once every 1 second if (GetForegroundWindow() != myForm.Handle) { FlashWindow(myForm.Handle, true); } }
