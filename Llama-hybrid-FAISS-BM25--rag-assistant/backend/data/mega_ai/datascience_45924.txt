Platt's Scaling for multiclass classification?

How does one do platt's scaling for multiclass classification? For example, if the final layer of my DNN is a soft-max activation with 10 classes, then how does platt's scaling work exactly? Do I train multiple logistic regressions using one-vs-many classification? Or is there a better way?
