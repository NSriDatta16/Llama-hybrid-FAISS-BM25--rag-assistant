specify random effects for multiple time series?

I want to specify a mixed effects model using lme4:lmer() to determine if sex (M vs. F) and treatment group (control vs. test) are related to how people's memory errors evolve over time for different objects. My time variable is in terms of trial number for a particular object, with independent numbering per object: subjectID, sex, group, memErr, object, objTrialNo 1, M, ctl, 0.32, obj1, 1 1, M, ctl, 0.23, obj1, 2 1, M, ctl, 0.67, obj2, 1 1, M, ctl, 0.44, obj2, 2 ... I'm not sure how I need to specify the random effect term to capture this "multiple" interleaved time series, for lack of the correct term. That is, how do I capture the fact that the time is a counter that resets for each object? Would the following be appropriate? (When I plot my memory error, memErr , against time, objTrialNo , I see there is what looks like an exponential decay -- hence all the transformations). I(log(memErr)) ~ grp * sex * I(objTrialNo^2) + (1+object|subject) + (0+objTrialNo|object) From what I understand, 0+ is okay (model won't converge otherwise) because at time 0, error is maximum anyway. However, when I run this model, the residuals vs. fitted plot shows model seems heteroskedastic (and qqnorm plot of residuals indicates non-normality)? Thanks very much in advance for any advice/tips/help!
