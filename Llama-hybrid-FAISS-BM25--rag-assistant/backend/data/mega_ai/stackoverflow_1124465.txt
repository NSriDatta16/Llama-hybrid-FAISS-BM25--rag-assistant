Objective-C switch defines contents of string

I've come from a java background, so i'm still getting to grips with some of the ways of doing things with Obj-C. Depending on a number provided, I want an NSString variable to have different contents. In java I would do something like this: string foo; switch (numberToSwtich){ case 1: foo = "Something!"; break; case 2: foo = "Something Else!"; break; } Obviously there are two types of String in objective-c. NSString and NSSMutableString. The difference being that you can change one at a later date. However, like java, can I initialize a NSString first then set its contents later or do I need to use an NSMutableString? Something a bit like this... NSString *aString = [[NSString alloc] init]; switch ([self getNumberOfSides]) { case 1: aString = @"A String"; break; case 2: aString = @"Another String"; break; } I'm aware there are other-ways of doing this, such as using an NSDictionary with numeric keys for example, but I would like to use a switch. Thanks.
