Using information on both sides of a 'gap' in time series data for imputation

As with my previous question, I'm looking at ways to impute missing data in a hierarchical time series data. With al my other procedures, including the experimentation of imputation packages ( Amelia , HoltWinters from Forecast and MICE imputation) I've only been able to use the time series data prior to the missing gap.

Forecasting using prior data to predict the future and backcasting using the later data to “predict” the past. I would then like to combine the forecast and backcast value to use as imputation. After which I will look at the fit etc. How do I go about this in coding? For example, I'm able to determine what SARIMA model exist for the first period 2001-end2006. But not the full period (because my basic functions I know from R does not support the NA values.) This is only for the period 2001-end2006: ARIMA(2,0,2)(1,0,1)[12] with non-zero mean Call: auto.arima(x = ts.datt) Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 sar1 sma1 intercept 1.3610 -0.8258 -1.2407 0.9191 0.8982 -0.7560 244.8374 s.e. 0.0884 0.0960 0.0878 0.1127 0.2190 0.3335 6.1894 sigma^2 estimated as 605.9: log likelihood = -335.01 AIC = 686.02 AICc = 688.3 BIC = 704.23 Should I just model the first period, predict by forecast ; model then the last period separately and then backcast? How will I do this backcasting (ie. 'predicting' the past)? EDIT: What I'm asking: 1) How do I use the data from years 2008 & 2009 to BACKCAST? I already know how to use 2001-2006 to forecast. 2) How do I determine the SARIMA model for the whole period? (2001-2009) ie.
