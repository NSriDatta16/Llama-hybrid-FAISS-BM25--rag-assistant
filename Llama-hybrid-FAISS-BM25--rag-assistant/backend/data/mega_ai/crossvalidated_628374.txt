Discrepancy between the results of the ANOVA and the post-hoc test: How should be such results interpreted and presented?

It is possible to find discrepancies between the results of ANOVA and post-hoc tests. The results of post-hoc tests are valid (with the exception of the Fisher LSD test) even if the overall P value for the ANOVA is greater than 0.05 ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ). How should such results be presented and interpreted? There are some questions on this subject, but the answers are more or less theoretical ( 5 , 6 , 3 , 4 ). I could not find any papers (biology, ecology and related fields) with such results. Therefore, I would like to know how to present and interpret such results using a real example: I used a linear mixed model (function lmer, R package lme4) to analyse the effect of cover of two invasive plant species ( Solidago spp.) on the diversity of invaded plant communities. The response variable is species richness, the explanatory variables are categorical - invasive species (2 levels: S. canadensis and S. gigantea ), cover of invasive species (3 levels: C = ~0%, T = ~30% and D = ~80%) and their interaction. Data While the results of the anova (function Anova, type 3 and 2; package car) suggest no significant interaction, visual inspection of the boxplot suggests the opposite, which was confirmed by post-hoc tests (function avg_comparisons from the package marginaleffects). See below. So how should I present and interpret these results? (By the way, why are there no values for intercept in the type 2 Anova outputs?)
