If this is important enough to spend a lot of time on, I'd consider using Venn diagrams. The visualisation will represent the result sets rather than the query terms. So to demonstrate AND you would show two circles representing the results, and highlight the overlap between them (intersection). To demonstrate OR you would show the two circles and highlight the union of both. Then to show the whole multi-part query you can either show five circles with some combination of union and intersection, or else combine each parenthesis and then hide the detail, making the results into a new circle to combine with other elements. Lots of drag-and-drop here, and dynamic resizing of subclauses for clarity. To make this intuitive and easy to use would take quite some work, but for some applications it would be a really powerful interface.
