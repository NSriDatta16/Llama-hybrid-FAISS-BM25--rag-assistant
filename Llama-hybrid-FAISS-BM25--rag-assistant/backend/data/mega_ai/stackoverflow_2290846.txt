This might look like a silly question but, if you add the following HTML code to your page: &nbsp; &nbsp; Is the red box twice as big as the green one? If it isn't, you have an incorrect DOCTYPE that's causing the browsers to render the page in Quirks Mode, basically ending any hope you might have of it working across browsers. If the size of the boxes is correct, do you get any error messages in the Firebug console when you try to drag and drop in Firefox? And as a last two comments related to the others answers: If you can, I also recommend you to avoid asp.net ajax and use jQuery instead. You'll find much more info around the web, and it's much better documented IMO. Check the references in your project to verify that you really are using the latest version of ASP.Net Ajax. Even if your computer has the latest version of ASP.Net, your project might reference an older dll included in your bin directory (It happened to me once, so I should know!)
