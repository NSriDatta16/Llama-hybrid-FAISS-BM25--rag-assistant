"Receptive fields are defined portion of space or spatial construct containing units that provide input to a set of units within a corresponding layer. The receptive field is defined by the filter size of a layer within a convolution neural network." https://towardsdatascience.com/understand-local-receptive-fields-in-convolutional-neural-networks-f26d700be16c In other words, receptive fields are about the area (in pixels) covered by the convolutional filter(s), not the size of the input. Padding changes the effective input size, so it canâ€™t change the receptive field. Stride changes how much area is covered by the convolution, so it increases receptive field.
