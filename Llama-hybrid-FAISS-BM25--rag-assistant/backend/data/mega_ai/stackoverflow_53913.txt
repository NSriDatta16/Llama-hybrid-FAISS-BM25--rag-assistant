How can I lay images out in a grid?

I'm trying to produce sheets of photographs with captions arranged in a grid using XSLT and XSL-FO. The photo URLs and captions are produced using a FOR XML query against an SQL Server database, and the number of photos returned varies from sheet to sheet. I want to lay the photos out in four columns, filling the grid from left to right and from top to bottom. In HTML I'd do this by putting each photo and caption into a div and using "float: left" to make them flow into the grid. Is there a similarly elegant method using XSL-FO?
