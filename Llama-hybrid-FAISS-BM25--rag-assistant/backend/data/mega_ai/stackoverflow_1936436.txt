Bit Manipulation and MySQL Retrieval in PHP

I am trying to optimize my mysql table a little bit in order to have a slightly more manageable table. I would like to store user permissions in a bit field. For example, a users permissions could be 0110 (I have a growing number of user permissions, so the length of this could be a bit longer) The example might correspond to the following: 0: User cannot post news items on the website 1: User can post new articles on the website 1: User can edit any article on the website 0: User cannot remove articles from the website etc. (for other permissions) If I have this stored in a mysql bit field. How can I manipulate this in PHP? For example, in PHP is there an easy way to get the 3rd bit and see if it is a 0 or a 1? Is there an easy way to set the 3rd bit to be a 0 or a 1?
