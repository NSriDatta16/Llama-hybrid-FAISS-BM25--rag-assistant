What are the representations of splines? Is there a concept of a 0 degree spline?

The splines package in R is mostly focused on, what they call, a B-spline representation which is, by default, a cubic polynomial with no knots (unless you supply them). The actual numeric coding of the splines is described well in the package. Needless to say, it's a little sophisticated. Case in point: x gives The argument bs(x, knots=c(25, 50, 75)) produces a 6 column matrix of output. What are the columns of a spline representation technically referred to as? Inputs? Curves? But I am interested in a constant sort of "moving average" representation to interpolate low order ordinal variables and estimate a specific contrast which clusters adjacent categories for better predictive accuracy. With the basis spline representation, degree 1 polynomial (aka linear) splines are square waves: Needless to say, in a linear model, I feel this is anything but intuitive. I'm not sure if the regression model which regresses an outcome against a linear basis spline with knots has any obvious interpretation. Does this square wave ensure that the first term in a regression model is interpreted as the slope for that subsection and the second the second slope, and so on? As far as I know similar predicted values are obtained using code like: spl the "representation" is different, but I don't know how to refer to it, and it produces the same predicted values as the other spline, x The linear interpolation of ordinal values is perhaps appropriate to test the hypothesis is there are locally linear approximations to ordinal values. Alternately, we might be interested in a "cumulative mean difference" for regions where a constant interpolation may be appropriate, like a "0 degree spline", which seems nonsensical, but an alternate designation could be something like: spl0 so that predicted values are of the nature: sp.2 To summarize my questions: I'm aware of B-splines representations and how they are calculated. What other representations are there and how are they calculated? In spline representation, a single vector is expanded to a matrix with columns. What are the columns referred to as? For instance, in a cubic polynomial representation, the specific terms can be called a linear, quadratic, and cubic term. Are there 0 degree splines? If not, what may I call the "moving average" type of regression I fit in the last example (knowing of course that a moving average is a different type of model)? Are there examples of using a regression of the above type to cluster adjacent categories in regression models for ordinal data to obtain parsimonious prediction and inference?
