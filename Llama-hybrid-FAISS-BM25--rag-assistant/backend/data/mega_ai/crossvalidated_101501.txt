Averaging Variables to create general equation

My data best fit is the 3 parameter inverse gamma distribution(thereby giving a, b, y variables with each event having a specific value for each variable) but I am not sure how to create a general equation for these equation...do I average each variable? or is there some other method? I've seen one researcher use MLE but he doesn't fully explain what he did to create the generalized equation. Is it possible to use MLE to find the mean of an equation with multiple variables and multiple values for each variable?
