Well I've found a way... but I don't like it much... I've added a Hidden Field control to the page, after adding the editor, and put the editor's ClientId in its value: Dim hdn As New HiddenField With hdn .ID = "HiddenField" .Value = itemEditor.ClientID End With cell.Controls.Add(hdn) .. and then in the JavaScript, I can get the hidden field, and hence the editor name as follows: function GetCkText() { var hdn = document.getElementById("HiddenField"); var editorName = hdn.getAttribute("value"); var editor = CKEDITOR.instances[editorName]; alert(editor.getData()); return false; } But it's a bit inelegant, to say the least. Anyone got a better way?
