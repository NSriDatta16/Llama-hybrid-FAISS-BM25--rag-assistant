Keep in mind that you can combine these two approaches so that: If the user has JS enabled, they get a smoother experience (no page reload) If they don't, no functionality is lost You would do that using a standard trick: This will require some competent engineering so that ajax_handler() can utilize the same code as bar.php does to process the form data. Also, you should pay special attention in the AJAX path so that things like the back button continue to work as the user expects.
