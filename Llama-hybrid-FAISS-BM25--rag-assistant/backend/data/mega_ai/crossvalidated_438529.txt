This is a critic of Bayesian inference, a different way to thing statistics (different from frequentists form that everyone learns in others courses others than statistics, we learn both). "The critic is that you can proof anything with a large sample because gives to you a p-value." That's why we look in A LOT of others metrics, aic,f,rmse,anova..... None of my professors answered me about how to lead this thing just "make a sample, so your dataset will be small and this will not happen" But I'm not happy with that, but I use this way :/
