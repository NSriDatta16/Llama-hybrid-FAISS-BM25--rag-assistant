Zero clue about the API however. I can bet the expected format is some raw one NOT gif since 262144 =2^18 (or 256*256*4). RGB+Alpha are 4bytes. edit: again, gl.glTexImage2D(GL2ES2.GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL2ES2.GL_RGBA, 256, 256, 0, GL2ES2.GL_RGBA, GL2ES2.GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, imageBuffer); just guessting but look at the constants: GL2ES2.GL_RGBA, GL2ES2.GL_RGBA, GL2ES2.GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE - all support RGBA format for the bytes in the byte buffer,see what other contestants are available, the way I believe using NIO would have point only with direct buffers containing the raster in the format specified by the constants. (i.e. no other formats for image storage/transmission like jpeg/bif/png will help) So read the documentation again, look for tutorial, examples and proceed (the way you load the image is not very good either)
