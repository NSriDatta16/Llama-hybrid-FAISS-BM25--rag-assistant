likelihood value calculation with glm

I have 2 questions regarding the likelihood value calculation with glm. It seems that sometimes it calculates the likelihood value including the binomial coefficient and sometimes it does not. Tow cases are described below: Why does glm calculate the log-likelihood value differently for the following two cases at the bottom in respect to the binomial coefficient? The first case is taken from here . Is that just an inconsistency or is there a reason behind? For logistic regression with binomial family it seems that glm does not compute the likelihood value. is that because it tries to calculate the binomial coefficient which it cont? Because as far as I understand the log-likelihood value can still be computed, as the binomial coefficient disappears when taking the derivative. Case 1) Y logLik(fit.glm) 'log Lik.' -2.336075 (df=2) Case 2) Y2 logLik(fit.glm2) 'log Lik.' -9.8958 (df=2)
