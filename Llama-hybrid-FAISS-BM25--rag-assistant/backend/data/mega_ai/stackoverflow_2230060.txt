SQL Server 2008 supports FILESTREAM storage. The files are stored on an NTFS volume like plain files, but are subject to transaction control and can be accessed via special file names passed to Win32 API functions (and of course any API built upon it) with additional SQL Server security checks (like GRANT options etc).
