Windows Azure: "An item with the same key has already been added." exception thrown on Select

I'm getting a strange error while trying to select a row from a table under Windows Azure Table Storage. The exception "An item with the same key has already been added." is being thrown even though I'm not inserting anything. The query that is causing the problem is as follows: var ids = new HashSet () { id }; var fields = new HashSet {"@all"}; using (var db = new AzureDbFetcher()) { var result = db.GetPeople(ids, fields, null); } public Dictionary GetPeople(HashSet ids, HashSet fields, CollectionOptions options) { var result = new Dictionary (); foreach (var id in ids) { var p = db.persons.Where(x => x.RowKey == id).SingleOrDefault(); if (p == null) { continue; } // do something with result } } As you can see, there's only 1 id and the error is thrown right at the top of the loop and nothing is being modified. However, I'm using "" as the Partition Key for this particular row. What gives?
