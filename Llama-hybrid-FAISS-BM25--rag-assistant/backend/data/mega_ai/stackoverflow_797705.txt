Embedding a flowchart design surface in a .net application

I need to incorporate a flowchart design surface into an app we're developing to allow users to create what are essentially workflows/schedules. I need to be able to create my own 'shapes', set custom properties on them and possibly have a bit of logic in there too (if, while etc). I know I need to take a look at hosting WF in the app, it looks like a good fit, but does anyone know of other designer compoments out there I could use.
