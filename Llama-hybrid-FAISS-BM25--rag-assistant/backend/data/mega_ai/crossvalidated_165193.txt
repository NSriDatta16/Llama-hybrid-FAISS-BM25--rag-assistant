Covarying correlation coefficients (measured with fMRI ROI time series) with behavioral measure

I have a set of fMRI data. I drew ROIs on them, and extracted time series from them. I need to compute correlation coefficients between different ROIs for each subject and see how they covary across a behavioral measure. In another analysis, I need to compare correlation coefficients between two groups. I obviously can't just average the correlation coefficients (or their square) and do a t-test on them. I have been told that I need Linear Mixed Model for Longitudinal Data for this purpose. Why is that and how do I do this? Thank you.
