If one value of bias is high and one is low then what indication it gives us?

I am dealing with fully connected neural network. Where I initialize bias with zero weights. But during training process one bias adopts a high positive value and other adopts negative value. I want to classify my data into two classes. I want to know what these bias values tell us?How they can help in classification problem?
