Response.Redirect in Application_AuthenticateRequest RawUrl

I am using a Response.Redirect in global.asax.cs. When the page loads the RawUrl property contains an encoded directory of some kind. "/(F(D7zFAWNl_SpT-cuyRXksIZnvwBB_bYfBl3ens83McZjPg9zLBvcjvik6FkwBNhnjeK-faeUt6PUYOZSsYXKdg4hi4IDPTDO5diQf693NLpw1))/Integration/Workflow.aspx" Where does this horrible directory come from? It's breaking a bunch of user controls on the target page which use the RawUrl to get path information. Why would Response.Redirect invent this horrible path and add it? Is there any way around this? Thanks Craig
