Autocorrelation is a simple, reliable technique to find cyclic patterns in data. If you have a one-hour-intervaled time series over let's say one week, you can create about 35 new time series (7 days in one week x 5 weeks) by lagging the original series by n days (n is from 1 to 35) by one day. Next calculate R-squared for the original series and each lagged series; then plot those data points (n, or units of lag on the x-axis, and R-squared on the y-axis) if instead of R-squared, you calculate correlation (so negative y values are possible) then plot those values, you get a correlogram and by looking at its shape it can tell you about the inter-day periodicity of that series. so for very high R-squared (near 1.0) the original series and lagged series are back in phase; if this occurs at multiples of seven, for instance, then your data has weekly periodicity.... there's a lot of reasons why this valuable information, not the least of which is that removing cycles (and the trend and regime shift if any) is a crucial predicate before forecasting (predicting future values in a time series). So for instance, perhaps the most frequently used family of forecasting models is ARIMA ; the first two letters in that acronym stand for auto-regressive .
