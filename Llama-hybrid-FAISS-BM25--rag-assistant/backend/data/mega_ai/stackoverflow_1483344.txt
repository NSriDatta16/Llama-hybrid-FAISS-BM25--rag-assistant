How to use double buffer in this case?

Let's say i have three control A, B, C. They are all inherited from CDialog, A is a main dialog , A contains B, and B contains C. and each time i use mouse mouse drag C, B and C will move together. This is a image: http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/7039/31709956.jpg We know this will cause B and C to redraw themselves. and it might cause flicker. And my question is whether not there is a method to double buffer these two dialogs B and C? I know that in XP and vista, there is a attribute WS_EX_COMPOSITED that will help, but i don't want to use this. someone might suggest me to use memDC, but my problem is how can i merge the actions in B's ondraw and C's ondraw function into a buffer ? Hope someone know what i said. Thanks in advance!
