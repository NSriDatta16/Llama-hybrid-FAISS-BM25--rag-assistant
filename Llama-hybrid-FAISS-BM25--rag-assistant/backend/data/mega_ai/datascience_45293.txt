Dealing with time series data which has multiple observations for the same timestamp

I have a time series data in Python 3 as follows: Date `Weekly_Sales` 2010-05-02 3400 2010-05-02 5600 2010-05-02` 4590 2010-05-02 5800 2010-05-12 2380 2010-05-12 6700 2010-05-12 3700 The time series is not continuous as there are multiple observations of the same date.I'm trying to forecast sales in python using ARIMA but my ACF and PACF plot shows that there is no corelation between the lags.Also if i run the dickly fuller test to test stationarity,my system freezes. How can I fix this?
