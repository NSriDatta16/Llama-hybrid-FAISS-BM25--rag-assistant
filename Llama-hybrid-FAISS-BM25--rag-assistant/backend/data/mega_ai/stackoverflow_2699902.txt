get next/previous month from a Time object

I have a Time object and would like to find the next/previous month. Adding subtracting days does not work as the days per month vary. time = Time.parse('21-12-2008 10:51 UTC') next_month = time + 31 * 24 * 60 * 60 Incrementing the month also falls down as one would have to take care of the rolling time = Time.parse('21-12-2008 10:51 UTC') next_month = Time.utc(time.year, time.month+1) time = Time.parse('01-12-2008 10:51 UTC') previous_month = Time.utc(time.year, time.month-1) The only thing I found working was time = Time.parse('21-12-2008 10:51 UTC') d = Date.new(time.year, time.month, time.day) d >>= 1 next_month = Time.utc(d.year, d.month, d.day, time.hour, time.min, time.sec, time.usec) Is there a more elegant way of doing this that I am not seeing? How would you do it?
