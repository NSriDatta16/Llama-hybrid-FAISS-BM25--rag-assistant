If it is actually related to a queue of work, then queueing theory may be the best route to an answer. For the general case you could perhaps attempt a (multiple?) linear regression on the historical data, to detect if there is a statistically significant rising trend in the resource usage that is likely to lead to problems if it continues (you may also be able to predict how long it must continue to lead to problems with this technique - just set a threshold for 'problem' and use the slope of the trend to determine how long it will take). You would have to play around with this and with the variables you collect though, to see if there is any statistically significant relationship that you can discover in the first place. Although it covers a completely different topic (global warming), I've found tamino's blog (tamino.wordpress.com) to be a very good resource on statistical analysis of data that is full of knowns and unknowns. For example, see this post. edit: as per my comment I think the problem is somewhat analogous to the GW problem. You have short term bursts of activity which average out to zero, and long term trends superimposed that you are interested in. Also there is probably more than one long term trend, and it changes from time to time. Tamino describes a technique which may be suitable for this, but unfortunately I cannot find the post I'm thinking of. It involves sliding regressions along the data (imagine multiple lines fitted to noisy data), and letting the data pick the inflection points. If you could do this then you could perhaps identify a significant change in the trend. Unfortunately it may only be identifiable after the fact, as you may need to accumulate a lot of data to get significance. But it might still be in time to head off resource depletion. At least it may give you a robust way to determine what kind of safety margin and resources in reserve you need in future.
