Obtaining confidence over prediction?

I am facing a rather strange problem. Machine learning gives us a probability of a data point belonging to either class (classification) or the actual estimate of the dependent variable given independent variables (regression). I am interested in building a model that has output such as $P(y \leq \hat{y} | x)$ , that is, the 'probability of actual value to be less than or equal to predicted-value given x'. I have gone through confidence intervals and predictions intervals for Logistic Regression. Are they best, I can do? Is there stream of research or machine learning, which I am missing.
