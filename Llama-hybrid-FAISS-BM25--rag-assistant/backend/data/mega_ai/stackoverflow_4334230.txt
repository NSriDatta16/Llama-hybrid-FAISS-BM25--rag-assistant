Firstly, which document did you refer to when you wrote this line ? [self setDraggingSourceOperationMask:NSUIntegerMax forLocal:YES]; This doesn't make sense. Don't use NSUIntegerMax . Use operation masks as defined here . It's written there that NSUIntegerMax stands for everything, but you shouldn't use it; Apple may re-define the bit in the future. You should use NSDragOperationCopy or something specific. If you copied that line from a webpage or a book, you should stop trusting that book/webpage. Secondly, forLocal: should be NO to pass the data to another application; local here means application local. Third, instead of just setting the archived data in [pboard setData:data forType:librarySongDataType]; Consider making an NSFileWrapper and set it using writeFileWrapper: , see here . That way you can specify the file name to be created in Finder. Otherwise, the system doesn't have any idea what the data represent.
