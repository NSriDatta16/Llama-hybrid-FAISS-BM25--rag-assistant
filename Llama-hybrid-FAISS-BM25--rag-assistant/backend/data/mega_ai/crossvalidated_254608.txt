How do we know that adaptation is not messing up with ergodicity at a given finite time, and that a sampler is sampling from the correct distribution? If it makes sense at all, how much burn-in should one do to ensure that early adaptation is not biasing the chains? Ergodicity and bias are about asymptotic properties of the Markov chain, they tell nothing about the behaviour and distribution of the Markov chain at a given finite time . Adaptivity has nothing to do with this issue, any MCMC algorithm may produce simulations far from the target at a given finite time .
