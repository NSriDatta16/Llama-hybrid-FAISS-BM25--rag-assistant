Required number for logistic regression

I read that it is recommended that for LR, a useful rule of thumb comes from simulation experiments which suggest that the number of the less common of the two possible outcomes (“events”) divided by the number of predictor variables should be at least 10, and preferably greater. I'm not sure if I quite understand this. Does this mean say if the result was death, there were 7 predictor variables, and one of the predictor variables was playing baseball, which 4/100 people did, that 4/7
