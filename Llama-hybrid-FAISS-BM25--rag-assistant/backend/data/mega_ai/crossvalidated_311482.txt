Test for "cyclicality" in time series

Is there a good test for "cyclicality" in time series data, hopefully that is pre-built into a Python stats package or easy to write? I'm not looking for stationarity alone, because that would also test positive for random dispersion around a mean. I'm also not looking for autocorrelation alone, as I'm looking for a solution that works when the lags are variable (instead of a predictable cycle e.g. every year). For instance, look at the linked image below. There is: Autocorrelation from each smallest step to the next. Stationarity around the mean of the overall data set Trend (autocorrelation of the rate of change) from each smallest step to the next. However, this is stochastically bounded by the overall data set's stationarity Alternatively, the above could also be described as autocorrelation with a stochastic amount of lag that is itself autocorrelated. Given how often this occurs in time series data, I thought there might be something off-the-shelf. https://marketrealist.imgix.net/uploads/2016/03/joy-china.jpg?w=660&fit=max&auto=format
