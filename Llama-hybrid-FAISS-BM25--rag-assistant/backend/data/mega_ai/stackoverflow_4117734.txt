What you call "dynamic array" is not what is called a "dynamic array" in the Delphi world. A "dynamic array" is defined as MyVar: array of integer for instance. In your classes, you've only TList descendants. These TList descendants are some kind of dynamic storage, but it's called a TList (or TObjectList), instead of "dynamic array". So just use the TypInfo unit. GetPropList will get you the list of all properties. Then call GetObjectProp for every PPropInfo item which maps a class, and retrieve the instance of every property. Call GetStrProp to retrieve the content of a string published property; Call GetOrdProp to retrieve the content of an integer published property. Call GetFloatProp to get a floating point value, like a TDateTime. In case of a class published property, after having called GetObjectProp, check the returned instance type, and enumerate its content, according to its class (TObjectList or TListSubClass). It's such a method we use in our Open Source ORM (we've dedicated some object-oriented classes for properties access, so we don't need the typinfo unit).
