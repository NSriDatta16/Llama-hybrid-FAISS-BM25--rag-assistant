The idea behind a neural network is that it will "learn" what functions it needs to apply to the input data in order to map it to the desired output. A' and A" contain all the same information as A, and if they are genuinely more descriptive of the data (the most useful representation to a human may not be the most useful representation to the network), the network will learn to apply that transformation on its own. However, if you know for certain that the network will find it easier to learn on the transformed data, then applying those transformations in preprocessing will decrease training time and could make the trained network more powerful. So the final answer is: try it and see! Deep learning is very much an evolving science, so the only way to know for sure is to experiment.
