Insertion for unordered_map should be O(1) and retrieval should be roughly O(1) , (its essentially a hash-table). Your timings as a result are way OFF , or there is something WRONG with your implementation or usage of unordered_map. You need to provide some more information, and possibly how you are using the container. As per section 6.3 of n1836 the complexities for insertion/retreival are given: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1836.pdf One issue you should consider is that your implementation may need to continually be rehashing the structure, as you say you have 100mil+ items . In that case when instantiating the container, if you have a rough idea about how many "unique" elements will be inserted into the container, you can pass that in as a parameter to the constructor and the container will be instantiated accordingly with a bucket-table of appropriate size.
