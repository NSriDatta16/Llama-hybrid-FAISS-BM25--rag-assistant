I find that for practical purposes all JPA implementations including hibernate are extremely similar and will work for the same use cases. However they tend to be a bit, euhmmm...., temperamental if they are used for things which they were not designed for. Since you appear to be deciding on a persistence framework, I'd like to bring to your attention that there are other frameworks which work very well in other use cases where the JPA are difficult to use. iBatis allows you to write plain SQL queries in a separate file and map them to java objects. This keeps the SQL code out of your Java code. You give the queries a name and refer to that name in your code. This works extremely well with larger legacy database where you need to integrate with. For some simple informal queries things like the Spring JdbcTemplate work also good without the cognitive load of the previous frameworks.
