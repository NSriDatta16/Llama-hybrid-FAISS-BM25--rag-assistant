How can Perl interact with an ajax form

I'm writing a perl program that was doing a simple get command to retrieve results and process them. But the site has been updated and now has a java component that handles the results (so the actual data is not in the source code anymore). This is the site: http://wro.westchesterclerk.com/legalsearch.aspx Try putting in: Index Number: 11103 Year: 2009 I want to be able to pro grammatically enter the "index number" and "year" at the bottom of the form where it says "search by number" and then retrieve the results listed next to it. I've written many programs in Perl that simply pass variables via the URL and the results are listed in the source code, so it's easy to parse. (Using LWP:Simple) Like: $html = get("http://www.url.com?id=$somenum&year=$someyear") But this is totally new to me and I don't know where to begin. I'm somewhat familiar with LWP:UserAgent and Mechanize. I'd really appreciate any help. Thanks!
