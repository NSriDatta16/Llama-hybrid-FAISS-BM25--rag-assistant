NUnit vs Visual Studio 2010's MSTest?

I realise that there are many older questions addressing the general question of NUnit v MSTest for versions of Visual Studio up to 2008 (such as this one ). Microsoft have a history of getting things right in their 3rd version. For MSTest, that is VS2010. Have they done so with MSTest ? Would you use it in a new project in preference to NUnit? My specific concerns: speed running tests within CruiseControl.NET (either commandline or MSBuild task) code coverage reports from CC.NET can you run MSTest tests in debug mode (We use ReSharper, so test-runners are not an issue for us. We have used NUnit for the last few years. We do not have TFS.)
