would support vector machine help? as far as i know, SVM only deals with continuous - variables as the predictors ... Binary variables are not a problem for SVM. Even specialized kernels exist for exactly such data (Hamming kernel, Tanimoto/Jaccard kernel), though I don't recommend using those if you're not intimately familiar with kernel methods. would logistic regression apply here? as far as i know, the predictors in logistic regression also are continuous Logistic regression works with binary predictors. It is probably your best option. how to explain the relationships in these models (especially to clinicians). If you use linear SVM it is fairly straightforward to explain what's going on. Logistic regression is a better option, though, since most clinicials actually know these models (and by know I mean have heard of ).
