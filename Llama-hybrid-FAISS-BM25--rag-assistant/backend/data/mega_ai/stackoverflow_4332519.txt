Shameless plug: I'm one of the co-authors 1 of Groovy in Action , which is pretty well regarded in Groovy circles, as far as I'm aware. There's a second edition in progress - if you order that now, you get early access to the second edition ebook as it's written, and a full copy of the first edition ebook to be going on with. That said, of course there are plenty of other books around Groovy - with some particularly focusing on one area, such as Grails. 1 Actually I'm more like a glorified editor. While I've touched large portions of the text, I've written very few complete paragraphs, if you see what I mean.
