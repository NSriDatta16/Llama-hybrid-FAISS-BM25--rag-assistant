As far as I understand the issue, your question boils down to how to appropriately model a non-linear time trend as the repeating U-shaped pattern may confound your treatment effect estimate. This is a valid concern and I agree that flexibly modeling the time trend as a robustness check is a good idea. Here are a few thoughts on a number of possible specifications and their pros and cons: In general, I would not suggest to use a high-order polynomial time trend. While they are very flexible, high-order polynomials are known to be problematic when estimating treatment effects, see for instance this paper by Andrew Gelman and Gudio Imbens . You could instead go for simple polynomials, i.e., quadratic terms. However, instead of using one quadratic term that is unit-specific (which does not make sense for repeated U-shaped patterns), you could try a quadratic trend that is unit-year-specific. This accounts for U-shapes where the characteristics of the U-shape can also change over time. However, depending on the specifics of your data set, this might heavily overfit and could well be too much to ask from your data. You could also stay in your proposed framework where you use sine and cosine based time trends. However, be aware that this comes with its own set of assumptions, most importantly that the intensity of the sine and cosine does not change over time. This means that the characteristics of the U-shape are constant across years. Assuming that this specification will be used in an economics paper, you will need to lay out in detail why you think that the trend in your y-variable behaves like this. This may or may not make sense, depending on the specific context you are looking at. In case you want to fully dive into advanced time series econometrics, you could look into state space models. Here, you could fit a local level model which basically allows you to fit a smooth time trend function to your data. This can capture much more flexible patterns in your data (e.g., the intensity of the U-shape can also change over time), but will require more tuning. There may also be the "problem" that there could be no R-packages available for estimating state space models with unit-specific local means. All in all, this may be a bit of an overkill for a robustness check. Long story short, in case the assumption of a sinusoidal trend in your data makes sense in your context, go for it and make sure to argue why you think that this is a sensible assumption.
