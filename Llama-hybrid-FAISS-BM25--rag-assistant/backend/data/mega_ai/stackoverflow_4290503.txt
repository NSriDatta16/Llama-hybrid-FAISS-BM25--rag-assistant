Time performance

Hi I have a question that this is my class which for each "n" will get the average time for it. also the method that I want to take its performance has T(n)= O(nlogn) my code : public class NewClass1 { public static void main(String[] args) { List randList = new ArrayList (); for (int n = 100; n list) { long time = 0; for(int i=1;i and it will print: 1.5 1.6 0.0 the average time is OK? because for n = 500 will have 0.0 and for n = 300 will have 1.6
