Ruby on Rails + Jquery: Saving data from draggable lists

I'm trying to save data to the MySQL database in Rails when the user drags items from different lists. I'm using the below Jquery script and HTML: $(document).ready(function() { $("#draggable").draggable( { connectToSortable: 'ul#myList', helper:'clone' } ); $("#myList").sortable(); }); HTML: Drag me to myList item 1 item 2 I've been Googling for the last few hours but can't seem to find how to save data between multiple lists using Rails. Any idea?
