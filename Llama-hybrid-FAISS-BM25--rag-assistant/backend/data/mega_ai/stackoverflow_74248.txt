In JSTL/JSP, given a java.util.Date, how do I find the next day?

On a JSTL/JSP page, I have a java.util.Date object from my application. I need to find the day after the day specified by that object. I can use to drop into Java and use java.util.Calendar to do the necessary calculations, but this feels clumsy and inelegant to me. Is there some way to use JSP or JSTL tags to achieve this end without having to switch into full-on Java, or is the latter the only way to accomplish this?
