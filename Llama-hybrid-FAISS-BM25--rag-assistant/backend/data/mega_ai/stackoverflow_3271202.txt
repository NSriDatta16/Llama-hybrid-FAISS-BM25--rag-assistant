Drupal 6 knowing it's current environment

I want to write a utility function so my Drupal project knows if it's running on the development, staging or live server. Something like: function mymodule_is_development() { return (//some condition) ? TRUE : FALSE; } Does anyone know how to do this the Drupal way? Drupal's multisite functionality should be leveraged I think...
