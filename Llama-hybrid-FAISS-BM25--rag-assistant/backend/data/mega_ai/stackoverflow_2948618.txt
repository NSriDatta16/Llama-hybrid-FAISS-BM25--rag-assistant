IMO you should just initialize your member variables in all constructors, at least with a sensible default value: A () : m_val(0.0) {} A (double val) : m_val(val) {} I don't see any benefit in retaining a garbage value in your variables (unless you plan to use them as a very crude random number generator - just kidding :-). Such garbage values and extra flags complicate the code, and would always require programmer attention to avoid bugs - and as we are humans, our attention sometimes slips...
