Here are a few options: You can use the glht function in the multcomp package for R and specify your own contrasts/comparisons. The result can be used with the confint function to compute the confidence intervals. You can use the Predict.Plot function in the TeachingDemos package for R (and the related TkPredict function) to create plots that will demonstrate how the predictions change with the variables. You fit the model using Bayesian methods and MCMC, then you just do the calculation that you want to get the posterior distribution of the combination of interest and plot that, or the intervals based on them.
