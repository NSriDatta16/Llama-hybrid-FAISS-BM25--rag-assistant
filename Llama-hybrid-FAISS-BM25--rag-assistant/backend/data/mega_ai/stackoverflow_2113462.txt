Really simple solution: Make the unique ID with: $id = 100; base_convert($id, 10, 36); Get the original value again: intval($str,36); Can't take credit for this as it's from another stack overflow page, but I thought the solution was so elegant and awesome that it was worth copying over to this thread for people referencing this.
