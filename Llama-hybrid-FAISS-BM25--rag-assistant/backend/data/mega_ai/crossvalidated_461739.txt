I'm also looking for a Python library to do STAR automatically but have no luck. It's quite interesting that after seven years, spatio-temporal analysis is still not attracting any developers' attention. I guess that tells something. Given that I want to experiment with different weight matrices $\mathbf{W}_n$ , I'm already determined to write my own optimization program to minimize the object function: $\mathbf{Y}_{n,t} = c + \sum_{\tau=1}^{\tau=T}\Phi_\tau\mathbf{W}_n\mathbf{Y}_{n,t-\tau} + \mathbf{\epsilon}_{n,t}$ As for VAR, it's more like multivariate time series analysis and therefore doesn't capture the spatial correlation. If distances/adjacency really matter in the model, VAR is certainly not a good choice.
