The outlier has an OK absolute value (on the right hand side there are normal values just as high), it is only anomalous because it deviates significantly from the time steps around it. When only passing in single samples to the anomaly detector this is impossible to learn, instead have to use some time window. This can be as simple as using the previous N samples as features for each timestep. So called lagged features. Windows size is a hyperparameter, 2-10 should work OK in this case. Since the difference might be informative one can also compute and pass in those. Probably Isolation Forest will catch the anomaly in this case. An autoencoder with a small LSTM or GRU is probably a better option though, again using a small time window.
