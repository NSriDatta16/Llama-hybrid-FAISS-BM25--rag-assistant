Is it possible to create a custom mail storage for MS Outlook 2007?

I know that Outlook stores all mail in a .PST file. Is it possible to create a custom storage engine for outlook 2007? I would like to have the functionality similar to 'Personal folders', but have a new node of folders where everything is stored in a SQL Server database. Is Outlook extensible enough to allow swapping the internal storage, while leaving the UI intact (so I don't have to recreate it from scratch)? Thanks
