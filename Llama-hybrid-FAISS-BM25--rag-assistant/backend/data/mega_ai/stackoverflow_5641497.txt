This might be too heavy an approach, but you can use jQueryUI draggable , combined with this touch library . It works pretty smoothly on iPad, I assume it would work on iPhone as well. With jQuery and those two libraries, you just call '.draggable' on the div you want to move. $('#divToDrag').draggable(); There are a zillion options for jQueryUI draggable divs, but that gets you the basics.
