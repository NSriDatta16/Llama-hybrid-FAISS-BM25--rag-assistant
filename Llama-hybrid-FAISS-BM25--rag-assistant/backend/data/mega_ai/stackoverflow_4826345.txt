If you are not bound for having the index in Sql, try a indexing engine like Lucene.Net . In my project I store the data in Azure Table Storage and index them in the Lucene index. There is a wrapper for Lucene.Net for the use in Azure. This way you don't need Sql. Table Storage is cheaper than Azure Sql.
