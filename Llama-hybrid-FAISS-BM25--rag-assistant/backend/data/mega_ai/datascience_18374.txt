Predicting probability from scikit-learn SVC decision_function with decision_function_shape='ovo'

I have a multiclass SVM classifier with labels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'. This is the code I'm running: >>>print clf.predict([predict_this]) ['A'] >>>print clf.decision_function([predict_this]) [[ 185.23220833 43.62763596 180.83305074 -93.58628288 62.51448055 173.43335293]] How can I use the output of decision function to predict the class (A/B/C/D) with the highest probability and if possible, it's value? I have visited https://stackoverflow.com/a/20114601/7760998 but it is for binary classifiers and could not find a good resource which explains the output of decision_function for multiclass classifiers with shape ovo (one-vs-one). Edit: The above example is for class 'A'. For another input the classifier predicted 'C' and gave the following result in decision_function [[ 96.42193513 -11.13296606 111.47424538 -88.5356536 44.29272494 141.0069203 ]] For another different input which the classifier predicted as 'C' gave the following result from decision_function, [[ 290.54180354 -133.93467605 116.37068951 -392.32251314 -130.84421412 284.87653043]] Had it been ovr (one-vs-rest), it would become easier by selecting the one with higher value, but in ovo (one-vs-one) there are (n * (n - 1)) / 2 values in the resulting list. How to deduce which class would be selected based on the decision function?
