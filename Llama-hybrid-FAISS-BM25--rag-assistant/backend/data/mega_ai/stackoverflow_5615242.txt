How would I go about making my q and a page like this: http://www.text-link-ads.com/r/faq

My q and a page sucks - it's this: http://rankingclimber.com/qa.php I checked out http://www.text-link-ads.com/r/faq and i really liked how the questions were clickable and the answers came down below. I checked out the source code for text-link-ads.com and found the below code. But I feel like this requires some css file or some .js file in addition to this. can someone help me and give me instructions on how to do this? I have a basic knowledge of html and css. What makes Text Link Ads unique? Text Link Ads are unique because they are static html links that can drive targeted traffic and help your link popularity which is a top factor in organic search engine rankings. How are Text Link Ads priced? Text Link Ads are priced at a flat rate per month per link. You prepay for a 30 day run of your ad, and your account will be set on recurring billing either via PayPal or credit card. Your ad will never be turned off if it gets too many impressions or clicks. Our pricing algorithm factors in a website's: traffic, theme, ad position, and link popularity when setting the flat ad rate per month. I just placed an order, when will my ad go live? Most links are placed within 48 hours of the order being received. New ads require our publisher to review and accept the ad. The 30 day billing period will not begin until your ad is actually live. What is Alexa? A website's "Alexa" ranking is a general indicator of the amount of traffic a website receives. The lower the number the more traffic that site receives, ie Yahoo.com is #1, Ebay.com is #8. More information on Alexa here . How do I review my active running ads?
