Are you doing a PCA or an EFA? You say that you do a factor analysis and use a direct oblimin rotation, but you also note that you are extracting components. PCA and EFA rely on different theoretical assumptions, and one should not use an oblique rotation for a PCA, as it goes against the fundamental point of the PCAâ€”to maximize interindividual differences. What software/packages are you using? What output you get is somewhat determined by what the programmers thought necessary given one factor extracted. What are the eigenvalues? What does the scree plot look like? If it is extracting one factor, and there is an obvious elbow at the second eigenvalue, then extracting one factor seems reasonable for these six questions.
