mysql sort string as date not as string

The DB I inherited stored there dates like: yyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss I was hoping to sort by date in my mysql query but it is treating them like a string and sorting accordingly. Any one know of a way to sort them as a date and not a string in the query itself? Thanks, Robert
