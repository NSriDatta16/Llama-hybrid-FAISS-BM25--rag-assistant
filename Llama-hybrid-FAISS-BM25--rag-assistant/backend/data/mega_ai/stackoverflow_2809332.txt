I am trying to Drag a toolbar button to a tree node. Is it possible? Buttons can not be dragged, is is not a normal UI behavior. If you really want do drag a button, you have to implement your own behavior. Extend from the button and override the methods for mouse up and mouse down behavior. Is there any list of components/classes available that currently allow to be dragged? Sorry, no, there is no list.
