Mike, The problem is that during deserialization, the JSON deserializer does not know what type to deserialize the element at position 2 to. You need to provide a "__type" hint. You can get the __type hint for thie particular type by actually serializing it out to JSON in a polymorphic situation, and seeing what type hint gets emitted. For more info, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb412170.aspx . Pay particular attention to the sections "Collections Assigned to Object" and "Preserving Type Information"
