LuaL_openlibs() and sandboxing scripts

I am embedding Lua (5.1) in a C/C++ application. I am using the LuaL_openlibs() function to load the base libs. However, this function loads some other libraries which I want to disable so that they are not available to my Lua scripts. Specifically, I want to disable the IO and OS modules. Is there a function I can call to programmativally disable (or unload) these modules so that I can create a safe sandbox environment for running Lua scripts?
