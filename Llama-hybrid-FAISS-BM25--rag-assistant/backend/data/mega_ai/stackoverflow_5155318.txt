The Zope Object Database (ZODB) is an object-oriented database for transparently and persistently storing Python objects. It is included as part of the Zope web application server, but can also be used independently of Zope. ZODB provides an easier persistence alternative to relational databases, for object oriented python software. The ZODB is fully ACID compliant, stores BLOBs efficiently, supports pluggable storages and employs a scalable architecture. See zodb.org for more information.
