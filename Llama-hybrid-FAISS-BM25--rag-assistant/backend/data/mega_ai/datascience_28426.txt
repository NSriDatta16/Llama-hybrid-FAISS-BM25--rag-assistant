Train Accuracy vs Test Accuracy vs Confusion matrix

After I developed my predictive model using Random Forest I get the following metrics: Train Accuracy :: 0.9764634601043997 Test Accuracy :: 0.7933284397683713 Confusion matrix [[28292 1474] [ 6128 889]] This is the results from this code: training_features, test_features, training_target, test_target, = train_test_split(df.drop(['bad_loans'], axis=1), df['target'], test_size = .3, random_state=12) clf = RandomForestClassifier() trained_model = clf.fit(training_features, training_target) trained_model.fit(training_features, training_target) predictions = trained_model.predict(test_features) Train Accuracy: accuracy_score(training_target, trained_model.predict(training_features)) Test Accuracy: accuracy_score(test_target, predictions) Confusion Matrix: confusion_matrix(test_target, predictions) However I'm getting a little confuse to interpret and explain this values. What exactly this 3 measures tell me about my model? Thanks!
