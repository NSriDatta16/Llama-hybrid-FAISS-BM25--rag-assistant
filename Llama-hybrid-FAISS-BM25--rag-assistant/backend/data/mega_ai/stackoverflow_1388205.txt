format integer to string

I have an integer field in a table and I want to make a query to format the integer value of this field in an char or double field with a especific format. For example, if my value in the table is 123456 I want to format it as "###.###" what means the result should be like this: 123.456 I've done this using CONCAT function, but the result is not very elegant. I would like to use another funciont spacific for this purpose.
