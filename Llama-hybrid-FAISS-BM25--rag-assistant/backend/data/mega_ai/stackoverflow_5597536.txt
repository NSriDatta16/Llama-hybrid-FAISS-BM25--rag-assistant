You are using the indirect object syntax that Perl allows (but in modern code is discouraged). Basically, if a name is not predeclared, it can be placed in front of an object (or class name) separated with a space. So the line acquire TTT actually means TTT->acquire . If you actually had a subroutine named acquire in scope, it would instead be interpreted as aquire(TTT) which is can lead to ambiguity (hence why it is discouraged). You should also update the new TTT(); line in the method to read TTT->new;
