In calculating the F-measure with precision and recall, why is the harmonic mean used?

The article for F-measure in Wikipedia says: The traditional F-measure or balanced F-score (F1 score) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall: $F_1=2\times\frac{precision \times recall}{precision+recall}$ Why is the harmonic mean used in particular, and not the arithmetic mean or geometric mean or any other type of averages ? What exactly does it mean, to calculate an harmonic mean?
