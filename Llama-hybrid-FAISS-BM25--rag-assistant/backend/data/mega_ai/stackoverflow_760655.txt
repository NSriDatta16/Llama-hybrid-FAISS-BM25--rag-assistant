Good CMS/Publishing platform with media plugin and nice urls

I'm looking for a good publishing platform with a good media gallery. I'll need to show several sorts of video and images, so a good media gallery is a must. I've tried drupal, but I don't like the node organization structure. I'm searching for a simple URL scheme, because in the future I may want to migrate my static html site to this platform. So I prefer a platform where urls are like www.mysite.com/parent/child/grandchild/page kinda like the atlassian confluence urls (ex: confluence/display/TKB/Technical+Details). This way I'll be able to make a simple script to migrate my static page to the dynamic version. Edit: The CMS/publishing platform must run on PHP.
