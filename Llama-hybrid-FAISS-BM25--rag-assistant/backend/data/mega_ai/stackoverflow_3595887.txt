content = ['This is Sams Content', 'This is someone\'s else content'] author = ['Sam', 'Someone Else'] reviews = [] for i in range(len(author)): d = { 'content': content[i], 'author': author[i] } reviews.append(d) for r in reviews: print "Author: %s, content: %s" % (r['author'], r['content']) EDIT for those who complained that range(len(...)) isn't sufficiently Pythonic (to which I say merely "seriously?"), here's the same solution using enumerate() as suggested: content = ['This is Sams Content', 'This is someone\'s else content'] author = ['Sam', 'Someone Else'] reviews = [] for i, elem in enumerate(author): d = { 'content': content[i], 'author': elem, } reviews.append(d) for r in reviews: print "Author: %s, content: %s" % (r['author'], r['content']) Personally I prefer the range(len(...)) solution over enumerate , because accessing both arrays in the same style when creating the hash aids readability. zip is still the most elegant solution though.
