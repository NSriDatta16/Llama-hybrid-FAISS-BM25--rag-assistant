Looks like you want go for unsupervised methods for feature selection. You can use PCA but it might not be that effective. I would suggest to go through these links. https://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-with-real-and-categorical-data/ https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/13/Papers/241.pdf https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/108743/methods-in-r-or-python-to-perform-feature-selection-in-unsupervised-learning There is a method called Principal Feature Analysis in Link 4. You can have a look at that. If you are using R, there is sparcl package for sparse clustering.
