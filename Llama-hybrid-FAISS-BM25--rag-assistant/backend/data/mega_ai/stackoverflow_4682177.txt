Emacs: Determine location in file

Say I've been browsing a source file in emacs and I've noticed something that I'd like to bring to the attention of a colleague. Is there an easy way (i.e. command) to get the file name and location of the point, e.g. if I'm on line 21 in foo.cpp c:\temp\foo.cpp:21
