From what percentage should I remove a column that has empty values?

I have a problem. I am currently cleaning and preprocessing my data. Suppose I have the following data set ID CarName MaxSpeed_in_kmh Costs Liter_per_100kmh 1 Mercedes-Benz 190 100000 5.5 2 Mercedes-Benz 180 4.9 3 Porsche 4 Mercedes-Benz 3.5 5 Porsche 260 6 BMW 140 7 VW 110 50000 8 VW 90 11.8 9 Porsche 280 10 Column Percentage_of_missing_columns CarName 10% MaxSpeed_in_kmh 20% Costs 80% Liter_per_100kmh 40% At what percentage is it recommended to completely delete a particular column? For example, I have defined 65% from experience, since it is often hard to fill up more than 65% of empty values (with average, etc.). Is there a generally valid statement? According to my example, the following columns would be removed: Costs , because they have more than 65% empty values. The remaining empty columns would be filled. Or does it vary from data set to data set, if so how do I know what would be a good percentage?
