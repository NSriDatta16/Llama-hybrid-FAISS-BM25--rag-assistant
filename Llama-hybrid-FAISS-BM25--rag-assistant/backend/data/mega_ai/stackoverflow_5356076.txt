I added this as a comment, but will offer up here as well. Hope this isn't overly simplistic, and looking at the detailed responses I may be misunderstanding the exact problem, but anyway... Seems your organisations table has column no (org.no) that is defined as a number. In your hardcoded example, you use numbers to do the compares. JOIN organisations org ON (cust.org_id = org.id AND ((10 IS NULL) OR (10 = org.no))) In your procedure, you are passing in varchar2 : PROCEDURE DO_STUFF( org_from VARCHAR2 := NULL, org_to VARCHAR2 := NULL) So to compare varchar2 to number, Oracle will have to do the conversions , so this may cause the full scans. Solution: change proc to pass in numbers
