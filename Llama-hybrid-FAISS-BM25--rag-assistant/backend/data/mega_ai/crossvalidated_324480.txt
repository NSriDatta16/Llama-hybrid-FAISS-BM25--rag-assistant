As indicated in the answer by stans , the question does not make sense in that the integral depends on the parameterisation of the likelihood, which is arbitrary. And the integral also depends on the choice of the dominating measure, which again can be arbitrary. Furthermore, outside the Bayesian framework, integrating out the parameter is not of particular interest, since the classical approach seeks the "true" parameter that led to the generation of the data. Within the Bayesian framework, the constant prior has no specific appeal, except for some special cases . Like location parameters. But in general the constant prior should not be interpreted as a "uniform prior", again because this interpretation fails to account for the dependence on the parameterisation.
