Delete multiple objects in Rails with a RESTful controller?

I'd like to delete multiple objects of the same type using a RESTful controller. The most simple thing I can think of is to have the destroy action expect a comma-separated list of ids of objects to destroy. Is there a more elegant way to do this?
