In R, many packages are potentially useful, as partially summarized in the CRAN Task View on time series: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html . Here is a relevant excerpt on change detection: Change point detection is provided in strucchange and strucchangeRcpp (using linear regression models) and in trend (using nonparametric tests). The changepoint package provides many popular changepoint methods, and ecp does nonparametric changepoint detection for univariate and multivariate series. changepoint.np implements the nonparametric PELT algorithm, changepoint.mv detects changepoints in multivariate time series, while changepoint.geo implements the high-dimensional changepoint detection method GeomCP. Factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) models are estimated by a Bayesian method with FAVAR. InspectChangepoint uses sparse projection to estimate changepoints in high-dimensional time series. Rbeast provides Bayesian change-point detection and time series decomposition. breakfast includes methods for fast multiple change-point detection and estimation. For those interested in Bayesian methods, three possibilities are Rbeast , bcp , and mcp ( I am sure that there are more than three of them). Below is a quick example using the Rbeast package developed by myself ( https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast ): libray(Rbeast) out = beast(Nile) # the annual streamflow data for the Nile River plot(out) The Pr(tcp) subplot shows the probability of sudden/significant changes over time, with the peaks given the most likely locations of changepoint occurrence. In this example, only one was detected. The SlpSgn subplot shows the probability of slopes being positive (the upper red portion), being zero (the middle green portion), and being negative (the lower blue portion).
