Vector AR/ARMA Model

For a vector AR/ARMA model in practice, if there are k different time series in the vector, there are k corresponding Gaussian white noises as well. Is it realistic to assume that those k white noises are independent of each other, or not, in many real world examples, the covariance matrix of those k white noises is not close to a diagonal matrix? Moreover, in practical problems, what is a common range for k?
