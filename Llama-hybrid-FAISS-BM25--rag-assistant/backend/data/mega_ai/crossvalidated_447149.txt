How to formally express low confidence in data in Bayesian framework?

I am trying to build a Bayesian regression model, and I am looking for a formal way to express low confidence in noisy data. I know that should be reflected in the prior specification.. I am using normally distributed priors with small variances to do this. When I do this, the posterior parameter estimates are aligned to the prior, with no influence from the data. However, the model error component is high as that is inferred from the data. So, my posterior predictive distributions are off due to the variance component, which is influenced from the data. Basically, I want the posterior predictive distribution to be the same as the prior predictive distribution. Thanks
