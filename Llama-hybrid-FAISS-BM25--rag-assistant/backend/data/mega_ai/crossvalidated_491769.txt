Can PCA generate a new random image?

I read The Batch: GANs newsletter and Goodfellow said: My colleague Bing Xu modeled face images from the Toronto Face Database, which were only 90 pixels square and grayscale. Because the faces were always centered and looking straight at the camera, even very simple algorithms like PCA could make pretty good faces . I wonder how PCA can be used to make faces. As far as I know, it can be used to reconstruct image like in the article Facial Image Compression and Reconstruction with PCA . But can it generate a new random image?
