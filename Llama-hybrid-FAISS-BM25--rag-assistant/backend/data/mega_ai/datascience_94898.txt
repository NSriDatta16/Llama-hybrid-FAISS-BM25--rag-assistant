The quality of a regression model is domain specific. Different problems and data sets will have different standards for relative model improvement. Typically machine learning models are measured by their performance on the hold-out dataset (i.e., validation or test dataset). Thus, the training loss values are not as important in measuring model quality. One way to frame the interpretation is to pick several evaluation metrics, such as Mean Square Error(MSE), Root Mean Square Error(RMSE), or Mean Absolute Error(MAE), and see which ones are improving on a hold-out dataset.
