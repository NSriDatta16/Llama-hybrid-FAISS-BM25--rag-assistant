Table of averages by date for multiple IDs

I have a table full of items that each have a unique ItemID . There is another table with information on tests that are done on these items around once a month (some may have multiple tests per month and some may have none some months) and each test entry has a full date mm/dd/yyyy . I would like to display the average of one of the fields over all the data on a monthly basis. So assuming what I'm averaging is the item weight, I want to end up with a table like this: Date AvgOfWeight 1/09 24.55 2/09 28.64 3/09 22.39 and so on... I know that I can do a query to do averages and I can group the averages by certain criteria, but is there an easy way to group mm/dd/yyyy dates by month?
