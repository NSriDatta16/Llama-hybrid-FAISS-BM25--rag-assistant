If you are using WebForms style control ( ), you can create a bool property on the control and trigger the visibility of the fragment based on that property. If you are using the MVC style control ( Html.RenderPartial() ), you can pass the bool value in the control model. If your control does not take currently a model, your bool value will become your model.
