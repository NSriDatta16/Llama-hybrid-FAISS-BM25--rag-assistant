WPF: Can't drop dragged data onto an ItemsControl

I have the following XAML: When I drag data onto this panel, the mouse cursor shows a drop is allowed on all the child items, but on any empty space, the cursor shows that dropping is disabled. If I set AllowDrop to false, I can't drop onto the child items anymore, so the flag DOES have an effect. I would like to drop data into the margins between the items in the ItemsControl . Any ideas?
