Android ListFragment Cursor managing

I want to use ListFragment and Loader Class for my android app. (honeycomb level SDK, but Google release comparability package) in Fragment, is it has managing cursor API with Fragmemt life cycle Activity has " startManagingCursor(Cursor c) " or Fragment automatically manage cursor in its life cycle?
