Creating a second form page for a has_many relationship

I have an Organization model that has_many users through affiliations. And, in the form of the organization ( the standard edit ) I use semanting_form_for and semantic_fields_for to display the organization fields and affiliations fields. But I wish to create a separete form just to handle the affiliations of a specific organization. I was trying to go to the Organization controller and create a an edit_team and update_team methods then on the routes create those pages, but it's getting a mess and not working. am I on the right track?
