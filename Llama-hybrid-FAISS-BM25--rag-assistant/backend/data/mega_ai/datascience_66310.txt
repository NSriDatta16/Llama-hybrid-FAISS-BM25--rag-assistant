Plot the loss of both train amd test loss on single graph after every epoch and check that it should not overfit or underfit..most commenly overfit happens in deep learning so keep track on that. Once the your distance between both train and test loss increases on graph stop at that time and save the weights. You can also keep track of weights of every layer also if your model overfit.
