Regression analysis for more than one categorical variable in time series

I have a time series data for shipment with following variables: Year: 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 Month: jan, feb, ..., dec Number of ordering days Shipment Volume I want to know the effect of the number of ordering days on the shipment volume. Can this can be done using regression method? If so, should I consider month and year as categorical variables?
