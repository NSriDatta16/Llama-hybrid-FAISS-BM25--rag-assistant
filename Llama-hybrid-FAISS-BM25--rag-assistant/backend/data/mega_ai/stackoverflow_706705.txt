Most of my programming experience is in Windows and I'm a big fan of visual studio (especially with Resharper, if you happen to be doing C# coding). These days I've been writing an application for linux in C++. After trying all the IDEs (Netbeans, KDevelop, Eclipse CDT, etc), I found Netbeans to be the least crappy. For me, absolute minimum requirements are that I be able to single-step through code and that I have intellisense, with ideally some refactoring functions as well. It's amazing to me how today's linux IDE's are not even close to what Visual Studio 6 was over ten years ago. The biggest pain point right now is how slow and poorly implemented the intellisense in Netbeans is. It takes 2-3 seconds to populate on a fast machine with 8GB of RAM. Eclipse CDT's intellisense was even more laggy. I'm sorry, but a 2 second wait for intellisense doesn't cut it. So now I'm looking into using VS from Windows, even though my only build target is linux... Chris, you might want to look at the free automation build server 'CruiseControl', which integrates with all main source control systems (svn, tfs, sourcesafe, etc.). It's whole purpose is to react to check-ins in a source control system. In general, you configure it so that anytime anyone checks code in, a build is initiated and (ideally) unit tests are run. For some languages there are some great plugins that do code analysis, measure unit test code coverage, etc. Notifications are sent back to the team about successful / broken builds. Here's a post describing how it can be set up for C++: link (thoughtworks.org) . I'm just getting started with converting from a linux-only simple config (Netbeans + SVN, with no build automation) to using Windows VS 2008 with build automation back-end that runs unit tests in addition to doing builds in linux. I shudder at the amount of time it's going to take me to get that all configured, but the sooner the better, I guess. In my ideal end-state I'll be able to auto-generate the Netbeans project file from the VS project, so that when I need to debug something in linux I can do so from that IDE. VS project files are XML-based, so that shouldn't be too hard. If anyone has any pointers for any of this, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks, Christophe
