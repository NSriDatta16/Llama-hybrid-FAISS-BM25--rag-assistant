I first created a my_website.metaproj beside the my_solution.sln that looked like this: Then it complained about not finding sgen.exe. I installed Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 on the build agent and it looks like it is working now. [Edit] This actually didn't completely work. It wasn't pulling the dependencies of the website project to its bin directory. What we ended up doing was scraping the upgrade build process and redoing the build process with a variation of the standard template. This worked fine.
