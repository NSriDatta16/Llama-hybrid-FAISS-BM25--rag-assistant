PHP + jQuery - How to form submit, process and redirect on success?

Stupid question (I seem to be leading all my questions with this phrase), but I was wondering if anyone out there had an elegant solution for processing forms via php and jquery and then redirects [HTML FORM] --> submits via jquery post to --> [PHP FILE] --> upon success redirects to --> [SUCCESS HTML PAGE] (and if not success returns back to [HTML FORM] HTML FORM example ...fields here ladeeda... JQUERY POST example $("form#registerAccount").submit(function(){ $.post( "procRegister.php", $("form#registerAccount").serialize(), function(data){alert(data.msg);}, 'json' ); return false; }); PHP PROCESSING example If everything works correctly then the page would pop up an alert box saying "Alright!". Now, how and where would I implement the redirect upon success? i.e. Instead of sending "Alright" how would I redirect the user to, say a CONFIRMATION page?
