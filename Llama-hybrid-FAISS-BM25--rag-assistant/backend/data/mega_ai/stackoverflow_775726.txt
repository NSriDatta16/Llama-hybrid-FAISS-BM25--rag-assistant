What's the fuss about Haskell?

I know a few programmers who keep talking about Haskell when they are among themselves, and here on SO everyone seems to love that language. Being good at Haskell seems somewhat like the hallmark of a genius programmer. Can someone give a few Haskell examples that show why it is so elegant / superior?
