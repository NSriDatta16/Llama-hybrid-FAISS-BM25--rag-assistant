Is the build executed directly by the JVM of the slave agent? If you run a Maven build (for example), the slave agent can launch an external Maven process (with default Java Xmx). So you should specify the MAVEN_OPTS parameter to ensure that Maven builds are always executed with a customized Xmx value.
