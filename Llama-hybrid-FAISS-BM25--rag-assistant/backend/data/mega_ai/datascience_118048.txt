Please do not build a recommendation system in order to solve a binary classification problem. If you like the idea with the ratings, you can always create a new feature that is the ranking. Consider using random forest, SVM, log regression, XGBoost, LightGBM. Some of these models are capable of returning the feature importance, so you can see how important your rankings are, if of course you decide to implement them as a feature.
