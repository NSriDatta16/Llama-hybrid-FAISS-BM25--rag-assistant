The Gibbs sampler is a simple form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, widely used in Bayesian statistics, based on sampling from full conditional distributions for each variable or group of variables. The name comes from the method being first used on Gibbs random fields modeling of images by Geman and Geman (1984).
