I think you can quite easily achieve that using the Solver. Make a model like the one you want, define your targets (the 2 averages) as formulae, then give it the range of data to solve. Nut you might well get the same answer every time, though. Give it a try. Note that the Solver is an optional install, might not be visible if you made a standard install instead of a full one.
