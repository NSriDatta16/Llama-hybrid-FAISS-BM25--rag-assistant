Yes you need to specify that the variable is a factor, otherwise R will treat it as a numeric variable. Use as.factor to do this or factor to also specify labels. The first level of the factor is typically treated as the reference category (in your case 0, or male). So the output in a glm (assuming you mean a logistic regression model, link function = logit) can be interpreted as the log odds difference between males and females in your response variable. As this is difficult to interpret I suggest using exp to transform your regression coefficient from log odds to odds so you can interpret it as the odds ratio between males and females. The interpretation would be: 'females are exp(coefficient) times more likely to have success in the dependent variable than males'. Success is defined by scoring a 1 on your dependent variable. Edit: in case of a binary predictor, the model estimates are the same for a numeric as factor version.
