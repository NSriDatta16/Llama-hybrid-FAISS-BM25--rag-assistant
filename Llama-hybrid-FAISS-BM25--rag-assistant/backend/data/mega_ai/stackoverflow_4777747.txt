It makes no real sense to me to describe really all the characters like a , b , / for a language, even if it is an exercise for compilers. Isn't the alphabet of a programming language the set of possible words, like {id, int, float, string, if, for, ... } ? And if you consider it really beeing "characters" in the basic idea of the word, is ??/ in C one or three charaters (or both)?
