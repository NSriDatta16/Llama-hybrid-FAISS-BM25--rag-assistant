need multiple inheritance in Objective C

I want to implement a movable UIView class (view moves when you touch on it and move your finger), e.g.: @interface MovableView : UIView { some members; } -touchesBegan; -touchesMoved; @end How can I apply this code to UILabel, UIButton etc without multiple inheritance? In C++, I'd do it like this (with UIView as a virtual base to MovableView): struct MovableLabel : UILabel, MovableView {}; Categories are offered as an alternative to multiple inheritance but I definitely don't want to extent UIView using categories because that would apply to all views in my application. I only want some of my views to be movable. My current strategy to avoid code duplication is putting MovableView code in a header file and including it everytime I need some class to use it. Besides that I have to add members of MovableView to whatever class I am writing. It is pure code ugliness but better than copy/pasting code all over my project. Does anyone have any other ideas to get around this Objective C limitation [of not having multiple inheritance]? Thanks, Altan
