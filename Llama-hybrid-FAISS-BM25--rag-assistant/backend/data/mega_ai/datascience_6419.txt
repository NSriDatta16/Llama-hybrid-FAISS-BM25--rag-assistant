Actually deep learning can be run in spark using h2o sparkling water feature.Also you can use h2o.deeplearning to run deeplearning on your data in cluster or single node.Spark is good for munging the data in cluster as it does so distributedly but in memory,otherwise h2o has limited functions for data munging and that too it can't distribute data munging.
