Copy the file "app/code/design/frontend/base/default/template/catalog/product/view/price_clone.phtml" to the directory "app/code/design/frontend/default/modern/template/catalog/product/view/". This is so you are not overwriting the original file. Open the file for editing. After where you see this: getPriceHtml($_product, false, '_clone') ?> Add the following: __('per pack') ?> By using the function $this->__() you are making the text available to be translated easily. It is good practice to do this always. For the second part now add this bit on the line after: __('Package Set %s', $_product->getPackageSet()) ?> Again it is potentially being translated but this time your extra attribute is being inserted where it says %s . The reason for doing this is to make it clearer when using inline translation . The line has been wrapped in a paragraph tag for yet more clarity and to ensure it appears on it's own line, not following on the end of the previous. I have assumed your attribute has the code "product_set" - which in Magento becomes 'camel case', or getProductSet . Finally you might want to remove the attribute from Additional Information tab. This is quite simple, go back to the Manage Attributes page in admin, edit your attribute and change "Visible on Product View Page on Front-end" to "No".
