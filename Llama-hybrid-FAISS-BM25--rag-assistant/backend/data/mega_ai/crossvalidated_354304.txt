Average had for at least two centuries since its induction in European languages implied damage to shipping goods, Words with similar roots are noted among shipping peoples (English, Dutch) and other traders in the Southern Mediterranean (Italian, French). The root awar- is from Arabic meaning damaged. King Louis the XIV reissued and enforced a set of pan-European maritime laws after nearly a millenia of lawlessness. This was in 1681. The Maritime Law of General Average states that damage to shipping goods should result in a proportionate share of losses to all parties: receiver and shipper and among the shipper all the crew. It seems like no coincidence that the usage of average to imply a mean in a general sense is attributed only 50 years later to another French writer, I guess it would be De Moivre. Since the Maritime Law refers to a sum being divided with equal weights, if there is any bearing on the conversation, I think we can probably say it is the arithmetic mean.
