Reporting binary regression models

For my study i used a model which had 6 independent factors that predicted a binary outcome variable (yes/no). The general assumption is that a higher score should predict a yes response. I tested this model in two different countries to understand what predicts the outcome behaviour in each. Should i first report the regression model which contains data from both samples to test my hypothesis regarding the basic assumption of the predictors influencing the outcome. Then should i report the 2 seperate models for each country Or should i not report the first 1 and simply report the 2 separate sample models. Also, a final qs, with regards to APA format, how do i report the results of a logistic regression in a write up?
