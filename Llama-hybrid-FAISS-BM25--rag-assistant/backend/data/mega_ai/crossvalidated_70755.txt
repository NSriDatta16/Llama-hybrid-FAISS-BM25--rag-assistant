There is a big difference between representing and fitting a model. If you want to display/represent the variable analysis you just make plot(analysis) in R and then you will see a representation of your model. If you want a explicit formula for your model you must (1) know (or assume) a specific model for your data (linear, quadratic, etc...) (2) fit your parameters model. Nonetheless there are very few problems that can be expressed as a formula, unless it is linear/quadratic. The idea of machine learning is to provide a solution which makes possible to predict without the necessity of using an explicit formula.
