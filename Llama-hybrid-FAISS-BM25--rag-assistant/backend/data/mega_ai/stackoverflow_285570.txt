I will add here that in VS 2010 Microsoft has added WPF adorner capabilities using Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), this will allow us to extend the source code editor to organize them in a much better way to make it more readable and accessible. For instance the Summary Comments visualizer that Scott Gu demoed at PDC 2008 . So look forward to a better tomorrow for developers :)
