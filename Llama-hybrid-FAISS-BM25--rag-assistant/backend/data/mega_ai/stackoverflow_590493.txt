Is it overkill to integrate Subversion in an application with a simple file archive?

As we're about to start planning an application that will handle media files (mp3, flv, pdf, images), I'm thinking about how to handle the file storage. The files will change and versions should be tracked to a degree, so integrating SVN in the app comes to mind. Now I wonder, is it too much? I'm quite sure we'll only use a fraction of the power SVN brings, so perhaps just pointing to the filesystem using a database will be just as good. On the other hand, these custom archive solutions always gets very ad hoc, and I would like a reliable solution this time. Too much hassle? What do you think?
