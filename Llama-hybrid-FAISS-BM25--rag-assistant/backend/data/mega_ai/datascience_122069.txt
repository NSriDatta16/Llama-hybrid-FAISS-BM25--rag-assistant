GridSearchCV custom scorer to consider both train and test performance

Based on my current understanding, the standard use of GridSearchCV scorers ( through available options such as "f1_micro") aim to maximize the average performance across validation folds . However, in my problem I want to design a custom scorer that will consider both average validation and average training performance , using the trading folds for the latter. Is there a way to achieve this e.g. with a custom scorer? As for the motivation, this feature could be used to design a scorer that aims at a high validation performance that do not deviate too much from the training performance.
