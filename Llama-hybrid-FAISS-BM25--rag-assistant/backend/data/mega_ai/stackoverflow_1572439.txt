You can structure the repository in such a way as to enable read/write access to the source code only to those who need it, and have other people, like your HTML coder, with no access (for example, source in one folder, DLLs in another). However, before you do that I encourage you to read the section of the Subversion book called Do You Really Need Path-Based Access Control? Excerpt: So, before you begin restricting users’ access rights, ask yourself whether there's a real, honest need for this, or whether it’s just something that “sounds good” to an administrator. Decide whether it’s worth sacrificing some server speed, and remember that there’s very little risk involved; it’s bad to become dependent on technology as a crutch for social problems. The point I’m trying to make is, consider whether it’s worth the effort to restructure your repository just so someone can’t see the source code. If it is, then you can do so by giving him/her rights to the DLL folder and no rights to the source folder.
