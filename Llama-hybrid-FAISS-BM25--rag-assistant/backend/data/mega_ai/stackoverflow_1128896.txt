Not every DOM element has a property called value which could be why your script is breaking. You could try the following: function value(elementid){ var el = document.getElementById(elementid); return el.value || el; } this will return el.value if it exists or if it doesn't just the element. this isnt the most elegant solution but it might stop your other scripts from breaking. Without knowing the context in which you are calling that function, i can't help more
