Have you considered virtualization for this. I routinely try and use it for testing and even dev environments. Yes, changing server time is a hack but in a VM that is trivial and you can control what you need, rollback state, etc. I know it is not quite what you have been thinking of; as elegant, etc., but it may meet your clients needs. There are a lot of VM options (VMWare, VirtualBox, Parallels). If you are more enterprise focused then ESX or ESXi (if you don't have a big budget). Also HyperV if you are a MS shop or XenServer.
