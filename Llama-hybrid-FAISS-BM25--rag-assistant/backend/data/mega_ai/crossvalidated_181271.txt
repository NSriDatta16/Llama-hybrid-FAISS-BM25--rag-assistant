As you say, a paired t-test is the way to go here. This is because your observations are not independent, but are grouped in pairs according to the volunteers who gave the samples. A paired t-test allow to exclude variability in B6 levels between volunteers, and test only within-volunteer variability (serum vs plasma). Note that a paired t-test ultimately amounts to a one-sample t-test of the within subjects differences (B6 levels in serum minus B6 levels in plasma). The null hypothesis of the paired t-test is that the average within-subject difference is 0.
