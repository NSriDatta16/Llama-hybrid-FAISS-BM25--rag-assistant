A table row cannot be positioned. There is no way to change the top or left values. Instead drag a "proxy" element, such as a div. When the mousedown occurs, if the event target is or contains something you want to drag (its a TR or has a TR ancestor that you care about), show the proxy there and assign a mousemove handler that updates the proxy coordinase. In the mouseup event, hide the proxy (as stated) and remove the mousemove callback. If the mouseup event occurred in the table, the source TR can be inserted to the new order. To make the operation more obvious, signifying information from the source TR, such as text inside it, can be copied to the proxy. The source TR can be greyed (by setting opacity or background color). You might also want to provide some signifier to where the insertion will occur, when the user drops the proxy element.
