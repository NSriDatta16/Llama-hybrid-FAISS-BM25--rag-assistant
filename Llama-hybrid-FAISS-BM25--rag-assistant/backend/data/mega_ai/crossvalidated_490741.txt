Mixed-effect coefficients at nonexistent levels

Suppose I recorded successes and failures for two different conditions organized into two different blocks. However, one of the conditions ( Trt ) was just in first of the blocks. I repeated the exercise twice. So we have: dat = data.frame( Cond = c(rep('Neg', 4), 'Trt', 'Trt'), Block = c(rep(1:2, 2), 1, 1), Rep = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2), Success = c(146, 143, 174, 136, 72, 136), Failure = c(500, 445, 570, 685, 299, 211) ) # Cond Block Rep Success Failure # 1 Neg 1 1 146 500 # 2 Neg 2 1 143 445 # 3 Neg 1 2 174 570 # 4 Neg 2 2 136 685 # 5 Trt 1 1 72 299 # 6 Trt 1 2 136 211 Now, if I try to model this: library(nlme4) m1 = glmer(cbind(Success, Failure) ~ Cond + (Cond|Block), binomial, data = dat) coef(m1)[1] # $Block # (Intercept) CondTrt # 1 -1.250252 0.3533767 # 2 -1.353067 0.4562030 Why do I get Trt coefficient also for second block? What does the coefficient mean?
