This behavior is due to the fact that support vector regression fits the flattest possible function for a given epsilon-value. It is nicely illustrated in Fig. 3.28 of the lecture notes "Machine learning: Supervised techniques" by Sepp Hochreiter, currently here: http://www.bioinf.jku.at/teaching/current/ws_mlstvl/ML_supervised.pdf Your picture is nice though, in order to see what happens with outliers.
