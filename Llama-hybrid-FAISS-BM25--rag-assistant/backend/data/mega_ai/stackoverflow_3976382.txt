Is there any free usable component for workflow editor/designer?

I am trying to find a .NET component that allows GUI (drag-and-drop) workflow design, and I need it as a part of a bigger software so I prefer it to be a usable component. What I imagine is it is similar to the GUI used to design workflows in Visual Studio 2008 and 2010. Is there any such component? I tried searching for a while and didn't have any luck. The best I could find are these http://www.wareprise.com/2009/03/13/list-of-top-open-source-bpm-workflow-solution/ http://java-source.net/open-source/workflow-engines but I don't think any of the items in those list are compatible with my requirements. has anyone been looking for this and found a good component? I am looking for a free one, and open source is even better if possible.
