A Function to select a forecast method

I often have more than one time series to fit a model. Thanks to forecast and forecastHybrid packages they make easy to fit a model to a time series. But often I have more than one ts. When the number of ts are sufficiently high it is a lot of work to do it one by one because the method I choose could do good job for some but it may do bad job for the others ts. To choose a model and to avoid the work I wrote the following code. It works but I would like to know : Would I face any problem? Are there issues that I cannot see? (sure it is slow but except that) Best A choose_model fc_stlf #model2 auto.arima(x_train, stepwise = FALSE, approximation = FALSE)%>%forecast(h=h1) -> fc_arima #model3 set.seed(12345)#for nnetar model nnetar(x_train)%>%forecast(h=h1) -> fc_nnetar #model4 snaive(x_train,h=h1)->fc_snaive #model5 hybridModel(x_train,models = "anst",weights = c("equal"),errorMethod = c("RMSE", "MAE", "MASE"),verbose=FALSE)%>%forecast(h=h1) -> fc_hy #model6 hybridModel(x_train,models = "an",weights = c("equal"),errorMethod = c("RMSE", "MAE", "MASE"),verbose=FALSE)%>%forecast(h=h1) -> fc_hy_2 #model7 ets(x_train)%>%forecast(h=h1)->fc_ets #model8 holt(x_train, h=h1)->fc_holt #model9 hw(x_train,seasonal = "additive", h=h1)->fc_hw_ad #model10 hw(x_train,seasonal = "multiplicative", h=h1)->fc_hw_mul #model11 hw(x_train,seasonal = "additive",damped = TRUE, h=h1)->fc_hw_ad_dam #model12 hw(x_train,seasonal = "multiplicative",damped = TRUE, h=h1)->fc_hw_mul_dam #accuracy model1 Edit Thank you for your answer @Tim and for your comment forecaster, here is my new code. I will be happy if you give me some feedback.
