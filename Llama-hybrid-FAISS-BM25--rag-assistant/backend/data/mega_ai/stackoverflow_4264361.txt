Following are advantages of Normalization 1) Avoids data modification (INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE) anomalies as each data item lives in One place, avoid data redundancy 2) Greater flexibility in getting the expected data in atomic granular 3) Normalization is conceptually cleaner and easier to maintain and change as your needs change 4) Fewer null values and less opportunity for inconsistency 5) A better handle on database security 6) Increased storage efficiency 7) The normalization process helps maximize the use of clustered indexes, which is the most powerful and useful type of index available. As more data is separated into multiple tables because of normalization, the more clustered indexes become available to help speed up data access.
