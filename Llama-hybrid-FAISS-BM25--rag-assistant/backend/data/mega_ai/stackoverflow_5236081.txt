Tool to find commented out VHDL code

This question asks the general question. I'm asking about VHDL in particular, since the tools that question's answer mentions are for Java and PL/SQL. It doesn't need to be perfect, some manual interpretation would be fine. I'm doing this for an automated commit task. EDIT 3/9/11: @phillipe pointed out automated commit task is inconsistent with manual interpretation. I'm trying to encourage other engineers to get rid of code and see that they did it. I guess a pessimistic tool would be better for commits; if it misses some code that isn't the end of the world. Or I could make it report the number of such lines and email me rather than stop the commit.
