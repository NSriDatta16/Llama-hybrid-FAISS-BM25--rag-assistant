The answers so far all look good, but I would also add: To hide implementation details that might otherwise be exposed because you need to handle those exceptions. E.g. You don't want your UI to catch SQLException. You should throw your own exceptions out of your data access code and let your UI deal with those. If you changed to a non database provider for data storage (e.g. XML, file system, etc), you would not need to change your UI code. However, I would only do that if I was handling them in my UI code explicitly.
