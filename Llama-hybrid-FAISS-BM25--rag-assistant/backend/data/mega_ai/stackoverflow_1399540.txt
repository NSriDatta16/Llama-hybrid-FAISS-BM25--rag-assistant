I'm writing an app at the moment that has this problem - I've solved it by putting a url to the image in the xml instead of embedding the image data itself. For example my xml looks something like this : As I'm parsing the xml, when I hit an tag I store the url in an NSMutalbeArray. When the xml is parsed I loop through the array and get each image using NSURLConnection. Sam PS I worked out how to use NSURLConnection from this page : https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/URLLoadingSystem/Tasks/UsingNSURLConnection.html
