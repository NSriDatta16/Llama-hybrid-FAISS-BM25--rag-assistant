In one of the recent blog post by Deepmind, they have used game theory in Alpha Star algorithm. Deep Mind Alpha-Star : Mastering this problem requires breakthroughs in several AI research challenges including: Game theory: StarCraft is a game where, just like rock-paper-scissors, there is no single best strategy. As such, an AI training process needs to continually explore and expand the frontiers of strategic knowledge. Where the game theory is applied when it comes to reinforcement learning?
