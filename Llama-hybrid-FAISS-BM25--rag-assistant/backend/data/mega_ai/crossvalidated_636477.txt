Is it legit to compute/define moving average series for a stationary process?

Suppose we have $X_{1}, X_{2}, ..., X_{n}$ sequence of $iid$ random variables with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ . By definition, the time series $x_{1}, x_{2}, ..., x_{n}$ is a stationary process with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ . If so, is it legit to compute a moving average series for the process as follows: $$s_k=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+...+x_{k}}{k}?$$ As the process is stationary, we assume that the mean should be time invariant, i.e., $\mu$ . Then if it is legit to compute moving average series, how we interpret it in the context of stationarity? (I assume if it makes sense, then interpretation should relate to long- and short-run dynamics of the series. )
