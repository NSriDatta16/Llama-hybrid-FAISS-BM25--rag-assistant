How to use time-series observations on multi-class classification problem?

I have a multi-class classification problem with time-series features. You can find an example series below. It shows the same series over time for different classes (actually, each line represents the average of its class at a given date). I have experimented with multiple models, and the random forest has the highest performance. My predictors are point observations for each series, the variance of the series, and the min-max range of the series. I assume that each class has a unique data-generating process (although some are very similar). Therefore, rather than only providing point observations at a time, there might be an elegant and better way to provide information to the model regarding the data-generating process. I am curious if you have any suggestions on this. Thanks.
