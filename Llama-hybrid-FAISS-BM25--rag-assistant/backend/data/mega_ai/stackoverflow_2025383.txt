MVC - How best to organize commonly used drop-down lists in many views

I am trying to understand how best to organize some common Dropdown lists used in several views (some are cascading) Is it best to create a single \Models\CommonQueries then create a webservice for each dropdown used in cascading situation then have a single controller that contains actions for each dropdowns This way I can follow DRY principle and not repeat the dropdown logics since they are used in various views. Much Thanks and Regards for reading my question and taking the your time. +ab
