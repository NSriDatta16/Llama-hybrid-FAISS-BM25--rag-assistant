There are a few rule-based models available in R. They differ in how they work (and I assume you want to use them for classification and not regression). I would start with Quinlan's book [1]. He goes into a lot of detail about how to make rules out of decision trees. Also look at Witten et al [2] to see how a lot of Quinlan's ideas have been extended (and these are implemented in RWeka : PART and JRip ) Then there is C5.0 which has tree- and rule-based versions, including boosting methods. Quinlan hasn't published much in a while but he did open-source his code recently. There are some subtle differences between what he describes in his book and what is currently in C5.0 . The main changes are boosting and winnowing (AFAICT). I just sent a book to Springer a few days ago that has a lot of detail on how this works, so hopefully that will be available soon if you don't want to sift thru a ton of C code. There is an R package C50 om CRAN that we made from his GPL version of C5.0 . There is an argument for rules (to get a rule-based model instead of a tree) and trials for boosting. Max [1] Quinlan, R.
