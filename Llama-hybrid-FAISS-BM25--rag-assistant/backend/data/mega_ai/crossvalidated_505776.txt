How many chains should i run in winBUGS?

i am relatively new to winBUGS and i am running a meta-regression model for bayesian meta-analysis. This model tracks the posterior distributions of the parameters mean and tau-square. Moreover,which values are non-informative for a uniform prior distribution? Since i am not quite familiar with MCMC and winBUGS i would appreciate any help! Thank you in advance.
