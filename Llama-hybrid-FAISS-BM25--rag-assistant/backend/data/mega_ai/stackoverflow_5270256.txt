Best way to create a popup replacement in WP7

I'm using the popup control in wp7 as a modal dialog to edit grid rows. The performance is dreadful - it can take up to 5 seconds to open - and I'm looking for an alternative. I'm also aware that I will have problems further down the road when I try and support landscape. My grid control (think datagrid) that open the popup is a user control that can appear anywhere on any page. I tried embedding a hidden grid inside it that resizes to 480 x 800 but can't seem to make it appear any higher up the page than the grid. I don't want to put a hidden grid on every page just in case. Is there a better way? Surely someone must have done this sort of thing before.
