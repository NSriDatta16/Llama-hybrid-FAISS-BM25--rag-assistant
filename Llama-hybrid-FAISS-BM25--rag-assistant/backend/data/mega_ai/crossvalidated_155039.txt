I faced a similar problem earlier and found some related literature, e.g. Britten‐Jones, Mark, Anthony Neuberger, and Ingmar Nolte. "Improved inference in regression with overlapping observations." Journal of Business Finance & Accounting 38.5‐6 (2011): 657-683. Harri, Ardian, and B. Wade Brorsen. "The overlapping data problem." Available at SSRN 76460 (1998). Hansen, Lars Peter, and Robert J. Hodrick. "Forward exchange rates as optimal predictors of future spot rates: An econometric analysis." The Journal of Political Economy (1980): 829-853. I do not remember finding any really simple solution in these papers (but my memory cannot be trusted). I was after correlation (rather than covariance) given overlapping observations. I thought that the following could perhaps help: run a simple regression of $\Delta_h x_t$ on $\Delta_h z_t$ with ARMA errors (such as described in Rob J. Hyndman's blog post "The ARIMAX model muddle" ). The ARMA errors should take care of the statistical artifacts resulting from the data being overlapping. The resulting $R^2$ could perhaps be interpreted as the squared correlation. Going from correlations from covariances should not be too difficult. My thinking is only heuristic, but perhaps the idea could be developed and become useful.
