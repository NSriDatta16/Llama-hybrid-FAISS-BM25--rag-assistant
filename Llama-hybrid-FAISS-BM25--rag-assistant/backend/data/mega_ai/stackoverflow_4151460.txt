Preventing a Webpage From Dragging on an iPad in the Code

I'm currently working on a webpage that will be viewed on an iPad. It uses the jquery-ui libraries to display a slider bar. However, when a user tries to drag the sliderbars, instead, the entire page drags. Does anyone know if there is any sort of override that can be specified in the jquery or html to prevent the browser from dragging the page on an iPad upon touch drag event?
