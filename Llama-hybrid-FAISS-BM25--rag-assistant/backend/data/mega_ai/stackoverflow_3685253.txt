There is a protected member function called contentsSize() in QListView . It is used to calculate the required minimum() , maximum() , and pageStep() for the scrollbars (as mentioned here ). Can you subclass the QListView class and make use of that information? I suggest you recalculate the size of your widget in the same function where you add contents to it. While somewhat lacking elegance, this appears to be a pretty reliable solution.
