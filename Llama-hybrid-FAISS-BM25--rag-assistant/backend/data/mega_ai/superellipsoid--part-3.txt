e. There are two commonly used objective functions. The first one is constructed directly based on the implicit function G 1 ( θ ) = a x a y a z ∑ i = 1 N ( F ϵ 1 ( g − 1 ∘ ( x i , y i , z i ) ) − 1 ) 2 {\displaystyle G_{1}(\theta )=a_{x}a_{y}a_{z}\sum _{i=1}^{N}\left(F^{\epsilon _{1}}\left(g^{-1}\circ (x_{i},y_{i},z_{i})\right)-1\right)^{2}} The minimization of the objective function provides a recovered superellipsoid as close as possible to all the input points { ( x i , y i , z i ) ∈ R 3 , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , N } {\displaystyle \{(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i})\in \mathbb {R} ^{3},i=1,2,...,N\}} . At the mean time, the scalar value a x , a y , a z {\displaystyle a_{x},a_{y},a_{z}} is positively proportional to the volume of the superellipsoid, and thus have the effect of minimizing the volume as well. The other objective function tries to minimized the radial distance between the points and the superellipsoid. That is G 2 ( θ ) = ∑ i = 1 N ( | r i | | 1 − F − ϵ 1 2 ( g − 1 ∘ ( x i , y i , z i ) ) | ) 2 {\displaystyle G_{2}(\theta )=\sum _{i=1}^{N}\left(\left|r_{i}\right|\left|1-F^{-{\frac {\epsilon _{1}}{2}}}\left(g^{-1}\circ (x_{i},y_{i},z_{i})\right)\right|\right)^{2}} , where r i = ‖ ( x i , y i , z i ) ‖ 2 {\displaystyle r_{i}=\|(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i})\|_{2}} A probabilistic method called EMS is designed to deal with noise and outliers. In this method, the superellipsoid recovery is reformulated as a maximum likelihood estimation problem, and an optimization method is proposed to avoid local minima utilizing geometric similarities of the superellipsoids. The method is further extended by modeling with nonparametric bayesian techniques to recovery multiple superellipsoids simultaneously.
