Usually, when we use a CNN, we apply padding with convolution, that way, activation maps have the same size as the inputs. Look at this video to understand how padding works : Andrew Ng course on Coursera about padding (you need an account to watch the full video ) In Keras, Conv2D layer have an argument called 'padding', here is a link to the documentation : Convolutional layer documentation of Keras Be aware because they say that setting padding to 'same' when using a stride different than 1 (it's your case here) can be inconsistent depending on the backends you use. I let you try to see if the second layers have the right shape. That way, your conv layer output should be 224x224 like in the paper (and 112x112 after the maxpool layer) Note : Be careful with your filters number. You set the number of filters to 64, but in the paper, the filters number is 192 (I guess it's 64*3 as there are 3 channels ?)
