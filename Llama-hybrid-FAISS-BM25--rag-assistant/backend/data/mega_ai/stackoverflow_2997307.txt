I have a fairly large project where we are doing Example 1 - Cache static class with retrieval delegate used from controllers. Actually, in our case we have a service class layer that handles caching and the controllers reference the service layer. The service layer deals with data retrieval, caching, permission checking, etc, while the controllers deal mainly with assembling data from the services into models. Per your question, you don't necessarily need a static cache helper. You could use DI to inject an instance of your cache helper, so then you could mock it out for testing, etc.
