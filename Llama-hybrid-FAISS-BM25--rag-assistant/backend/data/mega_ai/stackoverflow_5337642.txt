Play mp3 file smoothly upon dragging a scroll using AVToolbox or openAL

I have been facing this since so many days but I have not reach to any conclusion. My problem is : I want to play an mp3 file but not simply by clicking on a play button. It is this way I want to play it. * There is a slider that I can drag using finger, I want that the mp3 should play with the frequency with which I am dragging the finger (or speed with which I am dragging my finger, so that it will give an effect of fast forwarding (funny type of voice)) or if I drag slider slowyly the output will be slow * The problem is the output of the sound is not coming out smooth. its very distorted and disturbed voice. I want the outuput to be smoother. Please help. Any suggestions please. Presently I am using AVAudioPlayer and passing the time value based upon slider input to play the file. (It does not seems to be feasible though). I feel that it is possible using openAL only and no other way. Because using openAL we can modify the frequency of the sound file (pitch) CAN SOME ONE PLEASE REFER ME A LINK TO openAL implementation for iPhone . I have never played a sound file using openAL Help!!
