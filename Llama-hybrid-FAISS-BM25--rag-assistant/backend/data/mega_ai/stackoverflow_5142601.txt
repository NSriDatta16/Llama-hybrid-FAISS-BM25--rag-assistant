This is for the particular case you mentioned, but I think that mostly every case in which you need chained short-circuit logic can be handled with a more elegant solution. Which is obviously a matter of taste, let me add, so scratch that if you think the above is better than this: try: foo = a.b.c except AttributeError: print "woops" In other, less straightforward cases, encapsulating all the testing in a function might improve readibility a lot. EDIT: by the way, duck typing .
