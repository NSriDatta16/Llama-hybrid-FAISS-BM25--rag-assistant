Forms in the dialog behave just like regular forms - there is nothing special about them. If you have a form that you use to already edit the item, wrap that in a and give it an id. E.g.: ... rest of form goes here And then somewhere you'll want to set up the dialog using javascript: $(document).ready(function() { var $your_dialog = $('#your_dialog').dialog({ autoOpen: false, title: 'Edit', modal: true, draggable: false }); }); And then hook up the dialog to some link (probably in your public/application.js ): $('#open-dialog').click(function(){ $your_dialog.dialog('open'); }); And somewhere in your view you will have an element that acts the open dialog button: Click me to open the dialog If you want to the dialog to be an AJAX submit, make sure to use :remote => true in the form parameters. That should do it. Make sure your form works before you try and put it in a dialog (ie. get the first div/form done before trying to hook up the javascript dialog)
