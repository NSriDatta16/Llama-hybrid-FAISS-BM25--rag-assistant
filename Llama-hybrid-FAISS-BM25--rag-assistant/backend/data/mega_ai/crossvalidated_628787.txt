Handling missing data for sea level in regression

I am doing a simple regression where one of the regressors is the sea level and another regressor is US region. For the central region in the US, I have obviously no data for sea level. I am wondering how I should treat the missing data without introducing bias ? Replacing NA by a sea level of 0 or a country average would definitely bias the results. I am also not sure that multiple imputation techniques are appropriate in this context. Thanks in advance !
