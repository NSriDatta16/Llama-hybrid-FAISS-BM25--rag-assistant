Handling ordinal data for clustering can be tricky due to the reasons you mentioned. Here are a few approaches that you may try: Ordinal Encoding : As you mentioned, you can use ordinal encoding, where you assign an integer to each category. The problem with this approach is that the distances between categories may not be equal, and this method assumes they are. One-Hot Encoding : This method creates a new binary column for each category. This can result in numerous columns if you have many categories, but it avoids the problem of unequal distances. Target Encoding : This method replaces each category with the mean target value for that category. This can be useful if there is a strong relationship between the category and the target, but it can lead to overfitting. Custom Encoding : If you have domain knowledge that suggests a certain ordering or distance between categories, you can use this to create a custom encoding. Embedding : This involves training a neural network to learn a dense representation of the categories. This can capture complex relationships but requires more computational resources. In your case, since you don't know the true distances between categories, you might want to try a few different methods and see which one works best for your specific problem. You could also consider using a non-parametric clustering algorithm that doesn't make assumptions about the distances between categories. Finally, the goal of clustering is to find meaningful groups in your data. If a certain encoding method leads to clusters that make sense in the context of your problem, then it's probably a good choice.
