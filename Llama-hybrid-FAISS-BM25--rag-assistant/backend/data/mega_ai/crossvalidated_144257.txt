You should be aware that it is one thing to compute a correlation coefficient and yet another thing is how to test for independence or significance . Time series data does not qualify for standard textbook solutions which premise independent samples. http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/dbs202/cat/stats/corr.html .
