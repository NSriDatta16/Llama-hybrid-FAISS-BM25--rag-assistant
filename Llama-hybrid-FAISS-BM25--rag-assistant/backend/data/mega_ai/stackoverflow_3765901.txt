If you want a local Hudson to run on your Mac whenever you log in, try this. You'll want to set up a launchctl plist for it; that should look something like this: UserName yourid Label Hudson EnvironmentVariables HUDSON_HOME /Users/yourid/.hudson ProgramArguments /usr/bin/java -jar /Users/yourid/Hudson/hudson.war RunAtLoad This assumes you've downloaded hudson.war to your home directory under ~/Hudson , and that you want to run it as yourself (probably the best decisions.) Be sure that you define the key or it will run as root! Starting on login Save the above as /Library/LaunchAgents/hudson.plist Start it the first time with sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/hudson.plist or log out and back in, which will do the same thing automatically. Starting on reboot Save the above as /Library/LaunchDaemons/hudson.plist Start it the first time with sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/hudson.plist or reboot your machine, which will do the same thing automatically. Restarting Hudson Hudson can't automatically restart under OS X, so if you need to stop it, issue the restart command launchctl unload -w path_to_plist I have found that sometimes it doesn't stop on the first execution of launchctl unload ; in those cases just issue the command again. This will run under port 8080 as if you had run the command from the command line yourself, using the Winstone server built in to the .war file. I realize this doesn't specifically answer the "run it on port 80" question, but for development on your own laptop, I suggest that this is a better option.
