At a guess, the WP7 code might be using some System.IO.Path functionality and this is infamous for having a 260 character limit - see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247(VS.85).aspx#maxpath - and this quite often finds its way across to Uri code - e.g. http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/netfxnetcom/thread/723e6bfd-cab7-417b-b487-67f1dcfa524f Some possible workarounds: If you can rewrite that request as using uglier QueryParam's then it might just work - e.g. if you can reorganise your URL into a from like http://mydomain.com/img/tile/p/23232/fetch?longval=2332323...33e== then this path processing might work. Can you use something like the bitly API to shorten the URL - http://code.google.com/p/bitly-api/wiki/ApiDocumentation ? If you are looking for just a small (300 down to 260) improvement then can you optimise your URL by using shorter names and by using something more compact than Base64 encoding - e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85 or better? (I suspect the answer to this depends on your web server)
