I haven't read this book, so I can only judge the particular quote you give. However, even on this basis, I agree with you that this seems extremely unfair to the statistical profession. I actually think that statisticians have always done a remarkably good job at stressing the distinction between statistical associations (correlation, etc.) and causality, and warning against the conflation of the two. Indeed, in my experience, statisticians have generally been the primary professional force fighting against the ubiquitous confusion between cause and correlation. It is outright false (and virtually slander) to claim that statisticians are "...loath to talk about causality at all." I can see why you are annoyed reading arrogant horseshit like this. I would say that it is reasonably common for non-statisticians who use statistical models to have a poor understanding of the relationship between statistical association and causality. Some have good scientific training from other fields, in which case they may also be well aware of the issue, but there are certainly some people who use statistical models who have a poor grasp of these issues. This is true in many applied scientific fields where practitioners have basic training in statistics, but do not learn it at a deep level. In these cases it is often professional statisticians who alert other researchers to the distinctions between these concepts and their proper relationship. Statisticians are often the key designers of RCTs and other experiments involving controls used to isolate causality. They are often called on to explain protocols such as randomisation, placebos, and other protocols that are used to try to sever relationships with potential confounding variables. It is true that statisticians sometimes control for more variables than is strictly necessary, but this rarely leads to error (at least in my experience). I think most statisticians are aware of the difference between confounding variables and collider variables when they do regression analysis with a view to causal inferences, and even if they are not always building perfect models, the notion that they somehow eschew consideration of causality is simply ridiculous. I think Judea Pearl has made a very valuable contribution to statistics with his work on causality, and I am grateful to him for this wonderful contribution. He has constructed and examined some very useful formalisms that help to isolate causal relationships, and his work has become a staple of a good statistical education. I read his book Causality while I was a grad student, and it is on my shelf, and on the shelves of many other statisticians. Much of this formalism echoes things that have been known intuitively to statisticians since before they were formalised into an algebraic system, but it is very valuable in any case, and goes beyond that which is obvious. (I actually think in the future we will see a merging of the "do" operation with probability algebra occurring at an axiomatic level, and this will probably eventually become the core of probability theory. I would love to see this built directly into statistical education, so that you learn about causal models and the "do" operation when you learn about probability measures.) One final thing to bear in mind here is that there are many applications of statistics where the goal is predictive , where the practitioner is not seeking to infer causality. These types of applications are extremely common in statistics, and in such cases, it is important not to restrict oneself to causal relationships. This is true in most applications of statistics in finance, HR, workforce modelling, and many other fields. One should not underestimate the amount of contexts where one cannot or should not seek to control variables. Update: I notice that my answer disagrees with the one provided by Carlos . Perhaps we disagree on what constitutes "a statistician/econometrician with just a regular training". Anyone who I would call a "statistician" usually has at least a graduate-level education, and usually has substantial professional training/experience. (For example, in Australia, the requirement to become an "Accredited Statistician" with our national professional body requires a minimum of four years experience after an honours degree, or six years experience after a regular bachelors degree.) In any case, a student studying statistics is not a statistician . I notice that as evidence of the alleged lack of understanding of causality by statisticians, Carlos's answer points to several questions on CV.SE which ask about causality in regression. In every one of these cases, the question is asked by someone who is obviously a novice (not a statistician) and the answers given by Carlos and others (which reflect the correct explanation) are highly-upvoted answers. Indeed, in several of the cases Carlos has given a detailed account of the causality and his answers are the most highly up-voted. This surely proves that statisticians do understand causality . Some other posters have pointed out that analysis of causality is often not included in the statistics curriculum. That is true, and it is a great shame, but most professional statisticians are not recent graduates, and they have learned far beyond what is included in a standard masters program. Again, in this respect, it appears that I have a higher view of the average level of knowledge of statisticians than other posters.
