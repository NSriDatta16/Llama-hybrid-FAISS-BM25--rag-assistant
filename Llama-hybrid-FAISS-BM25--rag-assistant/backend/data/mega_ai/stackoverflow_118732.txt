There will always be a tradeoff between ability and simplicity. Personally I'm happy with the features of WPF (which uses XAML) for MS development. I dont find its complexity to be a barrier to developement at all. However if your going to target your toolkit/language to a demographic that requires a higher degree of simplicity, you could possibly get away with leveraging an existing framework and provide the end user with a DSL specific to their needs. Writing a new framework for the dev community as a whole is a mammoth undertaking though, and I suspect you will find that due to the wide range of features required that you will have to deal with a large degree of complexity at some point . Best of luck.
