Data Loading & Pre-Processing : depending on your data-size, this is a highly variable measure. we can agree that this will be the second longest task. Edit : This phase ,for me, was about collecting the relevant columns and structuring a csv file to be read and loaded in a python environment. Model Development : again, this will highly depend on your data ( and i'm referring to complexity and structure of your data rather than the size) , if you have a lot of features at hand, and your problem is complex ( demands a lot of effort in feature engineering and feature selection ) , this will be the longest task at hand and will probably take up most of your time I would say deployment would take something in weeks like you mentionned depending on the complexity ( yes again ) of your production environnement. Please take my statement lightly as i don't have much experience in this field. I've had the opportunity to deploy some models as webservices, and it took me less than your projections. However, our problems are quite different.. so my numbers could be out of match.
