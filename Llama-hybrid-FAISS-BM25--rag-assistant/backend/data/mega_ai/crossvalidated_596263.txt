To retain all levels of your categorical variable in the model output, you would need to drop the intercept from the model (i.e. y ~ 0 + color ). However, it rarely makes sense to fit a logistic regression without an intercept, because it implies that $P(Y=1 |\mathbf{x}=0)=0.5$ (which is often not the case). Take a look a these questions & answers: 1 , 2 , 3 . This page might also be helpful.
