I would like to nominate myself as the "anti-meta" candidate. I agree 100% with Jeff's " Meta is Murder " post from 2009 & it's a shame he has abandoned the principles expressed there. I was once active user on meta.stackoverflow.com, but I have recently disassociated that account (and requested for it to be expunged completely.) I promise not to log into that site ever again (or to follow the groupthink that is common there or be biased against others who do not follow it.) On the plus side, I am a regular (if not the most frequent) contributor to the "Java" tag on SO. As a moderator I anticipate that my activity would be: 50% : deleting spam & offensive comments, and migrating questions to other StackExchange sites. 25% : permanently deleting embarassing questions & answers at the author's request 12% : reopening questions inappropriately flagged as "not a real question" (some users apply that flag just because they think the answer is obvious or because they disagree with the goals, particulary optimisation questions.) 12% : re-tagging questions, other tag-related activity e.g. maintaining tag synonyms 1% : everything else I promise not to: Use the "close as duplicate" button unless the author requests it (though I use it regularly now, it really should require 5 votes because it is rarely clear-cut.) Migrate anything to meta.stackoverflow.com (though it is appropriate for some moderators to do this, I am not qualified since I will never read questions there.) Lock any questions or answers (what the hell is that about anyway? Most locked questions have (or should have been) migrated to programmers.stackexchange.com, locking of answers has mostly been used for censorship by administrators.) Update It's a shame this needs to be said but... I will continue to ask questions . I do not know everything, not even about my primary field (Java.) To claim to know everything is arrogant. If you are impressed by some candidates pointing out that they ask few questions (or none at all) then please do not vote for me.
