I think a lot of times people just hack the css together without a concept of the overall picture. A lot of times they just add things on as they are laying things out with little regard to any "conventions" they established that aren't directly fresh in their mind leading to all kinds of naming redundancies and discrepancies. I don't think that its so much that CSS is new as it is that CSS is often the realm of the designers and often times they dont think architecturally when designing something - everything is somewhat adhoc. I know when I'm a lead i establish a formal set of conventions for class naming and organization as one of the first things i do and then hammer it in to the front end underlings :-)
