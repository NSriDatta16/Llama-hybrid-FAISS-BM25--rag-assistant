Thank you for your answers so far! I'll take the liberty of summing up the points for future reference. Drawbacks of using Lua to store data, compared to XML Security both when transferring data and when storing it, especially when receiving data from an unknown source Portability, and ease of access to data by other tools Less useful existing tools like XML Schema validators Less support for parsing the data Problems with circular references Less restrictive -- harder to enforce proper conventions, usage and design Benefits of using Lua to store data, compared to XML Using a single language for both scripting and data (no need for separate files, no need for special cases when loading) Less code and dependencies because of the usage of a single language More verbose and (arguably) more human readable A lot more flexible, and extensible (it's a programming language after all) Data is "executed" and can be accessed when needed as it sits in the virtual machine Takes less space, especially if compiled to bytecode If I missed something in the first list, please point it out!
