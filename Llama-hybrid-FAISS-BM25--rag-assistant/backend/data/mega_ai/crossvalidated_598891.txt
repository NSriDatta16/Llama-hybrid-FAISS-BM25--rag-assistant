Are they sufficient? Can you always frame a $\sf BIBD$ with all those sets of parameters that satisfy the conditions stated? Does there exist any counter example? Do certain conditions other than those exist that are necessary as well as sufficient that encompass all forms of $\mathsf{ BIBD}?$ Sufficiency is a tough job to show. Check this paper by Haim Hanani for further insight. Also, go through chapter $12$ of $\rm [I].$ Reference: $\rm [I]$ Constructions and Combinatorial Problems in Design of Experiments, Damaraju Raghavarao, Dover Publications, $1988.$
