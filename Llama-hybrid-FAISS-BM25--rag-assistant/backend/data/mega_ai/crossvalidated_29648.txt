The maximum aposteriori (MAP) approach isn't really fully Bayesian, ideally inference should involve marginalising over the whole posterior. Optimisation is the root of all evil in statistics; it is difficult to over-fit if you don't optimise! ;o) So the practical difference between Bayesian and frequentist runs rather more deeply if you opt for a fully Bayesian solution, although there will often be a prior for which the result is numerically the same as the frequentist approach. However, the credible interval and confidence interval are answers to different questions, and shouldn't be considered interchangable, even if they happen to be numerically the same. Treating a frequentist confidence interval as if it was a Bayesian credible interval can lead to problems of interpretation. UPDATE "My question could be posed simply as the difference simply between the likelihood function and the posterior." No, the definitions of probability are different, this means that even if the solutions are numerically identical, this doesn't imply they mean the same thing. This is a practical issue as well as a conceptual one, as the correct intepretation of the result depends on the definition of probability. Tongue in cheek, if the answer to the question was "yes", it would imply that frequentists were merely Bayesians that always used flat (often improper) priors for everything. I doubt many frequentists would agree with that! ;o)
