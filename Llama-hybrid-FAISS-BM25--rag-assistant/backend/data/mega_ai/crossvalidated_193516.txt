OK, if I understand the problem correctly you have An unknown initial state $X_i$ A deterministic, yet complicated function $f(X_i, \Theta)$ with parameters $\Theta$ that describes your dynamical system, i.e the transition from the initial state $X_i$ to the end state $X_e$ Question 1 : How to find the statistical properties of the end state $X_e$, given some distribution of $X_i$? I am not aware of any general method that performs significantly better than simply drawing from $X_i$ and following the trajectories (what you call brute force). This is of course assuming it's impossible to analytically or numerically forward the probability distribution for $X_i$. I'd be interested to hear if such a method exists, but the normal solution to this problem in Bayesian statistics (e.g. to calculate the posterior predictive distribution) is simply forwarding the uncertainty by simulation as described above. Question 2 : How can I make inference about $X_i$ or $\Theta$? This one has a clear answer - if you cannot forward your end state analytically, it is nearly certain that you cannot calculate your likelihood function $$ p(X_e | X_i, \Theta ) $$ directly. In this case, you have to resolve to a method that approximates the likelihood from simulation. The two main methods are Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) Synthetic Likelihood Our review Hartig et al., 2011, Statistical inference for stochastic simulation models - theory and application should point you to the right literature. Addition: If simulation time is a serious constraint, you may consider constructing an emulator of your dynamical system, to generate a fast, approximate solution of your ODEs. I'm not on top of the relevant literature though, so I would suggest that you ask a new question to find out what the most promising technique for your problem would be.
