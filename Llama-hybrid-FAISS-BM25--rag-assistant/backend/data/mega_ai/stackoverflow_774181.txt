Why can't I inherit static classes?

I have several classes that do not really need any state. From the organizational point of view, I would like to put them into hierarchy. But it seems I can't declare inheritance for static classes. Something like that: public static class Base { } public static class Inherited : Base { } will not work. Why have the designers of the language closed that possibility?
