Cross platform format string for variables of type size_t?

On a cross platform c/c++ project (Win32, Linux, OSX), I need to use the *printf functions to print some variables of type size_t. In some environments size_t's are 8 bytes and on others they are 4. On glibc I have %zd, and on Win32 I can use %Id . Is there an elegant way to handle this?
