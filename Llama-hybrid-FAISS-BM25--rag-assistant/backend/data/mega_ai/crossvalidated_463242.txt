Calculate LC50 from a non-sigmoid dose response curve

Is it possible to calculate LC50 (concentration that is lethal for 50% of the test organisms), when my dataset does not have a sigmoid dose response curve? For my experiment, I had 6 treatments exposing invertebrates to a pesticide (control + five concentrations). The mortality for the test animals increased with the first two concentrations, but then the mortality is lower for the next higher concentration before it increases a little bit again. So the response increases before it flattens out at about 40-50% mortality. This might be due to the animals avoiding their spiked feed at the higher concentrations, then reducing their exposure and thus mortality. I use the R software. I have tried to fit log-logistic dose response curves using the drc package (and all other models that the package contains), and no models get a good fit. I have also tried to calculate LC50 using the ecotoxicology package, no luck, and tried the trimmed Spearman-Karber method, which didnÂ´t work either. I believe this is because of the non-sigmoid curve. Are there any other things I can try in order to calculate this? One option is just to present the data without LC50 value, but I want to try all options.
