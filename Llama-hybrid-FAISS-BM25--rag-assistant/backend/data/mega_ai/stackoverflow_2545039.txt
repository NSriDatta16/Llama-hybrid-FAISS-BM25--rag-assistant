I'll go for option 1 and use what is called a ViewModel instead of your entity. The ViewModel is representation of you model for a specific view. In the ViewModel you can mix data from different entities and pre-format values to fit the view. Is an elegant way of passing data to a view and you can accomplish what you want easily. Using ViewModels is becoming the preferred way of working in ASP.net MVC and Silverlight / WPF.
