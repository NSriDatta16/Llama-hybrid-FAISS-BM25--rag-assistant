I'd suggest having a set of tests for localizeError , and another set for displayUserMessage . There doesn't seem to be any reason for the two to be tied together; localized errors might go into the log, and you might want to display non-error messages, right? In general, try to keep unit tests as small as possible. The idea is that they test a small unit of code so you can isolate and fix problems as quickly as possible. EDIT: Remember that TDD is not a silver bullet. In this case, the key point is that unit tests are appropriate for localizeError and displayUserMessage , but maybe the requirement-driven test you describe is not so appropriate for methodOne and methodTwo . Depending on your organisation, maybe the higher-level "check that it displays correctly" test is better in UAT. The general guidelines about "don't repeat yourself" and all those other good software development rules apply to writing tests, too.
