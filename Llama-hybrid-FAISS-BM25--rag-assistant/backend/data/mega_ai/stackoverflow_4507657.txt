Add Cache-Control and Expires headers to Azure Storage Blobs

I'm using Azure Storage to serve up static file blobs but I'd like to add a Cache-Control and Expires header to the files/blobs when served up to reduce bandwidth costs. Application like CloudXplorer and Cerebrata's Cloud Storage Studio give options to set metadata properties on containers and blobs but get upset when trying to add Cache-Control. Anyone know if it's possible to set these headers for files?
