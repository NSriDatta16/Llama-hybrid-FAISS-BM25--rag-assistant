I program in Python everyday, and I have to say that too much 'bandwagoning' toward OO or functional could lead toward missing elegant solutions. I believe that both paradigms have their advantages to certain problems - and I think that's when you know what approach to use. Use a functional approach when it leaves you with a clean, readable, and efficient solution. Same goes for OO. And that's one of the reasons I love Python - the fact that it is multi-paradigm and lets the developer choose how to solve his/her problem.
