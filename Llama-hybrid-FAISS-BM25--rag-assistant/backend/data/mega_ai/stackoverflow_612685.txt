I believe that the USB power typically comes directly from the power supply. It might go through the motherboard or some other hardware to combine it with the data lines, but I don't think the voltage ever goes through any programmable circuitry. If you wanted to deactivate the data transfer, that would probably be possible since that is handled by an extension file (IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext), but short of modifying the port physically, I don't think you will be able to deactivate the power.
