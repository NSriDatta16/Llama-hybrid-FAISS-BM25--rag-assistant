Regression analysis for change in overall score of a likert based survey

We have a pre-post study and we want to assess the effect of an intervention on the change in the scores of a survey in a group of subject. The survey is made up of many likert questions. We will perform a per-question analysis using an ordinal logistic regression. But we want also to asses the overall change on all the questions. Averaging the likert scores between the questions doesn't seem correct to me because the likert scores are not really quantitative. But what other solution do I have? Furthermore I suppose I should treat the analysis as a paired comparison, isn't it?
