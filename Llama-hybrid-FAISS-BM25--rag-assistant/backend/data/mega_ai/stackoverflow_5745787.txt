You'll need to order by pg.pcat in your SQL query, and wrap the whole of this in an if test to ensure that at least one row has been returned $currCat = ''; $printed = false; while ($qarr = mysqli_fetch_array($r2, MYSQLI_ASSOC)) { if($currCat != $qarr['pcat']) { // category has changed if ($printed) { // we already printed an opening so we need to close it echo ' '; $printed = true; } echo" {$qarr['pcat']} "; $currCat = $qarr['pcat']; } echo " {$qarr['link_title']} "; } echo ' ';
