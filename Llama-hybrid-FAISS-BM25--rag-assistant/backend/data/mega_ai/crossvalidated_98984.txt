Continuous time markov chain backward/forward equations

Using Kolmogorov's forward and backward equations, show that $p_{11}(t) + p_{21}(t) + p_{31}(t) = 1$ and $p_{21}(t) = p_{31}(t)$ where $p_{ij}(t) = P(X(t) = j | X(0) = i)$. My attempt: I can show the first part but not the second, that is, for all $t \ge 0$, the forward equations for $p_{11}$, $p_{21}$, and $p_{31}$ are as follows: \begin{gather} p_{11}'(t) = \lambda p_{12}(t) + \lambda p_{13}(t) - 2\lambda p_{11}(t) \cdots (1)\\ p_{21}'(t) = \lambda p_{22}(t) + \lambda p_{23}(t) - 2\lambda p_{21}(t) \\ p_{31}'(t) = \lambda p_{32}(t) + \lambda p_{33}(t) - 2\lambda p_{31}(t) \end{gather} The backward equations for $p_{11}$, $p_{21}$, and $p_{31}$ are as follows: \begin{gather} p_{11}'(t) = \lambda p_{21}(t) + \lambda p_{31}(t) - 2\lambda p_{11}(t) \cdots (2) \\ p_{21}'(t) = \lambda p_{11}(t) + \lambda p_{31}(t) - 2\lambda p_{21}(t) \\ p_{31}'(t) = \lambda p_{11}(t) + \lambda p_{21}(t) - 2\lambda p_{31}(t) \end{gather} Subtracting $(1)$ from $(2)$ yields, \begin{gather} 0 = p_{21}(t) - p_{12}(t) + p_{31}(t) - p_{13}(t) \end{gather} Noting that $1-p_{11}(t) = p_{12}(t) + p_{13}(t)$, we have: \begin{gather*} 0 = p_{21}(t) + p_{31}(t) - (1-p_{11}(t)) \\ \implies p_{11}(t) + p_{21}(t) + p_{31}(t) = 1 \end{gather*} However, I'm not exactly sure how to show $p_{21}(t) = p_{31}(t)$ from algebraic manipulations... (I can show it by actually solving the differential equation but the question wants me to show it through manipulation)
