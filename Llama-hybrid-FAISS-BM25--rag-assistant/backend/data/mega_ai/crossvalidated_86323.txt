Does computing this confidence interval make sense here?

I work in a medical company and we often analyze the days patients stay in hospital longer than needed. For example we have these data: patient days in hospital days not necessary 1 20 2 2 5 0 3 13 1 4 9 3 5 22 0 .. we now compute the average days per patient that were not necessary for treatment in hospital. In this example: (2/20 + 0/5 + 1/13 + 3/9 + 0/22) / 5 where 5 is the number of patients in this example. Then we compute a 95% confidence interval for this value (in SPSS). The result is usually an interval of the kind - 0.9 Because a negative value makes no sense we change this interval to 0 For me the whole process feels kind of wrong but I cannot specify it exactly. What would be a better way to do this, or does this make no sense at all? Edit: Some more insight on the data: We are authorized by health insurance companies and get data about patients directly from the hospitals. Our experts, usually doctors, look at each patient's case and make a report about possible unnecessary days of treatment. Reasons can be that an outpatient treatment would be enough or various others reasons. Sometimes patients also want to stay a day or two longer because they feel it is necessary. Of course health insurances have a interest in getting people out of hospital as soon as possible because that's a huge cost factor. Anyway, this is not relevant here. In this report we make a CI like the above example. Of course I cannot provide any real data nor anything that is close to it. The sample size is usually between 40 and 140 patients. There can be no negative days. I think we get negative values for the interval because it's so close to zero and the variance of the assumed normal distribution makes it so. days not necessary is always a fraction of the total days. So for patient 1 in the above example 2 out of 20 days were not necessary. The CI should say in which area the expected value of not-necessary-days/total-days per patient is.
