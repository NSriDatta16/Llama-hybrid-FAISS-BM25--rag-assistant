Efficient priority list

I am looking for an efficient data structure to represent a priority list. Specifically I need to assign a priority to a set of items and return only the top scoring items. I have looked into priority queues which operate on heaps, but they don't seem to really suit my needs. They will reorganize the heap structure as soon as I will poll the top rating item from the queue. The simplest solution would of course be a linked list, which in the worst case would take quite long for the insertion operation. Does anyone have a better solution?
