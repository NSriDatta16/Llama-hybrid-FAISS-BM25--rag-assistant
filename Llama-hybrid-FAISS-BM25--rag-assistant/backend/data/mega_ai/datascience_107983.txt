With a single exemplar per class, there is a limit to appropriate evaluation metrics. There can be no estimate in the variability of performance. It is best practice to look at test dataset only once so the current setup will have limited value. A related machine learning field is one-shot learning . It might be better to reframe the problem as a case study since there is not enough data for effective machine learning.
