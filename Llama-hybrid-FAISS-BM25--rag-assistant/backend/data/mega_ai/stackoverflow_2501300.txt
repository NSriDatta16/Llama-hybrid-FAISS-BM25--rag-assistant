The IETF RFCs are often not clear enough. However, they are written for the sole purpose of describing interoperability so finding a reference implementation to either explore its code or test against is almost essential. Indeed 2409 specifically notes: The authors encourage independent implementation, and interoperability testing, of this hybrid protocol. Finding another implementation is what you really need; finding someone else's source is better still. Failing that, read the bibliography. It has been said that some RFCs written by some firms intentionally obfuscate or simply hide the information needed to produce a conformant implementation in order to build 'market advantage'. There is no royal road to understanding 2049.
