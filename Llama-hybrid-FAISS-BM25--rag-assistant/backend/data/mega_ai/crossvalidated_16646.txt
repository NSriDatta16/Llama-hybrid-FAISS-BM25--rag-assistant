What is a good index of the degree of violation of normality and what descriptive labels could be attached to that index?

Context: In a previous question, @Robbie asked in a study with around 600 cases why tests of normality suggested significant non-normality yet the plots suggested normal distributions . Several people made the point that significance tests of normality are not very useful. With small samples, such tests don't have much power to detect mild violations of normality and with large samples, they will detect violations of normality that are sufficiently small not to be of concern. It seems to me that this problem is similar to the debate around significance testing and effect sizes. If you only focus on significance tests, when you have big samples, you can detect small effects that are irrelevant for practical purposes, and with small samples you don't have sufficient power. In a few instances I've even seen textbooks advise people that you can have "too large" a sample, because small effects will be statistically significant. In the context, of significance testing and effect sizes, one simple resolution is to focus on estimating the size of effect of interest, rather than being obsessed with the binary decision rule of whether there is or is not an effect. Confidence intervals on effect sizes is one such approach, or you could adopt some form of Bayesian approach. Furthermore, various research domains build up ideas about what a given effect size means in a practical sense, for better or worse, applying heuristic labels such as "small", "medium", and "large effect". This also leads to the intelligent recommendation of maximising sample size in order to maximise accuracy in estimating a given parameter of interest. This makes me wonder why a similar approach based on confidence intervals of effect sizes is not more widely espoused in relation to assumption testing, and normality testing in particular. Question: What is the best single index of the degree to which the data violates normality? Or is it just better to talk about multiple indices of normality violation (e.g., skewness, kurtosis, outlier prevalence)? How can confidence intervals be calculated (or perhaps a Bayesian approach) for the index? What kind of verbal labels could you assign to points on that index to indicate the degree of violation of normality (e.g., mild, moderate, strong, extreme, etc.)? The aim of such labels could be to assist analysts with less experience in training their intuition of when violations of normality are problematic.
