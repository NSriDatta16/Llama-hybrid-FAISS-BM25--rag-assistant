You seem to be talking about the standard error of the mean If each property has water usage independently and identically distributed with expectation $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ then the mean water usage of a sample of $50$ such properties would be distributed with expectation $\mu$ and standard deviation $\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{50}}$ the average of $100$ means from such samples of $50$ such properties would be distributed with expectation $\mu$ and standard deviation $\dfrac{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{50}}}{\sqrt{100}}$ this is the same distribution of the mean water usage as from a sample of $5000$ such properties, as their mean would be distributed with expectation $\mu$ and standard deviation $\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{5000}}$ So in that case it makes no difference whether you make the intermediate calculations or not. I would have thought this was intuitively appealing, as the overall mean should not depend on how you slice up the calculation. It could make a difference if your original samples were not all the same size (instead you could take a weighted average of the original means, with the weights proportional to the number of properties in each group). It could make a difference if the different groups had different expected water usage (a group of $50$ student residences might tend to use less water than a group of $50$ farms).
