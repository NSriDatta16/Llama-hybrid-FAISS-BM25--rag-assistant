As RoBorg said your get string should be: char get[] = { "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n" "Host: localhost\r\n" "From: bla@ble\r\n" "User-Agent: HTTPTool/1.0\r\n" "\r\n" }; If you are connecting to other sites besides localhost the 'host' field will have to be updated (usually hostname, IP address, or www works).
