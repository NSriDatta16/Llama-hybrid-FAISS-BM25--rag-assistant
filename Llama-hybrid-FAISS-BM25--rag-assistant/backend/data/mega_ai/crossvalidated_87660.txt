You can compare the calculated F value and the tabulated F value. If the calculated is less the tabulated at the given alpha value you accept the null hypothesis otherwise you reject. So, you have the liberty of either using the F value or the p value. But if you are doing you calculation manually using F value is more simpler, if you are using a software then p-value is simpler.
