So you can simulate pseudo observations given the parameters. In this case it might be helpful to use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). In its crudest form you: define a distance metric between the observed data and some pseudo data; simulate parameter values from your prior and in each simulation generate a pseudo data set; retain all parameter values where the distance between the observed and pseudo data are small. This produces an approximate sample from the posterior. If you gave a bit more info we might be able to suggest some appropriate metric. Response to Edit Steps 1-6 are your means of generating a pseudo sample given the parameters. sse is your distance metric. So you could simulate steps 1-6 many times and only retain simulations where sse is less than some value, k say. As k goes to zero you will get a more accurate estimate of the posterior. If you had all the time in the world, you could only retain simulations in which the pseudo data exactly corresponded to the actual data--this is possible in your case as you have discrete outcomes (0 or 1 for each lineup) although probably infeasible if the sample size is moderate. Even if you don't, however, any distance metric you use is just an approximation of this "exact" rejection criteria.
