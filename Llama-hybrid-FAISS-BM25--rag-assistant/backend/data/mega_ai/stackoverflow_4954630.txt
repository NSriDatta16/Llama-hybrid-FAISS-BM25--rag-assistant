The documentation on the flask site ( http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/fileuploads/ ) demonstrates how to properly and safely handle file uploads, I would start there. If you wish to parse the file before/instead of saving it, you should be able to use the stream property/attribute on the FileStorage object you're given access to via request.files.
