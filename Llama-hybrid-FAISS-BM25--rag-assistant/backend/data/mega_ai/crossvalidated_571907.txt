Covariance based SEM and GOF indexes

I have some questions all related to SEM models. I am just estimating a SEM model in R using the function sem. The model looks like this: SEMmodel I am asked to state whether I use a covariance-based structural equation modeling. I am not able to understand it. Do I use it just because I define the covariances or this is something different? Moreover, I am asked to report the average variance extracted (AVE) and the composite reliabilities but I don't know which indicators are since I haven't found them anywhere among the goodness of fit indices... Can somebody help please? Thanks in advance!
