How to represent dependencies between horizons and uncertainty when forecasting multiple horizons?

Suppose the following case of univariate time series forecasting. We forecast sales of a product 1 till 7 days ahead. The true distribution of the actual sales is the following: there is a 100% chance that there will be a sale of 30 on one of each 7 days, each day has a chance of 1/7 of being the day with the sale. What kind of output should a forecasting algorithm give to predict such a distribution? Quantile forecasting does not suffice. Each day has a chance of 1/7 of sale of 30 and 6/7 of 0. If we combine the distributions of each day and assume them to be independent, there would still be a chance of (6/7)^7 of having no sales, which is clearly not the true distribution.
