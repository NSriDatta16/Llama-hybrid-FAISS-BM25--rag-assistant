Establishing an empirical relationship among environmental properties using PCA and Multiple Regression

So, this post is a follow-up to a previous question of mine asked recently ( Percentage of contribution of multiple factors to a single dependent variable ), with more details on what I am trying to achieve with the data. Generally I have a set of oceanic data collected underway during a cruise: temperature (T), salinity (S), fluorescence (F) and inorganic carbon (C). It is known that C is somehow related to T, S and F respectively. My goal is to acquire an empirical relationship between C and TSF based on those data, which can then be used in predicting C for a larger ambient area and analyzing the proportion of variance explained by each of the three environmental factor (i.e. T, S and F). I was kindly provided with the multiple regression method by @A.Donda in my last post, which assumes that T,S,F are independent to each other in order to correctly evaluate the variance contribution. But they are practically not completely independent. So I want to try incorporating TSF in a PCA model with the goal of deriving an independent set of principal components to express C and estimate the percentage contribution to C. (I'm working with Excel and Matlab.) @A.Donda, please join the discussion if you can.
