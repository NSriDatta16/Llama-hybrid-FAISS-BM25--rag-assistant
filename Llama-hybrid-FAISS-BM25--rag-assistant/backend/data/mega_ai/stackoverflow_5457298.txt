Anchoring/docking behavior in WPF on Canvas layout

I am arranging quite freely a lot of elements on a Canvas layout, in fact the elements represent an interactive flow-chart. As transformations are applied, I need relative transformations on some of the elements. Especially I require some elements being anchored or docked to their parent elements. I found different solutions, however I don't know if they solve my problem in the most elegant way. Here is an example: The Polygon draws a triangle and I would like to let it dock on the left side of line. Which means, when translating the line to a new position or when scaling it down, the Polygon should move with it. Is this possible?
