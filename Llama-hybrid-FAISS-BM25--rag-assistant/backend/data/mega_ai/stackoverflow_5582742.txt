It sounds like VSS is expecting those files in a particular directory. To solve this: find and make the path that VSS is expecting; the one with ccp_utility x 3. check-in (all files) to VSS. if you don't care about version history at this point, delete the project from VSS. disconnect/unbind your solution from version control. make the directory layout on disk as you need. drag & drop the root folder of your new layout on disk into VSS Explorer. Suggest make it a brand new path (aside your old project) in VSS, to avoid any complications. you now have a 'new project' as far as VSS is concerned. ensure your bindings are correct, and you should be able to continue as per normal.
