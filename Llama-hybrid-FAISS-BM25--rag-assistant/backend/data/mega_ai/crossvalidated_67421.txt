It will not create problems, although inclusion of all 642 variables in your regression will. You have only 1300 observations for each variable and if you include all variables you will be asking the data to answer 642 questions (asking whether this variable is significant or not) which is too many in my opinion. Something in the order of 10 variables would be more appropriate for data of this size. Also important to note is that all your explanatory variables are dummy variables indicating the inclusion of a chemical group or not. This does not cause any problems but you should note that the coefficients estimated in your regression will give you the average Y for that particular variable. For example, if I run a regression of height on a constant and a dummy variable indicating whether someone is male or not (1=male, 0=female), the coefficient of the constant term will only tell me the average height for all females and the sum of the coefficient on the constant term and gender dummy will tell me the average height for all males in the sample. So if your Y is say cost of experiment and one of your dummies indicates the presence of benzine, your constant + coefficient will tell you the average cost of an experiment with benzine in it. I would be mostly worried about performance of your model eroding very quickly as you add more and more explanatory variables. The ratio of zeros to ones is not a problem though.
