SQL query find max row from the aggregated averages

Supposed I have the following tables: Sailor(sid, sname, age) Boat(bid, sid) Each boat can have many sailors, and each individual sailor can serve on many boats. What I want to do is to find the boat with the highest average age of sailors. I can find the average age of the sailor on each boat with this subquery: SELECT b.bid, AVG(s.age) AS avg_age FROM sailor s, boat b WHERE b.sid = s.sid GROUP BY b.bid However, I am stuck on how to find the maximum row from this subquery further on. P.S. I'm also looking for MySQL-compatible query, if that makes any difference.
