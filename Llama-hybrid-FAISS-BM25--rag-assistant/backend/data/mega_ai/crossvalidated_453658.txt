Seasonality reduction in a time series

I'm working on a project in which there is a time series that contains calls number per antenna in a certain region. This time series has a seasonality of 24 hours (the number of call in a day at for example 1PM is very similar to the number at the same time the next day). I've applied seasonality reduction by following this tutorial with lag-24 and I've applied some RNN models in order to predict future values. I've some question about this application: Is this seasonality reduction step mandatory? If I use original data how does this affect my prediction? Is it normal that the NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error) obtained when applying the model on seasonality reduced data is higher w.r.t. the one obtained without this lag-reduction? Consider that with seasonality reduced data I got 0.8 NRMSE while on the original dataset 0.2. Should I re-introduce seasonality after applying the prediction step? I mean, once I've computed y_pred by using lag-24 data, obviously these data are lag-24 differenced too, should I try to insert seasonality back? If so do you have any suggestions? Because the train/test split is random and I don't know how to reintroduced seasonality because I don't have the 24-hour before observation.
