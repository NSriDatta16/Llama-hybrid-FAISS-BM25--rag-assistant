You cannot say anything about overfitting from (log-)likelihood, AIC or BIC alone. You could say something by comparing the model's in-sample fit with its out-of-sample prediction accuracy. If the in-sample residuals are subtantially smaller than the out-of-sample forecasting errors, the model suffers from overfitting; otherwise, it does not. Time series cross validation (e.g. as presented in Hyndman & Athanasopoulos "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" Section 5.10 ) is your way to go.
