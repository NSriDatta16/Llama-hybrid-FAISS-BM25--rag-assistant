This is more of a comment than an answer but it's too long to be a comment: The "bible" for sequential analysis is probably 2014's book Sequential Analysis: Hypothesis Testing and Changepoint Detection by Alexander Tartakovsky. It is seemingly exhaustive in its coverage of the topic. http://www.amazon.com/Sequential-Analysis-Hypothesis-Changepoint-Probability-ebook/dp/B00MMOIWTS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1445511005&sr=8-1&keywords=sequential+analysis+tartakovsky That said, in June 2014 Columbia sponsored The Fifth International Workshop in Sequential Methodologies which brought together the latest and greatest practitioners in the field. Tartakovsky was on the organizing committee. https://sites.google.com/site/iwsm2015/home See the "Detailed Program" link on the conference website for abstracts and papers. There's probably something there targeted specifically to your question. Response lifted from this CV thread as written by me: sequential estimators for a proportion
