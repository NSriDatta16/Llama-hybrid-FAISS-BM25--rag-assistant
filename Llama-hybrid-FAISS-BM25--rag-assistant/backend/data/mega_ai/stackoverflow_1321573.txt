This is a bit of a high level question, but I will have a stab. Drupal is a content managment framework, there is a good overview here. Drupal is bassed on some object orineted principals . It has seperations of concerns, much like MVC. There is a database abstraction layer , a logical layer and theming system . When programming a drupal module it is often advisable to make use of one or more of the hooks available. This will allow you to tightly integrate your code into the drupal system. There is a lot of functionality built into the core , which you can leverage in your modules. Making use of these will reduce the code that you have to write as well as making your code more drupalish.
