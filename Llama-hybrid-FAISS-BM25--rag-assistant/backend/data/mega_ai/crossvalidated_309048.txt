StijnDeVuyst, and repeated by igrinis, provides a good measure and concept for the 'variance among subsets' you were looking for. In relation to your task to find 'turnover' and not just 'similarity' of friends replying to your posts. I believe that you may wish to extend this concept. Instead of taking all the subsets together you may want to look at adjacent subsets only . The difference is whether you want a relative measure for the friends that consistently reply to all of your posts, or a relative measure for the changes of replying friends (how much come and go) from post to post, or period to period. Instead of creating subsets based on the friends replying to a specific post, you might want to create subsets by taking multiple posts together. You have to determine whether facebook-friends that answer irregularly (for instance answering post number x and x+2 but not post number x+1) should be considered as contributing to turnover. (An example: For some countries that include short-term leaves as emigration and immigration, their statistics show high values, relative to the population. You may wonder if this is correct. Several media like to report on these high numbers of turnover without correctly placing this nuance and pretending that an extreme amount of people are leaving the country). These statistics then become multidimensional. Turnover is for instance not constant in time. Possibly you would like to provide multiple types of definitions of turnover in your graphs. For instance you could graph time series of 1) the number of leavers, 2) the number of arrivers and 3) the total number of commenting friends. And then consider how you wish to express turnover . For instance, is it about replacement (the number of leaves that get replaced by arrival) or about changes? The latter, changes, is also reflecting growth and decrease. As an alternative you could create a measure that determines how long on average your facebook friends remain are inside the commenting subset (residence time reflects turnover rate). You could also brake this up into activity level changes (too loosen the concept that a facebook friend is either active or not active in commenting on your posts). For instance you could determine the number of replies per 10 posts as a level of activity and then determine the change in activity level for all your friends. In such way a friend who is changing from 8 replies in 10 posts to 2 replies to 10 posts can be included in your measure of turnover.
