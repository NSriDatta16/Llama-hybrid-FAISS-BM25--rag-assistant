As Glen mentioned, additivity of variances when samples are independent: VAR(N D) = N VAR(D), with VAR = S^2 then S(N*D) = SQRT(N)*S(D) In statistics, the standard error SE or standard deviation for a sample mean is given by the formula SE = S/SQRT(N) for the same reason as above, where N is the sample size and S is the standard deviation of the sample. Applying this to supply chain, the standard deviation over a lead time of N days is equivalent as pulling a sample of N days and measuring the standard error of its daily demand: Average SE for N days = S(D)/SQRT(N), where S(D) is the daily demand standard deviation. Notice this is an average daily standard error. The total SE over the length of N days lead time is N times that value = SE = N*S(D)/SQRT(N) = SQRT(N)*S(D) The safety stock is then simply a measure of how many standard deviations away from the mean you want to be = Z*SE (standard error over the lead time).
