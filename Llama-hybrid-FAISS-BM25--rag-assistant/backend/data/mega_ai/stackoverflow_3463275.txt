Convert a String (formatted just like an ArrayList ) to an actual ArrayList

I am trying to convert a String into an ArrayList. For example, my Struts2 webapp returns this String named row in a format similar to this: [A, BB, CCC, DDDD, 1, 0, 1] (something along those lines) I need to convert them into an ArrayList so I can prepopulate some forms in another JSP page. I hardcoded a method to convert such Strings into list form: StringBuffer rowBuffer = new StringBuffer(row); int startIndex = 0; int endIndex = rowBuffer.indexOf(",") - 1; rowBuffer.deleteCharAt(rowBuffer.indexOf("[")); rowBuffer.deleteCharAt(rowBuffer.indexOf("]")); while(startIndex != -1 && endIndex != -1 && startIndex This works fine in cases where all the fields are populated. However, lets say I have a String that looks like this: [A, BB, , , 1, 0, 0] (the 3rd and 4th fields are missing), then I get something that doesn't work (the blank elements don't register correctly, and the size of the list is 6, when it should be 7). Is there a more elegant solution than hardcoding? If not, could someone point me in the right direction on how to handle cases with blank fields? Thanks!
