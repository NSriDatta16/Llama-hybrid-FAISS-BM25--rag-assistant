I don't see a problem with this, frankly. Having separate classes for the data in separate layers means that you can change one without having to change the others. The extra cost of the other representations is usually pretty minimal - typing speed is generally not the factor in productivity. OTOH, being able to change something about data storage without being obligated to change the whole stack can save you a ton of time and effort, as often using the same construct for multiple purposes results in unforeseen side-effects when making a change. IOW, while having to propagate a change through multiple layers can suck, it can often be assisted by proper tooling, etc. On the other hand, when a trivial change in your data layer has an unforeseen side effect in your UI, that always sucks, and slows any change as anything you do can break anything in the entire system.
