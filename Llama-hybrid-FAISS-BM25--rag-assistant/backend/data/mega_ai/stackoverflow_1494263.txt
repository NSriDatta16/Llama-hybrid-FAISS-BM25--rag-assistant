As a diagnostic test, can you accurately measure the time it takes to load the very first time? Then take that to determine the transfer rate. Then you can take that transfer rate and compare that to what you get when running HD Tune . For what it's worth, I ran this myself and got 44.2 MB/s minimum, 87 MB/s average, 110 MB/s max read speeds with my Western Digital RE3 drive (one of the faster 7200 RPM SATA drives available). The point of all this is to see if your own application is doing the best it can. In other words, aside from caching you can't really read the files any faster than what your hard drive is capable of. So if you're reaching that limit then there's nothing more to do.
