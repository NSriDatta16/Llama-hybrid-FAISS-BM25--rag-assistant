Synchronisation construct inside pragma for

I have a program block like: for (iIndex1=0; iIndex1 progress( iCount, (size()-1)*((size()-1))/2 ); } } } } I have tried parallelising the inner and outer loop and by putting iCount in a critical region. What would be the best approach to parallelise this? If I wrap iCount with omp single or omp atomic then the code gives an error and I figured out that would be invalid inside omp for. I guess I am adding many extraneous stuffs to paralellise this. Need some advice... Thanks, Sayan
