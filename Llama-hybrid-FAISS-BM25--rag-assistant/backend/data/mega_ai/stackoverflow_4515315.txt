How to optimize performance for a canvas with hundreds of separate custom user controls

I am writing an application that can potentially have hundreds of custom user controls on a canvas. All of them can be dragged around the screen, and there are lines connecting all of then to at least one other user control. Once you reach 250 custom user controls or so performance starts to markedly decline, with frame rates going to 10 or below. Are there any best practices or ideas on how to optimize performance in this sort of situation? The problem seems to be in the sheer number of controls on the canvas at any one time. Thanks! ~Steve
