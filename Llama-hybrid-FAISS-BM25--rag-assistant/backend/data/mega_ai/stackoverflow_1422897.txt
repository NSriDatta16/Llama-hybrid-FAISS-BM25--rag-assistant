You can instruct the WebRequest to use system cache by setting the CachePolicy property. Following code (taken from MSDN ) caches requests for one day. The cache is stored at the temporay internet files folder of the current user (at least on Windows XP). // Create a policy that allows items in the cache // to be used if they have been cached one day or less. HttpRequestCachePolicy requestPolicy = new HttpRequestCachePolicy (HttpCacheAgeControl.MaxAge, TimeSpan.FromDays(1)); WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create (resource); // Set the policy for this request only. request.CachePolicy = requestPolicy; HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse(); // Determine whether the response was retrieved from the cache. Console.WriteLine ("The response was retrieved from the cache : {0}.", response.IsFromCache); Stream s = response.GetResponseStream (); // do something with the response stream s.Close(); response.Close();
