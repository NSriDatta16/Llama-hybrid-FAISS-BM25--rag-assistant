You can have some interactions which could account for various nonlinearities. Linear model means that outcome can be expressed as an linear function of parameters, variables can be cross-products, squares, cubes etc. So in the end linear models in reality allow flexible modeling. For logistic regression outcome is logit and modeled class probability can be calculated via transformation of this logit by exponentiation and other operators. I would suggest not to worry about linearity of dataset, whatever that means, but only checking if your model has power to classify outcomes for example by using ROC-analysis.
