mysql : a pivot table handler request?

I have a mysql question : using php with mysql I actually have a schema that looks like this : 3 tables : module module_has_theme (pivot table) theme The idea behind this is to display the modules of my application using themes if they have, and if they don't, then display them in an extra category (other). So let's say if I populate my module table with some modules : mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, mod5 Then I create some themes : fruit, animals, number, human Then in the pivot table I bind mod1 with animals. Then I would like to have the result of the request like this (or something similar) result : fruit => null, animals => mod1, number => null, human => null, other => mod2, mod3, mod4, mod5 Actually, my code use 2 mysql requests and a php loop to do it, ( first request takes all modules second request takes all modules that have themes (using two inner join) a php loop that organize modules the way I want using the two above resulting arrays ) Now I was wondering if there would be a magic mysql request that would do the same job in 1 single request ? Please if you know that let me know ;)
