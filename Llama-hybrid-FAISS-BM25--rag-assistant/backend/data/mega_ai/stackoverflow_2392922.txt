What Is Wrong With Using GET To Remove Content?

I know it goes against the REST architecture but, from a pragmatic viewpoint, what is wrong about using GET request method to remove data from a database? Let's say I built an application that has an administration panel. In administration panel admins can remove items by accessing URIs like these: /admin-panel/items-controller/remove-action/id/X Where X is a primary key of an item to be deleted. Are there any practical disadvantages to using this approach? Please educate me because I don't understand why POST should be used for this. My main problem with using POST for removing data is that instead of a simple link (easy to style in CSS) you have to print a form with POST method next to each item and then style it to look like a button/link. Or am I completely misunderstanding?
