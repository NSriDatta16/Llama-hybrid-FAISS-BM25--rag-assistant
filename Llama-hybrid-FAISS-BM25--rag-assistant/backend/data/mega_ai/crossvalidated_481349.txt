Relevance of Mixed Model Estimates vs. Observed Means

This question is a follow-up to a previous question I asked regarding mixed model effects construction, linked here . It provides some background, although this is a broader question with little to do with specifically my model. I have since constructed my model, taking care that assumptions are met etc. But at the risk of asking a perhaps noobish question, I'm struggling to get my head around the output and how to go about reporting it. Via the model I can generate what I have taken as estimates for the mean of each of my 10 treatment conditions for each of the three time steps, done via simple addition method seen in Robert's answer here . But after comparison it is evident that these model-based predictions slightly deviate from my observed means that I calculate from my raw data, as you would expect from a prediction of a trend taking into account the random effects and interactions. So my primary question here is whether these predictions are at all valuable when discussing my results (i.e. under what circumstances one would refer to them/graphically depict them) or whether that is not their typical purpose, and I should stick to the observed means for discussion. Cheers for any help.
