No. I'll give you one use of time series, which is not related to forecasting: spectral analysis. FFT is the work horse in spectral analysis, but it works best when your series are essentially infinite, or very long. Analyzing sound waves is a good application for FFT. However, in social sciences the series are usually not very long. Usually we have a few dozen observations at most. So in these cases you can use Yule-Walker equations to obtain a periodogram of the series, e.g. see MATLAB pyulear function .
