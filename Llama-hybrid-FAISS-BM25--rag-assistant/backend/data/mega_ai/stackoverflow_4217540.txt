Looks to me like you are simply trying to move an image around within a canvas, correct? If so, using the DragManager and related mechanisms is overkill in my opinion. You can simply add handlers to your image for mouse down/up and then add a member var "isMouseButtonDown" or some such which you will set to true when the mouse button goes down and set it to false when the mouse button is up. When the mouse goes down, add a handler to your image for mouse move (don't forget to remove the handler when the mouse goes up.) You then update the x/y of your image whenever you get the move event and isMouseButtonDown is true. Pro tip: When adding the handler for mouse move, set the third parameter of addEventListener to true (useCapture), this will make your image move much less jittery. Hope that helps.
