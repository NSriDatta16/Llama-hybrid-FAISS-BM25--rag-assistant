Linear regression and regression line

The aim of the regression line is to find the line which error is minimum. This error can be calculated by suming all the squares of the difference between the value predicted by the line and the real one. However, some say the average point must belong to line, is this true? Because, if it were that way, that line may not minimize the error.
