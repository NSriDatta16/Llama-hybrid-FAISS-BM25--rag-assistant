How to output coverage XML with nosetests?

I'm trying to output the coverage XML of my nosetests so they show up on Hudson. The line I'm executing is: nosetests --with-gae -v --all-modules --with-xunit --with-coverage I see the coverage output in the console, but there's no xml file containing the coverage data. How can I get it to output the coverage xml?
