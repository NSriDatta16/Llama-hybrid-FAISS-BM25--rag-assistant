This is not the most elegant solution but does work well. You will need to modify the form to act as an action listener. Instead of creating tasks, send out emails containing a link to the InfoPath. When the user opens the form customize the top of form to look like a task form with a checkbox, when the form is updated fire the workflow to check if the check box is complete, if so move on the workflow on.
