Yes there is a difference! You will want to make it part of the filename or some browsers will not cache it. From: http://thinkvitamin.com/code/serving-javascript-fast/ According the letter of the HTTP caching specification, user agents should never cache URLs with query strings. While Internet Explorer and Firefox ignore this, Opera and Safari don’t – to make sure all user agents can cache your resources, we need to keep query strings out of their URLs From: http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/08/23/revving-filenames-dont-use-querystring/ Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, mentioned that Squid, a popular proxy, doesn’t cache resources with a querystring. This hurts performance when multiple users behind a proxy cache request the same file – rather than using the cached version everybody would have to send a request to the origin server. (note this default behavior in Squid has since changed ) Finally, there is a great little service that will let you "ping" a page on the Internet and verify the "cacheability" of the file (and the resources it uses) Cacheability - Check www.stackoverflow.com's Cacheability You'll notice that the CSS and JS files that StackOverflow serves up are versioned in the query string and as a result the service reports: This object will be fresh for 1 week. It can be validated with Last-Modified. Because it contains a query ('?') in the URL, many caches will not keep this object.
