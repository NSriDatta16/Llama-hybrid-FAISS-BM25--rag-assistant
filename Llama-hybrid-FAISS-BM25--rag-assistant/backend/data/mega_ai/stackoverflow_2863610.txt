For starters, you can't really expect to get the computer to identify arbitrarily complicated rules. Same is true of a human analyzing the strings; I'm sure you can think of some examples of rules that could apply but that no human could ever be expected to figure out just from looking at the strings. What I think you would need to do is program the computer with certain kinds of rules that it can identify. For example, you could write a script that identifies rules of the form "The string length is always X." Or even "The Nth character is always X" wouldn't be too hard. I notice that the example rules you mentioned are all of this form, so it wouldn't be too far off from a human analysis ;-) In fact, if you know, or can assume, that the choice of the character that appears in a given position is based only on the positional index, you could use your data to estimate the probability that a given character appears in a given spot, which would be like a more general version of "The Nth character is always X." If you want to establish a confidence level for your rules, I'd suggest looking into Bayesian statistics, which is used when you want to revise the probability of a hypothesis (such as "this rule is correct") as you collect new evidence.
