There is no difference as far as memory or performance that I know of, but there ARE differences. For example, non-dynamic controls (the drag and drop you refer to) are instantiated in the Page.Init, whereas the controls you add dynamically may come from a button click, the Page.Load, etc. Just be aware of the initialization differences, and also how the ViewState is handled for dynamic controls .
