Sample size calculations for logistic regression are complex. I wont attempt to summarise it here. Reasonably accessible solutions to this problem are found in: Hsieh FY. Sample size tables for logistic regression. Statistics in Medicine. 1989 Jul;8(7):795-802. Hsieh FY, et al. A simple method of sample size calculation for linear and logistic regression. Statistics in Medicine. 1998 Jul 30;17(14):1623-34. An accessible discussion of the issues with example calculations can be found in the last chapter (Section 8.5 pp 339-347) of Hosmer & Lemeshow's Applied Logistic Regression .
