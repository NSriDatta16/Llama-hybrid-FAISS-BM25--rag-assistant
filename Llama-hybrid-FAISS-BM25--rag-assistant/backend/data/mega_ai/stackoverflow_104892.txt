How do I remove loadbalancer pollution from my access logs

I have a pair of Sun web servers (iws6) sitting behind a load balancer. It likes to know if the web servers are up and continually asks for /alive.html. That is fine but how do I not log that in my access log? Failing that, how could I have the archiver strip out that accesses when it roles the file over? I would prefer something more elegant that cron calling grep -v alive.html
