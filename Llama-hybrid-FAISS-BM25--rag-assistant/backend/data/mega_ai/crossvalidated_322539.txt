can I use h2o or mxnet to do time series prediction?

I have a time series like 4, 6, 10, 12, 2, 23, 4,... It is not a stationary time series so I do not want to use arima algorithm. I perfer neural networks. There is some algorithm in R package such as forecast. But that function (nnetar in forecast) is simple. It only has single hidden layer. I want to use deep learning that includes more layers to do time series. h2o or mxnet seems good because they not only have multiple layers, but also can customize the number of the nodes in every layer. But I am not sure if h2o or mxnet can be used for time series prediction. my h2o version is 3.16.0.2 and my mxnet version is 0.10.1 Could anyone please let me know if h2o or mxnet can do this? If so, how to use these packages?
