I don't use SVM, but in Logistic Regression and ANN's I have sucessfully used k-fold with replicated training data (cut the folds, generate the proper training\test pairs, generate replicas of the less represented class only in training data), sometimes with noise. Biases were removed in the selection of the cutpoints. A very elementary review to techniques available for unbalanced data if found on this paper . My favorite technique so far (PCA plus noise injection) is found in this paper .
