To my knowledge, you can set just one glVertexPointer. So you could set this pointer to your big data storage but that would be in client's memory and without VBO. If you want ot use VBO there can be only one at time. But actually you could save all your data as texture and use geometry shader to rebuild model just from indices. Texture limit on my Radeon 3870HD is 8192 per dimension, but you are more likely to run out of memory using more than 1D texture (512 mb memory on my card and full 2D RGB texture is around 805 mb). In geometry shader you can connect your vertieces acording to supported indices and create mesh, but it's quite big workaround and not very practical. As mentioned it's rather waste of resource to do such precise models. In most 3D designers you have modifier to get much less polygons without affecting visuality, you just choose part that is overdetailed. It's also huge performance hit when you think about that most of time you see arround 50% of model and rest is discarded by tests..
