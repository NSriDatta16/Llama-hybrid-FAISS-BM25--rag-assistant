Not sure why your query would be generating that: normally you get that error message when you do: SELECT id /* This should have been qualified with system. or organization. */ FROM system LEFT JOIN (organization) ON (system.idOrganization = organization.id) Are you sure that query is exactly giving you that error? If you trimmed it down for SO, you might have cut out the bug.
