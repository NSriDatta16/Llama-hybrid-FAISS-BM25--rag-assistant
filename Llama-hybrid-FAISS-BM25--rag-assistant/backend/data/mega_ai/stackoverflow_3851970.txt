The #pragma is useful if you're distributing a library. Especially if you have different compiled .libs for different build settings (e.g. debug vs. release, multi-threaded C runtime vs. single-threaded, DLL vs. static library, etc). You can use #ifdef s in your code to select the correct .lib file, rather than requiring your users to set up their build environment to select the correct one. It reduces support time because your users cannot choose the wrong .lib file.
