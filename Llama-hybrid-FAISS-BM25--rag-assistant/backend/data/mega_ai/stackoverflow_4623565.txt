Jquery Draggable Div change background on drop

Making a fun little activity for my daughters 1st grade school website. I have several pictures in div's the kids can move around on the virtual living room using Jquery Draggable and Droppable, but my problem comes from where I want to have a light bulb png image (#bulb1) when dragged over the lamp (#lamp1) that the background image bulb-off.png of (#bulb1) will change to image bulb-on.png once dropped on (#lamp1). I am able to get the background image to change now, I have the tooltip that shows with the vocabulary for the kidds to learn, but I do not seem to have the ability to remove the dropped image the same way it was placed, and with the current settings, the tool tip will stop... Seems to be a little messy now. I have been reading a lot on the Jquery site, but not seeing anything to put me on track to get this to work. Basically I am back at the beginning (cleaned up my code mess). $(document).ready(function () { $( '#bulb1' ).draggable({ containment: '.shelf', helper: 'clone' }); $( '#lamp1, #laml2, #lamp3).droppable({ drop: function( event, ui ) { $(this).css('background-image', 'url(images/bulb-on.png)').tooltip(); }, out: function( event, ui ) { $(this).css('background-image', 'url(images/bulb-off-off.png)'); } }); }); Any assistance would be great ! Thanks, Alan
