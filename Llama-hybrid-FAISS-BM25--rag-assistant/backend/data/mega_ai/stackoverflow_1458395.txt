There are two different ways you can utilize jQuery on your website. To start off, you need to have access to your website source, whether it be straight HTML or generated HTML from a programming language. Then you need to insert a tag that will render in the final output to the web browser. Because you are new to jQuery, I highly suggest you start reading How jQuery works . As others have mentioned, there are Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) that host JQuery -- all you need to do is point your script tag src to a specific URI. Google and Microsoft both have CDNs that are free for personal and commercial use. Alternatively, you can download jQuery and host it on your own website. You can also leverage both of these methods together . In the event that the Google or Microsoft CDN is down or blocked in the end user's country/firewall/proxy, you can fallback to your locally hosted copy of jQuery.
