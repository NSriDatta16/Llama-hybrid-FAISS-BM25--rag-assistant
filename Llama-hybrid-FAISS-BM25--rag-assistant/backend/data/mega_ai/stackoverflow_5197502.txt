I can perhaps answer some of your questions, but certainly not all. EC2 are virtual machines preconfigured with a number of different options. It sounds like what you want is a Windows instance. They come with a number of different memory and cpu options depending on what you think your application will need. EBS is basically your fault tolerant file-system. That is where you'll put your files, including your database files. S3 is in essence a content delivery network. A REST friendly place to put files. For example if all you have is static content you could put the whole thing up in an S3 bucket, and not pay for any compute power, just storage, and bandwidth (which is cheap). I should add, there is no need to use S3, if you are comfortable with using your EC2 instance to serve up all your content. Its all a question of options. As to why would you shut off an instance -- that would be because you're not using it. For example, a staging server, that you would use to test your app, in a variety of different scenarios. You could have a different EC2 instance per scenario, start them when you want to run your tests and stop then when you're done. As for SQL Server, one of the EC2 instances that Amazon offers "pre-configured" includes a SQL Express already set up. If you don't want SQL Express, then I beleive you'll have use one of your SQL Server Licences and install it on your server. The great thing about AWS is the very low barrier to entry. For just a few dollars investment, you can poke around for a day and see what there is to see. When I first started with AWS I found it helpful to start small, with a single EC2 instance. Just open up the RDP ports and connect into it. You'll soon feel right at home, having a your own machine up in the cloud. Let the CDN and load balancing things come in time. On last bit of advice, is to remember that your ESB data and your instance must be in the same region. If you start a machine in Europe, and your ESB volume is in Seattle you're out of luck. You'll have to move your volume from one region to another (and they charge something for that data transfer)
