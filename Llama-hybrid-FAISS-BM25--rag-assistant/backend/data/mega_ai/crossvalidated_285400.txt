The Dirichlet Process (DP) is a stochastic process used in Bayesian non-parametric models. Each draw from a DP is a discrete distribution. DP exhibits a clustering property which makes it useful in mixture modeling where the number of mixture components grows with data. Pitman-Yor (PY) process is an extension of DP that enables modeling of tail behavior with greater flexibility. It includes a discount parameter that controls the probability of cluster assignment. This makes PY useful for modelling data with power-law tails (such as word frequencies in natural language). Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) is an extension of a DP that models problems involving groups of data, where each observation within a group is a draw from a mixture model and mixture components are shared between groups. In each group, the number of components is learned from data using a DP prior. HDP processes are useful in for example learning the topics shared across multiple corpora.
