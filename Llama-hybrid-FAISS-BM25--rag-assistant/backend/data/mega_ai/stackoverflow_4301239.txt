Yes, very discouraged. That violates the point of having a rdbms. Which copy of data should be updated if it were to change? There are many, many ways to avoid it. Django has a cache system for intensive queries. You can also write views in the database that make retrieving data less comples. Also, writing methods for your models will probably help you retrieve data with more ease. I would look at Model-View-Controller designs as well. If it is not set up well, your application can become chaotic.
