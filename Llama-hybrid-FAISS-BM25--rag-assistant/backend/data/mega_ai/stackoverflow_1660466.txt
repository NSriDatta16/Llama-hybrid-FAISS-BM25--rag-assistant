Thank you for the answer. It seems i just haven't really understood the last paragraph of the section http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/index.html#configuring_recovery Because at first it seems c3p0 could do it (detect stale connections and retry to acquire connections for all eternity without ever throwing an exception to the application code (unless of course when its an error related to the sql statement and not to the connection), but in the last paragraph - which is written in pretty confusing way - it seems as if c3p0 can't ensure that to 100%. So my solution was to make a small wrapper for the methods i needed from the jdbc Connection interface, which attempt to reconnect if a query fails due to a connection error. Of course its a bit hacky, because i'd rather have my components use the standard Connection-interface instead of my own interface, but at least its working cleanly now.
