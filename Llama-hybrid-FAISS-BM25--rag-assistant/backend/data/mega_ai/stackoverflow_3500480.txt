jQuery itself might not meet your requirements for simple svg drag&drop (at this time), so you either have to make it do what you want or use another js framework. I'd recommend having a look at raphaÃ«l for example. The values from event.clientX/Y are not in user units, they need to be converted. See e.g http://www.codedread.com/code.php#dragsvg for an example of dragging svg objects.
