Is a Bayesian estimate with a "flat prior" the same as a maximum likelihood estimate?

In phylogenetics, phylogenetic trees are often constructed using MLE or Bayesian analysis. Oftentimes, a flat prior is used in the Bayesian estimate. As I understand it, a Bayesian estimate is a likelihood estimate that incorporates a prior. My question is, if you use a flat prior, is it any different from simply doing a likelihood analysis?
