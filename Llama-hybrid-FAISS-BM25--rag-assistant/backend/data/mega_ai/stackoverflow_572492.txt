SAS data step has a built-in loop over observations. You don't have to do any thing, unless you want to, for some reason. For instance, the following generates a random number for each observation: data one; set sashelp.class; rannum = ranuni(0); run; If you want to loop over variables, then there are arrays. For example, the following initializes variables, var1 to var10, with random numbers: data one; array vars[1:10] var1-var10; do i = 1 to 10; vars[i] = ranuni(0); end; run; The first. and last. flags are automatically generated when you set a (sorted) data with a by statement. An example: proc sort data=sashelp.class out=class; by age; run; data one; set class; by age; first = first.age; last = last.age; run; /* check */ proc print data=one; run; /* on lst Obs Name Age first last 1 Joyce 11 1 0 2 Thomas 11 0 1 3 James 12 1 0 4 Jane 12 0 0 5 John 12 0 0 6 Louise 12 0 0 7 Robert 12 0 1 8 Alice 13 1 0 ... 18 William 15 0 1 19 Philip 16 1 1 */
