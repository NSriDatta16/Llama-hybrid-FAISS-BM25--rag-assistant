I figured a way that makes it clear that the CDF just does not factorize like a pmf/pdf and that shows that the intuition in the original question is wrong. Suppose $X \to Y \to Z$ , therefore $X\perp Z \mid Y$ . Assume for simplicity and without loss of generality that $Y \in \{ y_1, y_2, y_3 \}$ . \begin{align*} &P(X\le x, Y \in \{y_1, y_2\}, Z\le z) \\&= P(Y = y_1) P(X\le x, Z\le z \mid Y = y_1) + P(Y = y_2) P(X\le x, Z\le z \mid Y = y_2)\\ &= P(Y = y_1) P(X\le x \mid Y = y_1)P( Z\le z \mid Y = y_1)\\ & \qquad + P(Y = y_2) P(X\le x \mid Y = y_2)P( Z\le z \mid Y = y_2)\\ &\ne P(Y \in \{y_1, y_2 \}) P(X\le x \mid Y \in \{y_1, y_2\}) P(Z\le z\mid Y \in \{y_1, y_2\}) \end{align*} Where I used the law of total probability in the first equality and then conditional independence in the second equality. The last inequality is what I was really wishing was true. The intuition is similar to @lukas-lohse's answer: conditioning on the event $Y \in \{ y_1, y_2 \}$ isn't "really conditioning" in the sense that we still don't know what value $Y$ takes and so we need to use total probability and take the average probability for all possible values $Y$ can take. I think another correct way to state this is that for all $y$ , we have that $\sigma(X \mid Y=y) \perp \sigma(Z \mid Y=y)$ which again checks out the sigma algebras argument but relates it to the two random variables $X \mid Y=y$ and $Z \mid Y=y$ . A lot of sources mention how the "probability distribution" factorizes according to the graphical model but I guess that's very imprecise terminology since typically we refer to the cdf as the "probability distribution" and again, the cdf does not factorize. It is the pdf/pmf that factorizes. Also, I found this https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/1550/1/paper_161.pdf but it seems the stuff at the end of page 4 is wrong for the same reasons
