Is char* supported on Chinese / Japanese machines?

I am trying to create a DLL for authentication using Java and JNI. To create the DLL, I have created a Win32 application whose Character Set and Runtime Library information are Multi-Byte String and Multi-threaded (/MT) respectively. I have tested the DLL on WinXP with valid and invalid user credentials. Both work fine. I need to know whether the same DLL will work in Chinese / Japanese environments as well. Can anyone help me out with this issue? Thanks in advance. Regards Jegan K S
