Does the assumption of autocorrelation apply to linear regression with a categorical predictor?

[Edit:] My question concerns the use of a categorical predictor in linear regression specifically. Some of the assumptions for linear regression include: normality, homoscedasticity, and autocorrelation (of residuals), among others. Normally, these all relate to the residuals of the model, but in a previous answer , it was suggested that when using a categorical predictor , assumptions should be checked on the raw data instead, but also that all the same assumptions endure . That being said, a regression with a categorical predictor is very similar to an ANOVA, and to my knowledge, ANOVA does not have the assumption of autocorrelation of residuals. Which brings the question: Does the assumption of autocorrelation apply to linear regression with a categorical predictor? If yes, then how do you test it in R on the raw data (and not from the model)? Edit I began my question by saying the "main" assumptions but perhaps I should have said, "the main assumptions of interest to check at the analysis stage (once data is already collected and respecting independence of observations) with a categorical variable (group) as predictor." I had read online (e.g., http://r-statistics.co/Assumptions-of-Linear-Regression.html ) that there are 10 assumptions. I will name them below for the sake of completeness (though I think the list is missing independence and linearity proper): The regression model is linear in parameters [re: related to Linearity] The mean of residuals is zero Homoscedasticity of residuals or equal variance [re: Equal Variance] No autocorrelation of residuals The X variables and residuals are uncorrelated The number of observations must be greater than the number of Xs The variability in X values is positive The regression model is correctly specified No perfect multicollinearity Normality of residuals [re: Normality] Some of these assumptions either have been already verified in my case or do not apply. For example, multicollinearity does not apply to my situation as I have a single predictor, and by definition when comparing two levels of a categorical predictor the relationship will be linear ( example 1 , example 2 ). That being said, as the title of my question points out, my question relates exclusively to the autocorrelation of residuals assumption for the case of a categorical predictor . The source linked before mentions "This is applicable especially for time series data", but it doesn't say that it doesn't apply to non-time-series data, so that's why I wasn't sure (also: in relation to a categorical predictor).
