I probably don't understand the whole context but I see there could be a couple problems: You want to use pretrained model by classification on ImageNet for face recognition task. Those are very different task and the representation from pretrained ResNet will not be very useful for face recognition. You have just 3 classes. Do you mean just 3 person? That is not enough for learning general representation extractor. How do you even split it between train and val? I see you have a couple options: Don't train your face recognition system but use of the shelf like this one . Train some layers even from base_cnn Download some face recognition dataset (like Labeled Faces in the Wild or preferably larger), pretrain model on it and finetune (or just validate) on your dataset.
