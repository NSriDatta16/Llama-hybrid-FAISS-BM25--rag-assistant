Whether the "difference is significant or not" is not part of Bayesian logic. It would be good to edit that part of the post. It is not clear at all why you entertained more than one model. It's better to formulate a complete model, then to assess evidence for nonzero or large effects on parameters in that one model. And logistic model assumptions (here, additivity on the log odds scale) cannot be simultaneously true for a model and a sub-model. So formulate a subject-matter-driven model, choose priors, and draw inferences from that model. From the multivariate posterior parameter samples you can easily make marginal assessments by concentrating on a single parameter at a time, or a derived parameter (combination of other parameters). For example you can compute $\Pr(\theta > 0)$ or $\Pr(|\theta| > 0.2)$ .
