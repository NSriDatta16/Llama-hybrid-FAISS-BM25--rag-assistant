I need to make a SVM in weka to filter documents using Java

I am an absolute beginner. Never made a classifier or anything in weka using Java I have used the interface before. Basically I am kind of lost I've looked at the filter class for weka and played around with it a little. My documents are text documents and I need to separate them into 2 categories. I'm not sure how I define the categories or how I load the documents into an IDE to be classified :-( Any help/tutorials or pointers would be greatly appreciated.
