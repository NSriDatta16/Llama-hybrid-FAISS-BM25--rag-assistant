No, it means that the time series did not exist before time t=1 or that the researcher chooses not to include observations before that time. For some time series models the likelihood function depends on observations before t=1. For example in an AR(2) model one needs y(-1) and y(0) to predict y(1). In the time series literature, "exact maximum likelihood" estimators deal with the unavailability of data before t=1. Sometimes approximate likelihood estimators that assume y(t) = 0 or e(t) = 0 for t
