Obviously the line will pass through averaged point (x_average,y_average). For direction you may use the following algorithm (derived directly from minimizing average square distance between line and points): dx[i]=x[i]-x_average; dy[i]=y[i]-y_average; a=sum(dx[i]^2-dy[i]^2); b=sum(2*dx[i]*dy[i]); direction=atan2(b,a); Usual linear regression will not work here, because it assumes that variables are not symmetric - one depends on other, so if you will swap x and y, you will have another solution.
