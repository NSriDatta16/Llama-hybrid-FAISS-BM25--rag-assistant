You want to send an Expires header set to a date in the past (like your Meta tag). Expires is the most widely respected cache header, but you can also use things like Last-Modified, or Etags to get more specific control. Meta tags are a somewhat outdated means of setting caching protocols, and most of the meta cache control properties are fairly deprecated (e.g. NO-CACHE). A lot of user agents ignore them.
