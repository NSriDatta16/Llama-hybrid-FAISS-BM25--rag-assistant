how to print cells of a table with simple html dom

i have this html code. Im using Simple HTML Dom to parse the data into my own php script. Name City Greg House Century City Dexter Morgan Miami I need to get the text inside the TDs in an array, example: $array[0] = array('Greg House','Century City'); $array[1] = array('Dexter Morgan','Miami'); I've tried several ways to get that but i've fail in each and everyone of them. Can someone give me a hand?
