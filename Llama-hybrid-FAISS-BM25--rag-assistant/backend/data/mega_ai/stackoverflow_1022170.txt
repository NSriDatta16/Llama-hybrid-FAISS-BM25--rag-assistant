If you are not completely sold on Hudson a one click test drive should change your mind. Click below: https://hudson.dev.java.net/hudson.jnlp This will launch Hudson through Java Web Start for a test drive. Once it launches, visit http://localhost:8080/ to get to the dashboard. Any configuration that you do with this Hudson will be stored in ~/.hudson, so your data will survive through Hudson process restart. If you are using fairly standard tools such as svn and ant/maven - you should have a build up and running in 5 minutes. Different tools and it might take 20 minutes! See an introduction here: http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Meet+Hudson
