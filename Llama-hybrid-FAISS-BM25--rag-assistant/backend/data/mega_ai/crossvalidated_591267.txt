Measuring events in sales time series

I am trying to measure the effect of an event on some sales data. An event might be turning on a new payment method for customers, or a discount coupon promotion. Does it make sense to try a time series decomposition into Trend-Seasonal-Residual, and then try to spot the effect in the Residual component? Maybe it would make sense to do this for the period before the event, and then compare a forecast over the event period to the actual sales. If either of these methods make sense, how might I measure the significance of any findings? Are there other methods to check for an effect and to evaluate the significance of my findings?
