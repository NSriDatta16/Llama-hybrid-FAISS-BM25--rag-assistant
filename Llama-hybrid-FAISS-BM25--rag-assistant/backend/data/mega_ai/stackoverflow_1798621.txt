My question would be, why do you want to merge a reorganization back into branches? The idea behind branches is that they are (typically) maintenance mode (e.g. trunk is version 4 and you need to go back and fix version 3, you do so in the version 3 branch), or for people to do some side work that they don't necessarily want to have in the trunk right away. If you are doing a complete re-org of the codebase, that sounds like a good time to break some backwards dependency in code. If you don't do this, you may be limiting what refactoring you can actually accomplish.
