Not as far as I know: the DataStore is the only storage available on App Engine. However, it's not a lot of code, even if you are lazy. ;) Make sure you import the db module: from google.appengine.ext import db Then just store a key/value pair (you can then use this model to store any other miscellaneous strings you might add as well): class MyData(db.Model): myKey = db.StringProperty(required=True) myValue = db.StringProperty(required=True) data = MyData(myKey="Title", myStringValue="My App Engine Application") data.put() You can get it again with: db.Query(Entry).filter("myKey=", "Title").get().myStringValue
