A very fine choice, plotly is... In my case, i was trying to plot similar designation based on skills, where skills was a word2vec embedding of 300 dimensions; brought it to a 3 dimension vector space, and using plotly Scatter3D, i was able to plot a 3D scatterplot for the same. Et Viola!! Got an awesome 3 dimension graph, with hover and enlarge functionality. And best part is it can be exported as an html file, making it a plug and play suitable for any other PC, just drag and drop in a browser (included in the code below). Can anything BEE anymore simpler from plotly.offline import plot from plotly.graph_objs import * import numpy as np # x = np.random.randn(2000) # y = np.random.randn(2000) # Instead of simply calling plot(...), store your plot as a variable and pass it to displayHTML(). # Make sure to specify output_type='div' as a keyword argument. # (Note that if you call displayHTML() multiple times in the same cell, only the last will take effect.) p = plot( [ Scatter3d(x=skills_df[0], y=skills_df[1], z=skills_df[2], text= skills_df['designation'], mode='markers', marker=Marker(color=skills_df['cluster_number'], size=3, opacity=0.5, colorscale='Viridis')) ], output_type='div' # filename='/dbfs/FileStore/tables/lnkdn_jobroles_viridis.html' turn it on to save the file )
