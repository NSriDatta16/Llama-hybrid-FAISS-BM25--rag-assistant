I'm surprised no one answered with the rule-of-thumb for regarding the standard deviation in data with normal distributions: The 68-95-99.7 rule. (See Wikipedia article . If you have normally-distributed data, about 68% of observations fall within the range of the mean ± the standard deviation. And about 95% of observations fall within the mean ± two standard deviations. As far as I can tell, for a uniform distribution , about 58% of observations fall within μ ± σ, and 100% fall within μ ± 2σ. It appears that for skewed distributions , more of the data would fall within μ ± σ, so that for a common log-normal distribution, perhaps 75% of observations fall within μ ± σ. The data could also have a bimodal distribution . For a pretty obviously bimodal distribution, perhaps more that 50% of observations fall within μ ± σ. EDIT: To make these observations more explicitly tied to the question: It depends on the distribution of the data, and on what you mean by "on average", but probably more than 50% of observations fall within μ ± σ , so " on average, people spend between USD 43 and USD 57 on meals " isn't a bad interpretation of the statistics presented. EDIT 2: I bolded the mentioned distributions to make the logic of my answer more apparent.
