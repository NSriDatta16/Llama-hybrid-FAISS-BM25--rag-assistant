If your question is about testing, why don't you use mocks to fake the server? It's more elegant than using Webrat, and easier to deploy (you only have one app instead of an app and a test environment). More info about mocks http://blog.floehopper.org/presentations/lrug-mock-objects-2007-07-09/ You've got some info about mocks with Rspec here http://rspec.info/documentation/mocks/
