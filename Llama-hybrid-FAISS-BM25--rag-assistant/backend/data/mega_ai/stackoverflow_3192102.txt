It would be helpful to understand what your interface is displaying, but I'd suggest one of the following: Don't allow rotation by returning NO from shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation Use Interface Builder to adjust your springs and struts so that all of your interface elements fit in landscape view Add a new UIScrollView in Interface Builder and drag your UIView into it, then re-assign the view property of your File's Owner to the scroll view.
