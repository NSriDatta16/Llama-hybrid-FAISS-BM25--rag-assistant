HPs Open Source HTTPerf I like. Just setup the URLS you want to test and let it rip. use a couple of machines to emulate load. You could even parse the output into a DB and do some number crunching. Also, think about doing HTTPerf runs with profiling on the server side to see what lags and what doesnt. A nice touch is to let a user go on the app, and record all POST/GET requests and use them as a replay set for typical user interactions. Also, if you are thinking about UX, use firebug or something to check JS imports are being done asynchronously instead of one-at-a-time. Have a ganders at Stackoverflow question 310583/loading-javascript-dependencies-on-demand
