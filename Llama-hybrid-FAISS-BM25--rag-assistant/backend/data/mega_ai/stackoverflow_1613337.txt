What consequences does this have? Resources don't get freed up as quickly, and depending on the rest of the code performance will suffer. Does the connection close automatically? Are resources released at the end of every request? At the end of page execution, all connections are terminated and all resources released. Some people figure that since this happens, there is no need to worry about explicitly closing connections and/or releasing resources. All things being equal, reliance on this is not something that is encouraged as you never know how things will play out in heavy traffic - which is why all the good tutorials/instructors will tell you to open only when you need, and release as soon as you are done.
