Just as most other modern mobile devices, applications running on WP7 are sandboxed for security and reliability reasons. This also means you can't do random I/O on the the way you'd do it in an unrestricted environment. WP7 does provide sandboxed persistence using familiar constructs as directories and files, within what is known as Isolated Storage. Try to look up IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication() and take it from there. Update: An example can be found here .
