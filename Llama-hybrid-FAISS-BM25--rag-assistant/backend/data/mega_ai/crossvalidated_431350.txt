Time series plots, polynomial coefficients and PCA

I have several time series plots that I have their polynomial coefficients (curve fitting using Matlab polyfit). Is it possible and valid to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to try to classify them? Is it mandatory that all the plots will have the same coefficient numbers (degree of polynomial fit)? limitation to consider? Any other alternatives?
