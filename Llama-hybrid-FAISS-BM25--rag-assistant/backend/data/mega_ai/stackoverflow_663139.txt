Code coverage tool like NCover? EDIT: This assumes you have sufficient tests for functionality and are determined to get rid of every unnecessary function. Delete-then-compile would work but isn't scalable.. regardless, the point is that you're going to want some kind of source analysis tool (either static or runtime analysis).
