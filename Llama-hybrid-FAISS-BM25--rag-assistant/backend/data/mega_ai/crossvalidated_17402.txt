How likely am I to be descended from a particular person born in the year 1300?

In other words, based on the following, what is p? In order to make this a math problem rather than anthropology or social science, and to simplify the problem, assume that mates are selected with equal probability across the population, except that siblings and first cousins never mate, and mates are always selected from the same generation. $n_1$ -- initial population $g$ -- the number generations. $c$ -- the average number of children per couple. (If necessary for the answer, assume that every couple has exactly the same number of children.) $z$ -- the percentage of people who have no children, and who are not considered part of a couple. $n_2$ -- population at the final generation. (Either $n_2$ or $z$ should be given, and (I think) the other can be calculated.) $p$ -- probability of someone in the final generation being a descendant of a particular person in the initial generation. These variables can be changed, omitted, or added to, of course. I am assuming for simplicity that $c$ and $z$ do not change over time. I realize this will get a very rough estimate, but it's a starting point. Part 2 (suggestion for further research): How can you consider that mates are not selected with globally uniform probability? In reality, mates are more likely to be of the same geographical area, socio-economic background, race, and religious background. Without researching the actual probabilities for this, how would variables for these factors come into play? How important would this be?
