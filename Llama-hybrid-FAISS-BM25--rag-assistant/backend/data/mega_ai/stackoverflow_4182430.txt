Did you look at the output of your script?! My guess is it looks something like: geocoder.geocode( { 'address': Prague, Czech Republic}, function(results, status) { In your PHP script, you probably actually want something like: geocoder.geocode( { 'address': ' '}, function(results, status) { and you'll probably want to escape single quotes out of the $gmap variable.
