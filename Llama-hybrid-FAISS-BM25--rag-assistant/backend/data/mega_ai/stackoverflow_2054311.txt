Apart from the obligatory "You use coldfusion?!? ... ha" here you go: URL handling, turning /a/b/c into a call to your application Input (GET, POST, PUT, DEL) parsing into native structures Cookies and session management (SQL session storage / Dep-injected sessions / pluggable) Automagic service creation (RESTful/SOAPy) whatever They would be my top 4. Then: MVC abstractions as core framework features (I know!) ORM (I hate it, but for little things it is alright) Automagic input validation, autofixups of controls to GET/POST/DEL Authentication mechanisms Then if you are bored: CRM and templating Of course, getting these things stable and scalable is probably not worth the time reinventing the wheel (and yes I have tried, and I still commit to that repo). Don't bother unless you have some great new way of approaching it.
