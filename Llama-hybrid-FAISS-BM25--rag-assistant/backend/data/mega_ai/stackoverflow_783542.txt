At my workplace, VB.NET was the standard up until recently as several of the previous developers came from a classic ASP background and were familiar with VB syntax. As our development team has matured, and we've adopted more sophisticated design methodologies (DDD, good OOD), there has been a natural shift towards using C#. In most instances I would guess that shops using VB.Net is a pragmatic choice, rather than a technical one. That being said, VB.Net really is a much more capable language than it's predecessors - it just lacks some of the elegance of C#, and as you've discovered there's much more material related to development in C# on the web.
