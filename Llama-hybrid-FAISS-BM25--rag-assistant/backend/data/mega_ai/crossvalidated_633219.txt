Calculate when a time series will reach s specific value

I have a time series at day level granularity: Date. Value 2023-10-01 78945 2023-10-02 78990 2023-10-03 79005 2023-10-04 78999 ... While there are some fluctuations, the overall trend is increasing and we want to estimate when this value will reach a threshold, say, 90000. While standard time series models like Holt-Winters, ARIMA are good for forecasting, I am not sure how to use them to get the exact "runway" like in this case. One way is to calculate growth rate and assume linear growth and find the time, but correct calculation of growth rate is also one problem. So, I have two questions: Is there a standard method for calculating when the time series will reach a certain value? How to correctly measure the growth rate? One additional requirements: Sudden spikes (absurd increase and decrease) should not decrease/increase the runway abruptly.
