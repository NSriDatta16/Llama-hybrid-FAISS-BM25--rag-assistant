How to convert my floating number to feed my Neural Network?

I've been reading some online tutorials about Neurons, Percepton and Multi Layer Perceptron concepts. Now, I would like to implement the concept in my own examples. What I would like to do is to implement the following simple algorithm into my network: Assuming we have 4 floating numbers minus1 , plus1 , minus2 , plus2 if (minus2>plus2) and (minus1 plus1) then return -1 else return 0 But here are my concerns: How do I feed my network with such numbers: 63.8990, -165.177, 1.33001 or 0.98401? How should I choose the number of inputs as I have 4 numbers but I don't know if I should use just 4 inputs or convert everything in bits first and choose the number of inputs according to the numbers of related bits? Considering the 3 types of output (1,-1,0) should I need 3 neurons in my output layer each one representing a specific type of answer or maybe I should train the network to learn seperately each kind of answer (1 for the first network, -1 for the second and 0 for the last one) ? Thank you all in advance for even reading and your help is highly appreciated Stephane
