You focus on "naming", but I would say that the real problem is understanding what principal components mean. You are right: this is an art. It often turns out that they are very difficult to interpret, hence all the attempts (especially in factor analysis literature and practice) to rotate the components/factors in order to achieve "simple structure", i.e. structure that will be easier to interpret (see my answer here ). I don't know where you took your figure from, but this dataset was nicely analyzed in Cosma Shalizi's lecture notes on PCA , and I quote from page 7: This [matrix of eigenvectors] says that all the variables except the gas-mileages have a negative projection on to the first component. This means that there is a negative correlation between mileage and everything else. The first principal component tells us about whether we are getting a big, expensive gas-guzzling car with a powerful engine, or whether we are getting a small, cheap, fuel-efficient car with a wimpy engine. The second component is a little more interesting. Engine size and gas mileage hardly project on to it at all. Instead we have a contrast between the physical size of the car (positive projection) and the price and horsepower. Basically, this axis separates mini-vans, trucks and SUVs (big, not so expensive, not so much horse-power) from sports-cars (small, expensive, lots of horse-power). Once you understood that, you can look for good names.
