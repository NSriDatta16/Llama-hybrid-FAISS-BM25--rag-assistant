First of all, what do you mean, you have 10 panels? Are they unrelated datasets? Does this mean that you have more than one dependent variable? If you have only one dependent variable, you do not need to consider SUR. If you have several time series, and assume that error terms may be correlated, take a look at seemingly unrelated time series equations. http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1391754?uid=3737528&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21106874145663
