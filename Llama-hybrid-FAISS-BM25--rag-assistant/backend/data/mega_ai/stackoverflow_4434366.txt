I once attended a Q&A session on UML and MDA in embedded systems where the panel included authors Bruce Powell Douglass and Steven Mellor. Having previously studied and worked on RT-SSADM projects and the Ward-Mellor methodology, I challenged Stephen Mellor on why a new way of software design comes along every 10 years before practitioners have hardly gotten to grips or truly understood the last one. He responded rather too honestly perhaps with " this way I sell more books "! To some extent therefore I suggest that the hype surrounding any particular notation or methodology is driven primarily by CASE tool vendors and publishing houses; often the authors are also employed by the tool vendors and have titles like "Chief Evangelist". That is not to say that these tools have no value; we should all be wary of such marketing, but on the other hand we also need to communicate our ideas and designs in an unambiguous and clear manner, and using a defined notation however inelegant, will always be better than some ad-hoc "sticks and boxes" notation that has no definitive semantics. Given that need for communication, UML (and derivatives such as SysML) is currently the most widely accepted and used notation, and currently enjoys the widest tool support. It differs from much that has gone before by being defined as a standard agreed by multiple parties rather the work on a single author or CASE tool vendor, so it is likely to develop rather than disappear.
