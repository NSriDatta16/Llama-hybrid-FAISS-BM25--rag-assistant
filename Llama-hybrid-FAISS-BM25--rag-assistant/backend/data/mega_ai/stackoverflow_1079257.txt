The discussion about the Scrum Master role starts with the word Master. From my point of view we need to understand the difference between Scrum implementation/transition and taking care of Scrum in an environment where Scrum is already running. Everybody can become a Scrum Master by attending a course. The certification is NOT an indication of experience or know how regarding agile processes. A good Scrum Master will take care of the Scrum Flow in an Scrum Environment. He will coach the team and takes care that the team can work undisturbed. But this does not mean, that he can train and teach the team the PO and everybody else how to do Scrum... To implement Scrum in an organisation or team it needs experiences on overall processes and strategic thinking. If you have a look at the Scrum Alliance Website you will find the descriptions of the certifications, and what one have to know and prove before getting the certification. There is much to learn for a "Certified Scrum Master" before he will be a Certified Scrum Coach If Scrum fails not because of Scrum, but because people THINK they do Scrum ;-) Doro
