Thomas Russell First of all it is very interesting problem to solve. I think you should not merge features extracted from CNN and other variables. You can try training CNN end-to-end for predicting class scores and train a Neural Network using other variables for predicting class scores and then some how merge both predictions(e.g. take mean) for final prediction. But the performance of this strategy also depend also on how you normalize inputs and design your networks?
