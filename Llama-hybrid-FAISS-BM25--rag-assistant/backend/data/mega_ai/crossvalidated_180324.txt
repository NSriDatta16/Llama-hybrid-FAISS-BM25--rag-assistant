Creating composite index using PCA from time series

I would like to create a composite indicator and to do prediction on this one. Probably I will use ARIMA or another model for this prediction. I need to create this composite index combining 6 variables and I would like to use PCA and factor analysis in order to create the weights of each variable. Iâ€™ve got time series of 6 variables (for 400 records) and I would like to create a composite indicator. I know how to create this composite index using a particular point in time of my time series (with PCA and FA) but my question is: how can I create my composite index using PCA and FA taking into account that I have time series of my 6 variables?
