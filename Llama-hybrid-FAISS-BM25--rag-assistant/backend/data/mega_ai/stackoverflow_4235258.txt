How to control memory usage and time of execution of a thread in .Net/mono?

I want to provide a way to upload plugins (assemblies) to a site by users for a scripting propose. Through mono.cecil I can analyse those assemblies and limit access only to a predefined list of functions, but I also need to limit memory usage, execution time and kill the thread if it goes to overdraft this resources. I think I can monitor the memory usage by the profiler api, but as I know there are no tools to abort thread with guarantee. Is there any way to abort thread with guarantee? Maybe I should run code using embedding mono and control the execution of thread in native part of an application, is it possible?
