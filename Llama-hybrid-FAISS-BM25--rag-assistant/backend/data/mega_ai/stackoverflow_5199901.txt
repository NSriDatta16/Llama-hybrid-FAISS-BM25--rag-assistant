How to sort an associative array by its values in Javascript?

I have the associative array: array["sub2"] = 1; array["sub0"] = -1; array["sub1"] = 0; array["sub3"] = 1; array["sub4"] = 0; What is the most elegant way to sort (descending) by its values where the result would be an array with the respective indices in this order: sub2, sub3, sub1, sub4, sub0
