Persistent collections and entities represent the current state; they can't have just a part of that (think about it: if they did, how would NH track changes?) So, in both cases, the answer is queries and DTOs. You can easily retrieve the data you need with HQL: class EmployeeNameAndBirthDay { public string Name { get; set; } public DateTime Birthday { get; set; } } public IList GetTopEmployees(Company company) { return session.CreateQuery(@" select Name as Name, Birthday as Birthday from Employee where Company = :company order by Birthday desc ") .SetParameter("company", company) .SetMaxResults(10) .SetResultTransformer( Transformers.AliasToBean ()) .List (); }
