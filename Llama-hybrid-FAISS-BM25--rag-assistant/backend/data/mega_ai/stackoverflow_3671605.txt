Okay, so what you want to do is build a sine wave that goes between 0 and 200, but with what period? Did you want it to loop about every 8 calls? How about this, leveraging the built-in Java Math.sin function: private static final double PERIOD = 8; // loop every 8 calls to updateNumber private static final double SCALE = 200; // go between 0 and this private int _pos = 0; private int Number1 = 0; public void updateNumber() { _pos++; Number1 = (int)(Math.sin(_pos*2*Math.PI/PERIOD)*(SCALE/2) + (SCALE/2)); } Basically, we keep a variable that counts how many updates we've done, and scale that to match the period of a sine wave, 2*PI. That acts as the input to the 'real' sin function, giving us something that goes between -1 and 1 but has the right frequency. Then, to actually set the number, we just scale that to be between -100 and 100 and then add 100 to move it to be in the 0-200 range you wanted from the beginning. (You don't have to cast the number to an int if a double works for you, I was just keeping with the spirit of what you wrote above.)
