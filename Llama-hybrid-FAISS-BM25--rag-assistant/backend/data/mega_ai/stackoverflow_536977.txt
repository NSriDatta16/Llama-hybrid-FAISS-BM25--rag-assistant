To clarify the other posters comments. There is no "direct" negative performance impact when using cross database access via stored procedures. Performance will be determined by the underlying architecture of the individual databases, i.e. indexes available, physical storage locations etc. This is actually quite a common practice and so long as you follow standard query tuning principals you will be just fine.
