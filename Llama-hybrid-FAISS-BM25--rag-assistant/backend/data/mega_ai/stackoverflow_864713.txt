Is it possible to use JSTL to display a date in the client's timezone?

In Javascript, I have this function to display the current date on our page header: var today = new Date(); document.write(today.toLocaleDateString()); I would like to do this via JSTL, but I'm not sure if it's possible. So far, I have this fragment of code: Because the date is now being created on the server, it may not represent the client's date. I believe that I can set the timeZone attribute of the formatDate function, but I'm unsure how to grab the client's timezone. Can somebody offer a suggestion? Thanks!
