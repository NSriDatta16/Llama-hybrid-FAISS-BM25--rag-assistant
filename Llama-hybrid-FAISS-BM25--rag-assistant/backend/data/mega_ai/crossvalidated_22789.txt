What you could do is test whether some features have significantly more trues than others (or than the average). This would be Pearson’s Chi-Squared test or Fisher’s exact test. Edit: Note that this approach somewhat contradicts your initial question, as it constructs a comparator. However, the very idea of a statistical test requires comparison.
