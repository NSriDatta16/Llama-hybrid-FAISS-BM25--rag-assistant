I don't believe it is any specific kind of animal, in the sense that probabilities and odds are specific kinds of things. I think its just a number. (I'll admit that this doesn't seem like much of an answer, but I don't think there's anything more to it than that.) Edit: I may still be misreading this, but let me note that w is not a log-odds, it is just some number that is adjusted throughout the training of the neural network to optimize the network's predictive accuracy. It could be anything. In your setup, xw is treated as though it were a log odds, in the sense that xw is passed through the logistic / inverse logit function. Then, y becomes a number that is like a probability in the sense that it now varies within the interval $(0,\ 1)$. For completeness, if we are moving from the input layer to the hidden layer, x could be any number as well (in many machine learning contexts, x is a binary feature indicator— 0/1 —but it could be a continuous value). If we are moving from the hidden layer to the output layer, your new x is your old y , so it can be thought of as analogous to a probability.
