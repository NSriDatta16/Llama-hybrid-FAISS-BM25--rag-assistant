How to consume a webservice using excel?

Possible Duplicate: Call web service in excel Hi, I have a wsdl-based webservice running on my intranet with some important organizational data that is constantly being updated. I have excel reports generated from some software we have running here. I would like to be able to consume the webservice using excel and to receive a specific dataset in one of my worksheets. Is this possible? How can it be done? Thanks in advance,
