How to do statistical test for the difference between two very small proportions?

I have a typical A/B test setup where I have a control and treatment sample of equal size with very small success proportions. An example could be the following data with a sample size of 505000, where the average of Y, $\bar{Y}$ is the variable of interest: $$ \begin{array}{c|lcr} Y & \text{Control} & \text{Treatment} \\ \hline 0 & 500000 & 499000 \\ 1 & 5000 & 6000 \end{array} $$ So $\bar{Y}_{control}=0.01$ and $\bar{Y}_{treatment}= 0.01202405$ . What are the tests you can use for $\bar{Y}_{control}$ being significantly different from $\bar{Y}_{treatment}$ ? I've read about the chi-square test for equality of two proportions and the Z-test, which are supposedly exactly the same ( What is the relationship between a chi squared test and test of equal proportions? ). I've also had people suggest binomial tests to me as 'tests relying on normal distributions won't work due to the fact that the proportions are very close to zero, which means that the confidence intervals won't be symmetric'.
