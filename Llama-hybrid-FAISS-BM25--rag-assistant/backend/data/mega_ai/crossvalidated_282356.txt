Dickey-Fuller test asymptotic distribution

In Shumway & Stoffer, Time Series Analysis and Its Applications , it is argued in Section 5.3 that the limiting random variable for the Dickey-Fuller test statistic is $$ \frac{\chi_1^2 - 1}{2(\int_0^1 W^2(t) \, d t)},$$ where $\chi_1^2$ is a Chi-Square distributed rv with one degree of freedom, and $W$ is a standard Brownion motion; see Eq (5.32). However, at first sight in the derivation of this result the authors assume (or at least suggest) independence of numerator and denominator, which is not discussed in any detail. Does anybody know if the above expression is indeed correct for the Dickey-Fuller test statistic, and whether $\chi_1^2$ and $(W(t))$ can be assumed to be independent?
