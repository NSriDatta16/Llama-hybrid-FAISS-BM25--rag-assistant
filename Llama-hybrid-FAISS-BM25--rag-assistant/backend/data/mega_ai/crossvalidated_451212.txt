By having separate linear models for each action, you are not enabling generalization between actions. This can be a problem if actions are ordered in some sense. For example, if the task is spam classification and your actions are degrees of belief (A = {Very unlikely, unlikely, neutral, likely, very likely}). It seems more common to enable this generalization by default, and have a single linear model. The contextual bandits chapter in [1] considers a single linear model for all actions in EXP4. I believe having separate linear models for each action is actually to make the analysis of confidence bound algorithms easier (see for example, https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09127 ). I have also seen separate models for each action in the Bayesian DQN literature ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04412.pdf ). To answer your second question, I am not aware of a study that contrasts both approaches. I would certainly expect that a single linear model would be better in general, since it contains separate linear models as a special case. [1] Lattimore, T., & Szepesv\'ari, Csaba (2018).
