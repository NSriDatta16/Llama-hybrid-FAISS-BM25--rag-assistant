Your proposed general approach - using latent partitions to assign different data points to different base classifiers - is a well-researched approach toward classification. The reason these methods are not widely used is likely because they are relatively complicated and have longer running times than logistic regression or SVMs. In many cases, it seems that they can lead to better classification performance.
