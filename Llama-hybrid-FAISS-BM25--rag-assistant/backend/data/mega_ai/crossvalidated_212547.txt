Non-linear terms in logistic regression?

I have a data set with binary response and several numerical and categorical predictors. I'm looking for ways to test if some of the numerical predictors are non-linear. I've read about lowess and wondering if it would make sense to do the following for each numerical predictors: plot(x,predict(loess(y~x))) If so how do I interpret the plot? If it's a straight line it's linear and quadratic if not?
