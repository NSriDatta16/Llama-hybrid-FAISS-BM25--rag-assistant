Two step regression - should we account for 'consumed' degrees of freedom?

One approach to determine whether the relationship between an exposure (x) and outcome (y) is linear is to use a flexible model with smoothing spline terms, such as a generalized additive model (GAM). These GAMs often reveal that the functional relationship between variables is approximately linear. In this case, one could go on to fit a regular linear regression model to access regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals. The process is then 1) fit a GAM 2) if the GAM supports linearity, refit the model using a standard linear regression model to access coefficients (and 95% CIs). I'm not sure if there are problems with this approach. In particular: Will the 95% CI's and p values from the linear model have appropriate frequentist coverage properties, seeing as we've used the data itself to identify the appropriate model? Should we/can we account for the degrees of freedom consumed by the GAM model in the subsequent linear regression model?
