The difficulty with the Poisson is that it is defined on the integers; you're dealing with a fraction between 0 and 1. If you have percentages, presumably you have the numerator and the denominator of that percentage, in which case you might normally look at something more like logistic regression. This then suggests that a corresponding zero-inflated model would be zero-inflated binomial.
