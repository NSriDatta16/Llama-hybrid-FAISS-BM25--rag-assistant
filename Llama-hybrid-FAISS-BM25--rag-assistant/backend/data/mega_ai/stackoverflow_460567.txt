How to mix java webstart with RMI?

I want to distribute a webstart application which uses RMI. I want to avoid to ask the user the address of the RMI server, because the website that distributes the application is also the RMI server. Furthermore, I don't know the address of the server at build time, therefore the address must be added with ad hoc configuration to the JNLP, or the address must be provided at execution time. This is the preferred way: is it possible to do so?
