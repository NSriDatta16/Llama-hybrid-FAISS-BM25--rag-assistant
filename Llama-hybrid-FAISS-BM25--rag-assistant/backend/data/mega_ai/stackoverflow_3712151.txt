UDP IP Fragmentation and MTU

I'm trying to understand some behavior I'm seeing in the context of sending UDP packets. I have two little Java programs: one that transmits UDP packets, and the other that receives them. I'm running them locally on my network between two computers that are connected via a single switch. The MTU setting (reported by /sbin/ifconfig) is 1500 on both network adapters. If I send packets with a size If I send packets with 1500 If I send packets with size > 24258, they are lost. Not Expected. When I run wireshark on the receiving side, I don't see any of these packets. I was able to see similar behavior with ping -s. ping -s 24258 hostA works but ping -s 24259 hostA fails. Does anyone understand what may be happening, or have ideas of what I should be looking for? Both computers are running CentOS 5 64-bit. I'm using a 1.6 JDK, but I don't really think it's a programming problem, it's a networking or maybe OS problem.
