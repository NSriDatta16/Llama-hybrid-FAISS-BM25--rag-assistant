@Nick Cox's first comment is completely correct. But you can get around this by using the data differently. I can see several possibilities: First, you could have your second plot but, rather than the sum over the month, you could look at the average per day. That would deal directly with the problem Nick identifies. Second, if you have the data for each day (which it seems like you do) you could graph that, along with a smooth curve. Third, if your goal is to model gas usage, rather than just display it, you could explore regression models and include relevant covariates (which would depend on whether the gas you are talking about is gasoline for a car, gas to heat your home, gas for cooking or something else).
