Keep storing this data (storage is cheap and relatively scalable, if you don't have to access it). Aggregate what is interesting for you. Once you know which statistics are interesting for you, you can generate these incrementally using aggregates of the minimum time span of interest. To take a simple example: if you are interested in the total sales count for an item, but only on a yearly basis, you can aggregate "sales in 2010", "sales in 2009". Work with these aggregates whenever possible. Still, using the original data, you can generate new aggregates if you discover that another metric becomes interesting.
