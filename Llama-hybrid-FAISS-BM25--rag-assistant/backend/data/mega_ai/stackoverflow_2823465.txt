Python module shared between multiple products

I'm working on a python class that is being shared between two products. 90% of the functionality applies to both products. For the 10% that's different the code is littered with this kind of thing: #Start of file project = 'B' #Some line of code if project == 'A': import moduleA elif project == 'B': import moduleB #Many lines of code if project == 'A': print moduleA.doA(2) elif project == 'B': print moduleB.doB(2) This doesn't seem very elegant or very readable, has anyone encountered this sort of thing before? Are there better ways of doing it?
