Check out the article and accompanying sample script to handle this task at SQL Fool (Michelle Ufford's website): http://sqlfool.com/2009/06/index-defrag-script-v30/ This is quite a nice solution to handle this once and for all! The best practice recommendation is to reorganize your index if you have 5-30% of fragmentation, and only rebuild it if it has more than 30% fragmentation. You can easily use these thresholds or specify your own using this script. Marc
