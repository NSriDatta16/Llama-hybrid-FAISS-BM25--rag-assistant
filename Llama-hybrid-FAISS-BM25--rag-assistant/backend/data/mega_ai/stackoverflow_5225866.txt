It is even possible that an ConcurrentModificationException is thrown, when you remove different objects. That depends on the implementation of the Set you are using: The remove() method may iterate over the set. Or worse: It may modifies some other internal variables and leave the set in an inconsistent state without throwing any exception. There is a really easy solution: Set safeSet = Collections.synchronizedSet(set); You still need to pay attention if you want to iterate over it, as described in the apidoc: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#synchronizedSet%28java.util.Set%29 but all the other methods (including remove) are fine.
