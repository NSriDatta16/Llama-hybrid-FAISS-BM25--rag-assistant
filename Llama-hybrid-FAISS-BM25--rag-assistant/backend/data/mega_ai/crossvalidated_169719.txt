Pixel level classification using deep network

I am new to deep learning and have already got my hands dirty with running deep network on MNIST and CIFAR datasets. Is there a way to directly use deep learning for semantic segmentation of image? Suppose, the training images consist of RGB images and images of their corresponding groundtruth (i.e. pixel level annotation). If I want the network to directly classify a pixel as one of the N classes (say), what should be the network architecture ?
