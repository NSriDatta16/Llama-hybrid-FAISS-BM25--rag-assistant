Which version of flexmojos should be used?

Recently I reorganized my Adobe AIR project as a maven project so I could hook into my continuous integration server. Most of the information I found to get it working came from various blogs, which seems to be the only way to go as far as flex stuff is concerned. When I was deciding which super-pom to inherit from, though, I found that there are a bunch of different flexmojos super-poms that different people are using. Here are a few that I found (with each of these in use by some examples in the wild) org.sonatype.flexmojos (this is the one I used) info.flex-mojos info.rvin.mojo What is the difference between the various super-poms and which is the de facto standard?
