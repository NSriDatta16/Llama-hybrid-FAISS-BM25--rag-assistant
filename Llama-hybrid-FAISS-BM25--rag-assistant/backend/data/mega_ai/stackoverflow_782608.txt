I always use SetDiBitsToDevice, but drawDIBits could be okay as well (haven't checked). As for the upside-down nature of the windows blit functions: There is a workaround. If you pass a BITMAPINFOHEADER or BITMAPINFO structure to the function just negate the value in the bitmap-height member. This will tell GDI to do the blit as if the height would be positive, but interpret the data as beeing stored in a top-down order. You may get a nice speed improvement by this "hack" as well. If you want to shuffle the byte-order of the pixels (e.g. turn ARGB into BGRA or so) you can use the BITMAPV4HEADER structure and tell GDI how your pixel-data is organized. That's a functionality that is rarely used but works since WIN98. I'd say it's save to use it these days..
