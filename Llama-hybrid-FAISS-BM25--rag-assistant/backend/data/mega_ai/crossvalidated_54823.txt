Applying Recency In Logistic Regression

Are there any statistical concepts or theories on how to effectively measure recency to where recent events are given more weight than older ones. I'm creating a logistic regression model and would like to apply an adjustment to various factors based on the events recency. ...or, is it purely up to me to come up with an arbitrary formula? For example: One of my projects is predicting via logistic regression the performance of pro golfers in upcoming tournaments. Their recent form (how they played last week) is generally more important than how they played six months ago. Are there any specific techniques/approaches that tap into this concept?
