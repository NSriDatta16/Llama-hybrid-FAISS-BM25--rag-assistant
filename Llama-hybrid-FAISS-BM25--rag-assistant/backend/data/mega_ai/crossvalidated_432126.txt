Based on your problem description, you are supposed to build a time series model for each student. Only 3-5 historical data might be not sufficient to build "fancy" models such as ARIMA or LSTM etc. Try plot the scores in Excel (x axis is date and y axis is score) and see if you can find some clear trends: going better, going worse, fluctuating or staying the same. Then you will have a rough judgement of the next score at a specific time.
