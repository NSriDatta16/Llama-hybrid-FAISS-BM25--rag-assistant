AVG() function always returning "Array"

This is what I got, UPDATED $avg_query = "SELECT AVG(rating) AS avg_rating FROM kicks WHERE userid = '$userid'"; $avg_result = mysqli_query($cxn, $avg_query) or die("Couldn't execute query."); $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($avg_result); $average = $row['avg_rating']; Every time I echo it out, it always returns array. Never used this function before, but i don't understand why it would do that.
