Calculating amount of months between dates

How would you go about calculating the amount of months between two arbitrary dates? Given that even if just one day falls on a month, it is considered a full month. Examples: 2010-01-01 - 2010-03-31 = three months 2010-06-15 - 2010-09-01 = four months Et cetera. I thought of just dividing the difference of timestamps with 2592000 (average number of seconds in a month) but that seems hacky and prone to errors. And I'd like to keep it as fast as possible (needs to run thousands of times quick), so I guess using strtotime isn't optimal either?
