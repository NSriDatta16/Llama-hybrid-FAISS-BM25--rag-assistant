The standard deviation is quantity we compute for a GROUP of observations, with respect to a particular variable. It tells us how far, "on average" each observation's value for that variable in the group is from the overall average for that variable. So a group of 1,000 people might have an average "activity" score of 3.5. Of course, that is just an average, some people in the group are going to have more or less activity than that. The standard deviation tells us how "tightly" these values are clustered around the overall average. If the standard deviation of activity for this group was 0.5, that tells us the average person in this group has a score that is 0.5 points higher or lower than 3.5. The standard error is a modification of the standard error which is used in calculating various statistical measures of uncertainty. For this reason, it doesn't make sense to calculate a standard deviation (or standard error) for a single observation. As the comments mentioned, in the table provided each row represents a single type of observation, with a particular set of characteristics. And the table includes the "N" (number of observations) in each group, which allows you to calculate the standard deviation (and standard error) for each group.
