The way ASP.NET is structured, you shouldn't really need to do this. Code is compiled, so all of your classes and functions should be accessible simply by referencing the relevant assembly or namespace, without having to include individual code files. You might be looking for user controls, which allow you to create fragments of markup with their corresponding code behind, and then reference these in your page.
