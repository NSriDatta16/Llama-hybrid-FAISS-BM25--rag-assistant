visual studio 2010 beta 1 slow? on 64bits/windows7

I have visual studios 10 beta installed on my windows 7 64bit laptop with 4gb and dual cores. I notice while developing ASP.NET app going to a page can be slow. After loading the first page it can take 3.5 seconds average to load the following pages. That shouldnt be. The same webapp on XP, 32bits, 512mb, single core visual studios 9 is fast enough for me not to notice the length of time. (both pcs are intel processors) I wanted to know if i should switch back to MSVS 9? if theres an option i can change in my project? or OS to make it perform better or if theres anything i could do at all. -edit- msvs9 is faster but not as much. I wonder why performance is worse when this pc has better specs.
