The order of the attributes selected is negligible. The underlying storage engines surely order their attribute locations, but you would not necessarily have a way to know the specific ordering (renames, alter tables, row vs. column stores) in most cases may be independent from the table description which is just meta data anyway. The order of presentation into the result set would be insignificant in terms of any measurable overhead.
