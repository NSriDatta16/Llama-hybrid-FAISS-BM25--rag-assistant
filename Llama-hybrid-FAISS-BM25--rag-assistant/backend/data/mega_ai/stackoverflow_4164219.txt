Flex shader effects: render one object into another

I want to make such effect: draggable semi-transparent object (let's call it 'plastic strip') over window with arbitrary objects. Plastic strip should be turbid, i.e. it blurs content under it (not blurred itself). What's the best way to do that with PixelBender shader on Flex?
