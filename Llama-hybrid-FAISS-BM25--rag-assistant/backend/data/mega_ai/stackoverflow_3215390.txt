ClientLogin is not the preferred mechanism here because your application is forced to handle the login credentials for the user. If the user's identity needs to be established for longer than a session, you'll be forced to store the credentials and this is non ideal -- compromise of your server would lead to the compromise fo Google users. Thus ClientLogin is not the right approach for your application. Have you looked at Google OAuth ? It solves the password handling problem pretty elegantly and is an established standard.
