Unfortunately, harmless seeming priors can be very dangerous (and have even fooled some seasoned Bayesians). This recent paper, provides a nice introduction along with plotting methods to visualize the prior and posterior (usually marginal priors/posterior for the parameter(s) of interest). Hidden Dangers of Specifying Noninformative Priors. John W. Seaman III, John W. Seaman Jr. & James D. Stamey The American StatisticianVolume 66, Issue 2, May 2012, pages 77-84. http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2012.695938 Such plots in my opinion should be obligatory in any actual Bayesian analysis, even if the analyst does not need them â€“ what is happening in a Bayesian analysis should be made clear for most readers.
