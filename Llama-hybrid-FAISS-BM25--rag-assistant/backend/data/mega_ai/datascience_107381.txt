Square error is calculated the same way, no matter how you fit a model (OLS, random forest, deep learning, or guessing like you are doing). $$ \sum_{i=1}^n\bigg( Y_{true, i}-Y_{predicted, i} \bigg)^2 $$ Divide by the sample size if you want an average. If you want to automate this task for a computer to do it, calculate the slope and intercept of your guesses line of best fit. Pick two points on your line, $(x_0,y_0)$ and $(x_1,y_1)$ . $$ y-y_0 = \dfrac{ y_1-y_0 }{ x_1-x_0 } \bigg( x-x_0 \bigg) $$ When you do the algebra to solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ , you will have the equation for the line youâ€™ve fitted by eyeballing it. You then can use this to make predictions to feed into the square error formula.
