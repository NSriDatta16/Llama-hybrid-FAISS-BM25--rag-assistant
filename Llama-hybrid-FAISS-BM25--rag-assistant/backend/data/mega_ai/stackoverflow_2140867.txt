html5 offline storage prepared db

I'm trying to write an iphone web app displaying info from a small ish database while offline. Is it possible to prepare a db and download that rather than downloading the data in some other format and creating it on first use? if i have to create db, what would be a good format (is there eg compressed xml?) to send data? is there a maximum storage limit for local dbs?
