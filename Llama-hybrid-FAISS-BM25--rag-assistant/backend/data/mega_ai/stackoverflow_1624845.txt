Detecting Drop Event in Input (Text) using Javascript

Atleast defining my problem is simple... I have a Input control (Text) and a javascript function, which truncates the Text in the input control to 15 characters. ie if the length exceeds the limit, left(text,15) is set back to the control. This is handled through onkeyup event... Now, when user drag and drops the text directly into the Input control, the event is not fired as no keyboard is involved. In that case, which event fires... or how do I execute the javascript function in that scenario.
