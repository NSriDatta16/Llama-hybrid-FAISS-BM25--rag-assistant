I don't have much to contribute as I also have the same question/doubt but your approach make sense to me. Would love to see more comments on this thread. However, I was contemplating on using a simple approach : Compare performance of algorithm on test data w/o any special hyperparameter configuration Choose the best performing algorithm. Further fine tune hyperparameters using CV method I am referring to approach mentioned in this article : https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-evaluate-machine-learning-algorithms/ When starting with a problem and having defined a test harness you are happy with, it is time to spot check a variety of machine learning algorithms. Spot checking is useful because it allows you to very quickly see if there is any learnable structures in the data and estimate which algorithms may be effective on the problem. Select 5-10 standard algorithms that are appropriate for your problem and run them through your test harness. By standard algorithms, I mean popular methods no special configurations. Appropriate for your problem means that the algorithms can handle regression if you have a regression problem
