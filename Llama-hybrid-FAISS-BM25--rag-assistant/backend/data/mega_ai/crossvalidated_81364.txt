Star Coordinates vs. principal component analysis

I currently preparing a presentation for a university course in "Visual Data analysis". And one of my topics is the "Star Coordinate" visualization. Star Coordinates As Star Coordinates perform a transformation of high-dimensional data, and the well known PCA technique does so too, I wonder whether PCA can be mimicked by Star Coordinates? I think of rearranging the coordinate axes in a way that they represent a linear combination of the original variables? But this is only an idea. Can someone confirm or disprove this?
