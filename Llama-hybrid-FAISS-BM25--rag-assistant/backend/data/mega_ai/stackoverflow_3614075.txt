Why is my code stopping?

Hey I've encountered an issue where my program stops iterating through the file at the 57802 record for some reason I cannot figure out. I put a heartbeat section in so I would be able to see which line it is on and it helped but now I am stuck as to why it stops here. I thought it was a memory issue but I just ran it on my 6GB memory computer and it still stopped. Is there a better way to do anything I am doing below? My goal is to read the file (if you need me to send it to you I can 15MB text log) find a match based on the regex expression and print the matching line. More to come but that's as far as I have gotten. I am using python 2.6 Any ideas would help and code comments also! I am a python noob and am still learning. import sys, os, os.path, operator import re, time, fileinput infile = os.path.join("C:\\","Python26","Scripts","stdout.log") start = time.clock() filename = open(infile,"r") match = re.compile(r'(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}),\d{3} +\w+ +\[([\w.]+)\] ((\w+).?)+:\d+ - (\w+)_SEARCH:(.+)') count = 0 heartbeat = 0 for line in filename: heartbeat = heartbeat + 1 print heartbeat lookup = match.search(line) if lookup: count = count + 1 print line end = time.clock() elapsed = end-start print "Finished processing at:",elapsed,"secs. Count of records =",count,"." filename.close() This is line 57802 where it fails: 2010-08-06 08:15:15,390 DEBUG [ah_admin] com.thg.struts2.SecurityInterceptor.intercept:46 - Action not SecurityAware; skipping privilege check.
