Testing a linear restriction on coefficients of a logistic regression (in SPSS)

I have a logistic regression model $$ P(Y=1|X_1,X_2,X_3)=\frac{1}{1+\exp[-(\beta_0+\beta_1 X_1+\beta_2 X_2+\beta_3 X_3)]}. $$ I would like to test a null hypothesis $H_0\colon \beta_2=c\beta_1$ . However, I am not sure how to do this using SPSS. Therefore, I have an idea to reformulate the model as follows: $$ P(Y=1|X_1,X_2,X_3)=\frac{1}{1+\exp[-(\beta_0+\gamma_1 Z_1+\gamma_2 X_2+\gamma_3 X_3)]} $$ where $Z_1:=X_1+cX_2$ and then test $H_0\colon \gamma_2=0$ instead (which I know how to do using SPSS). Is this reformulation valid, i.e. am I still testing the hypothesis I am after, or am I fooling myself? And if I am, how else can I solve this problem? (I know that asking for SPSS code or instructions is off topic, so I am not doing that. But it would be extra nice if you included some hints of that in your answer in addition to answering my direct question.)
