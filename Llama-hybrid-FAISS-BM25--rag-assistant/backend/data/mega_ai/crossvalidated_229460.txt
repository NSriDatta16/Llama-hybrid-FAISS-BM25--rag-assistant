First, it is important to note that you are not talking about the complexity of the model, but the complexity of the relation between X and Y, which has nothing to do with modelling. When we try to figure out such relations, we use models, which typically involve some kind of assumptions, etc. in order to track down that relationship. but there is an inherent difference between the complexity of the underlying relationship and the complexity of a model. Given that, there is always a tradeoff between model complexity (in some intuitive sense) and model accuracy. when there is underlying complex relationship we try to model, the simpler the model is, the less accurate are its prediction likely to be. So the underlying relationship complexity is in some sense the "sum" of actual model complexity and its lack of fit. I think that the AIC measure is an attempt to capture such complexity (that takes into account both inaccuracy and the model's "degrees of freedom" so to speak. I use it often to compare models that fall under common "strategies" even if they do not contain the same variables (e.g. two logistic regressions with the same response, but with different set of predictors), but tend to find it less useful/reliable comparing models of different nature. Second, the example you bring about the circle, emphasize the importance of feature representation and two different sources of "complexity". after all, with a simple polar transformation, the circle with fixed radius become analogous to your first example. so what is worse? another explanatory variable or a transformation on an existing one? and is sin(x) is more complex that x^2 as transformations? This is to emphasize how "measure of complexity" is totally dependent on the context. you must have some kind of a "loss function" that will quantify/penalize you for any "step" you do in order to get from X to Y. and this function is unlikely to have universal features. it is context specific. I know this is not the kind of answer that you expected (sorry), But I do think there is no hope for the expectation you expressed in your question. HTH
