Error: Retrieval of mergeinfo unsupported by 'svn://IP.Address'?

I am trying to merge a Branch to Trunk using the TSVN 'Reintegrate a branch' feature. However I get the following error. Error: Retrieval of mergeinfo unsupported by 'svn://IP.Address'? What is the reason for this error? Also is there some other way to merge the Branch to the Trunk.
