Sorting XML in Groovy

I have looked at the documentation on sorting XML with Groovy def records = new XmlParser().parseText(XmlExamples.CAR_RECORDS) assert ['Royale', 'P50', 'HSV Maloo'] == records.car.sort{ it.'@year'.toInteger() }.'@name' but what I am trying to do is sort the XML and then return the xml string sorted. I know I can completely rebuild the XML after i am done sorting. I know I can run an XML Transformation on the XML to get it sorted def factory = TransformerFactory.newInstance() def transformer = factory.newTransformer(new StreamSource(new StringReader(xslt))) transformer.transform(new StreamSource(new StringReader(input)), new StreamResult(System.out)) BUT I was looking for some Groovy magic to make it easier for me
