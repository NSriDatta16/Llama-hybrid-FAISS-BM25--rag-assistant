Best practices for reducing/clustering data which is location/time based?

I have event-based data (or longitudinal data ) which has a person's age, gender, location (zipcode etc.), the datetime when they saw something, and how long they watched it. I have a project requirement to reduce the number of dimensions ( PCA or t-SNE ) and cluster the data ( k-means probably). However, I'm wondering if clustering becomes meaningless since the data is tied to a location, and changes over time? It's been suggested to aggregate the data using an average of the durations. I'm not convinced that's a good idea either. Can anyone explain the best practices for clustering this type of data? Or, confirm/deny my suspicions? Thanks! Disclaimer: I have a background in Computer Science not Statistics.
