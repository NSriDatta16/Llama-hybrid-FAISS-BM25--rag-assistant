Can I use Item Parcelling in Confirmatory Factor Analysis

I am conducting a CFA with Lisrel, I have sample of 127 participants and 19 items with 4-point Likert scales that should load on 3 factors. I have a very bad CFA fits :( I went back to EFA to learn about the structure (with a different sample of 169 subjects). EFA results clearly suggested an oblique three-factor solution, and also the parallel analysis method confirmed the three-factor structure. The CFA factor loadings are highly significant, but not the overall fit. I have also tried alternative solutions (one-factor, two factors, and orthogonal three-factor model) with worst fits. Now my question is: Can I use the item parceling approach? I have created 4 parcels for the first latent factor, 3 parcels for the second factor, and 2 parcels for the third factor, by randomly averaging two items scores for each parcel. What do you think about it? Thanks, Tiziana
