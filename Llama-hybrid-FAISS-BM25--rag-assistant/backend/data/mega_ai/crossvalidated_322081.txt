Suppose you have probabilities: 0.45 0.45 0.90 Then hard voting would give you a score of 1/3 (1 vote in favour and 2 against), so it would classify as a "negative". Soft voting would give you the average of the probabilities, which is 0.6, and would be a "positive". Soft voting takes into account how certain each voter is, rather than just a binary input from the voter.
