How to manage project tasks in SVN and developer resources?

I have a task assigned to me but I am not a project manager. Doh. So here is the problem. Imagine that you have 100 tasks which should be done in 1 year. So we want to do 5 or six releases during this year. Our team is small, about 10 people. Now we go trough all the tasks and mark 15 of them for example to be released in 2 months. But 1 developer is ready with his tasks 1 month ahead and he has no tasks until we release. We use SVN and currently we work in the trunk. How you suppose to organize our SVN repository? We want the developer who finished his tasks to start working on tasks for the next release. If we create a branch for each release and work there (trunk is only a result of merging with branches) is something like suicide. Can you give me suggestions. Thanks
