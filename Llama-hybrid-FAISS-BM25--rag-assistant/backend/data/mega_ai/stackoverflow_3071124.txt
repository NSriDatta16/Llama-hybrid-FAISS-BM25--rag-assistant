Slow machines are the bane of development, IMHO, especially since any delay gets developers out of concentration and can lead to a much costlier switch to things like web browsers. There can be other weird effects like a how a slight increase in the latency for the Javadoc popup or C# equivalent) to appear when you hover a method and the chances someone would consult the documentation. If legal in your company (at least for self use), record about half an hour of work with a screen capture tool like Camtasia. Then use a fast editor to spot the times the machine was hung (easy if you have a cursor change, progress bar, etc.) and count the time and number of instances. I've done that for hours of tapes - it doesn't take that long. Use these numbers to argue the case, though you need to also argue that it leads to the indirect costs like a context switch. Also, in my experience, hard drives are often the major cause of slowdown, not CPU or RAM, and unfortunately most organizations skimp on fast hard drives or SSDs and have very strict rules about replacing them.
