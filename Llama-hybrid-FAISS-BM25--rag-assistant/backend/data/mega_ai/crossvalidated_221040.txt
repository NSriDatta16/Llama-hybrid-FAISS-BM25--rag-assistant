Wapner's argument is correct! Some comments: Following the described cut-off strategy where we switch envelopes if $x If you add a Bayesian prior (i.e. you add beliefs about the initial distribution of money in the envelopes), you can solve for the optimal value of $d$ given your prior beliefs. In certain situations (eg. where the more you observe, the more likely it is you got the big envelope), a cut-off strategy is even optimal. In a more general Bayesian setting, you can do better than a simple cutoff strategy for many priors. A related but different problem: As several @Glen_b and @whuber have mentioned, there's a related puzzle known as the Two Envelope Problem where a fallacious argument is given for always switching envelopes and the flaw in the argument can be seen by taking a Bayesian approach and adding prior beliefs over the contents of the two envelopes. In some sense though, the puzzle described here is rather different. Wapner's argument is correct!
