In gcc you see warnings about this if you use the -pedantic flag. But this is apparently something that has changed in the standard, in C90 it say: All the expressions in an initializer for an object that has static storage duration or in an initializer list for an object that has aggregate or union type shall be constant expressions and it was not allowed as the p array is an aggregate type, but in C99 we have: All the expressions in an initializer for an object that has static storage duration shall be constant expressions or string literals.
