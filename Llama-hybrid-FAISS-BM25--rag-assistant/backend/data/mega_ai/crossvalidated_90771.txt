Returning the inverse of a matrix in a quadratic program (SVM) in cvx optimization package

I am solving the dual QP of an SVM, and using the RBF kernel. As you know, the objective function is of the form $$f(\alpha) = \alpha^T Q \alpha $$ where $\alpha$ is the optimization variable and $Q$ is some positive semidefinite matrix. When $Q$ is dense, I wish to see what cvx (or any other optimization packages if you can point me to one) uses as $Q^{-1}$ when solving the QP. Any ideas?
