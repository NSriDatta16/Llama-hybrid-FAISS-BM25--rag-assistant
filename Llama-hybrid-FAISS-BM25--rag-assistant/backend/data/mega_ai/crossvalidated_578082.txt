I would start by trying to calculate a set of statistics that would differentiate all these curve types. Some examples of statistics could be: mean, std, min, max, gradient mean/std, number of positive/negative turning points (note these should be specifically chosen to separate out the expected curve types). Then using your statistics as a model input you would try to cluster the results. After which, you would investigate the clusters to check that all the curves are similar (e.g., check the MSE of each curve to the average for the cluster etc.).
