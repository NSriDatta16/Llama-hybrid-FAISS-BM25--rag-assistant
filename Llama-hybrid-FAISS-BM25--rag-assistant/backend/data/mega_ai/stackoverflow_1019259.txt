Serving images is not so much a CPU/storage demand as it is a bandwidth demand. You're unlikely to be able to afford enough bandwidth to serve enough images to bring a server down. A reasonable solution I have seen implemented is using a separate media server, with the base URL configurable within your application or site. That way, you can negotiate a different rate for bandwidth from a different host somewhere else on the internet, without worrying if that host supports the technology you're using to develop your application. ASP.net web hosting tends to be far more expensive than vanilla linux hosting and requires more control over the server environment. Host your ASP.net application with Rich Guy Feature Hosting, LLC and your image server with Destitute Nerd Basic Hosting, Inc. since all it's doing is serving up dumb files. You can also contact content caching providers like Akamai to host and cache your images for you. They distribute your images geographically, so that users get your images from a server physically closer to where they are.
