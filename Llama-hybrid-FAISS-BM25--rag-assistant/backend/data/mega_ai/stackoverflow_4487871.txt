embedding a font in Java

I have a custom font I want to show off in a Java program where the user can view it without having to install it. Does anyone know how to do that? working solution I have implemented the following: font = java.awt.Font.createFont(java.awt.Font.TRUETYPE_FONT, new java.io.File(Clazz.class.getResource("/resources/segoescb.ttf").toURI())); font = font.deriveFont(11.0F);
