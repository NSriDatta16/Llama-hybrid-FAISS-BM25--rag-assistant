onstant comparison of interviews, the researchers identified repeating data patterns across participants and developed an explanatory framework they referred to as the Imperfect Mosaic. The patient experiences were found to echo those previously reported by maternity care professionals, particularly in relation to race and ethnicity in the NHS. A study in Virus Evolution applies co-evolutionary mosaic theory to identify regions—particularly in Southeast Asia and Central Africa—where bat betacoronavirus dynamics heighten the risk of zoonotic emergence. Another application uses the mosaic framework to explain hypertension as resulting from multiple interdependent causes, including salt intake and inflammation. The updated model places dietary salt and immune system inflammation at the center of the mosaic, influencing nearly all other contributing factors to hypertension. This re-frames hypertension as an emergent condition shaped by connected biological systems, rather than a linear sequence of causes. The World Health Organization's 2023 report "Crafting the mosaic": A framework for resilient surveillance for respiratory viruses of epidemic and pandemic potential calls for identifying and securing medium- to long-term resources at national, regional and global levels to underpin its mosaic of complementary surveillance approaches. The report called for all countries to establish mosaics of fit-for-purpose surveillance systems for monitoring of respiratory pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential. Each surveillance approach is framed by the WHO as an individual mosaic tile, that need resiliency improvements globally to handle future public health incidents. Industrial control systems In one of the most cited real-world examples, researchers were able to deduce the internal configuration of Iran's Natanz nuclear enrichment facility using photographs from a 2008 presidential visit and cascade models visible on SCADA displays. Security expert Ralph Langner linked these visual cues to the structure encoded in the Stuxnet malware, illustrating how seemingly innocuous information revealed through images allowed adversaries to reconstruct operational architectures. Privacy The mosaic effect has impacts on privacy. Legal scholars have proposed the mosaic theory as a means of identifying unconstitutional surveillance practices that rely on prolonged data accumulation rather than single intrusions. The risk of identification through the mosaic effect increases as more data becomes available online, particularly when data brokers collect and sell information that can be linked across sources. Privacy protections may be inadequate when public data is recombined in ways that expose sensitive patterns. Mosaicking carries the risk of exposing personally identifiable data, particularly when sensitive datasets are involved. Public reactions to data use often depend more on perceived outcomes than on formal privacy safeguards. Aggregating discrete, publicly available data points can infringe on individual privacy by revealing sensitive personal information that none of the points would disclose in isolation. Seemingly harmless fragments of personal data can, when linked across platforms and time, form these mosaics that exposes detailed insights into an individual's routines, relationships, mental health, and private life well beyond what any single detail would reveal. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime observed that metadata, though often dismissed as non-sensitive in isolation, poses acute privacy risks when accumulated, enabling detailed inferences about individuals' lives through patterns undetectable in any single data point. Paul Rosenzweig of Lawfare analogized the mosaic effect to aggregation that produces exponential informational value, stating "1+1+1 equals 17", to emphasize how seemingly benign data points can yield complex insights when combined. The United Nations' Centre for Humanitarian Data warns that even anonym
