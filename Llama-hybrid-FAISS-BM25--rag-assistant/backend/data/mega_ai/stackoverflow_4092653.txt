If you really mean the ultimate versions of hibernate-annotations (and not hibernate-entitymanager) and ehcache, then you'll need the following: ... org.hibernate hibernate-core 3.6.0.Final net.sf.ehcache ehcache-core 2.2.0 ... repository.jboss.org-public JBoss repository https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public ... As of Hibernate 3.6, JDK 1.4 support has been dropped and the Hibernate Annotations have been merged back into Core. I you meant Hibernate EntityManager, then replace hibernate-core by hibernate-entitymanager in the above snippet. Regarding EHCache, ehcache-core should provide everything you need (including implementations of the "new" Hibernate 3.3/3.5 caching SPI with its CacheRegionFactory ). So, as documented : Setting Ehcache as the Hibernate Second Level Cache Hibernate 3.3 and higher ATTENTION HIBERNATE 3.2 USERS Make sure to note the change to BOTH the property name and value. Use: net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.EhCacheRegionFactory for instance creation, or net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.SingletonEhCacheRegionFactory to force Hibernate to use a singleton of Ehcache CacheManager. Follow-up: To answer your update: sl4j threw errors, which went away by adding (...) Well, I can't guess what logging framework you're using, providing the binding of your choice was left as an exercise for the reader :) There are many instances of this warning (...) I get only one WARNING when running in a non JTA environment. If that's your case (a non JTA environment), I would consider the WARNING as normal. If that's not your case, have a look at the documentation about JTA . Additionally, this error makes everything fail This is somehow a different question (but it looks like the SessionFactory fails to initialize properly, activate logging to see why) and I suggest to post a new spring specific question.
