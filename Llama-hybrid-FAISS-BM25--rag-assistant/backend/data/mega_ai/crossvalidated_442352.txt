What is a latent space?

In the context of machine learning, I often hear the term latent space, sometimes qualified with the word "high dimensional" or "low dimensional" latent space. I am a bit puzzled by this term (as it is almost never defined rigorously). Can someone please provide a definition or motivation to the concept of a latent space ?
