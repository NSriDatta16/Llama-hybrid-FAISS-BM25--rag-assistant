Depending on your SVM implementation , there may be a difference. Compared to the linear kernel, the polynomial kernel has an additional parameter $c$ (and $d$ of course): $K(x,y) = (x^\mathsf{T} y + c)^{d}$ However, if $c=0$ (and $d=1$), then: (linear) $K(x,y) = x^\mathsf{T} y \equiv K(x,y) = (x^\mathsf{T} y + c)^{d}$ (polynomial) Nonetheless, some SVM implementations may opt-out of calculating $c$ and assume homogeneity in order to reduce the number of hyper-parameters. So, it depends on how your SVM is implemented. For example sklearn's polynomial kernel assumes by default $c=1$ if you do not specify the parameter, which would make it not exactly the same as a linear kernel.
