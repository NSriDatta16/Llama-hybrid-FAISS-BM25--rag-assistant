Error message when using lrm() and validate() from the rms package

I do not have a fully reproducible example as I am using proprietary data. Therefore, I am providing here an example that only partially reproduces the problem. I am trying to fit an ordinal logistic regression via lrm() . For instance: TV When I try to test this model through resampling with validate() as follows: validate(lrm.model, B = 200, bw = F) I get an error as a result of the number '8' in the TV column: Error in predab.resample(fit, method = method, fit = lrmfit, measure = discrim, : A training sample has a different number of intercepts (14) than the original model fit (15). You probably fit an ordinal model with sparse cells and a re-sample did not select at least one observation for each value of Y. Add the argument group=y where y is the response variable. This will force balanced sampling on levels of y. So I added group = TV to the validate() function: validate(lrm.model, group = TV, B = 200, bw = F) Which solves the problem. On my actual data, however, I then get another error: Error in predab.resample(fit, method = method, fit = lrmfit, measure = discrim, : object 'TV' not found Do you have any idea what the issue could be?
