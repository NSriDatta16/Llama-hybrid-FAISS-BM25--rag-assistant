For simplicty, denote the dependent variable as $Y$ ( performance ), the matrix of independent observed variables ( hour_of_day , day_of_week ) as $X$ and the matrix of latent variables (Social Networking Potential etc.) as $Z$. Now, as per my understanding, the key idea behind using latent variables is to combine information across users to add strength to the model. Also, you clearly want to have a model that predicts $Y$ based on $X$ only, since you don't observe $Z$. Here is how you can do it: You need a model (probability distribution) for $Y|X,Z$. A simple model could just be a $Y|X,Z \sim N(\beta X+\gamma Z,\sigma^2I)$, where $\beta,\gamma$ are regression coefficient vectors, and $\sigma^2$ is noise variance. You need another model for the latent variable $Z|W$. Here $W$ is the matrix of additional observed variables that could help predict $Z$. For example, the Social Networking Potential of an individual ($Z$) might be influenced by location, age, number of friends and other individual-related factors. Lump all of these factors into $W$. A simple model here might be $Z|W \sim N(\alpha W, \delta^2I)$. The model that predicts $Y$ only based on $X$ is $Y|X$. To obtain this, you need to integrate out $Z$ from the joint density of $Y,Z|X$. Use the fact: $$ f(y|x)=\int f(y,z|x)dz = \int f(y|z,x)f(z|x)dz $$ where the $f(\cdot)$'s generically denote respective probability density functions (slight abuse of notation here). Once you do this, you technically have a predictive model. Now, to make it good, you probably have to use something more sophisticated than the simple normal models I specified. Also, whether you take a Frequentist or Bayesian (read MCMC here) approach here depends on you. For the latter, you would put priors on $\beta,\gamma,\sigma,\delta$. Usually for predictive accuracy, ensemble models like Boosting and Random Forests are great, but I don't know how to cast them for latent variable use. I can suggest you take a look at Gaussian Processes.
