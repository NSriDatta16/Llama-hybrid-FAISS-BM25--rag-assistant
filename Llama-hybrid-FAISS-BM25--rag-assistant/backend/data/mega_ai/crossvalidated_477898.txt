Wisdom of the Crowd Disagreement Probability

I'm trying to estimate the likelihood that a set of annotators will have at least one dissenter. For n annotations, we know the probability that they will annotate any given record P(a) and the probability that they'll annotate the record correctly P(true). As a simple example if we have the following values: Annotator A P(a): .35 P(true): .9 Annotator B P(a): .45 P(true): .95 Annotator C P(a): .7 P(true): .85 I can simulate this scenario and get roughly 11.67% of the annotations having some disagreement, but I'm stumped on how to generalize the calculation. Presumably, I need to know the weighted probability of a correctly annotated record along with the average number of annotators per record. Appreciate the help.
