To answer the question from the edit. I guess that algorithms that naturally support MultiOutput targets, perform best. This is because these algorithms calculate the multiple output variables simultaneously and hence take possible correlations between outputs into account. This is not the case, if you use MultiOutputRegressor from sklearn which fits a model for each output variable individually . SVR naturally only supports single-output regression. But there are different adaptions that can be made to make the algorithm fit also to a multi-output regression task. For an extensive overview check the paper in the Reference section of this repository . You can find an example for an implementation of Multiple-output support vector regression in python here . It is based on the paper Multi-step-ahead time series prediction using multiple-output support vector regression . You also might want to check out this answer .
