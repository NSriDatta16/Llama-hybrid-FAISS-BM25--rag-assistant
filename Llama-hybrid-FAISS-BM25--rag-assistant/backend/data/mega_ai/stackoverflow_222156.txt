Pickledegg, There's nothing wrong with breaking up style sheets. In fact, I find it very useful to organize css rules into different files based on their type, or what parts of the site they are applied to. If you lump rules into one large file, it can quickly become a mess and become very difficult to manage. I would recommend coming up with your own scheme for separating your rules into files, and stick with it for all your projects.
