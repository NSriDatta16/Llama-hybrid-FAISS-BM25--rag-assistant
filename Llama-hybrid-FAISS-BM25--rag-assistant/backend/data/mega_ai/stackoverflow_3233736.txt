You are right, IceDragon, it doesn't make sense to use multiple if/else's, because every single time you add options, you'll have to rewrite your code. There are a number of ways to avoid this. Here is just one approach: Standard seat Wheelchair seat Back Nave Front nave Middle nave // make sure to put these in the order you wish them to appear in the output var selections = { area: '', seat: '' }; var seatsArray = []; function chose(input, value) { selections[input.name] = value; } // call this function when user clicks the floor plan: function image_clicked(e) { var desc = []; for (var i in selections) if (selections[i] != '') desc.push(selections[i]); seatsArray.push(desc.join(', ') + ' ' + e.posX, e.posY); } Notice that in the selections object, we're keeping track of the selections that the user has made so far. Then when the user clicks the image (or whatever triggers the code you are working on), the function simply formats the values already collected. The one drawback to the way I have written this code is that browsers tend to cache the state of the radio buttons, so a radio button may be already selected, but the chose() function wasn't called. One quick and dirty workaround is to add an ID to the form tag and run this on page load: document.getElementById('form').reset(); Where 'form' is the ID attribute of the form tag.
