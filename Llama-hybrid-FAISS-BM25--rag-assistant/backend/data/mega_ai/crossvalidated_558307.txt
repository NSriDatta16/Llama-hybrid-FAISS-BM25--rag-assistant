As @usÎµr11852 suggested , I read through Logistic Regression on Wikipedia , and found the following formula: $$P(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \sum{\beta_ix_i})}}$$ $P(x) \equiv probability \space of \space positive \space sample$ $\beta_0 \equiv logistic \space regression \space interception$ $\beta_i \equiv coefficient \space i$ $x_i \equiv feature \space value$ I have the coefficients ( clf.coef_ ), the interception ( clf.intercept_ ), and the feature values. So this is easy to implement now.
