Different situations call for different answers. Applied statisticians should find the measure that answers the underlying question best. Consider the following sentence: Most people have above average number of legs Most people have 2 legs, some have only one or none. So the mean is probably 1.9... If someone in the street asked you "How many legs do people have?" they will usually expect the answer "two legs", which is the mode . The mode is often "the normal thing". If, however, you were in a position where you would have to plan a stock of lower limb prosthesis for a country far away, you would want to multiply the mean with the population size. In many cases where you would like to assess a mean from a small sample but are afraid of outliers, the median will be a better estimator. So the question for the best measure is not a universal mathematical question nor does is necessarily depend on what you measure, but it depends on whatever real world problem you try to tackle.
