This is legal ( foo is red; bar is blue; spam is red again as it's nested): foo bar spam This isn't: foo bar spam But it may be worth noting that in MediaWiki and some other sanitization engines in blogs etc that is legal, as it converts the above to this: foo bar spam It could be argued this encourages bad behavior, but not everybody who writes a blog is as technical as the people like us who use stack overflow (posting as community wiki as this will probably get voted down :-P)
