Way too many organizations in the USA use SSNs as unique identifiers for people, despite the well-documented problems with them. Unless your application actually has something to do with government benefits, there's no good reason for you to store SSns. Given that so many organizations (mis)use them to identify people for things like credit checks, you really need to be careful with them. With nothing more than someone's name, address, and SSN, it's pretty easy to get credit under their name, and steal their identity . The legal issues are along the lines of getting sued into oblivion for any leak of personal information that contains SSNs.
