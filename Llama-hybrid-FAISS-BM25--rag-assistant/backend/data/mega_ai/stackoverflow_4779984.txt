I am working on something similar in Java on a speech recognition app. I would recommend using MFCC (requires calculating FFT) for feature extraction and Neural Networks or some other sort of machine learning technique for training and recognition. You train the NN with the features extracted from the reference wav file, more precisely from consecutive equal lenght slices/windows of that audio file. Then you use the NN to detect if another file, also split into slices, has the same features. This is the basic idea upon which you can elaborate to further your own specifications, or exactly what you want your app to do. In terms of libraries in Objective C I think you can find a few for the signal processing part (FFT and such) as for the machine learning part I have no idea about what you could find. As for programming time it's hard to estimate because it depends on a lot of details. I would say somewhere about a week, but that's just a fair estimation. ps: MFCC stands for Mel-Frequency Coeficients: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum
