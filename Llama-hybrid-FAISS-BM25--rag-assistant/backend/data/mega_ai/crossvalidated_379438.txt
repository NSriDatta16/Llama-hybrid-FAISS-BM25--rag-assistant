Why use ARMA (1,0,0) when AR (1) could work

I'm confused because I thought $ARMA(p,q)$ , has elements of autoregression $AR(p)$ and moving average $MA(q)$ . I know a series is $ARIMA$ if the differenced data is an $ARMA$ . The authors of something I'm reading say that this model: $Y_t=0.9Y_{t-1}+W_t$ is an $ARIMA (1,1,0)$ because the differenced data are an autoregression of order one: $Y_t=X_t-X_{t-1}$ I agree with the differenced data being an autoregression of order 1 but if a series is a $ARIMA$ if the differenced data is an $ARMA$ , then where's the moving average part?. In other words, why say that a series is a $ARIMA$ if the differenced data is an $ARMA$ , why not just say that a series is a $ARIMA$ if the differenced data is an autoregression.
