Place to set SQLite PRAGMA option in Django project

According to this test , setting PRAGMA synchronous=OFF can dramatically improve SQLite write performance. I am well aware of the drawbacks, but would still like to try this out. What would be the best location within a Django project to set this PRAGMA option? I cannot do it from settings.py - at least not the way the article suggests - because from django.db import connection would cause a recursive import error.
