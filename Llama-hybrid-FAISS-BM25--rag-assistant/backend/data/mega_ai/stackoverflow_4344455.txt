You've still not made it clear what you are trying to do! Are you aware for example that there are three casts: TO_TYPE DEST_VAL = static_cast (SOME_VAL); TO_TYPE DEST_VAL = dynamic_cast (SOME_VAL); and the one you're hung up on: TO_TYPE DEST_VAL = reinterpret_cast (SOME_VAL); Of these three, the last is the most dangerous , basically you are ignoring all the things the compiler is telling you about types and forcing your way on it! It implies that you know what you are doing, and in most cases, you don't. Typically you should only use the last one as a LAST RESORT when the other two casts can't do what you need and you've carefully looked at the design, and consulted soothsayers etc.! It is NOT type safe, and IT MAKES NO GUARANTEES that the resulting object is what you expect it to be, as in what you are trying to do above.. bool and int may or may not have the same aligned storage and pointing to the address of a bool with a pointer that should point to an int and dereferencing could lead to potentially accessing all sorts of nether regions of memory...
