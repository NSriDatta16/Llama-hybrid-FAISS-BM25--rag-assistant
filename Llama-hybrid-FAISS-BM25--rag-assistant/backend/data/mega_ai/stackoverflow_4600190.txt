Global function definition in header file - how to avoid duplicated symbol linkage error

I have the following code in a header only file. #pragma once class error_code { public: unsigned __int64 hi; unsigned __int64 lo; }; std::ostream& operator I get linkage error, when there are 2 cpp in the project include this header file. error LNK2005: "class error_code __cdecl operator|(class error_code const &,class ViTrox::error_code const &)" (??U@@YA?AVerror_code@0@ABV10@0@Z) already defined in xxx.obj I know I can resolve this problem, if I move the definition of operator to a cpp file, or to a DLL file. However, I just would like to have them in a SINGLE header file. Is there any technique to achieve so? Or must I separate the definition to another file?
