Concatenating an array of arrays in Coffeescript

I'm trying to find an elegant way in Coffeescript to merge an array of arrays, so that [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] ==> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. As you might imagine, I need this because I'm generating arrays from a function in a "for in" construct and need to concatenate the resulting nested array: result = (generate_array(x) for x in arr) Is there an elegant way to handle this? Thanks for any pointers!
