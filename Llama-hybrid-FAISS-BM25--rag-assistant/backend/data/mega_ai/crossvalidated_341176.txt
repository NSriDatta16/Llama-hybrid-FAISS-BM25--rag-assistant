I like the answers given here already ( AdamO , Daniel , Dave31415 ), and I'll try to synthesize them and add a bit from my experience: You mention: The manufacturer would like to know about the durability of each part in each system of each car among other things. This leads me to think of a two part solution: First, map all possible parts in a one-to-many relationship with which car model and problem is solved in the repair. You'll need both experts and actual repair documentation. This can be done with a complete survey by amending the required documentation. Alternatively, you can randomly sample part orders and manually follow up on the individual repair (ie: call the repair shop) - eventually, you'll have a representative sample. Both are very time-intensive. Next, you build a dataset that takes actual repairs and builds lifecycle data (average, median, plot the distribution, etc) on a per-model-problem basis. This will likely demand at least 30 data points per part per problem per model. That's a lot of data to gather, suggesting that going the "required documentation" route would be better than hiring a fleet of interns. The added benefit is that this analysis can be automated and can update over time as new problems/parts/models are added. I'm not sure you need to actually "predict" anything - gathering the dataset above will be sufficient. You can simply look at actual lifespans of parts in the models. You could then extrapolate to the lifespan of those parts in current service. Maybe "predict" can simply mean "use the median lifespan". Overall, this might be too low-profile of a project to actually justify the expense of gathering these data. What if, instead, you brought in experienced mechanics from the community and from dealerships and simply asked them which parts fail and when? They might even be able to give you a great hypothesis on "why" they fail, not just which and how often. They are your real experts. .
