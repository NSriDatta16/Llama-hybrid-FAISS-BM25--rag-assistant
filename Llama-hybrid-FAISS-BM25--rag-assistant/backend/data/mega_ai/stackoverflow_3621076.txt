I haven't found any way to automatically update my DBML based on changes to the database without clearing the entire canvas and re-dragging the items in again. And as you say, the FKs are all renamed to defaults which is annoying. DBMLs are in XML format and I've often found that once the major database changes settle down, it is faster and easier to just edit the XML (Open With ... ) and make the modification there as you do in parallel to the creation script that I keep as part of my project. Then you rebuild, or perhaps just Run Custom Tool to regenerate the changes to the cs files. This was in VS 2008, not sure if it's still a challenge in 2010. HTH
