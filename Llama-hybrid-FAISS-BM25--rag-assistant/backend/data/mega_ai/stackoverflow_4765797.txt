Having admins and normal users log in using the same form is not necessarily less secure, depending your other security measures. Some CMS systems, such as Drupal, use that model. You're better off focusing energy on other security concerns, rather than security through obscurity . Do you limit admin logins to certain IP addresses? Do you block users after a number of unsuccessful login attempts? Do you encourage/force strong passwords? Etc.
