How much time series analysis do you know? The topics that will likely help you: ARIMA models (AutoRegressive, Integrated and Moving Average problems). Box-Jenkins framework that @IrishStat mentioned is that of univariate ARMA models. Distributed lags models (the fat you see decreasing today may have been the function of the exercise you had yesterday or two days ago) Granger causality (whether one time series causes another) Threshold autoregressive models (whether the coefficient of a variable changes when this or another variable exceeds a threshold value) The standard time series references are Hamilton (for economists; I found it to be dry and somewhat unwieldy reading) and Brockwell and Davis (for statisticians, won't have as much causal modeling as Hamilton would)
