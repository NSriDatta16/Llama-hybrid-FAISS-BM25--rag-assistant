What is the best way to change the key of an array using values from another array?

I have two arrays: array ( 'AK_AGE_ASS_VISIBLE' => '1', 'AK_AGE_ASS_COMP' => '0', ..... ) I want to change the key to another value taking it from another array: array( 'AK_AGE_ASS_VISIBLE' => 'AGENT_ASSOCIATED', 'AK_AGE_ASS_COMP' => 'AGENT_ASSOCIATED_O', .... ) The ending array should produce this array: array( 'AGENT_ASSOCIATED' => '1', 'AGENT_ASSOCIATED_O' => '0', ... ) What is the correct way to do these kind of things? Please note that the arrayys won't have the same number of entries and there is no warranty that the first array will have a corresponding key in the other array. Thank you very much
