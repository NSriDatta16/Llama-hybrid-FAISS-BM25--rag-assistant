try to focus on reorganizing your query building process. query = select + ' where ' + filter1 + filter2 select = 'select * from table' filter1 = ''; if set minprice if minprice = 'nomin' filter1 = price > minprice' else filter1 = 'price and so on ... 'til the building the full query : query = select; if any filter on query += ' where ' first = true if set filter 1 if not first query += ' and ' query += filter1 and so on... you can put your filters in an array. it is more 'scalable' for your code.
