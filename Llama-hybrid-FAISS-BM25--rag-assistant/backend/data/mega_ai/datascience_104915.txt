This is more of a programming than a data science question and would therefore be better suited for the stackoverflow page. There are two ways of doing this, depending on the number of items/rows you want to leave separate and if you can manually provide them. Both methods first change the Name column to group names in your example and then group and sum the rows. import numpy as np # manually provide three items which should not be grouped ( df .assign(Name = lambda x: np.where(~x["Name"].isin(["Apple", "Carrot", "Pear"]), "Other", x["Name"])) .groupby("Name") .sum() .reset_index() ) # automatically use items after third row for grouping ( df .assign(Name = lambda x: np.where(x["Name"].isin(x["Name"].iloc[3:]), "Other", x["Name"])) .groupby("Name") .sum() .reset_index() )
