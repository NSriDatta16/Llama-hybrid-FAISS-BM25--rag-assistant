resize handle in AJAX RadEditor appearing in IE

I am using an AJAX RadEditor from Telerik in a CMS that I am working on. Everything seems to work well in Firefox, but I have noticed some strange behavior in IE. Namely, when content is put in a , it becomes very difficult to manage. Clicking on the content contained in the creates a striped border, with resize handles attached to it, around the full area of the . This tends to include area that is outside the containing RadEditor. It also causes the cursor to turn into a drag cursor and makes the content draggable. This makes it difficult to actually select the content. This only happens in IE, and I'm wondering if there is a way to disable this behavior. It is frustrating my clients in their attempts to use the CMS, and unfortunately simply switching to Firefox is not a workable solution for them. Has anyone else encountered this?
