Magento: How to tell if you're on a category page, or product page in .phtml file(s)

I am trying to program into my .phtml files an if statement if the guest is on a category list page, or on a product page. For example this code: getFrontController()->getRequest()->getRouteName(); ?> Returns "catalog" whenever l'm on a page other than a CMS page. Is there a way l can use a similar method to know if the user is looking at a root category, sub category or an individual product page? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
