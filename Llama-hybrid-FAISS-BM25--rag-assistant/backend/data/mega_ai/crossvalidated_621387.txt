You have a single rating that is the outcome of not just one input (stimulus) but several (intonational phrases). Instead of building multiple models with the same response (rating) and different predictors (intonational phrases), this can simply be done with one multiple regression model. Use rating as the response (i.e. dependent variable) and the boundary tones of the intonational phrases as predictors (i.e. independent variables). You might also consider using 'participant' as a random effect because each participant rated multiple stimuli. And if your ratings are best treated as ordinal and not continuous, which is likely, the best solution would be a mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression . This is a good thread about how to fit them: How to use ordinal logistic regression with random effects?
