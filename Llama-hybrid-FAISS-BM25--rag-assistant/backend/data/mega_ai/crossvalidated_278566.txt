If you standardize X, must you always standardize y?

Related reading: When conducting multiple regression, when should you center your predictor variables & when should you standardize them? When and how to use standardized explanatory variables in linear regression Variables are often adjusted (e.g. standardised) before making a model - when is this a good idea, and when is it a bad one? Follow-up question: When should you center your data & when should you standardize? Background: I am comparing the effectiveness of various forms of linear regression machine learning, such as sklearn.linear_model.Ridge , sklearn.linear_model.Lasso , sklearn.svm.SVR . Question: The linked questions above discuss various reasons to standardize, center, or neither the predictor variables in regression settings. If I standardize the X matrix do I have to then standardize the y array? If I center the X matrix do I have to center the y array? For either of those situations, would failing to standardize/center give me incorrect results?
