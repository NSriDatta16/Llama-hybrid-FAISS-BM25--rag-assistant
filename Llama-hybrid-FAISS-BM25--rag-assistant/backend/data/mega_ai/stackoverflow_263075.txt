What are some of the best resources to learn MSBuild with?

I am looking for any and all suggestions of the best and effective resources that the StackOverflow community has used to better learn MSBuild with an emphasis on integrating unit tests and later static code analysis tools such as FxCop and StyleCop into the build process. I have tried to find good clear documentation on adding unit tests into my build but I still am searching - even Google searches have come up empty or with just bits and pieces. Ideally I want to add unit tests, report results, and eventually add code coverage statistics, etc into the build results. I know it has to be in MSDN somewhere but I seem unable to find anything which explains and teaches well. I am using Visual Studio Team System 2008.
