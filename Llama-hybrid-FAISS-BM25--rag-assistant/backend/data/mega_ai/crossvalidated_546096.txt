How is the Following Picture Possible?

Source: https://blog.wolfram.com/2013/03/21/the-mathematics-of-queues/ In this picture, it would appear that multiple customers can enter and exit the queue at the same time. In real life, this is entirely possible - but how exactly can this be modelled by a Markov Chain or by a Stochastic Process? Is it possible to have a stochastic process that can accommodate "multiple events at the same time"? Is this what the "jump process" is used for? Or is this accomplished using the "compound poisson process"? E.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_Poisson_process
