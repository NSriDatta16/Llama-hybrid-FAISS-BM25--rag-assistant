What is the best way to import standalone data into a database?

A little background: I have a remote, stand alone SQL Server database that is truncated at the end of every weekend. The data is hardly relational, not normalized at all, and pretty annoying to work with. On top of that, the schema for this database cannot be modified at all, because it is recreated by a third party application. Before the database is destroyed each week, a backup is created of that week's data. On average each database will have between 500,000 and 2,000,000 records. My task is to create a historical version of this database that is a superset of all of these database backups. It should tie into our other databases which contain related sets of information. I have already started on an application to perform this task, and I've gotten to the point where I'm able to match data with our other databases, but I'm wondering if theres any best practice to handling this kind of import. How do I make sure that I have unique IDs in my historical version of this database? Are there any features in SQL Server that can do some of the heavy lifting in this for me? Thanks for your time on this.
