The team determines how much new story work it can do during a sprint. The amount of time they have to do that work is some percentage of the work day. Depending on the responsibilities of team members (customer support, bug fixes, emails, PTO, other duties) that amount varies from team to team. I like to see 10-15% of the work day dedicated to "planning" for the next sprint. That includes helping the PO research, writing stories, breaking up stories, design sessions, what-if scenarios, etc. I think the key is not to shoe-horn every one of these types of tasks into a sprint but rather to set the correct time allocation to doing the sprint work. Maybe something like 30 hours/wk is an average number. So to directly answer your question; the planning work is done in parallel to the current sprint work.
