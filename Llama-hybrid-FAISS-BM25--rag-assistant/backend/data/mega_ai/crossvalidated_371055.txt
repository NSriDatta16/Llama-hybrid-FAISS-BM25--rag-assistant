Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on mixed data using 1-hot encoding

From a standpoint of interpretation, can I use NMF on one-hot encoded categorical data for dimension reduction? I have mixed data and was thinking about one-hot encoding the categorical features and min-max normalizing the numerical features. I read that this approach is not good when using PCA ( see Stack Overflow here ), but NMF follows a different principle than PCA. Is this a valid approach? Thank you very much in advance! Jimmy
