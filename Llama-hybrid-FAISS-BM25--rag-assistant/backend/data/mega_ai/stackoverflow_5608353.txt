If you only need to do it for C++, you can override the new, delete, new[], delete[] operators. See 18.6.1 "Storage allocation and deallocation" void* operator new(std::size_t size); [...] void operator delete(void* ptr); "Replaceable: a C++ program may define a function with this function signature that displaces the default version defined by the C++ standard library." I don"t know if it works with static linking however (don't know how it is implemented).
