You are right. The meaning of your quote is: if you look at the probability $P(H)$ of people being hit by a heart attack occuring in a given population, you are looking at the "average" probability in that population. Differently, if you look at the probability of people being hit by a heart attack given their cholesterol level is higher than some threshold, say event $C$, you are considering the conditional probability $P(H | C)$, i.e. the probability of being hit by heart attach in that population given a high cholesterol level. If events $H$ and $C$ are not independent, then $P(H) \neq P(H|C)$. That's it. I think that conditional probability is used to introduce Bayes' theorem, and for the moment you can stop right there. Further interpretations require more analyses. For example, let say that $P(L|S)$ is the probability of getting a lung cancer when you smoke, while $P(L|NS)$ is the probability of getting a lung cancer when you do not smoke. We can safely assume that $P(L|S) > P(L|NS)$. However, if a man smoked cigarettes for 50 years, does stopping his habit reduce his probabilities of dying? Moreover, the event you are conditioning on (e.g. some blood value) could be just a confounding factor, and changing its level might not have any effect on your target variable. More generally, when you want to draw cause-and-effect relationships, you have to assume (and possibly validate) a causal model.
