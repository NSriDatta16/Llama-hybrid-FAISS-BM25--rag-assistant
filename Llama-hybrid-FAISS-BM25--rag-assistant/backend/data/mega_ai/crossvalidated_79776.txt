VarCorr() here provides the variance estimate of the random intercept by REML, but sd(ranef(fit1)[[1]]) shows the standard deviation of the empirical Bayesian estimates of the random intercept. In other words, say we have parameter $\sigma$, VarCorr() gives us the estimate $\hat \sigma$; we can generate a random sample based on $\hat \sigma$, and then calculate the standard deviation of the random sample by sd() . The two would be different since the result by sd() is an estimate of the result by VarCorr() . The similarity depends on the data set, and the two are similar when tested with the Orthodont example in lme() . > summary(fit1 sd(ranef(fit1)[[1]]) [1] 2.003087
