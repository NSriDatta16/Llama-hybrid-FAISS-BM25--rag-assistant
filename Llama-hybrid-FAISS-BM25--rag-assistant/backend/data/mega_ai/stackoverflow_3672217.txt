Yeah, I guess you could do it, using a stored procedure. It would have to have a REPEAT loop that uses LOCATE to find the string index of the next '${' token, takes the name from there up to the next LOCATE d '}' , and replaces it by CONCAT and SUBSTRING with the value. If that value comes from a simple name-to-value lookup table that's not too bad, but if you want ${first_name} to actually use the column called first_name you would have to create some dynamic SQL in a string and run it using PREPARE...EXECUTE , which is ugly and dangerous. It would be complex, fragile and DBMS-dependent. SQL is not really designed to be convenient for string fiddling. Any general-purpose programming language with reasonable string-manipulation facilities should be able to do it in a much more straightforward way. If you have PHP available, use it.
