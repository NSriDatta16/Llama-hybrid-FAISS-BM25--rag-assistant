There's a huge variety of algorithms for making binary classifications. Knowing which one is best for you depends on knowing a little more about the kind of outputs you are after. For example would you like to know in each case the probability that the note is being played with, say, the left hand or do you just need a yes or no answer? Do you need to be able to understand the contribution of each of the variables to the probability that the note is being played with the left hand? Does the solution need to be implemented somewhere where it would be difficult to embed a complicated algorithm. In fact these are all questions that would be partially answered if you could tell us a little about the purpose of the experiment. It does sound like logistic regression would be a promising place to start. Sorry stack exchange users. I know this is more of a comment but I'm new and I don't yet have enough points to comment!
