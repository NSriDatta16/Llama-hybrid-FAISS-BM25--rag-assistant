You can collapse the selection to remove the drag handles in IE: tinyMCE.activeEditor.selection.collapse() This will also keep the cursor position relatively close to where the user expects it to be. Alternatively, the cleanup command will remove the handles in all browsers (along with the selection): tinyMCE.activeEditor.execCommand('mceCleanup');
