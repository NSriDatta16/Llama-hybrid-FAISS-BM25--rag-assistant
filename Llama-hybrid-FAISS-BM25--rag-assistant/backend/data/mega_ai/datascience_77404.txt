How to match features in new records for NLP BOW

I have a dataset that has 100,000 records data in this dataset are 2 columns 1- Text 2- Class When I apply BOW of my model I get big list of features That is fine, I managed to work with them my problem is after building the model and deploying. now if a new text came with new words then the model wont work as it wokds in same feature structure Example "This is a test, test is important" , Red "Adam pass a test", Green so my final dataset is This is a test important Adam pass class 1 2 1 2 1 0 0 Red 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 Green once model created and got this text "test and exam are similar", Yellow in this case the set of features has new features which are and exam are similar the model will break coz these features never included in the training model I wonder how to resolve this issue?
