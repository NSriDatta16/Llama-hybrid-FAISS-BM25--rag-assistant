PCA, highly explained component with no value above 0.3

I was analyzing PCA output, and when I reached " pca $xlist, comp($ ncomp) blanks(.3) " to name variables, I found out that component 1. which explains more than 50% didn't have any variable above 3 , yet most of the macroeconomic variables under it were above 1. How should I deal with it? The other 5 components had variables above 0.3, but I don't know what to name component 1.
