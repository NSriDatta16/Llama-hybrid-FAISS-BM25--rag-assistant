Magento extension giving problem at time of install

I am using extension in magento "J2TRememberMe", but at installation it's giving me problems. It's showing a message like: "Failed to download magento-community/J2TRememberMe within preferred state "stable", latest release is version 1.0, stability "beta", use "channel://connect.magentocommerce.com/community/J2TRememberMe-1.0" to install Cannot initialize 'channel://connect.magentocommerce.com/community/J2TRememberMe', invalid or missing package file Install Errors Package "channel://connect.magentocommerce.com/community/J2TRememberMe" is not valid PEAR ERROR: install failed" Does anyone have any idea how to resolve it ? Thanks
