Remember that a logistic regression outputs a probability, not a category. Your idea for using square loss is fine. In fact, that is known as the Brier score. If your label is $1$ and your predicted probability is $0.75$ , your Brier score loss for that point is $(1-0.75)^2 = 0.0625$ . If your next label is $0$ and your predicted probability is $0.6$ , your Brier score loss for that point is $(0-0.6)^2=0.36$ . Add them up and get $0.4225$ as the Brier score for this two-point model. $$ \text{Brier Score} $$ $$ \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{p}_i)^2 $$ Brier score is one example of a strictly proper scoring rule. The other famous one, which might be preferred, is the log loss: $\sum_i y_i \log\hat{p}_i + (1-y_i) \log(1-\hat{p}_i)$ . ( $y_i$ is the true label; $\hat{p}_i$ is the predicted probability.) There are other strictly proper scoring rules, but these are the biggies. Notably, absolute loss is not a proper scoring rule: (Why) Is absolute loss not a proper scoring rule? .
