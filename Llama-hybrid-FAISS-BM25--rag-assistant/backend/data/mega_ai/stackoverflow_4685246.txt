It sounds like you might be referring to the act of swiping (clicking+dragging on a computer) up and down a list, with some simple easing added. I would consider building this yourself using AS3's dragging methods, and applying some basic easing with a library like TweenLite. If you want to copy/purchase a script from somewhere, it might be tough to find exactly what you want. My guess is that you'll have the best luck trying to find a simple scrollbar component with built-in easing (ie. http://www.extendstudio.com/flash-components-creative-flash-scroller-extension/features.html ) , and customize the hit area of the scrollbar to overlay on top of your scrollable content. This way, clicking and dragging anywhere will produce the desired effect.
