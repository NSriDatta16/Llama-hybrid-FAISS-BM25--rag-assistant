Could you elaborate on what you want to achieve? You probably will not (and most certainly should not) be able to re-hook the Secure Attention Sequence to perform application-specific actions. What you can do, however, is customize or replace the login component (GINA) that is responsible for handling the SAS -- this might be useful, for example, in kiosk systems where you want to restrict users from logging out. MSDN Magazine had an article on that a while back, which you might find interesting: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163803.aspx
