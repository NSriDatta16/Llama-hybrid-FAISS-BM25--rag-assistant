How to find out what event cause a javascript function to be executed in FireFox?

I'm debugging an old Infragistic grid. One of the javascript functions executes more times than needed. It was coded to be executed when a user clicks a cell in the grid. However, sometimes it runs when on mouse is over the cell. I'd like to know if there's a way to track what event caused this function to run. Multiple executions of that function happens only in FireFox, IE behaves as it intended.
