If you really are starting out in Azure Table Storage, then there are a few nice "simple" tutorials around - e.g. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jnak/archive/2008/10/28/walkthrough-simple-table-storage.aspx Once you are happy with reading/writing entities then there are several ways you can map your array to Table Storage. If you ever want to access each element of your array separately from the persistent storage, then you should create 0 to 99 separate entities - each with their own entity in the Table store. If you don't ever want to access them separately, then you can just store the array in a single entity (row) in the table - e.g. using PartitionKey="MyArrays", RowKey="" and having another column which contains the array serialised to e.g. JSON. As a variation on 2, you could also store the array items - 0 to 99 - in separate columns ("Array_0",..."Array_99") in the row. There are ways you could map this to a nice C# Array property using the Reading/Writing events on the table storage entity - but this might not be the best place to start if you're beginning with Azure.
