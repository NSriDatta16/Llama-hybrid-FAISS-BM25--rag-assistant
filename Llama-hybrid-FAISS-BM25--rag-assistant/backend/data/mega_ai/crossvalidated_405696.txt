How to calculate probability using T distribution in R and When to use T distribution

Can someone help me to solve below question using R programming. A Government company claims that an average light bulb lasts 270 days. A researcher randomly selects 18 bulbs for testing. The sampled bulbs last an average of 260 days, with a standard deviation of 90 days. If the CEO's claim were true, what is the probability that 18 randomly selected bulbs would have an average life of no more than 260 days With the data above provided i used T distribution to calculate probability using below formula in R qt(0.95,17) = 1.73 Probability using T distribution = (1.73) * 90/sqrt(18) = 36.69 Is this proper way to solve and can someone please tell me is there is function to get probability for T distribution. Thanks in advance.
