Measuring change in average for groups over time

I have a large dataset with measurements of leaf retention in a species of trees. I have many different plots. For each plot, measurements taken for 8 (randomly selected) trees. Measurement were taken each year over three years. I want to know if leaf retention is getting better or worse. To do this, I want to see if there is a significant difference between years. I am thinking of using a one way Anova with repeated measures (because the groups are not independent) to test for a difference in group means for different years. However, I am not sure if this is the correct test as I do not know whether to treat the groups as independent. They are repeated measurements from the same plot, but the actual trees that are measured may not be the same. Would anyone be able to give me any suggestions or advice? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
