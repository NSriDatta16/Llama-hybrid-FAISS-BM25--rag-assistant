Ok, here comes some seriously unorthodox approach: Use some screen capturing package[1][2] to render the given URL to a Raster Image (like PNG). Analyse the resulting raster image sampling it's pixels for an average, if you're looking for average, or give a threshold to group pixels into "colour-groups". Using the average or max-occurrence of colour groups (which method to use depends on what matters most to you) you can get a pretty high accuracy representation of the predominant colour in the page.
