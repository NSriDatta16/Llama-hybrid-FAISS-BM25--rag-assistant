Data Structures... so how do I understand them?

So I am a Computer Science student and in about a week or so... I will be retaking a Data Structures course, using C++ for applying the theory. Yes, I did say "retaking". I took the course last Fall and I feel like there is more that I need to learn. Being a student, I feel that I MUST know the basics because it will be much easier to understand new concepts in future classes by already knowing the basic concepts... not having to relearn every time. The first time around, I had no experience in C++ and the course expected us to be coding by the end of the first week. I struggled getting through several of the first programming assignments (MPs). Needless to say, I got used to it and had little trouble with the syntax the remainder of the semester. But then the harder Data Structures came around and the theory (Big O), became the difficult part. All in all it was a great experience, but I feel my problem was that I didn't develop good study habits. I did the MPs and showed up to lecture, but it seems like my heart wasn't there with me. I want to change this the second time around because looking back at the class, I did have a good time and I enjoyed the material. But I found myself spending too much time thinking about/setting up the data structure(s) when I needed to be spending the time thinking about how to put the data structure to use effectively. Learning theory is difficult (mostly because it isn't so exciting) so how should I apply myself to truly understand the Data Structures covered class? I've always been a visual learner, an interactive learner... I don't want to spend time just doing my MPs. Rather, I want to spend my time in such a way that I truly learn/understand the concepts and then directly apply the knowledge. I'm looking for any suggestions... perhaps advice on study habits that have worked for you in the past learning such concepts... or suggestions on good note-taking techniques... anything that you'd like to share :) ... and most importantly, how to prepare before the semester starts. Please feel free to provide feedback even if an answer has been selected. I am looking for your advice... this is why I posted :) Thanks!
