Query result organization

I am trying to figure out the most efficient way to format this query. I have three tables - Transaction, Purchase and Item. The desired result is to select sales data (quantity/sales total) for each item for a specific client. the tables are formatted as follows: ( =primary key)* Transaction: Transaction_ID*, Timestamp Purchase: Purchase_ID*, Sale, Item_ID, Transaction_ID, Quantity Item: Item_ID*, Client_ID, Description As of right now I have a query set up to select each item for a given client_id: SELECT Item_ID, Description FROM Item WHERE Client_ID = $ClientId Then I store the results in an array, and executing a query to retrieve the sales data for each Item_ID between a given date-range: SELECT Sale, Quantity FROM Purchase INNER JOIN Transaction ON Purchase.Transaction_ID = Transaction.Transaction_ID WHERE Transaction.Timestamp >= $start AND Transaction.Timestamp Then for each row fetched, I sum the quantity. It gets the job done, but is probably not the most efficient way to get this done. I would like to order this data by the sales totals, putting the greatest number first How would you go about sorting this from greatest to least? Is there a way to get this all done in one query?
