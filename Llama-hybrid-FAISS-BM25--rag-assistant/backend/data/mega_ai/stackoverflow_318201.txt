Realign namespace definitions with file structure

Like all developers with OCD I try to organise my namespaces within our project so that they match where the file they are contained within sits of disk. However after a pretty massive refactoring session within VS.NET I've moved files within projects and created new subfolders a plenty, leaving the refactoring of the namespaces to later believing that there must be a refactoring tool that will accomplish this for me once things have settled down. However I'm now not able to find such a tool! Does anyone know of anyway to accomplish this automatically (ie. without me painstakingly going through 100s of files or even writing my own tool?).
