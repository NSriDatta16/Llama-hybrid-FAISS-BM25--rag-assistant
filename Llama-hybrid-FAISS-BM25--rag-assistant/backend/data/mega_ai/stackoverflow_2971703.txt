What are the best ways to store Graphs in persistent storage

I am wondering what the best ways to store graphs in persistent storage are, for later analysis, search, clustering, etc. I see neo4j being an option, I am curious if there are also other graph databases available. Does anyone have any insights into how larger social networks store their graph based data (or other sites that require the storage of graph like models, e.g. RDF). What about options like Cassandra, or MySQL?
