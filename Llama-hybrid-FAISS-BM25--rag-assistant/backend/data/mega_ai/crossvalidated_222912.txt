How to determine parameters for t-SNE for reducing dimensions?

I am very new to word embeddings. I want to visualize how the documents are looking after learning. I read that t-SNE is the approach to do it. I have 100K documents with 250 dimensions as size of the embedding. There are several packages available as well. However, for t-SNE, I don't know how many iterations or the value of alpha or the value of perpexility I should keep to learn better. Are these hyper-parameters or can these be determined by some attributes?
