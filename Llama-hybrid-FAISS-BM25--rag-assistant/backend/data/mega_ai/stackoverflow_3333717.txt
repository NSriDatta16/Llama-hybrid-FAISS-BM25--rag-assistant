You would need some delimiter to indicate when it is the end of each pair as opposed to having one large string with sections in between e.g. Organization: Name of a governmental, military or other organization.|OrganizationType: Organization classification to one of the following types: sports, governmental military, governmental civilian or political party. (required) |Nationality: Organization nationality if mentioned in the document. (required) Notice the | character which is indicating the end of the pair. Then it is just a case of using a very specific delimiter, something that is not likely to be used in the description text, instead of one colon you could use 2 :: as one colon could possibly crop up on occassions as others have suggested. That means you would just need to do: // split the string into rows string[] rows = myString.Split('|'); Dictionary pairs = new Dictionary (); foreach (var r in rows) { // split each row into a pair and add to the dictionary string[] split = Regex.Split(r, "::"); pairs.Add(split[0], split[1]); } You can use LINQ as others have suggested, the above is more for readability so you can see what is happening. Another alternative is to devise some custom regex to do what you need but again you would need to be making a lot of assumptions of how the description text would be formatted etc.
