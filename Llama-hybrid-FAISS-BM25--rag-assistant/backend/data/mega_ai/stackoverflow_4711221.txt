What would you recommend as a transition language on the desktop for a PHP programmer?

I've been using PHP for some time now, and though I certainly don't claim I am a PHP guru, I feel I know my way around the language enough to get most things done elegantly enough. Up 'til now, I haven't really wanted to do much desktop programming. I've hacked together tiny things with AutoHotKey and (I'm sure) rather poorly written C#, but I have never gotten into these languages in the same way that I have with PHP. Now, I'm looking to change that, so I am asking you guys what you think would be the best language for me to try for programming on the desktop. Preferably, I would like something that is Typed similarly to PHP (Wikipedia lists it as "dynamically/weakly" typed Interpreted Can be compiled (or at least packed) to an executable, and easily Thanks in advance for any help! EDIT: Thank you all for the helpful answers - I wish I could have accepted all of them. I decided to try learn into Python, keeping in mind the differences between web and desktop development. Thank you all for your generous help!
