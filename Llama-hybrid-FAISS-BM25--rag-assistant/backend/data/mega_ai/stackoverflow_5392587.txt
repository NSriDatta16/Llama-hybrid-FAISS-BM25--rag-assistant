Problems with res folder and R.java

I'm doing Tutorials and I'm on section about images. It says to put them into the folder res/drawable. But I don't have that folder, I have three instead: res/drawable-hdpi , r es/drawable-ldpi and res/drawable-mdpi . So whats the difference between them? Im using this tutorial. One of the steps is: Create a strings.xml file in res/values/ and edit the file to look like There already is strings.xml , combined with the above, telling me to use res/drawable, are these tutorials out of date? This tutorial has code like: R.id.spinner R.array.planets_array R.layout is just simple enum. Uses the main.xml in the layout folder. But where are R.id and R.array to come from. Because it is coming up in eclipse saying it doesn't know what they are. R.java gets updated automatically, so can someone tell me from reading that tutorial where id gets added to R? It says that The R.array.planets_array ID references the string-array defined above Only it doesn't work. I doubt it makes a difference that i didn't make strings.xml since it's the same filename in the same location. But since R.java is meant to be updated automatically I don't know how to fix this.
