Are regression coefficients in a model with interactions ALL made conditional, or just those involved in the interaction?

In every example I've seen describing the interpretation of interactions in multiple regression (I know logistic regression is different), they use an example of two regression coefficients and the interaction between them. I want to know how the rest of a model is affected when interaction terms are included, and if it is more appropriate to first present a model without an interaction and then with it (like I've seen in some articles and presentations). For example, let's say I have 10 predictors, plus an interaction term between two of them, in my regression model. I understand that the coefficients for the interacting terms are now conditional effects instead of main effects. What I don't understand is how it affects the interpretation of the other 8 predictors in my model. Thoughts?
