Understanding and simulating a classic linear regression model with fixed coefficients

I had used the GPT chat to ask some straightforward questions. However, one of the responses left me feeling quite confused. Currently, I am studying the classical regression model given by $$y_t = x_t\beta + u_t,$$ where $t = 1,...,T$ and $x_t$ is a deterministic (fixed) variable. As a result, I requested GPT to generate two realizations of this model using Julia. Here is the provided answer: # Realization 1 T = 100 x = fill(3, T) # Fixed value of x for all observations (3 in this case) y = 2 .* x .+ randn(T) # Y values with a linear relationship to x # Realization 2 T = 100 x = fill(3, T) # Fixed value of x for all observations (3 in this case) y = 2 .* x .+ randn(T) # Y values with a linear relationship to x So his response led me to wonder about the concept of a population model in the context of a classical linear regression model with fixed coefficients. This model is commonly used in introductory econometrics courses for pedagogical purposes, but in my case, it has been somewhat confusing. In my understanding, the population model would be represented as: $$y = x \beta + u $$ where $x$ is deterministic and fixed, while $y$ and $u$ are random variables. So, GPT's answer aligns with this definition. However, I had anticipated a slightly different response T = 100 x = rand(T) # Fixed # Realization 1 y = 2 .* x .+ randn(T) # Y values with a linear relationship to x # Realization 2 y = 2 .* x .+ randn(T) # Y values with a linear relationship to x And now I'm confused. Could you help me?
