Organizing VBA Project

I am maintaining a large MS Access Project. Over time the number of modules and classes has grown, at this moment it contains 90 modules. More and more time do I spend searching for a specific class in the list. (I know about Shift+F2 :)) Is there any way to organize the list of modules in the VBA editor, i.e. some kind of Addin? My idea would be subfolders in the tree or a filter-as-you-type textbox. Best regards, Torben
