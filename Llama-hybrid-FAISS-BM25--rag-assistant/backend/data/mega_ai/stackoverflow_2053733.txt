Neutral Messaging Language and XML

I have a question, quite desperate at the moment, because i couldn't find any proper info on the internet. Do you some how know the connection of NML and XML. I know that we can send XML messages in client and server architecture, for example, but is there any example of how NML is used? I know it is like a protocol, organises the communication between server-client, etc. Is there any chance that XML messages can be converted to NML and sent in NML format, and on the different side once the message is received, it is converted back to XML again? Thank you very much!!
