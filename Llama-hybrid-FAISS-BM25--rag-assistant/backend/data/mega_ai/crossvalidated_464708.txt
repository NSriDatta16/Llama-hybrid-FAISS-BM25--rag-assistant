If the variance of the model errors is proportional to the expected value the power transforms may be appropriate When (and why) should you take the log of a distribution (of numbers)? ... your data plot doesn't suggest that remedy . If the variance of the errors changes at fixed points in time then GLS following the suggestion by TSAY might be appropriate http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html but that doesn't seem to be appropriate . Outlier detection via INTERVENTION DETECTION can be useful insofar as unusual values inflate the error variance if not mitigated. Why don't you post your interesting time series (not a pix but the actual value and I will put it under my microscope and try to help you further.
