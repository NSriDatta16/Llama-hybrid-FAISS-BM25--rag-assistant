I don't think it matters where the images are stored. Pick the simplest approach that will work. But you should have an architecture where you can change the approach if it proves to be the wrong one. To accomplish this, I would put the data and the image storage both behind a web services interface. Pick a technology - doesn't matter. All access to the data (and images) would be the same way - through the web service. By doing this, you have decoupled where the data is stored from the desktop application. The desktop app doesn't care. All it knows is that the server at a certain address can get it the data. Then store the data and the images wherever you want. Choose the simplest thing for you. If you end up having issues, then (and only then) should you add additional complexity in order to solve the problem. The good news is that the additional complexity and work shouldn't affect the desktop applications at all. You can make the changes on the server without having to deploy a new version of the desktop applications.
