I would investigate OpenStreetMap : Content is open (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0) There is good open-source library support The catch is the data isn't always as accurate or complete, but coverage in major cities is good and the project keeps getting better. You might also look into Microsoft and Yahoo! mapping licenses.
