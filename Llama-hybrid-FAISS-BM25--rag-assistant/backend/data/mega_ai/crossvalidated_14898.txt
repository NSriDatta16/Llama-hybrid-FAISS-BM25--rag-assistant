What is an elegant way of visualising two time series with many data points?

I need to draw two time-series plots on a graph in R . The problem I am facing is as follows. Each plot has 200 data points, and therefore, the graph that I have produced looks clumsy on my two-column pdf file. I am trying to use different pch values, but still the graph doesn't look good to me. Could someone help me to visualize this data in an elegant way, please? Please see the graph below. The most important requirement is that the graph should be clear on printing . The R Code that I have used is as follows: plot(temp11, type="b", col="blue", ylim=c(0.5,1), lwd=0.8, lty=4, pch=1, xlab="Time", ylab="price", cex.lab=1.2,cex.axis=1.2) > lines(temp22, type="b", col="red", lwd=1.5,lty=1, pch=18) > legend("top",legend=c("temp11","temp22"),lty=c(4,1),pch=c(1,18), col=c("blue", "red"),text.col=c("blue", "red"))
