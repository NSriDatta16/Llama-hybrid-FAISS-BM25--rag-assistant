Each case is essentially a sequence of 5 black/white independent trials. There are 100 cases. You assume all cases should have the same probability for black except a few "outliers" you want to detect. These outliers are believed to have a higher probability for black. You can consider each case (that is not an outlier) has a binomial distribution with parameter $B(5,f)$ where $f$ is unknown but fixed. If $f$ was known (say 0.2 corresponding to 1 black per case in average), then you could easily compute a p-value of $k$ blacks: it is the probability that the binomial $B(f,5)$ is at least $k$. For example, with $k=4$, it is $\binom{5}{4}f^4(1-f)+\binom{5}{5}f^5=0.67\%$. With $f=0.2$ here is the p-value table: If $f$ is unknown then you need to estimate it. If you consider your outliers are so rare that their influence would be negligible on the average, then you could just compute the average frequency over all cases: numbers of blacks divided by 500. If you can't consider this, then it becomes a rather difficult problem. One possibility is a hidden variable model (mixture) involving something like expectation/maximization to solve. But I think this would lead us too far.
