Non-blocking IO with Ruby?

I have some questions about non-blocking IO: If I use Ruby without EventMachine on Nginx, could I leverage non-blocking IO? If i use Ruby with EventMachine but on Apache, could I leverage non-blocking IO? If the above answers are no, then it means I have to use Ruby with EventMachine on Nginx to leverage non-blocking IO?
