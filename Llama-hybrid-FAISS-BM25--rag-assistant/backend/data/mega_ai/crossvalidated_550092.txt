Given a training dataset $(X,y)$ where $X$ is the covariate matrix and $y$ the dependent variable, we fit a logistic regression model with coefficients vector $\hat{\beta}$ and its covariance matrix $Cov(\hat{\beta})=\hat{V}$ . When provided a new sample $x_i$ , the LR model work the following way: Estimate the linear predictor, $\hat{\theta}_i=x_i^T\hat{\beta}$ Estimate the output probability using the sigmoid function, $$\hat{\pi}_i=P(y_i=1|x_i)=sigmoid(\hat{\theta}_i)=\frac{e^{\hat{\theta}_i}}{1+e^{\hat{\theta}_i}}=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\hat{\theta}_i}}$$ that's for the logit linking function. a similar method is available for probit linking function. Provide a prediction based on $\hat{\pi}_i$ . In a well-balanced model the threshold should be 0.5 (that is, $\hat{y}_i=\begin{cases}1\quad \hat{\pi}_i\ge 0.5\\0\quad \hat{\pi}_i , but there could be other cutoff values).
