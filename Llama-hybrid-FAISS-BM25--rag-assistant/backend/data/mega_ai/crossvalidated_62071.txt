Is there a well-defined class of ensemble methods?

Ensemble methodology's main aim is to somehow aggregate or summarize estimates from multiple models. In some cases this is aggregating different bootstrap estimates or Monte Carlo estimates, but others involve combining the estimates from starkly different models. When you look up "ensemble methods", especially in ESL, they mention boosting, bagging, bumping, random forests, and the EM algorithm. Question is: is this all of them? Or more generally, are all so-called ensemble methods somehow contained within these classes? Or is there a more general term that I'm missing? The list so far: Boosting Bagging Bumping Random forests EM algorithm Can you add to this?
