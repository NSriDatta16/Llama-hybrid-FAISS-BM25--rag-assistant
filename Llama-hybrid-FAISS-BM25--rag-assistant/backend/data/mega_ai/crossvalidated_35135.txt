Discrete distributions are not normal. The binomial can be approximated by a normal in large samples due to the central limit theorem. The same can be said for sample averages from discrete distributions. For discrete distributions it is not uncommon to test to see if a distribution fits a binomial or a Poisson or a geometric distribution. The chi square goodness of fit test is the most common way. These procedures test hypotheses, so they are significance tests. But they do test for goodness of fit.
