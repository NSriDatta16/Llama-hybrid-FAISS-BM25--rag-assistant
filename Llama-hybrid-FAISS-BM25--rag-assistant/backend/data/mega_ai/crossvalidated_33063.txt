Estimation the standard error of correlated (binomial) variables

Say we have N voters from some group (N binomial variables). Each voter has a preference on voting about some issue (probability of "success" p), which depends on the preferences of other voters. Given a sample of votes for each voter (an estimation of their preference on that issue), and an estimation of the correlation matrix between each two voters. Can we give a better estimation of the standard error of the average of the proportions (than the one offered by the standard $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$?
