This would be the most basic procedure behind any such simulation: Type I errors: Have the computer generate a set (of size $n$) of pseudorandom numbers that conform to a particular distribution (the normal would be most typical). Generate a second identical set (i.e., same distribution, parameters, and size). Conduct a statistical test on these data (as I have described this, a t-test would be appropriate). Store the resulting p-value. Iterate over (repeat) the above procedure many times (e.g., 10k is popular). Determine the proportion of observed p-values fall below your chosen $\alpha$ level (typically .05). (Note that this observed proportion ought to be very close to $\alpha$.) Type II errors (modify the above procedure as follows): For the second step: Generate a second set of pseudorandom numbers that differ from the first set in a pre-specified way (typically the mean would differ by some amount). On the sixth step: the proportion of observed p-values below $\alpha$ will almost certainly differ from $\alpha$ by a large amount. The observed proportion is an estimate of the statistical power of your test for that exact situation (i.e., data from those distributions, with those parameters, with those $n$'s). Using simulations in a manner like this to explore properties of tests or situations, or to conduct power analyses is very common. Moreover, they have been commonly used on this site to demonstrate / explain statistical concepts. Here are some threads you can explore if you want: Here is an example where I used such a simulation to show that power decreases as the two group sizes become increasingly unequal: How should one interpret the comparison of means from different sample sizes? This is a very extensive discussion of using simulations to assess power: Simulation of logistic regression power analysis - designed experiments . A broader discussion of using simulations to understand statistical concepts can be found here: Using computer simulations to better understand statistical concepts at the graduate level .
