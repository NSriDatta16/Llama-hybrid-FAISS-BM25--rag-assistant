Does PCA preserve convexity of a space?

I have a cluster $C$ of points in a high dimensional space $\mathbb R^n$ . I want to know whether this cluster is convex or not. How can i study this? I thought of projecting $C$ on $\mathbb R^2$ to visualize it using Mapper or PCA. If the projection of $C$ on $\mathbb R^2$ is convex, can i assume that it is convex? On the other hand, if the projection of $C$ is non convex, can i assume that $C$ is non convex? Thank you!
