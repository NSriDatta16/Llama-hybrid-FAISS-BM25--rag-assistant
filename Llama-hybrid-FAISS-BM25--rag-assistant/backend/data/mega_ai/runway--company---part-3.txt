eate promotional materials without requiring traditional photoshoots and to accelerate pre-visualization during development. According to AMC Networks executive Stephanie Mitchko, the partnership aims to "enhance both how we market and how we create" while providing creative partners with tools to "fully realize the stories they want to tell." Lionsgate In September 2024, Runway announced a partnership with Lionsgate Entertainment to create a custom AI video generation model trained on the studio's proprietary catalog of over 20,000 film and television titles. The custom model is designed exclusively for Lionsgate's use and cannot be accessed by other Runway users. The partnership, described as the first of its kind between an AI company and a major Hollywood studio, allows Lionsgate filmmakers, directors, and creative talent to use AI-generated cinematic video for pre-production and post-production processes. Tribeca Film Festival Runway has partnered with the Tribeca Film Festival since 2024 to showcase AI-generated films and explore the integration of artificial intelligence in filmmaking. The collaboration includes a programming partnership called "Human Powered," which features short films and music videos created using AI tools, followed by Q&A sessions with filmmakers. The Tribeca Film Festival is also a recurring partner at Runway’s AI Film Festival. The partnership has grown significantly, with Runway's AI Film Festival receiving around 3,000 submissions in 2024, a ten-fold increase from the previous year. Tribeca CEO Jane Rosenthal has emphasized the importance of working directly with AI companies to foster dialogue about the technology's role in filmmaking rather than avoiding or fighting it. Education Runway is incorporated into design and filmmaking curricula at major universities including NYU Tisch School of the Arts, UCLA, RISD, and Harvard among others. The company offers discounted resources and support to educators through their "Runway for Educators" program, working with institutions to ensure classes and students have access to AI creative tools. AI film initiatives AI Film Festival Runway has hosted an annual AI Film Festival (AIFF) since 2023 to showcase films created using artificial intelligence tools. The festival has experienced dramatic growth, expanding from 300 submissions and screenings in small New York City theaters in its inaugural year to over 6,000 submissions by 2025. The 2025 festival culminated in a sold-out screening at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall, drawing filmmakers and audiences from around the world. The festival serves as a platform for emerging filmmakers to explore the creative possibilities of AI-assisted storytelling and is considered by many to have become a significant event in the intersection of technology and cinema. Gen:48 Runway organizes the Gen:48 short film competition, a rapid-fire filmmaking challenge that gives participants 48 hours and free AI generation credits to create short films between 1-4 minutes in length. The competition format is designed to encourage experimentation with AI tools under time constraints, fostering innovation in AI-assisted filmmaking. The first edition launched in October 2023, followed by a second edition in February 2024, and subsequent competitions continuing through 2025. The August 2025 "Aleph Edition" marked the fifth iteration of the competition. Participants receive Runway credits and temporary unlimited access to Runway's tools during the 48-hour period. The competition has become a notable fixture in the AI filmmaking community, with winners receiving prizes including cash prizes, Runway credits, and the opportunity to screen their films at the AI Film Festival.
