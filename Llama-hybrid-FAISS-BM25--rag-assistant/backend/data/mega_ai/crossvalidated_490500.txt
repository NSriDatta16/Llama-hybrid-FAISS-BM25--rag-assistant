basic questions about expected value

I'm trying to learn machine learning and I'm filling in the gaps in my knowledge as I go along. I see from this definition that $$ E[X] = \int_{\mathbb{R}} xf(x) dx $$ But what is $E[\hat{\beta}|X]$ ? It is defined here . Is it expected value of $\hat{\beta}$ given $X$ ?
