Finding intersections

Given a scenario where there are millions of potentially overlapping bounding boxes of variable sizes less the 5km in width. Create a fast function with the arguments findIntersections(Longitude,Latitude,Radius) and the output is a list of those bounding boxes ids where each bounding box origin is inside the perimeter of the function argument dimensions. How do I solve this problem elegantly?
