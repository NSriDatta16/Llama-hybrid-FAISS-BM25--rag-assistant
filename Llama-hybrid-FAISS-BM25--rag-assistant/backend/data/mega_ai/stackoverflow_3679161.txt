How to cap memory usage by Extensible Storage Engine (JetBlue)?

I have an app that every so often hits a ESE database quite hard and then stops for a long time. After hitting the database memory usage goes way up (over 150MB) and stays high. I'm assuming ESE has lots of cached data. Is there a way to cap the memory usage by ESE? I'm happy to suffer any perf hit the only way I've seen to drop the memory usage is to close the DB
