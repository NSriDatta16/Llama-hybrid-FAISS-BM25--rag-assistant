I created a solution for you that I think will fit your situation. I created it based off of the song playlist methodology. I created an xml document where you would list each of your scripts individually and in another node in the same document you list the scripts you want to copy for each project. I have created a working example of this below. Though it is not elegant when it comes to managing a few hundred script files or alot of projects but it gets the job done. PS1 Script [xml]$XML = gc "C:\XMLFile1.xml" $Scripts = $XML.Root.Scripts.Script $Projects = $XML.Root.Projects.Project foreach($Project in $Projects){ $ProjectLocation = $Project.CopyPath $ProjectScripts = $Project.Script foreach($Script in $ProjectScripts){ $ScriptPath = ($Scripts|?{$_.ID -eq $Script.ID}|Select Path).Path Copy-Item -Path $ScriptPath -Destination $ProjectLocation } } XMLFile
