In most organizations, all source files have to begin with a legal blurb. If you're really lucky, it's just a one-liner, but in most cases it's a really long block of legalese. As a result, few people ever read these. Our eye just travels to the first program element and then goes up to its documentation. So if you want to write anything, write it in association with the topmost program element, not the file. Any other bookkeeping information should generally be part of your version control, not maintained (poorly) in the file itself.
