In a regression equation, the coefficient for the intercept is the estimated value of the outcome when all of the predictors are equal to zero. In a case like this where continuous predictors have been standardized but binary predictors have been coded as 0 and 1, the intercept represents the estimated value of the outcome for the mean value of the continuous predictor(s) and whatever level of the binary predictor(s) is coded as 0. To make it a little more concrete, imagine I have two predictors, gender (male: 0, female:1) and age (ranging from 20-40, mean of 30). If I standardise age, and fit the regression model and get the following coefficients predictor beta Intercept 5 Gender 10 Age 1 then the intercept tells us that for a male of average age (i.e. 30), the estimated outcome would be 5 ($5 + 0\times10 + 0\times1$). For a female of average age, the estimated outcome would be 15 ($5 + 1\times10 + 0\times1$). As the number of predictors increase, interpretation may become a little more difficult, but the basic point remains. The intercept is the estimated value of $y$ when all $x$s are zero.
