The purpose of a question like this in an exam is not to see if you know the answer. (There doesn't need to be a right answer.) Rather, it is to determine whether the student has developed the ability to think and reason within the subject domain. If I were to answer this question I would observe: a) An actor-model is very much a merging of object-orientation with coroutines, in the sense that actors (agents) could receive and process messages concurrently. b) The real reason coroutines are not often in OOP languages is the same as the reason coroutines are not often in any mainstream language, viz. coroutines are difficult to implement in the presence of a conventional stack. My response is almost certainly to late to help the original poster. I thought I'd respond anyway as coroutines and other forms of concurrency are currently a popular topic.
