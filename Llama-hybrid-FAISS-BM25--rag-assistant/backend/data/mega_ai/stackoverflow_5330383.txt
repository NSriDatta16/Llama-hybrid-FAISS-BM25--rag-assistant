Excel VBA question - If then ElseIf statement

I have a VBA conditional function I hacked together (I'm a noob) that checks for a name in a cell and then returns appropriate variations if one of the conditions is true, otherwise it returns a blank "". Instead of returning a blank, I'd like it to return the default cell value. As an example, I have the following cells and results based on my function: Cells A B 1 Bob Bob Rob Robert 2 Mike Mike Michael 3 Dan Dan Daniel 4 Scott I'd like the result for B4 to return the default value in A4 (Scott), rather then a blank, like this: Cells A B 1 Bob Bob Rob Robert 2 Mike Mike Michael 3 Dan Dan Daniel 4 Scott Scott Any help would be appreciated: Here's my function (abbreviated version without all names included in ElseIf): Function NameList(pVal As String) As String If pVal = "Bob" Then NameList = "Bob Rob Robert" ElseIf pVal = "Mike" Then NameList = "Mike Michael" ElseIf pVal = "Dan" Then NameList = "Dan Daniel" Else NameList = "" End If End Function Thanks!
