When you compile an application there might be errors and warnings which will be shown at the errors window. When you run the application errors will no longer be shown in Visual Studio but depending on how your application is organized it will either crash or handle them gracefully. Also notice that if you try to run the application with F5 or Ctrl+F5 Visual Studio will try to compile it first and if there are compile-time errors and warnings they will be shown.
