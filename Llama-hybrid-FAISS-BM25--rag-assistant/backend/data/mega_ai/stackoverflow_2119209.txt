How to bind objects list to infragistics data grid?

Pretty simple task, but the source code doesn't do required job... Please advise. There is Products collection in the class (approach is based on the MVVm pattern, but that is not influe on the current issue): public class ProductWindowViewModel : WorkspaceViewModel // implements INotifyPropertyChanged { public ProductWindowViewModel() { Products = new List (ProductService.Instance.Repository.GetAll()); } List Products { get; set; } } Here is class declaration: public class Product : IEntity { #region Public Properties public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public string Description { get; set; } public int Cost { get; set; } #endregion } The class instance is binded to the window's Grid data context: ProductWindow wnd = new ProductWindow(); wnd.MainGrid.DataContext = new ProductWindowViewModel(); wnd.ShowDialog(); And here is xaml code of the window: The xamDataGrid sampe is the same. overall code is pretty simple, but doesn't work. Does anybody know why? Any thoughts are welcome. How could I debug binding to resolve the problem himselft? Thanks.
