For the sake of keeping stuff together, for easier lookup, instead of normalizing the data, I'm regurgitating some parts of the answers on the other question pointed out by Paolo Bergantino, that show benefits of XML: Favor XML over JSON when any of these is true: You need message validation You're using XSLT Your messages include a lot of marked-up text You need to interoperate with environments that don't support JSON -Robert Rossney You need to process the data on the client, and you can leverage XSL for that. Chances are the XML + XSL chain will work faster than JSON + JavaScript especially for big chunks of data. One good case is to convert the data into an HTML snippet. -Eugene Lazutkin I'd choose XML over JSON if I need to validate the chunk of incoming data, because XML nativly supports this through XSD. -lowglider However JSON is missing both attributes namespacing -null
