I found out that the distribution is a compound distribution of Poisson or Binomial with the uniform distribution. The steps below is how I found this out. Use a theoretic starting point When you are seeking for a certain distribution it is helpful to start thinking about the process that generates the data. In your case it is imaginable that a single individual will behave randomly according to some Poisson or binomial distribution with a given rate or probability which may differ from individual to individual. Then the ensemble of all individuals can be described by a compound distribution . Trying different models. Initially I thought of the beta-binomial distribution which is a common distribution to model an over-dispersed binomial distribution (the function is easy to describe and there are there is lots of software/programming-language that have this standard available). However the beta-binomial was not able to model such low kurtosis. Then I thought of a continuous distribution as the mixing distribution. A trial by mixing 21 distributions with varying parameters ($p$ between 0.5 and 1.5 times the average $p$) showed that this works well and then I worked it out more precisely by formulating the exact function and using some optimizer to fine tune the parameters. The final model Let $M$ be the total number of users and let $N$ be the total number of calls. Both Poisson and binomial distributions fit your data since for small $p$ and large $N$ the $\text{Binom}(N,p)$ is nearly the same as $\text{Pois}(p*N)$. You have: $$ X \sim \text{Binom}(N,p) \qquad \text{ or } \qquad X \sim \text{Pois}(N*p) $$ with $p$ itself being distributed according to a uniform distribution $$p \sim \text{Unif}(0.5277 M^{-1}, 1.5186 M^{-1} ) $$ The compound distribution is $$f_{binom*unif}(k) = \int_{p_{min}}^{p_{max}} f_{unif}(p) f_{binom}(k,p) dp $$ or $$f_{Poisson*unif}(k) = \int_{p_{min}}^{p_{max}} f_{unif}(p) f_{Poisson}(k,Np) dp $$ which involves integrals like $\int_{p_{min}}^{p_{max}} x^a(1-x)^b dx$ or $\int_{Np_{min}}^{Np_{max}} x^ae^{-x} dx$ which can be expressed in terms of incomplete Beta and Gamma functions. The details are, I hope, clear from the code at the end which creates the plot below showing a histogram using the data from your other question ( How to perform goodness of fit test and how to assign probability with uniform distribution? ) and superimposed a line for the calculated/fitted numbers. library(zipfR) # provides incomplete Beta and Gamma functions # data nr
