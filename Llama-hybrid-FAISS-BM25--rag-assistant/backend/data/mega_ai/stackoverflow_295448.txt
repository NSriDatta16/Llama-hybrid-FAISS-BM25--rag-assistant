Sharepoint: How do I filter a document library view to show the contents of a subfolder?

A number of business areas I work with use a folder structure to organise their Sharepoint housed documents (not ideal I know, but we're stuck with it). I would like to use a web part page to present a number of views of their document libraries based on the subfolders that the documents appear in, but this is proving more difficult than I had thought. Has anyone overcome this problem in the past?
