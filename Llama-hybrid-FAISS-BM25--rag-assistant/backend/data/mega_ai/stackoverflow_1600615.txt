#pragma warning( disable:4001) Put this somewhere to be compiled before the lines with problems. For more details, see #pragma warning documentation in MSDN. Later edit Use the option from Visual C++ to display the include files when compiling (it should be somewhere in the advanced options in C++ section). It can provide an idea where sal.h is included. Probably some of the VC libraries include this header indirectly. If it is a C header, I wonder why they used C++ style comments...
