It depends on some factors. Using mean or median is not always the key to imputing missing values. I would agree that certainly mean and median imputation is the most famous and used method when it comes to handling missing data. However, there are other ways to do that. First of all, you do not want to change the distribution of the data. You have to place values so that the variance is not much. To ensure you are doing it right, you can look at the KDE plots before and after the imputation or overlap them. The variance will be clear. You can also use other techniques, such as , , , . Some of the techniques also record the importance of the missing data. you Can learn about these in the following link https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6958745603480698880/ You can also find the codes in https://github.com/protikmostafa083/Machine-Learning-Workbook/blob/main/Feature%20Engineering/Feature_Engineering_Handling_Missing_Values.ipynb You can use an algorithm that is robust to missing values, such as k-NN, random forest, Naive Bayes etc.
