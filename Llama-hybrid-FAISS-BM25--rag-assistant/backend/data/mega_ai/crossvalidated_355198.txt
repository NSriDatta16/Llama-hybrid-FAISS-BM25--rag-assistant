Why isn't Matlab's Classification Learner the End All?

After building some machine learning models in Python, R and Matlab, I found the latter's Classification Learner App to be immensely powerful. In the time it took me to build a single model in Python or R, I churned out 250 in Matlab. Why don't auto-generated models features dominate when it comes to model creation? Also, why doesn't Matlab dominate as a result?
