Nginx configuration with Magento 1.8

anybody knows how to configure server {} in configuration file of nginx server? I have something like this below: server { server_name local.com; root some_path; index index.php; #location / { #try_files $uri $uri/ index.php; #proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000; #} # set a nice expire for assets #location ~* "^.+\.(jpe?g|gif|css|png|js|ico|pdf|zip|tar|t?gz|mp3|wav|swf)$" { # expires max; # add_header Cache-Control public; #} # the downloader has its own index.php that needs to be used #location ~* ^(/downloader|/js|/404|/report)(.*) { # include fastcgi_params; # fastcgi_index index.php; # fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$1/index.php$1; # fastcgi_read_timeout 600; # fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000; #} location ~* \.php { include fastcgi_params; fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name; fastcgi_read_timeout 18000; fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000; } #location ~* ^(/index.php)?(.*) { # include fastcgi_params; # fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root/index.php$1; # fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000; # fastcgi_read_timeout 18000; #} } Browser returns blank page and doesn't exec php... EDIT: After spending some time with nginx configuration and php stuff i ended on having site that in some cases load properly and in some not... Ex: I have two pages that are identical, but for some reason first is loading lie a charm, and second is loading partially... Sometimes page is loading half way... Nginx isn't logging anything... And for some reason when i try to go to backend, nginx loads frontend with backend url :/ Does anybody can provide me with other magento 1.8 configuration ?
