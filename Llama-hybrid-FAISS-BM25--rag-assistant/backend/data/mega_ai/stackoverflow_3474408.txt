The best two I know of are the Wikipedia page and Stroustrup's FAQ . I really wouldn't recommend reading the standard until you know what you're looking for. Besides being significantly larger than the C++03 standard, the organization and clarity has gotten somewhat worse in parts. If you're only going to do one lecture on "advanced C++", you might focus on C++0x features which were adopted from other common sources, such as boost::smart_ptr and std::tr1::unordered_map . Such things are ahead of the curve on adoption.
