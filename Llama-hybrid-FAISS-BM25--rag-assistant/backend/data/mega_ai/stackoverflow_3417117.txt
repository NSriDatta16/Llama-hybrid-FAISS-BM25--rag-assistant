Flex Builder 4 Spark equivalent to Yahoo Astra Flash Layout Dragbar

I am currently looking at a couple of ways to integrate UI components into my current Flash project. I usually use Flash Develop and I have recently been evaluating the Yahoo Astra Flash library and I really like the following example (especially the horizontal and vertical drag bars): http://developer.yahoo.com/flash/astra-flash/layout-containers/examples/FeedReader/FeedReader.html Today I was evaluating the new Spark components in Flex Builder 4 and looked to building an interface in a similar way. I liked the overall workflow system of FB4 and it feels like my most preferable IDE (eclipse version). Question, is there was a way that I can duplicate the same kind of screen mechanisims found in the above example, using the Spark layout system in FB4. I've been playing with the components, and nothing is jumping out at me as prebuilt layout drag bars per-se, and if there isn't anything prebuilt, is there anyway that this could be acheived simply?! :) Any help, really appreciated. Thanks
