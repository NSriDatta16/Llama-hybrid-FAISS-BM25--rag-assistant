I don't know anything about optics, but keep in mind that PCA doesn't know anything about optics, either. It is a pretty low-level bit of linear algebra that works by recoding the data into high-variance but uncorrelated components. It comes with no guarantees that the first few principal components will have any substantive meaning. This will only happen to the degree that substantive relationships give rise to shared variance.
