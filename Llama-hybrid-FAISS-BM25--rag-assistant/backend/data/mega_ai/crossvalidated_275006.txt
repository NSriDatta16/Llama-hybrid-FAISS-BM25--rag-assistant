R, linear regressions and contingency tables

I'm sorry this may be very simple and stupid but I'm new to R. I've tried everywhere on the net to find a solution but nothing. I have this data set: Table They show the distribution of 1607 women interviewed according to age, education, desire for more children and current use of contraception. The task is to understand how contraceptive use depends on age, education, and fertility intentions. I think I need to use logistic regression with the glm formula but I can't use the formula like this: glm(using~age+education+wantsMore, family = binomial,data = Table) Because "using" is not between 0 or 1, it shows frequencies. In class I've always had data set instead of this sort of contingency table. How can I solve this? If I don't have a column with "0" and "1" I don't really know where to start. I am really new to R so I apologize again but I really need to sort this out. I've defined the explanatory variable with two levels: 1=notUsing, 0=using contraception = as.factor(c(1,0)) response But I have this error: Error in model.frame.default(formula = response ~ contraception, drop.unused.levels = TRUE) : variable lengths differ (found for 'contraception') This may not be the solution.
