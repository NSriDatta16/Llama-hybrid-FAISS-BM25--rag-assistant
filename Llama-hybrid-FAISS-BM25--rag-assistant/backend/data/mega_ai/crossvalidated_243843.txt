The acf of the residuals suggest a possible seasonal structure perhaps being dampened by all the anomalies/level shifts/time trends etc that might be in the noise process. Secondarily think about a random process that has a large variance. It's history/plot will "look" similar to yours. The forecast for this data would then be a constant with commensurately wide limits. If you create bootstrap forecasts (via monte carlo resampling the model residuals ) then one can obtain a family of forecasts for each future period. This family of forecasts can then lead to possible traces (via simulation) for the future ... all of which will average to the baseline forecast.
