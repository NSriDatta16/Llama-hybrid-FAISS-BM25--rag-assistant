Android API for detecting new media from inbuilt camera & mic

Is there any elegant way in the Android API for detecting new media when it is written to the device? I’m mainly interested in photos taken by the camera, video taken by the camera and audio recorded from the mic. My current thinking is to periodically scan each media content provider and filter based on last scan time. I’m just wondering if there is some service I can get realtime notifications.
