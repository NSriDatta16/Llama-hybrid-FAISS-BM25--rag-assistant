Data mining, domain knowledge and visualization

In my book ( Introduction to data mining by Tan, Steinbach and Kumar - chapter 3), in the section about visualization, it's written: Another general motivation for visualization is to make use of the domain knowledge that is "locked up in people's heads." While the use of domain knowledge is an important task in data mining, it is often difficult or impossible to fully utilize such knowledge in statistical or algorithmic tools. In some cases, an analysis can be performed using non-visual tools, and then the results presented visually for evaluation by the domain expert. In other cases, having a domain specialist examine visualizations of the data may be the best way of finding patterns of interest since, by using domain knowledge, a person can often quickly eliminate many uninteresting patterns and direct the focus to the patterns that are important. I don't fully understand it. What's meant by domain knowledge ? Who is a domain expert or specialist? Could someone explain the paragraph in simple terms?
