Machine learning techniques for time series estimation - forecasting price

Can anyone recommend any machine learning techniques for time series estimation? I have a series of times $t_{1}...t_{n}$, each having a set of associated features $f_{1}...f_{m}$, and a value $x$. I want to estimate the value of $x$ for the next time in the series given a set of corresponding features $f_{1}...f_{n}$. Thanks Edit: Just to add clarification, this is for price forecasting, where x is a price and the features will be extracted from news articles.
