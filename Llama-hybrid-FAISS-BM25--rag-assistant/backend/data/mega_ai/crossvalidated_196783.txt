How Neural Networks' prediction in R works on periodic data?

I have a data set x x As my entries with a period of 4. And now if I call library(forecast) forecast(nnetar(x)) Then neural networks should predict # 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 9 Knowing there is a periodicity. But the result observed is something like # 7 8 9 6 7 5 4 9 So, any answer on how neural networks' prediction works for periodic data?
