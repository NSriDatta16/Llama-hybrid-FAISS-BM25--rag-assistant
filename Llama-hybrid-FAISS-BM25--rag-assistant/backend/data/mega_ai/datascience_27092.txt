What are some methodologies for performing feature selection for simple feed-forward neural networks?

In multiple linear regression there is an F-test which can be used to evaluate whether or not a covariate has a meaningful impact on a model. This is typically done through either a forward selection or backwards selection algorithm. Does such a meaningful process exist for neural networks as well? The only reason I ask is because working with neural nets is an inherently stochastic process, so I do not know how I should try and get accurate bounds for the F-statistic .
