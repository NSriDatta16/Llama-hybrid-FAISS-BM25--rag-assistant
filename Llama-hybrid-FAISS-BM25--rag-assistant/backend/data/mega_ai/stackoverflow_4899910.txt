Figured this out. It does have to do with the encoding, in a way. It appears that the PNG encoding is doing weird things. I tried JPEG and GIF encodings and both work in the ReportViewer and PDF export. I tried changing to different PNGs (transparency and non-transparent) and had various distortion issues. It is my suggestion that if using an embedded image with the ReportViewer that will be exported to PDF that you should use GIFs or JPEGs for embedding in your RDLC.
