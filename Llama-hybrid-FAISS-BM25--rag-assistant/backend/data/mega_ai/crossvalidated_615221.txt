I think you're on the right track. Firstly, the "simple" approach is often called "The Marginal Odds Ratio" or "The Unadjusted Odds Ratio". Marginal here means marginalizing over the other variables as you mentioned. Conversely, the odds ratios obtained from logistic regression might be referred to as "Adjusted Odds Ratios". I will use those terms here. In my opinion, the advantage is that the Odds Ratio calculated using Logistic Regression is "adjusted" to take into account the influence of other variables - whereas the Odds Ratio calculated using the simple way does not take into account the influence of other variables. This is the main advantage of adjusted estimates, yes. Its very easy to create an example where the marginal estimate might give you the wrong sign, for example.
