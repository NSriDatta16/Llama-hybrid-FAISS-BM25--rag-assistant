Logistic regression, Fisher Exact test, or am I just completely off?

I'm having a hard time determining an appropriate way to analyze a large dataset for a city's street tree inventory. I'm attempting to statistically support if any given species is more likely to produce sidewalk damage. Personally, I am under the impression that the planter size is a much more relevant variable for predicting the likelihood of sidewalk damage. An example of how the raw data looks: Species | Planter size| SidewalkDamage Red maple | 5 | Present Red maple | 5 | Absent Red maple | 5 | Absent Red maple | 5 | Absent Norway Maple | 4 | Present Norway Maple | 4 | Present Norway Maple | 4 | Absent Norway Maple | 6 | Present ... Then This continues on for a 24,000 more measures... While working with the data in this form it makes the most sense to me to use a logistic regression (Two Independent Variables one categorical the other continuous but readily adapted into a categorical and a binomial response), but from my understanding this doesn't seem like it will work because I have multiple measures for any given species. My next thought was to try and analyze the data in a summarized form: An example table: Instances of sidewalk damage Planter Size Species | 0-4 ft| 4-8 ft| 8-12 ft| 12ft+ Red Maple | 30 | 20 | 2 | 8 Norway Maple | 58 | 22 | 3 | 0 Doug Fir | 6 | 0 | 4 | 0 Elm | 12 | 8 | 0 | 1 Birch | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 ...This continues on for a couple hundred species... In this form I was thinking about using a Fisher exact test (or whatever permutation of a chi squared is actually most applicable). The issue that I am having with trying to analyze the data in this form is that I'm completely disregarding the measures without instances of sidewalk damage and have null values in any given planter category. These issues potentially lead to species that may have drastically more measures (something like 5000 red maples vs 100 elms sampled) are disproportionately being represented in my analysis and additionally I have just heard anecdotally that having null values in my table is a headache for a lot of statistical analyses. I'm looking for some guidance of how to proceed from here. I feel like I've been chasing my tail on how to approach this and could definitely use some insight from someone with an actual statistical background.
