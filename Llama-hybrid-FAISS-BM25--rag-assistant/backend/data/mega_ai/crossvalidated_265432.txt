There are many introductions to ABC, available, most of them on arXiv, so I am rather surprised the OP could only find videos! I agree with the earlier answer that the Wikipedia entry is very good; it actually stemmed from a PLoS Computational Biology article (that I refereed). In addition to Mark Beaumont's superb review, let me refer the OP to the depository of ABC related papers . Which was run by Erkan Buzbas from the University of Idaho till 2015. For more recent papers and extensions, you may check the 2015 and 2016 NIPS workshops on the topic, the ABC'ruise workshop, and our supremely recent ABC'ory workshop at BIRS, Banff, that contains videos for most talks. Some chapters of The Handbook of Approximate Bayesian Computation edited by Sisson, Fan and Beaumont are available on arXiv as well, and the book should be out very soon. The slides of several courses I gave on ABC are to be found on slideshare and range from one hour to ten hours presentations .
