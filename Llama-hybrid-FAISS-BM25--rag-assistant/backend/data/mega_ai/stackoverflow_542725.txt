get one Attribute id, set as another Attribute id

I'm currently using scriptaculous and prototype to drag/drop elements from one div to another, and append a new Element based on the 'src' of the element that is dropped, creating a new draggable out of it. What I need to do is assign the id of the dropped element to the new one once it is created. I've tried a ton of different approaches, here is the latest: $$('.image').each(function(stack) { new Draggable(stack, { revert: true, ghosting: true }); }); ... onDrop: function(stack) { var added = new Element('img'); added.src = stack.readAttribute('src'); var imageid = stack.identify(); added.setAttribute('id', imageid); obviously I'm a bit of a novice, and imagine I am way off by now. Appreciate any help.
