FREAK is only a feature descriptor, so in order to use it you must provide a set of keypoints for it to extract your features e.g., FAST, AGAST, SIFT’s keypoint detector, etc. The original paper uses AGAST . You might need to process the keypoints since the region requirements are different (A keypoint for SURF might lay too close on the border to compute FREAK). keypoints = SomeDetector(image) freakExtractor = cv2.xfeatures2d.FREAK_create() keypoints,descriptors= freakExtractor.compute(image,keypoints) The FREAK: Fast Retina Keypoint paper says: Rostenand and Drummond proposed in [A] the FAST criterion for corner detection, improved by Mair et al. in [B] with their AGAST detector. The latter is a fast algorithm to locate keypoints. The detector used in BRISK by Leutenegger et al. in [C] is a multi-scale AGAST. They search for maxima in scale-space using the FAST score as a measure of saliency. We use the same detector for our evaluation of FREAK. [A] E. Rosten and T. Drummond.
