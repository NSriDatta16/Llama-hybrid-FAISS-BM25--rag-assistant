WPF and Very Large Images

Is there anything I can do to help manage the sheer amount of memory WPF uses to render huge images - potentially anything up to 10,000 x 10,000? I need to maintain the quality as zooming is key, but loading the Image control seems to require anything from 50 - 700MB of memory usage :S I'm not doing anything particularly clever with loading the image at the moment: BitmapImage imageSource = new BitmapImage(); imageSource.BeginInit(); imageSource.UriSource = new Uri(imageUrl, UriKind.Absolute); imageSource.CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad; imageSource.EndInit(); image.Source = imageSource;
