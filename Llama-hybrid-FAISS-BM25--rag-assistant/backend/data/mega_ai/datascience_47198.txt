From a bayesian perspective, I would not begin the answer talking about the regularization term. I would rather say what is the prior distribution you are assuming (since this is the starting point in the bayesian framework) and then the regularization term comes up as a consequence, after calculating the log-posterior. Also, I believe that feature selection is called "automatic" in the sense that the regularization term may drive to zero some weights when you minimize the cost function, without the need of selecting the features in a previous step (in practice you may need to do it anyway.)
