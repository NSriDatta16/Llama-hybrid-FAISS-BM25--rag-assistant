Unfortunately you can't force an email client to accept any kind of picture, whether it's embedded or an external URL. What you can do is include your pictures as attachments to the email instead of simply embedding them. That said, different email clients handle attachments in different ways, but GMAIL for example will scan the attachments and then display them below the message. If you want to have your images actually embeded with the text you'll have to settle for the 'Click to allow Images to Display', since it's there for security reasons and is out of your control.
