I think it would be understandable to prevent ActiveX plugins from being loaded on the browser as that would speed up the browsing experience and not to destabilize the browser by memory hogging plugins (Adobe is imho, an example of such). Also due to the recent flaws found in the PDF which would enable a malicious user to arbitrarily control a PC by way of script embedding within the PDF. Would this Pdf2Html do? This is found on Sourceforge by the way. Hope this helps, Best regards, Tom.
