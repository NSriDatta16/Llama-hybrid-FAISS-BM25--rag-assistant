JSF trimming white spaces

HI, I have an input field in which I want to trim any leading/trailing whitespaces. We are using JSF and binding the input field to a backing bean in the jsp using: My question is that besides validation can this be done in the jsp? I know we can also do this using the trim() java function in the Handler, but just wondering if there is a more elegant way to achieve this in JSF. Thanks.
