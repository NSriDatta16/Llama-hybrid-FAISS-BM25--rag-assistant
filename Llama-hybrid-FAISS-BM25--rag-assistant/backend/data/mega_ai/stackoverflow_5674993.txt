How a nib file know's its File's Owner Controller

When one creates a UIViewController and the corresponding nib file, this nib file usually comes with the same name as the controller, but it can be renamed. So, how does IB know which UIViewController this nib file refers to? When one drags from a referencing outlet or from an action, IB only shows the methods for a particular Controller. How is it chosen? When one renames the nib, I wonder whether IB saves the connection between the nib and the UIViewController . Does it seem like there is too much confusion in my head? :) Hope not... Regards, Fak
