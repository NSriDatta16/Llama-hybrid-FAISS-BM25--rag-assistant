Can the forecasts using exponential smoothing be negative in value?

Hello I am trying to forecast using different exponential smoothing methods(Linear and Winter's). For the optimal parameters, I am getting negative values of the forecasats. I am assuming it means that the values will be zero, since it is a sales forecast. I wanted to know if negative values denote something wrong with the model or is it possible to have negative values in forecast. Since it is just a model, I think we can get negative values for certain type of time series.
