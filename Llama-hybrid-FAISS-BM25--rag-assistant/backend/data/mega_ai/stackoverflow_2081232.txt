If you just want to retain the original text, then simply don't pass it to Markdown. Markdown is for one thing only: turning Markdown-formatted text into HTML. If you want Markdown to format it in something other than HTML with a different set of transformation rules, then alas, you'll have to write your own transformer. If you want to get the "text-only" version of already-HTML-formatted Markdown, you can just strip the HTML tags. This is what StackOverflow does.
