How to check statistically significant relationship between images and the values stored in the CSV file?

I am trying to perform a regression task with CNN. I am using some images as the predictors, and the independent variable is coming from a CSV file. The images are sets of satellite images and the csv file corresponds to crop growth. My aim before going through CNN is to find out if the values within csv file correlate with image channels. The main question is which image channels are more effective/significant to predict the crop growth. Since I have large number of image channels, I would like to know first if I can relate the images with values stored in the CSV file. Can someone suggest which technique I can use to check if there is a statistically significant relationship between the image channels and the CSV file? So, this way I can reduce the dimensionality/the number of image channels, and only utilize those channels which are mostly correlated with the values stored in the CSV file.
