Rewrite Registry File in Windows

I have been trying to find a way to "defragment" the registry on my Windows machine. Firstly, does this make sense? Any benefits in doing this? (Not much love on superuser.com) Secondly, I am looking for a way to rewrite the registry using C/C++ with Windows API. Is there a way to read the registry and write it to a new file getting rid of unused bytes along the way? (I might have to write the new file and then boot into another OS/disk before I can overwrite the original... but I am willing to take that risk.)
