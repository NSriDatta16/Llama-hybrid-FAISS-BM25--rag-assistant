Trade-off between using explicit inputs and using fewer inputs for neural networks

Suppose you have 2 distinct features x1 and x2 with discrete values between 1 and 10. When building a neural network, I have 2 options: Create a new feature x3 = 10*x1 + x2 and use this as the only input. Use both inputs x1 and x2 for the neural network. How can I decide which is the best option? Here is a practical example inspired from poker: You have 7 cards. The first 2 cards are from player 1. The next 2 cards are from player 2 and the last 3 cards are the flop. You want to determine who has the strongest hand. The two options are: Treat each card as a number from 1 to 52. Make two inputs: One for the rank (2,3,4,5,6...J,Q,K,A) and one for the suit (club,diamond,heart,spade). More precisely, I want to understand how choosing each option will affect how much training data is needed, how many neurons in the hidden layer I should use and how much time will be needed for training.
