widespread use of technology has no strong correlation to technological quality. The nakedobject system is difficult to use in combination with type objects: if I'm selling different kinds of products and need different data for different products, it is difficult to constrain the data on the product type. NO lost momentum when they switched licences. (to GPL+Commercial, not the recent move to Apache) Did you take a look at jmatter? [edit] And another one: it makes it obvious to non-programmers if you can deliver. Spring is very much in the technological domain, NO means a developer has to talk to users. Large organisations don't do that.
