Firstly i have some questions for you: What is on line 1388 , 1388 and 1389 Is there any errors being outputted When you reach the final line, do you get an ( $data[0] === null ) You information regarding the memory limit would probably not be the issue that's causing it, as fgetcsv reads a single line per iteration, there is only ever 1 line's worth of data in the memory at one time. Within your lop if your keep placing data into an array, or concatenating them together. this may cause a memory leak but you would have to show more in depth code A CSV File has to be pretty structured for the fgetcsv to be able to parse it correctly, some rules to remember when using CSV Files: The first line must always be the column names All other lines are the data lines: Each element should be separated by a , If a element contains a space or a comma, '\n' , '\r' , '\r\n' , it should be wrapped in double quotes An example of a valid CSV File should be like so: id, firstname, lastname, age, profile_description 0, Robert, Pitt, 22, "this string has spaces, and has a comma" You should validate the the structure is correct, if it is not correct then you should fix this until the parse is able to read the data correctly, you can then cleanly place the data into a new CSV File taking care of all the little incorrect structures.
