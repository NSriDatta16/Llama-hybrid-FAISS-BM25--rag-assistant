Using XAMPP 1.6.7 I installed the community version of Magento. But there seems to be a problem. I am getting the error message 'extension file "curl" is must be loaded'. In another computer, everything seems fine. (the other computer) intel(R) Pentium(R) Dual CPU, E2140 @ 1.60Hz, 1.60 GHz. 504 MB of RAM and XP professional 2002 sp2 My computer is less powerful (Inet Pentium 4 1.6 GHz. with sp2.) Please help me, thanks.
