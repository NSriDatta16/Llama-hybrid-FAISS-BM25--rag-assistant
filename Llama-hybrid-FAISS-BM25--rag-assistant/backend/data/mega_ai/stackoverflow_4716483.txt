Wish I could speak to the PublishTestResults setting, but what appears to be happening is the tool is trying to authenticate across domains or doesn't have the appropriate permissions on the network drop location. Two things you can do: Add the username and password needed to access the droplocation to the Credential Manager of the build agent machine. Verify that this credential has the correct permissions to this network resource. The Credential Manager was introduced in XP and beyond.
