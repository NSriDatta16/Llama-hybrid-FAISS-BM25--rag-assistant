Natural language translation is an incredibly hard problem. Given the limited storage and computational resources available to a mobile device, I'd say that your best bet would be to leverage an existing online service, like Google's translation engine. Otherwise, you could check out the libraries mentioned in this question: " Your favorite natural language parser? " to parse the language. Translation after that point will be another challenge. The answers to this question point out one or two resources for Python, but that's not really compatible with the iPhone.
