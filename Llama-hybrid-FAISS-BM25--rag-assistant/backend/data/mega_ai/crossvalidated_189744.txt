For the polynomial kernel, specify kernel='poly' and also try also rescaling your data, as well as tuning your parameters C and epsilon as Matthew described. >>> from sklearn import preprocessing >>> X = [[ 1., -1., 2.], ... [ 2., 0., 0.], ... [ 0., 1., -1.]] >>> X_scaled = preprocessing.scale(X) >>> X_scaled array([[ 0. ..., -1.22..., 1.33...], [ 1.22..., 0. ..., -0.26...], [-1.22..., 1.22..., -1.06...]]) "The data will then have zero mean and unit variance".
