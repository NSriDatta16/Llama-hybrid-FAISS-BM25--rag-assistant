predictive modeling: comparing actual and predicted values in terms of accuracy

I have applied a predictive model on a hold out data set on which I know actual values of the target variable. I wonder how to compare actual and predicted forecasted values, verifying whether on average the two values are statistically the same. I am not assessing the precision of estimate, but the accuracy: I want to assess whether on average $\hat{Y_i}=Y_i$. I am not bothering about the precision (i.e. RMSE or $R^2$) but in non - distortion (i.e. $E \left[ \hat{Y_i} \right]$=$Y_i$). I have used paired sample t.test but I am not sure whether this is the right approach to assess accuracy.
