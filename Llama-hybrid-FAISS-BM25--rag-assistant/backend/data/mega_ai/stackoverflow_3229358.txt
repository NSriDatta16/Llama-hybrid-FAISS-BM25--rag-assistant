IDisposable and WCF

At work, I've found a helper class to manage WCF Services which implements IDisposable and has a ServiceAgent that derives from System.ServiceModel.ClientBase. The Dispose() method closes all the opened WCF services. The helper exposes methods that wraps calls to the methods of the ServiceAgent. Each method is build on that pattern: public void WCFMethod1() { using(this) { this.ServiceAgent.WCFMethod1(); } } public override void Dispose() { try { this.ServiceAgent.Close(); } catch { this.ServiceAgent.Abort(); } finally { this.ServiceAgent = null; } } Here's the question: is the use of using(this) a good practice?
