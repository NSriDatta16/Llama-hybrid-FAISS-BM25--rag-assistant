Compound poisson process: Average size of claim will exceed £110

"An insurance company receives claims at a rate of two per week, the size of a claim in pounds having mean 100 and standard deviation 50. Assuming the compound Poisson process as a model, and using normal approximations, find the probabilities that, in a period of 50 weeks the average size of claim will exceed £110". As it's a PP, I have $$Q(t) = \sum_i^{N(t)} Y_i$$ I also have $\mu = 100$ and $\sigma = 50$. I want to work out $P\left(\frac{Q(t)}{N(t)} > 110 \right) \implies P\{Q(t) - 110N(t) > 0\}$ This tells me I have a new compound PP which can be written as $$ \tilde{Q(t)} = \sum_i^{N(t)} (Y_i - 110) $$ Now we want $E[\tilde{Q(t)}]$ and $Var[\tilde{Q(t)}]$ $$ E[\tilde{Q(t)}] = E[Q(t) - 110N(t)] = E[Q(t)] - 110E[N(t)] = \lambda t \mu - 110 \mu = -1000$$ $$ Var[\tilde{Q(t)}] = Var[Q(t)] - 110Var[N(t)] = \lambda t (\sigma^2 + \mu^2) - 110\sigma^2$$ However, this variance is wrong. What is the correct way to work out the variance?
