I've actually used wordpress for the CMS of a code igniter site. This is the method i used to pull page content, not blog content, but maybe you can change it up a little to fit your needs. In my front controller I added the wordpress header file require('/path/to/wp-blog-header.php'); This gives you access to the 2 functions you'll need get_page() – Get the page data from the database wpautop() – Automatically add paragraph tags to page content To get page data $page_data = get_page( 4 ); // Where 4 is the page ID in wordpress If you get this error: Fatal error: Only variables can be passed by reference… You have to do it like this $page_id = 4; $page_data = get_page( $page_id ); because of a bug in certain versions of php Then in the view post_content) ?> Hope this helps EDIT I installed wordpress at /blog in the filesystem. So wordpress actually runs as a blog normally. I just use this method to grab the pages
