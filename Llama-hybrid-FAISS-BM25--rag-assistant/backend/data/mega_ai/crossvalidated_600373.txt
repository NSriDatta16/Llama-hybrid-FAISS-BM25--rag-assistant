You're accidentally asking more than one question. The first is whether the trend relating a continuous exposure and a binary outcome. One possible way to inspect such a trend is to create a non-parametric smoothing function, such as a smoothing spline. x You can also plot the GLM object itself, and pay particular attention to the plot of Pearson residuals versus fitted. Despite the infamous appearance, you can expect that the mean should be 0 and the variance should be constant across all predicted values. They give you a Loess smooth line to deal with this problem. Departures from this could signify a misspecified logistic model. The second question is whether the multivariate association holds, that is controlling for other predictors, U, V, W, does the X,Y relationship meet certain criteria (similarly, controlling for X,V,W does the U,Y relationship ... and so on...). For some reason, people seem to think that plotting the bivariate associations - like you've shown here - does something. Maybe, but dimensionality is complicated that way. A more powerful tool to inspect these relations is a coplot. w Notice what a terrible smoother LOESS is compared to a smoothing spline for binary response - this is because LOESS excludes outliers. Anyway, coplots work well for multivariate data because you expect the plots to be identical when there is no interaction between covariates. And, as above, you expect the smoother to show a nice logistic trend line relating the exposure to response.
