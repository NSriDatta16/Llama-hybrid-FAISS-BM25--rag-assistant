VECM model unable to predict approximately but able to learn the pattern

In the below image VECM model has learnt the pattern but did not predict properly there is a difference in actual and prediction Have used the below dataset to predict the meanpressure:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data/code In what other method we can reduce the difference or is there any other multivariant time series model where it can address the issue. Where with the minimum amount of data the model should use cointegration and predict. So, for that will VECM is suitable? If possible suggest different other methods.
