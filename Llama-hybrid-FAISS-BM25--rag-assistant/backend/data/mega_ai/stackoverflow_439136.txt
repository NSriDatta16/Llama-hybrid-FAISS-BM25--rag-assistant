I don't entirely agree with unwind who says "C and Objective-C are different languages". Objective-C is a strict superset of C. Of course he knows that - his point was that you don't need to completely master C before progressing onto Objective-C. I'll second that (and hopefully have clarified it). But I do think it's worth getting some basics with C first, as most introductory texts on Objective-C will assume a basic knowledge. I don't have any recommendations on that myself, but probably most internet based tutorials will be sufficient for that purpose (remember, you're not trying to master it at this stage). If you want to take it seriously, then "The C Programming Language" by K&R is the classic text. When you you can do some basic hello world programs in C, and understand the type system, pointers and stuff - then pick up a copy of "Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X", by Aaron Hillegass. This is a book about Cocoa that covers Objective-C along the way, but it one of the best presented coverages of the language. It will assume you are coding on a Mac (it's in the context of Cocoa after all). You may be able to follow the pure language stuff using GCC on Windows, but I wouldn't recommend it. If you're going to be working on a Mac eventually, then best to do it at this stage, IMHO. You say you don't have a Mac "powerful enough for programming", but anything that can run OS X would be fine to get your started.
