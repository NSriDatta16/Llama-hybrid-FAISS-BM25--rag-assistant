The column logx(Cumulative Sum) seems to be your source of confusion, even though it is not even needed to compute exp(logx) or the last column. In other words, the first orange column is not needed to revert back to the original time series x , unless you meant to imply that it is actually a data-given blue column. For example, $$e^{\ln x} = e^{\ln 4} \neq 0.8$$ because the exponential cancels the logarithm according to the rule $e^{\ln x} = x$ . Instead, $$e^{\ln x} = e^{\ln 4} = 4$$ already. Had you spotted this obvious mistake in the second orange column, you wouldn't need to start questioning why the calculation of the third orange column isn't working how you expect it to. You're just feeding mistakes down the chain, what do you expect
