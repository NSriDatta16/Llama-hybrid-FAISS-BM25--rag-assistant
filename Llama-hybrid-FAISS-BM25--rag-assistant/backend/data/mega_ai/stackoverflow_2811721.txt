I found this regarding the Roles and Users parameters for the [Authorize] attribute: http://www.robertschultz.org/2009/07/29/multiple-roles-with-authorize-attribute-using-enums-in-asp-net-mvc/ Based on the code in the custom Authorize attribute, it looks to me like the name is probably case-sensitive. Have you tried: [Authorize(Roles="Admin")] You could also try using the custom code in that article so you can get away from using strings.
