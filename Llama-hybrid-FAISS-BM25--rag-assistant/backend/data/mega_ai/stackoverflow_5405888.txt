While your code might be working (with the fix suggested by others) it's not good practice. It's the classic ASP way while you're using ASP.NET - it's like driving 10 MPH with sport car on the highway. One good practice can be to use the Repeater Control - it's still simple and it's much more elegant. The .aspx will now look like this: And to bind the data have such code in the Page_Load function in your code behind: string[] arrPlants = new string[] { "Sacred Datura", "Kambroo", "Wallflower", "Beech 'Retroflexa'", "Zephyr Flower" }; rptPlants.DataSource = arrPlants; rptPlants.DataBind(); In your case just replace arrPlants with your real array, Plants . Feel free to ask for further details or explanations. :)
