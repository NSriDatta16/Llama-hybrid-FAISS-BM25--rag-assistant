Neural Networks

Is there such a thing as a double sided neural networks? I am trying to see if there are already established algorithms in Neural Networks for matching purposes. Lets assume there are two different parties available each with a separate dataset (like men and women in a dating site). Can we start a Neural work on one side (men) to get an output and conduct another neural Network from the other side (women) which could be possibly totally different and find a way to compare (measure the distance or the similarity) of the two outcomes? Assuming to have a large enough set of data would it possible to train both networks simultaneously? I have looked into Siamese Neural networks for instance, but that would not be the answer since in the case of Siamese networks both branches of the network have to be identical.
