I think you might be misunderstanding what Cook's D does. Influential observations are those that, when removed from the sample, cause a noticeable change in the parameter of interest. In this case, it's the slope of the regression line. It would appear from your plot that there is a greater concentration of data points in the lower left quadrant, and so it's feasible that the upper left "outlier" does not sufficiently leverage the slope, whereas the lower right points do because of the relative sparseness of data in that region.
