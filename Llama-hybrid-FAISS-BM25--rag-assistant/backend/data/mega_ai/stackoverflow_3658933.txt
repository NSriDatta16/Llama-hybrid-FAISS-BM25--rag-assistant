How can I make the Excel cell menu update when the keyboard's context menu key is pressed

At the moment, I have code that runs in the Application's SheetBeforeRightClick event, but I've found that this code doesn't run when I press the keyboard's Context Menu key instead of using the right mouse button, which means that I get the wrong menu. I could use the SheetSelectionChange event instead, but I'd imagine this would be quite error prone. Is there a more elegant way of doing it?
