Private Variable Instantiation: When Defined or Within Constructor?

I don't know if this has been asked before, but we're having a discussion about it today at my job. Should private variables (that are shared/static) be instantiated when they are dimensioned/defined, or is it a better practice to do this inside of a constructor? For example, this seems perfectly fine to me... Public Class IpCam Private Const HOST As String = "http://test.com/url/example" Private Shared _Example As New OurClass(HOST) Public Shared ReadOnly Property Example() As OurClass Get Return _Example End Get End Property End Class But others are telling me that it should be done like this... Public Class IpCam Private Const HOST As String = "http://test.com/url/example" Private Shared _Example As OurClass Public Sub New() _Example = New OurClass(HOST) End Sub Public Shared ReadOnly Property Example() As OurClass Get Return _Example End Get End Property End Class What is the difference? Is there a common consensus as to which one to use?
