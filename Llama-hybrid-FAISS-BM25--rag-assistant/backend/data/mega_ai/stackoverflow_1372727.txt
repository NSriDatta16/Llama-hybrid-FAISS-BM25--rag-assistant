I would recommend Git which is free & open source and: Doesn't require you to even set a central server even if you want add more developers or machines. Is Extremely Fast (imo) Encourages the use of branches I use it for almost every new project, even when it's just me on the project. It's an extremely fast distributed version control system and was written by Linus Torvalds and is now used in high profile projects like the Linux Kernel and Ruby on Rails . Git isn't hard to use from the Command line but also has it's own "Tortoise" package ( TortoiseGit - albeit not as polished as it's SVN cousin).
