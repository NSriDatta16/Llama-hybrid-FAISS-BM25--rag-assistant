Storing images in NoSQL stores

Our application will be serving a large number of small, thumbnail-size images (about 6-12KB in size) through HTTP. I've been asked to investigate whether using a NoSQL data store is a viable solution for data storage. Ideally, we would like our data store to be fault-toerant and distributed. Is it a good idea to store blobs in NoSQL stores, and which one is good for it? Also, is NoSQL a good solution for our problem, or would we be better served storing the images in the file system and serving them directly from the web server (as an aside, CDN is currently not an option for us)?
