Question 1: I have daily price and sales data for a product, now if I want to calculate the price elasticity should I aggregate the data at a weekly or some other level or should I directly feed the data into a regression model. I think you can do both ways: aggregate by days (but if price deviates inside a day you will loose some information), and aggregate by price while adjusting for the number of days the price was holding. The later is better, to my mind, as you will see the clear dependence between price and volume. It should look this way: price: 1.02; 1.03; 1.04; 1.05... sales: 1.4M; 1.3M; 1.2M; 1.2M... Question 2: Now let's assume the data size is very large and I cannot run models on daily data which in this case leads me to aggregating the data at a weekly level. Averaging the price on a daily basis will do the trick, but, again, with some loss of information.
