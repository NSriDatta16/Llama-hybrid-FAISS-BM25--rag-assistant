If the term "network" in your question implies data structure, as in networks/graphs , I have a suggestion. In order to analyze and visualize network data, you may find some useful ideas from my earlier answer on Data Science StackExchange site: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/3685/2452 . In addition to using Gephi , SoNIA and graph streaming , as described in the above-mentioned answer, you might also find Cytoscape software useful: http://www.cytoscape.org .
