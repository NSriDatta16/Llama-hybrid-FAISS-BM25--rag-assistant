Detecting trend divergence between two time-series datasets

Is there a relatively simple to implement method out there for detecting the early stages of divergence between two time series ? To take a simple example from the financial area, a common one is detecting the start of divergence between asset price and an associated "indicator" or "oscillator" chart in order to identify the begginings of a trend reversal.
