A transformer is just a neural network. Sure, it is way more complex than a feed forward one, but it still is a neural network. As long as you provide the correct dataset (supervised case, so the correct pair input-target) your model should be able to learn the hidden representation that make it able to answer to new questions. I found this interesting tutorial, try to check it out.
