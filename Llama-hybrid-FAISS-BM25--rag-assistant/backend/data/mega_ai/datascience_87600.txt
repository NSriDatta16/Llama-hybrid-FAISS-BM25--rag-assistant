AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'nan_to_num'

I'm trying to run a Random Forest model from sklearn but I keep getting an error: ValueError: Input contains NaN, infinity or a value too large for dtype('float32'). I tried following steps in ValueError: Input contains NaN, infinity or a value too large for dtype('float32') fillna(0) on my pandas dataframe still gave the ValueError. So I tried working with my numpy array: val = setTo.ravel().nan_to_num(0) But I keep getting an error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'nan_to_num' I'm wondering how I can deal with the nan values if I have ndarray? Update Thanks so much to @Beniamin H for all the help, as suggested, I rescaled the data, which I based on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34771118/sklearn-random-forest-error-on-input and it worked!
