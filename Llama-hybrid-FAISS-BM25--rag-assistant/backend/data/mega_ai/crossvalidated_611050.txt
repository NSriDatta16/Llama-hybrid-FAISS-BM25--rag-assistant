ARIMAX- Do exogenous variables have to be stationary?

I am trying to model a time series with R using the auto.arima() function. I understand there is no need for the autoregressive variable to be stationary as this is taken care of by the "integrated" part. However, when extending the model with exogenous variables using xreg , does the same rule apply to them, or do I have to transform those to achieve stationarity prior to including in the model?
