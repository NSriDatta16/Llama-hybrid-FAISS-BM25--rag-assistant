Javascript context menu click event/detection - filter paste content

Scenario: I'm trying to intercept paste events inside a textarea/input text, and filter the content being pasted. Webkit/IE are handled rather well, as I can attach code to the onpaste event, and then read from the clipboard what is being pasted. Plenty of examples around. Gecko is trickier, because as far as I know it isn't possible to read the clipboard content on Firefox (unless somebody knows a workaround for that?) I just use the input swap trick for that. Opera is being annoying tho. I can trap CTRL + V and SHIFT + INS , but there's no onpaste event. Not to mention any sort of clipboard interaction, apparently. So, my question is: Can I detect if the user clicked on paste in the context menu on Opera? Is there any other way to detect the event? EDIT: Thanks everybody for the answers - they all add a good input, even if there's no definitive solution. Having to choose, I'll pick the only one that tried to address the original question, and that would probably work if it wasn't too much of an hack to even try. Notes for those that have my same problem (input filtering): it is possible to capture content being dragged: mouseup + setTimeout does the trick everywhere almost perfectly. without flash, there is probably no solution bar polling. Even with flash, it's not a completely solid solution either. Too much effort to support 100% of the cases.
