Building a search tool and classifying text using NLP and ML

Im a newbie in information Retrieval. Currently Im reading a book entitled "An Introduction to Information Retreival" by Christopher D. Manning and Prabhakar Raghavan . Im trying to implement an ai based search tool to search for some relevant information from a private dataset. ( say a chemical or mathematical dataset that invloves more number of numericals and unstructed messy representation of unit of measure) Following is a row in my dataset in JSON format where keys are the coloumn name and value are the values corresponding to it. "ABC Project": { "In/Out diameter": " Both in and out are 1‚Äù ", "Design Pressure (barG)": { "Max": "116 psiG (7.99 barG)", "Minimum": "79.7 psiG (5.49 barG)", "Design": "174 psiG (11.99 barG)" }, "C02 %": "0.671", "MW": "16.68 kg/kmol", "TITLE": null, "Mothiram": "There is very dense forest and their lived a king. The name of the king was Pandidhurai. He was very brave ", "Thooval delivery material": "- thooval delivery material is panam patta 316/316L " The sample search query that will fetch the above mentioned row from my dataset would be " The project in which molecular wight is nearly 16 kg/kmol and Thooval delivery material panam patta 316l is used in which Mothiram is King Pandidhurai " What I have done . Preprocessing Read each row from table(say $T$ ) as $R_{i}$ and search query as $Q$ do the following preprocessing convert_lower_case(data) remove_punctuation(data) remove_apostrophe(data) remove_single_characters(data) convert_numbers(data) remove_stop_words(data) stemming(data) remove_punctuation(data) Convert Word to Vector for coloumn $C_i$ and do it for each corresponding row in table $R_i$ Build Vector Space Model for coloumn $C_i$ and do it for each corresponding row in table $R_i$ Build a vector space model for query $Q$ . Compute cosine score to select Row having high score Challenges I'm facing When I do 'remove_punctuation(data)' Im loosing vital informations (say $"$ denotes inches in the diameter coloumn) A way to interpret unit of measure in the data Unable to keep the relation between value ( say 16.78 kg/k mol is stored in multi diamentions and unable to find it is related to MW). I think it could be solved by building a ML classifier and train it to identify the entity MW. Say and using the unit of measure as a feature . But there are values like percentage composition of different chemical components, IN and OUT diameter , Inside and Outside Temperature. etc Difficulty in interpreting scientific terms and mapping to one root form ( say MW, mol wt, molwt etc are all different ways of representing molecular weight) Difficulty in finding the close proximity of neumerical values Question Please suggest me a step by step approach to build a search tool using this dataset (Please also suggest me an apt algorithm that would be useful in each step) I have read from here that some documents can be tagged as and train a Navie Base Classifier Model for better search performance. Is it possible in this case , if so what could be class label you would be suggesting ? UPDATE : I think Navie Base cannot be used as the coloumn or key would be greater than 1000. Im looking for a scalable approach to the problem. Is there any better approach to solve this problem than using a vector space model and computing cosine similarity ?
