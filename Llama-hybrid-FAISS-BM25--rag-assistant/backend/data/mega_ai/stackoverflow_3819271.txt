Google maps get_bounds event triggered multiple times

I'm using V3 of the Google maps javascript api to bring in more markers as the map bounds are changed. The problem is that when I drag the map around for a while and then end dragging a flood of events are triggered at once. They appear to be queueing up while the map is being dragged. Is there some way I can add a timer to stop this or will I have to use the zoom_changed and dragend events as a workaround? Here is the relivant code: google.maps.event.addListener(map, 'bounds_changed', function() { var bounds_url = map.getBounds().toUrlValue(); $.ajax({ //... }); });
