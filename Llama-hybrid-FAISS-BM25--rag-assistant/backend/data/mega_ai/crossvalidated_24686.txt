Most analyses in SPSS expect data in the “wide” format (i.e. one row for each participant). The one exception I know of is the MIXED procedure. If I understand you correctly, using MIXED could be a solution but reorganizing your data and running GLM is going to be inappropriate. For more details on MIXED and data preparation see this document from SPSS or this step-by-step guide from Marc Brysbaert . If you want to use the GLM procedure (through code or through the dialog box, as described in the answer you accepted to your earlier question), then the data must remain in wide format. If you want to use a multi-level model (John's answer to your last question), then MIXED is the way to go and you will need to reorganize your data. But you cannot mix both approaches and run GLM on data in “long” format.
