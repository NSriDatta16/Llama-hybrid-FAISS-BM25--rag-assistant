The generic issue I fear is that the RP connects to the OP and ends up on a different application server than the user. Save the conversation state in a shared storage. That is, database or distributed cache . Cache would be faster, and you don't need much of persistence anyway. Load-balancing with sticky sessions (all consequent request from the same client come to the same server) would reduce the number of cache updates. (Clustered HTTP sessions that I intended to advice initially wouldn't work as the same conversation is spread between two sessions: user's and application's.)
