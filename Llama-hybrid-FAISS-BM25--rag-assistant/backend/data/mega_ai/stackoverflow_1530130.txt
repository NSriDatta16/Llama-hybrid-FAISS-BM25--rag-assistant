VS2008, no embedded application icon?

I'm using Visual Studio 2008 and I can set the application icon using the My Project -> Application - Tab with a path. But, is there any way to set the application icon to an embedded resource instead of the file itself? 'cause it seems like that VS is embedding the icon again just for this purpose, instead of reusing an already embedded resource.
