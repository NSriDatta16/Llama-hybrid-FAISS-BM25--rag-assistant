I have the experience that valgrind has difficulties of tracking the storage that is allocated for the state of joinable threads. (This goes in the same direction as caf indicates.) Since it seems that you always return a value of 0 I guess that you perhaps need to join your threads from an application point of view? If so consider of launching them detached from the start, this avoids the allocation of that memory. The downside is that you either have: to implement your own barrier at the end of your main . If you know the number of threads beforehand, a simple statically allocated pthread_barrier would do. or to exit you main with pthread_exit such that you don't kill the rest of the running threads that might not yet be finished.
