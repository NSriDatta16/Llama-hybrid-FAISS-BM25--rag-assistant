How to send HTTP Headers to an included page in php?

I need to include some URL in php.. I used the following code: The problem is that, the page some_page.jsp act differentially based on the request header user-agent that appears not being sent by the above include statement... So How can I force the browser to send the request headers too to the included page? Thanks.
