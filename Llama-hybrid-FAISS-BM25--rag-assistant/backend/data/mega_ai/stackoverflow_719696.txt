Actually, you're quite right. WPF IS resolution independent, but the problem is how you control font sizing. ViewBoxes should be avoided, because they cost performance, but I think a single one shouldn't hurt anybody. But beware: It may look right now, but you simply can't display as much information with 640x480 as with 1600x1200... The most elegant solution is to use resolution dependent templates which are demonstratet in the Photo Suru app .
