4k * 40.000/s = 160MB/s is quite some bandwidth. You probably need to have that bandwidth in both directions, since the no-message-lost requirement means that all communicating parties send and receive both directions. Divide that number by the average throughput of your network card, or the write speed of your harddisk, to find that this is going to be a highly parallel and redundant system. You also need to benchmark your db operations and the calculations of each message, multiply by 40.000 (or, 3.5 billion for a single day), to get an estimate of the required hardware. I guess the .Net requirement will be the least of your problems.
