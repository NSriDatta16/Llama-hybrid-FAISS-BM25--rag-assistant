Our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit is exactly this idea. DMS provides generic parsing, tree building, analyzes (name resolution, control flow anlaysis, data flow analyis, call graphs and points-to analysis, custom analyzers, arbitrary transformations). It has a variety of legacy language front ends, as well as some DSLs (e.g., HTML, XML, temporal logic equations, industrial controller languages, ...) off-the-shelf, but has very good support for defining other DSLs. We use DMS both to build custom analyzers and transformation tools, but also as product-line generator . For example, we provide test coverage, profilers, smart differencers, and clone detections for a wide variety of languages... because DMS makes this possible. Yes, this lowers our dev and maintenance costs because each of these tool types uses DMS directly as a foundation. Fundamentally, it allows the amortization of language parsers, analyzers and transformers not only across specific languages, but across dialects of those languages and even different languages.
