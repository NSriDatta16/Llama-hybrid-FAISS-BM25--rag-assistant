Can Scala's Actor framework handle 10.000 actors without stack problems?

I want to do a multi-agent simulation containing about 10.000 agents (machine and product agents) using the Scala Actor framework. As I understand, if there are lots of actors passing messages around, can it run out of stack due the recursion? If so, how can I increase the stack sizes for the underlying worker threads?
