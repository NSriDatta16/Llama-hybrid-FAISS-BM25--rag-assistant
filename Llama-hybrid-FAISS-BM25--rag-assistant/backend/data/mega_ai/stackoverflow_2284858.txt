Entity Framework 4.0 generated entity set vs POCO with INotifyPropertyChanged/IDataErrorInfo

lets assume I do create the entities and I want data binding + error validation in wpf with mvvm pattern. Where is the advance of Poco? POCO is naked and has nothing... no INotifyPropertyChanged or IDataErrorInfo. Due to way much cumbersome work I do not wrap my entities like Customer in CustomerVM/CustomesVM (collection) etc... I return my data in a List<> pass it the ObservableCollection constructor and bind to that collection from the View. Easy and less to code. So why should I use a POCO which is the super great feature in EF 4.0 so they say...
