Well it means that each member of a structure, class or union declared after the pragma that follows the first member of the structure is stored at a multiple of either the size of the member type or 2 byte boundary, whichever is smalle. #pragma pack(n) will affect the size of the structures, classes and unions that follow it. if you use it a file level it is probably a good ideea to save the packing alignment before changing it and restoring it back to its previous value when the declarations you want to apply the new packing alignment end. And of course you should look at in the documentation for your compiler. For MS VS 6.0: see Here .
