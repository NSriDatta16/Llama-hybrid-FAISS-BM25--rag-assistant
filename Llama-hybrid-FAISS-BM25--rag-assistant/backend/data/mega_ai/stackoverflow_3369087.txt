WPF GridSplitter

I am experiencing weird behaviour whilst using the WPF GridSplitter. I have the appropriate HorizontalAlignment properties set to stretch and when I resize them the GridSplitter jumps around, sometimes going back to their original positions or just jumping around as I drag them..... Does anyone else seen or know what may be causing this? Thanks Here is the XAML
