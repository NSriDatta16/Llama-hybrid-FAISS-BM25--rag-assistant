Not only the current instance can access a private member. Other instances of the same type can too! This enables some scenarios where this access control may be useful. I am thinking of a tree structure where all nodes inherit a certain type and a private/protected event allows to propagate leaf events to their parents. Since they are the same type, the parent can register to the child's private event. Yet any client of the tree structure cannot. I can definitely see a use case in a directory like storage system where where each directory needs to propagate its last modified date to its parent for example.
