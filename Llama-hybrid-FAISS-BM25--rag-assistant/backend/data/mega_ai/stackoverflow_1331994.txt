ANSI 4.10.4.1 The behavior of the abort function with regard to open and temporary files The abort function does not close files that are open or temporary. It does not flush stream buffers [source] and Abort current process Aborts the process with an abnormal program termination. The function generates the SIGABRT signal, which by default causes the program to terminate >returning an unsuccessful termination error code to the host environment. The program is terminated without executing destructors for objects of automatic or static storage duration, and without calling any atexit function. The function never returns to its caller.
