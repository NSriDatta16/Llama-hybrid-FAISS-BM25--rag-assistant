You describe an exponential decay, or "spike," as the basic ingredient in a periodic function $\tilde f.$ All other operations are affine transformations of this: shifting and scaling the argument and the value. If we write the "spike" as a function $f$, and assume it decays rapidly in both directions, then its periodic version can be created by reducing mod $1:$ $$\tilde{f}(x) = f\left(x - \lfloor x \rfloor\right).$$ A flexible, simple, reliable--and therefore elegant and possibly even efficient--solution is to code these three ingredients separately: the spike function $f,$ this infinite sum (which of course will have to cut off at finite points), and the affine transformations. Here are simple bare-bones R solutions. spike computes the exponentially-decaying pulse described in the question: cycle = 0) * exp(-x) To illustrate, let's create a function that spikes at a rate of $1/4$ (that is, has a period of $4$, decays exponentially with a rate of $10,$ and attains heights just slightly greater than $2:$ f Here is its graph on the interval $[-10,10]:$ curve(f(x), -10, 10, n=501) My old workstation performs five million calculations of this particular $f$ per second: that's pretty efficient. With this solution you have the ingredients to answer all questions like this one, regardless of the shape of the spikes.
