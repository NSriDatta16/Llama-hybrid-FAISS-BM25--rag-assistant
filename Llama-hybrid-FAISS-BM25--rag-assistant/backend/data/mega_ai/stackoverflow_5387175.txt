Personally, I found success with Kohana 2.3 (the later versions don't work as well IMHO) as it has a very simple MVC structure, it runs fairly quickly, and it is OO. It was based off of CodeIgniter. However, I would pick a framework and stick with it, paying more attention to designing your application with a good understanding of MVC. Head First Design Patterns (http://www.amazon.com/First-Design-Patterns-Elisabeth-Freeman/dp/0596007124) helped me understand why MVC was useful and how to implement it. Good luck!
