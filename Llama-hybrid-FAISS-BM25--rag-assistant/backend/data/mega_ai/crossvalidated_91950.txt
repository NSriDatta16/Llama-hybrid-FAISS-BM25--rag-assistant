The problem is in some sense "worse" than heteroskedasticity in linear models. At least there your variance estimate will in some sense be a kind of 'average' value in the data. What happens is that with a Poisson model, the variance is set equal to the mean. In an overdispersed model the variance is large than the mean. All your standard errors for parameter estimates will be based on the 'variance=mean' assumption. One alternative is to fit a quasi-Poisson regression; it will scale the parameter variance estimates for the variation in the data (by using a variance of $\phi \mu$ with $\phi$ being able to be larger than 1).
