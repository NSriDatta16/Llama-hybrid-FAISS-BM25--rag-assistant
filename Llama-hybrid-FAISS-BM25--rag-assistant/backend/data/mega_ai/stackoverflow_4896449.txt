First advice: don't use DOM. Libraries like JDOM or XOM do the same job much more elegantly and efficiently. If you can avoid Java and write the whole application in XSLT or XQuery, then do. It's another language to learn, but it's much better suited to XML. If it really has to be Java, then make maximum use of XPath, or XQUery if the queries are complex. The JAXP API for XPath is rather clunky (e.g very weak type-checking) and only supports XPath 1.0; Saxon's s9api interface is much cleaner and supports XPath 2.0, but of course you may want to avoid the lock-in.
