Architecture of the Triplet Neural Network

I want to implement face recognition neural network like in this topic (Step 3: Encoding Faces) using dlib library. I already conducted a some research and found out that it's triplet neural network and our goal is to take two images of the first person ( x , x+ ) and one of the second ( x- ) and find a measurements in which the distance between x and x- is less than the distance between x and x+ I also found some simple description of steps which I need to do: First we need a three deep convolutional neural nets (embedding nets) which will extract some features from x , x+ and x- . Find distance between x and x- features and distance between x and x+ features. Take features where distance between x and x+ is less. Use these features for creating measurements. But unfortunately it's impossible for me to use these abstract things for creating neural network in practice. So can someone explain architecture of the Triplet Neural Network by layers?
