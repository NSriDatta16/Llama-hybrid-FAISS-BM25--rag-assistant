The problem with Bonferroni is that you won't detect any violations of the null hypothesis if $N$ is becoming large. Thus, instead of asking for one test that covers everything, you should change your goal a bit: e.g. the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure answers the following question, which might be useful for you: Which tests, out of my complete set of $N$ tests, should I consider to significantly reject the null hypothesis, if I want to have only a ratio of $q$ of those to be wrong, for some $q$ that the user can provide? E.g., if you choose $q=0.1$ , then the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (BH) gives you those tests out of your total $N$ tests that are the most significant ones. Let's say (BH) returns e.g. $k=50$ such tests to you. Then BH makes sure that on average only $q\cdot k=0.1\cdot 50=5$ of those tests will be wrong.
