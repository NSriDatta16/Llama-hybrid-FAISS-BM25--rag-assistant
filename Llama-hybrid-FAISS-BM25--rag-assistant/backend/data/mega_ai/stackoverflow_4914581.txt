The code as written doesn't compile. The problem is that your TenStrings class contains an array TenStrings objects. Since each TenStrings requires that the compiler provide storage for ten TenStrings objects, it can't compile. Try replacing the "TenStrings str[10]" with "std::string str[10]" and see how that works. Edit: If you have to use pointers to characters, then try "const char *str[10]".
