Intent not received by activity

I have a main activity that launches a service to do a web search in the background and I would like the main activity to get an intent when the search is done. In my main activity , I defined a BroadcastReceiver and an Intent Filter to listen to the "end of search" intent: public class AgeRage extends Activity { // Listener to all results from background processes BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() { @Override public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) { if (intent.getAction().equals(ImageSearchService.SEARCH_RESULT_ACTION)) { 0); Toast.makeText(context,"Got " + i + "results", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } else Toast.makeText(context,"unknown intent", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } }; IntentFilter receiverFilter = new IntentFilter (); @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.main); // Register to image search service messages receiverFilter.addAction(ImageSearchService.SEARCH_RESULT_ACTION); registerReceiver(receiver,receiverFilter); ... In the service , I do the search and when it is done , I send an Intent: public class ImageSearchService extends IntentService { ... protected void onHandleIntent (Intent intent) { ... doing search ... Intent i = new Intent (this,AgeRage.class); i.setAction (SEARCH_RESULT_ACTION); i.putExtra(SEARCH_STATUS, (searchStatus ==SearchStatus.DONE) ? true:false); i.putExtra (SEARCH_RESULT_NUM, totalResultNum); i.putExtra (SEARCH_ID, searchID); sendBroadcast (i,null); } But, the main activity doesn't get the Intent. I know that the sendBroadcast is being called and the the receiver's OnReceive is not (checked with a debugger). I assume that since I create the filter dynamically , I do not need to define a filter in the manifest file. Am I doing something wrong ? Thanks Isaac
