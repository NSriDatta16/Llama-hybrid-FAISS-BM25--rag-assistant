Expanding on whuber's comment. The way you make a confidence interval in this case is the same as any. You have $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ from a Uniform$(0,1$). You have a function $y = g(x) = xe^{x/2}$, so that $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$ are a random sample from a distribution with mean $\theta$ and some unknown variance $\sigma^2$. Once you take the Monte Carlo average, the central limit theorem kicks in and in order to make confidence intervals you just have to obtain an estimate of $\sigma^2$.
