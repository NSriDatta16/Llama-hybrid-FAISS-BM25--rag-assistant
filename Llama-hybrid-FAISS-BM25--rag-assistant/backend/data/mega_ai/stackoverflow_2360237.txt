How do I look under the covers and see how HTML is rendered?

For example: I know this gives me a button. But I also know that someone had to figure out how wide my text was, draw a button of the correct size, place my text in there... etc. Let's use Mozilla as an example. I did some googling and found this , so I think I'm on the right track. Still, the first sentence says it all: Page reorganization: The layout engine used in Mozilla (which is known by many names) started off as a project to write a new layout engine for Mozilla and became the layout engine of Mozilla and the foundation for a nearly-complete rewrite in late 1998. Confusing. Here is a list of parts I know exist (from that Mozilla page): HTML parser and XML parser DOM implementation CSS parser and style system HTML parser and XML parser Code for CSS-based and HTML-based layout and rendering Can someone explain in layman's terms how the Mozilla browser model displays a button?
