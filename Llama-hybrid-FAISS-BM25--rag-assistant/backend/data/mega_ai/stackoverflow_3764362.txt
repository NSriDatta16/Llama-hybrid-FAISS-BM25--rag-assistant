Just reviewing the docs it would appear that the DragDropTarget has a GetInsertionIndicatorGeometry which I suspect is responsible for the various symbols shown when dragging. Hence for you to replace these symbols you will need to inherit the specific target type you are using and override this protected member to inject your own geometries.
