How to apply regression on principal components to predict an output variable?

I read about the basics of principal component analysis from tutorial1 , link1 and link2 . I have data set of 100 variables(including output variable Y), I want to reduce the variables to 40 by PCA, and then predict variable Y using those 40 variables. Problem 1: After getting principal components and choosing first 40 components, if I apply regression on it I get some function which fits the data. But how to predict some variable Y from the original data? To predict variable Y I have (100-1) variables at the input, and how do I know which 40 variables to choose out of my original 100-1 variables? Problem 2: I do reversing of the PCA and get the data back from those 40 principal components. But the data are changed because I chose only first 40 components. Does applying regression to these data make any sense? I use Matlab/Octave.
