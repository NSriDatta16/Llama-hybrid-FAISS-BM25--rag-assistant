Building upon Arne's answer, there's a very interesting paper by Bell/Jones (2012), mentioned in this post Panel regression: what to do when Hausman test fails and want to keep time invariant regressors? . They argue in favor of an RE model to capture both within and between variance by 'Within-Between transformation', essentially building upon Mundlak (1978). I found this passage particularly interesting and I'm wondering whether your hint that .. it is very crucial that your assumptions about the specific dependency hold still holds true in light of that paper? In the paper, it's said: Where the within and between effects are different, β1 in equation 1 will be an uninterpretable weighted average of the two processes (Krishnakumar, 2006, Neuhaus and Kalbfleisch, 1998, Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002 p137) whilst variance estimates are also affected (Grilli and Rampichini, 2011). This can be thought of as omitted variable bias (Bafumi and Gelman, 2006, Palta and Seplaki, 2003); because the between effect is omitted, β1 attempts to account for both the within and the between effect of the covariate on the response, and if the two effects are different, it will fail to account fully for either. The variance that is left unaccounted for will be absorbed into the error terms and , which will consequently both be correlated with the covariate, violating the assumptions of the RE model. Leading to the model which can be rearranged to Crucially, there can be no correlation between the group mean centred covariate and the higher-level variance because the group mean centred covariate has a mean of 0 for each higher-level entity j. Bell, Andrew; Jones,Kelvyn (2012): Explaining Fixed Effects: Random Effects modelling of Time-Series Cross-Sectional and Panel Data, Working Paper I found this paper very helpful.
