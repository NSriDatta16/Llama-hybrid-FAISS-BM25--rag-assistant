Since a=loglikelihood($\theta_c$)+logprior($\theta_c$) and b==loglikelihood($\theta_p$)+logprior($\theta_p$), it follows that $$\exp(b-a) = \dfrac{likelihood(\theta_p)\times prior(\theta_p)}{likelihood(\theta_c)\times prior(\theta_c)},$$ which is the "usual ratio" you refer to. The instrumental distribution used by the authors is normal (this is where you sample the $\theta$s from). Moreover, you don't need to come up with intricate instrumental distributions, just define your log posterior as: if($0 else return $-\infty$ This will do the truncation job for you. I also recommend the following R packages for an easier implementation: mcmc . Look at the command metrop() . Rtwalk . A self adaptive MCMC sampler based on Metropolis steps.
