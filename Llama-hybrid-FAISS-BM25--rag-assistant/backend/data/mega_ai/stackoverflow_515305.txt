How can I apply a common extension method to multiple unrelated types in a third party SDK?

I'm beginning to fall in love with Extension Methods, but I just don't know how to create an EM only for a determinate Object type. I have for example: public static void AddPhoneNumberToContact(this Contact contact, PhoneType type, String number) { lock (contact) { PhoneRow pr = PhoneRow.CreateNew(); pr.SetDefaults(); pr.PtypeIdx = type; pr.PhoneNumber = number; contact.Phones.Add(pr); pr = null; } } My problem is that I want to also Have this method in the Person object, and that is why I named AddPhoneNumberToContact AddPhoneNumberToPerson Is there a way to have AddPhoneNumber and deal with the object that is provided? or the solution is to have public static void AddPhoneNumber(this object contact, ... { ... if(typeof(Contact) == contact) ((Contact)contact).Phones.Add(pr); else if(typeof(Person) == contact) ((Person)contact).Phones.Add(pr); } Thank you.
