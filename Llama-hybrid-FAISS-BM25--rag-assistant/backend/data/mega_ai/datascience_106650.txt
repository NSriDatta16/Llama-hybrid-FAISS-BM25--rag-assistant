Number of input and output channels of MAX POOL layer

This is what Andrew Ng draws in his pooling layers video in the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization: and this is what he draws in Inception network video: Notice in first slide, number of input and output channels is same as pooling layers processes each channel independently and thus produces as many output channels as there are in the input. But in the second slide, the number of output and input channels of the MAX-POOL is different: number of input channels to MAX-POOL is 192 (encircled orange) and the number of output channels is 32 (encircled red). How in this example MAX-POOL outputted in different number of channels? What detail I am missing?
