Fine-tune random forest on time series

I am using the random forest for classifing if it will rain (1) or not (0) in my daily rain dataset with a small quantity of data (8103 tuples). Currently running a walking foward evaluation looking at the recall metric and getting a mean of 83. I'm using a multivariate approach with the following columns: I know the RF doesn't use autoregression, so I'm looking for ways to help it understand the time property better. Also if I there is any argument I can pass to RFClassifier that would be good, I'm already using bootstrap=False. I already tried other techniques such as ETS and ARIMA, but they could not beat mean (only STLF has beaten it actually) so I'm looking into the Machine Learning approach.
