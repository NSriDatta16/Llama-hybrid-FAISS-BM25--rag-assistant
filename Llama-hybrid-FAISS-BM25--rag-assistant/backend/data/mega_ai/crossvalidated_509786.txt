Here is my answer: Think about the data generation process. Suppose we have a random variable $X$ depending on a parameter $\theta$ . We assume $\theta$ follows some distribution as in the Bayesian philosophy. In this case, consider the joint distribution of $(X, \theta)$ . Each time $X$ is generated, a $\theta$ is generated as well. However, you cannot see the value of $\theta$ . So in this way, both $X$ and $\theta$ are random. This is how I understand it.
