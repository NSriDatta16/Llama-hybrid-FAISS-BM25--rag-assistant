Wikipedia's explanation of the issue: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_XML Supposedly the recommended organisation and its java and .net sdk can be downloaded from: http://www.agiledelta.com/product_efx.html xml is pure text but can be used to represent serialized objects. Let's presume your serializer is serializing your objects into xml. You should not try to convert your objects into binary streams because you would have to tackle endian ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endian ) and data-representation issues. However, if you insist, you would need to use XDR ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_Data_Representation ) for its data architecture neutrality. Otherwise, you should serialize your objects to XML using standard serializers and then convert the xml to binary/compact xml because of the availability of libraries and sdks. And then deserialize by decompacting from binary xml.
