participants rank 6 independent options that are given. If they have all three options - Option A, Option B, and Option C - in the highest rank of three, I assign them with a score of 3. If they have only two of them in the highest rank, I assign, 2, and so on until 0. This is probably best handled by viewing the outcomes as ordered, with integer outcome values ranging from 0 through 3, and performing an ordinal logistic regression. The UCLA website has links to implementation of that type of regression in each of 5 statistical software packages.* With only 2 binary predictors you might not have much discrimination in your model. You probably should include an interaction term between those 2 predictors so that the effect of one predictor can depend on the value of the other. A Poisson model wouldn't be a good choice, as that implicitly assumes that there is no upper limit to the number of "counts" even if large numbers of counts are improbable. Here, you have a fixed upper limit of 3 "counts." *While I was writing this answer, Frank Harrell made a similar suggestion in a comment. As his course notes and book explain, that approach can be useful even with continuous outcomes. Review the resources to which he links for more background.
