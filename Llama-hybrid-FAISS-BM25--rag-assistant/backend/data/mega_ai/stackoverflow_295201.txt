Vim reflow paragraph adds unwanted indentation

When I use `gqap' command to reflow a paragraph in vim, vim seems to try to be smart and adds indentation automatically, e.g. When a line ends with a ',': We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2), offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. When a line has unmatched brackets: Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". Is there a way to turn this off? Thanks!
