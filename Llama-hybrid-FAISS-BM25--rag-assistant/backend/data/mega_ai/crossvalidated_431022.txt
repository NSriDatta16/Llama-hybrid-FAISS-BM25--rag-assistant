Error while performing multiclass classification using Gridsearch CV

I am trying to solve a multiclass classification problem using SVC as the base estimator and GridSearchCV to tune my results. Mentioned below is the code and the error being received: svc_clf = SVC(C=0.7,tol=0.01,kernel='rbf',cache_size=500) param_grid = {'C':np.linspace(0.1,1.0,10),'tol':[1e-7,1e-6,1e-5,1e-4,1e-3,1e-2,1e-1],'kernel':['rbf','poly'],'degree':[3,4,5,6,7]} gs_svc = GridSearchCV(estimator=svc_clf,param_grid=param_grid,scoring='f1',cv=5) gs_svc.fit(X_train,y_train) Below is the error received: ValueError: Target is multiclass but average='binary'. Please choose another average setting. Upon my research I found that 'f1-score' isn't for multi-class classification. Please suggest which metric should be used for GridSearchCV for a multi-class classification problem ?
