I want to feed the results of a clustering into a logistic regression

Basically, my problem is, I have a dataset where I know about 12% of the rows should be classified as something, and I have some reasonable predictors. The problem is, my predictors aren't too good, because when I run a K-means with two clusters, they classify 85% of the rows as target instead of 12%. But otherwise the centroids elaborated seem to have face validity. My idea is that I could feed the cluster assignments and the predictors into a logistic regression, and then I could fine tune the acceptance threshold to 12% instead of 50%. Mathematically, it seems like it should work but it reeks of inelegance.
