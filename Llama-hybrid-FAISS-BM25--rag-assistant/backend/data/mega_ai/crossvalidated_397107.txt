It is perfectly fine to use PCA on a dataset with well defined continuous features with vastly different scales as long as you standardize all your variables to put them back on the same scale (note that centering is a necessity for PCA as well). The further you move away from continuous data, the more problematic it becomes. For example, PCA (and standardization) on a multinomial feature coded as numbers like numbers for continents is total nonesense. There is a method along the lines of PCA that is meant to deal with mixed data called FAMD : Factor Analysis of Mixed Data. See this link : Factor Analysis of Mixed Data
