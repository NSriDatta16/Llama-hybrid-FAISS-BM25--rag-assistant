How can I replace a Python 2.65 UCS-2 build with one built using UCS-4 without losing everything in my site-packages?

I downloaded the Python 2.6.5 source, built it for OS 10.6.4 64-bit, and installed numerous dependencies. I opened a big project our team has been working on recently, ran the unit tests, and one of the tests failed because I had installed Python built using UCS-2 (I didn't know this was the default of OS X!) In a nutshell: I didn't supply flag --enable-unicode=ucs4 when building Python. (as I discovered was necessary: http://copia.posterous.com/confusion-over-python-storage-form-for-unicod ) Now I want to correct this without losing everything I put in site-packages. Is this possible? If so, how? Thank you! Michaux
