How to compare time series with different time stamps

My data consists of several time series of the form $A_i = [ (t^i_0,x^i_0), (t^i_1, x^i_1), \ldots, (t^i_{n_i}, x^i_{n_i})]$ for $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots 20 \}$ $B_j = [ (t^j_0,x^j_0), (t^j_1, x^j_1), \ldots, (t^j_{n_j}, x^j_{n_j})]$ for $j \in \{21, 22, \ldots 40 \}$ Where $x \in \mathbb R$ is a measurement taken at time delta $t \in \mathbb R$ , measured in milliseconds after some start time $T_0$ which is the same for all series. My goal is to compare the two sets of time series $\{ A_1, \ldots, A_{20} \}$ and $\{ B_{21}, \ldots, B _{40} \}$ and to decide whether they come from the same distribution or not. If this is too abstract, imagine two algorithms $A$ and $B$ . Each algorithm is run 20 times and, during each run, gathers rewards over time. The algorithm $A$ takes longer than $B$ for each time step, but the rewards are higher. Both algorithms are run for a fixed time. $A$ will gather less measurements than $B$ in that time. Which algorithm is now better? Is it $A$ , wich had the chance to gather less rewards, but the rewards are overall higher? Or is it $B$ , which gathered more but overall lower rewards? Look at the following picture where I created an artificial example. I only drew the first 3 runs of each algorithm to illustrate the problem. On the left, the individual rewards are plotted for each process. On the right, the cumulative sum of all previous rewards are plotted. Notice that Series $A$ have less measurements than $B$ in the same time period Series $B$ got lower rewards, but its cumulative reward is higher than that of $A$ due to the higher number of measurements. The data are generated in numpy with at = np.arange(0, 5.1, 1) A = [pd.Series((at+np.random.random(at.shape))*10, index=at+ np.random.random(at.shape)) for i in range(3)] bt = np.arange(0, 5.1, 0.2) B = [pd.Series((bt+np.random.random(bt.shape))*5, index=bt+np.random.random(bt.shape)) for j in range(3)] The plots indicate that process $B$ is indeed different (and better) than $A$ . But how would a more formal analysis of this statement look?
