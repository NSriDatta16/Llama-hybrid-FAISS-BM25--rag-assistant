I am not sure there is a single gold standard but I know that the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is used to evaluate the fit of a mixture model. The R Mclust package uses this as its default option in choosing the best fit among mixture models with different numbers of components. You can find a source for the math behind this but the BIC essentially computes the total log likelihood for the data given the model and penalizes it by the number of parameters in the model.
