Factorial Analysis is especially helpful when trying to visualize a high-dimension space ( i.e dataset with lots of variables). In your case, that could be somewhat applicable. Factorial Analysis, such as PCA, is strictly speaking not compatible with ordinal variables (as it assumes that your variables are linear, and thus continuous) but lots of people in sensometrics still use it in your situation. Using PCA you could visualize more easily how your individuals and variables 'behave' with one another. Meaning that you could see which variables hold the same information. If you want to specifically explain which variables have an impact on satisfaction level (and even quantify that impact) then I would recommend linear modeling (such as ANOVA if all your attributes are factors).
