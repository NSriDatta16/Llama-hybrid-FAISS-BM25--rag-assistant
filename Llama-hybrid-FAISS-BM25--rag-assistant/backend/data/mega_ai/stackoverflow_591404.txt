Firstly thanks to everyone for their replies. This was an interesting one to solve and for anyone new to MDX and coming from SQL its an easy trap to fall into. So for those interested here is a brief overview of the solution. I have 3 tables factDemographics: holds respondents and their answers (who answered what) dimAnswer: the answers dimRespondent: the respondents In the datasource view for the cube I duplicated factDemographics 5 times using Named Queries and I named these fact1, fact2, ..., fact5. (which will create 5 measure groups) Using VS Studio's create cube wizard I set the following fact tables fact1, fact2, ... as fact tables dimRespondent a fact table. I use this table to get the number of respondents. Removed the original factDemographics table. Once the cube was created I duplicated the dimAnswer dimension 5 times, naming them filter1, filter2, ... Finally in the Cube Structure's Dimension Usage tab I linked these together as follows filter1 many to many dimRespondent filter2 many to many dimRespondent filter3 many to many dimRespondent filter4 many to many dimRespondent filter5 many to many dimRespondent filter1 regular relationship fact1 filter2 regular relationship fact2 filter3 regular relationship fact3 filter4 regular relationship fact4 filter5 regular relationship fact5 This now enables me to rewrite the query I used in my original post as SELECT [Measures].[Dim Respondent Count] On 0 FROM [DemographicsCube] WHERE ( [Filter1].[Answer].&[Male], [Filter2].[Answer].&[20-25] ) My query can now be filtered by up to 5 questions. Although this works I'm sure that there is a more elegant solution. If anyone knows what that is I'd love to hear it. Thanks
