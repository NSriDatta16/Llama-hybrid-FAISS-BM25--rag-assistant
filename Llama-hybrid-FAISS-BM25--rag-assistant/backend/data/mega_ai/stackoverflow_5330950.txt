It depends a lot on how selective the indexes are, and what you're doing with the data. I'd say 70K rows and 20mb isn't a show-stopper if you're piping the result set to a file for automatic processing. But it might be a show-stopper if you're trying to load it into a web page. Anyway, I'd encourage you to give some thought to the real reason someone needs to see 70,000 rows and 20 megabytes on a web page. What are they trying to accomplish with that much data at one time?
