GUI for a simple profiler

Hi I want suggestions on which API to use or tools or any source codes to create a GUI for a simple profiler I have. It produces a text output of the runtime of different processes in a program. I want to show it in a graph format Y axis being the Process name/ids and X axis a timeline. Thus I can show how long it has executed and its start and end point too. Preferably as a normal application and not a web based one. My design has this as a gantt chart with finely grained timeline and support to display 100's of processes on the Y axis (thus a scrollable window )
