Best approaches for feature engineering?

I have a regression problem. The aim is to estimate the best fitting curve from a set of features. Now I have extracted a set of features that are relevant based on the literatures found. Now the performance with the present set of features is not giving satisfactory performance. Feature engineering is a possible next approach that I plan to do. Now how do I do this? I can take the product of the features or polynomial features (quadratic, cubic, etc..) but will this not make the system non-linear prone to overfitting?
