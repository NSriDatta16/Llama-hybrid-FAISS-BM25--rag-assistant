Wiki's are definitely great for that. I have used two notetaking solutions that have what you want (I've used more, but these were the best for me). TiddlyWiki Great feature set since it's javascript/html with wiki functionality: intralinking to pages you create, embedding of images from any directory, hyperlinks, and printability Also has an amazing amount of plugins at places like TiddlyTools and other repos like it I combined it with TeamTasks which not only made it look better, but brought in some todo functionality; with TiddlyWiki Address Book (twab) for contact management, and several other plugins that worked great emacs + orgmode This is my top choice today for notetaking and all kinds of stuff It is literally unbelievable. Todos, contacts, scheduling, linking, export to html, export to PDF via LaTeX, interfacing with gnuplot, TikZ, ditaa, R (like Matlab), etc. Inter and intralinking are very easy. See THIS for specifically how orgmode deals with various linking. Lastly, if orgmode sounds interesting, I would strongly recommend checking out the orgmode wiki, Worg, where tutorials, videos, and screencasts exist. Your initial inquiry mentions simplicity, so perhaps one of the wikis is best. If you're unfamiliar with them, it's quite easy to just download a copy (just an html file), open it in a browser and play around. There's a lot of documentation out there to help you and your linking is as often as easy as writing something like [[page::section]] or similar in your document. On the other hand, if you're looking for advanced usage and especially exporting of documents, I have yet to find anything to beat orgmode for me! I highly recommend it and the mailing list is very, very active and supportive.
