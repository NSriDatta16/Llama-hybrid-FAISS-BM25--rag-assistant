I followed that steps that pygorex1 posted but also replaced lines 191-195 in the Select.php file, because I was still getting another similar error about the getPrice() . I have Magento ver. 1.3.2.4. Original code from lines 191-195: $result = $this->_getChargableOptionPrice( $option->getValueById($optionValue)->getPrice(), $option->getValueById($optionValue)->getPriceType() == 'percent', $basePrice ); Here is the code I created to replace lines 191-195: $z= $option->getValueById($optionValue); $result = is_object($z) ? $z ->getPrice() : null; $zz = $option->getValueById($optionValue); $result = is_object($zz) ? $zz ->getPriceType() == 'percent' : $basePrice; FYI - I am NOT a PHP programmer. I just happened to figure out how to rework the code to make fix this problem based on pygorex1's code. So, there is a good chance I didn't write it correctly. However, it did fix the problem for me (which I am rather proud of :)
