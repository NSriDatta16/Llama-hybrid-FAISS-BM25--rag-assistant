Wix heat.exe with project harvesting type

I'm using the lastest version of Wix 3.5 and I'm trying to generate a fragment file using heat.exe. The command line is : "%WIX%\bin\heat.exe" project "MyProj.csproj" -pog Binaries -pog Content -suid -directoryid INSTALLLOCATION -ag -template fragment -out "Files.wxs" The problem I'm having is that the assemblies my project is depending upon are missing from the generated file. Is this the intended behaviour ? How can I add them ? Should I use the dir harvesting type ?! How to remove *.pdb or *.vshost.exe then ? I want to use it with CI Server (TeamCity) edit : I tried -pog Satellites and doesn't work either
