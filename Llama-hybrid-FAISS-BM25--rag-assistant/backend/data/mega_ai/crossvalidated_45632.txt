You guys might be interested in a paper on this subject (journal subscription required for access - try accessing it from your university): O'Neill, B. (2011) Exchangeability, correlation and Bayes' Effect. International Statistical Review 77(2), pp. 241-250. This paper discusses the representation theorem as the basis for both Bayesian and frequentist IID models, and also applies it to a coin-tossing example. It should clear up the discussion of the assumptions of the frequentist paradigm. It actually uses a broader extension to the representation theorem going beyond the binomial model, but it should still be useful.
