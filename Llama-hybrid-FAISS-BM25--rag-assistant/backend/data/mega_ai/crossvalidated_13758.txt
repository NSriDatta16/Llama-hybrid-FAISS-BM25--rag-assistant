Inference to the population when the survey response rate is only 30%

I have conducted a survey in which the questionnaires were sent out to 450 individuals, but only 30% of them answered the questionnaires. Is it still valid to interpret the usual inference analysis (i.e., the inference analysis developed under the assumption of random sampling)? Is it correct to do logistic regression analysis with these data? If not, how to proceed?
