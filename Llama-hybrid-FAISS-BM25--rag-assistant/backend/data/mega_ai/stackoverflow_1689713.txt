What is your primary criterion for selection? Speed or security? That's the fundamental trade-off in the cryptography business. Here's a set of benchmark results for Crypto++ . They won't tell you everything, but you will be able to tell which algorithms are generally faster than others. Here's a whitepaper discussing the relative strengths of some popular algorithms . Determining strength is a very hard thing to do in the general case, although some algorithms have been given enough attention that their strengths and weaknesses are fairly well known (DES, RSA, etc). A conventional rule of thumb is that longer keys imply greater strengths, but you gotta be very careful with that. I suspect that in your case, either AES or Blowfish will be fine. AES will probably be somewhat more widely supported, but really - either would probably do. Stay away from DES unless speed is a critical factor.
