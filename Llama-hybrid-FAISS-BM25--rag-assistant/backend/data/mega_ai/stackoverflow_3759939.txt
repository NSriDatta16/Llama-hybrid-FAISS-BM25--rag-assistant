No you dont need to know Objective C you dont need to use PyObjC , and you wont be a second class citizent. Unless you want to do something extremely specific to the MAC platform , coding in Objective C or using PyObjC is a really bad idea. The reason is obvious, once you go the objc route you say a big "goodbye" to other platforms. Its that simple. Apple does not want you to code for other platforms the same way Microsoft does not want you to code for other platforms. And that is why more and more developers are turning to open source languages like, python, java, ruby etc. Because you dont care what Apple and Microsot , you only care about an App that is the most useful and most easy to develop. And making your App available only for MAC will make it less useful and obviously developing in Objective C is way more difficult. Python has more than enough libraries to accomodate you , hundrends of them , readily available for the mac platform. I for instance develope a new application in pygame, no its not a game, if I have done the same thing in ObjC or PyObj I would have to rewrite the code for windows and linux. While with pygame my code works exactly the same in windows and linux even though my main platform is macos. Thats the appeal of most python libraries , they are cross platform. WxPython is another example, someone mentioned that "it does not exactly look natively" , do you want this to stop you from making your application available for windows and linux. Why limit yourself only on the MAC platform ? Do you think the average user will care how natively your app will look. Even macos apps do not look native , many of them introduce their own "eye candy" gui. Not that you cant make WxPython look 100% native, the way you code is always importnat. Objc makes sense when you intend to develop for Iphone OS , as Apple thought it a great idea to exclude python (and not only python), even though they were forced to include javascript (or else websurfing would have being a nightmare on iphoneos) . Pyjamas, can make python available for iphone os as well (with no hacks or jailbroken phones), but with the obvious limitations since it translates python code to javascript, but still its a valid solution till Apple decide that excluding python from iphone os is a really bad idea. link text There is no harm done in studying Objective C though. You can always use the native libraries via pyobjc. But to be absolutely sincere with you, If my app reaches a dead end with the python libraries ( a very unlikely scenario) I would rather wrap an existing cross platform C/C++ Libraries with Cython than go the objective c pyobjc route and detroy the cross platform ability of my app. The last thing I would be using is anything platoform specifc. Now if you dont care about other platforms at all, then I guess Objective C can be a valid choice. It certainly looks ugly as hell, but I have heard that it gets much better the more you use it and there are many people that prefer it over C/C++.
