Random Records & SQL2005 Stored Procedure Insert

I need to submit data from a form to an SQL2005 database via a stored procedure. The difficult part is that i also need to get 5 random records from a secondary table and insert these as part of the inserted record in table 1. My structure is akin to this: Tbl_Organisations (table to get the 5 random records from) Key | organisation_name | Tbl_Campaigns (table to be inserted to) Key | name | date | organisation_1 | organisation_2 | organisation_3 | etc........ I need to get 5 unique / random records from 'tbl_Organisations', catch them and insert them into a single record along with the data input to the stored procedure. I understand arrays arent an option in SQL2005(?). So how do i catch these records and then insert them as a single record along with the SP Inputs? Any help would be greatly appreciated as i am trying my best to get to grips with the complexities of SQL Thanks.
