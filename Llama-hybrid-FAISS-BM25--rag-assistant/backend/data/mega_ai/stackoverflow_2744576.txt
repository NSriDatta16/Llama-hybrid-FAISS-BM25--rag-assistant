I ran into the exact same problem you have a couple of years ago, that of setting the compiler to level 4 warnings to catch as many potiential problems as possible. At the time, I had a support contract with Qt and asked them why their code generated so many warnings. Their response was that they never gaurenteed that their code would compile without any warnings. Only that their code would run correctly. After several attemps, I started surrounding the Qt header files with pragmas to disable the warnings as shown below - #pragma warning(push,3) // drop compiler to level 3 and save current level #include #include #include #include #include #pragma warning(pop) // restore compiler warning level By doing it this way, you only compile the Qt header files at the lower warning level. Or whatever level it takes to get rid of the warnings. You may have some individual warnings that still show up, so you could raise the warning level or disable individual warnings with #pragma warning(disable: 4700) Some Boost library files also have this problem.
