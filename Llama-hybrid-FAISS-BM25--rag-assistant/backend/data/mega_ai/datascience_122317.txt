Rejoin Categorical Labels After Running Cluster Analysis

I'm working on creating a kNN & PCA analysis using 6 variables associated with different schools. The first step is to drop the school name label column which the first column, so only numeric values remain: random sample of 10 obervations only features features = new_df[new_df.columns[1:9]] features.sample(10) # Create a model based on 3 centroids model = KMeans(n_clusters = 3, init= 'k-means++', n_init=100, max_iter=1000) # Fit the data and predict the cluster assignment for each data point km_clusters = model.fit_predict(features.values) # View the cluster assigments km_clusters Then fit the data and I get the clusters. So my question is, how do I re-join the school name to the output with the assigned cluster label so I know which school was assigned to each? It seems like index is still in tact and in order, is it safe to use that and rejoin the dataframes?
