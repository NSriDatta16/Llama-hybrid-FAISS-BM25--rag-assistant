Calculating proportion of variance explained by random effect in multinomial GLMM

I have a multinomial logistic GLMM with one random intercept. The number of response categories $C = 4$. Since a multinomial logit model consists of $C-1$ binomial logit models -- each pairing one non-baseline response category with an arbitrarily chosen baseline category -- there are three random-effect parameters. Hosmer et al. (2013: 327) instruct that the proportion of the overall variation that is accounted for by the random component in a binary logistic GLMM can be estimated by $$\frac{\theta^2}{\frac{\pi^2}{3}+\theta^2}$$ where $\theta$ is the estimated standard deviation of the random effect, and $\pi$ (unless I'm gravely mistaken) is simply pi. How do we generalize this formula to a multinomial setting, where there are $C-1$ logits instead of one, and the random effect of each logit has a different $\theta$ and a different $n$? Note that I'm not asking how to test the significance of the random effect -- I already know roughly how that is done . I'm specifically interested in quantifying the proportion of the overall variability explained by the random effect. I imagine the answer might be some kind of mean of the result of the above formula over the $C-1$ logits. But if so, how should that mean be weighted? The response categories $c$ are not evenly distributed. FYI: $c1$ (the baseline category) has $n = 688$. $c2$ has $n = 747$. $c3$ has $n = 667$. $c4$ has $n = 437$. References: Hosmer, D.
