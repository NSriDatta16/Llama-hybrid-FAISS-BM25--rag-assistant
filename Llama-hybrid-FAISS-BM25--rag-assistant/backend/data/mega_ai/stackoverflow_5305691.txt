You can use SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'MY_TABLE' to return a bunch of information about the table. The Data_length column will contain the size of the data file used for that table. There is also an "average row length", Avg_row_length , that might be useful. See here for details: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/show-table-status.html . As mentioned in my comment above though, the number after an int declaration, int(11) , does not affect the size of the data structure that holds the integer. It only affects the display width of the column. Furthermore, you will only see its effect if you are using ZEROFILL .
