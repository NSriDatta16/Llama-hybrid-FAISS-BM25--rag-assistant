Generally I think this would encourage poor practice. Properties are supposed to represent some kind of state about the object in question, whereas methods should represent units of work. But many developers tend to put computationally intensive or relatively long-running code in the getters and setters where they would be much more appropriate as methods. Extending an object is not the same as deriving from it. If you need to add properties, from a philosophical perspective you're talking about needing to add stateful information to the object. That should be done by deriving from the class.
