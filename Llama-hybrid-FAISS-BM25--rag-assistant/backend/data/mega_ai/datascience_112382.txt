To answer your question. First think of only one column. Let's say your column has 10 unique values, so 10 categories. So, cat_szs will be 10. Then emb_szs will be calculated by the emb_szs=[(size, min(50, (size+1)//2)) for size in cat_szs]. Using the formula the your embedding layer will be of shape [(10,5)]. For every category you will have 5 dimension representing it. If you had label encoding you would represent it from 1,..., 10. But Now 1 would be for eg. [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4, 0.6] . Similary all the categories will have 5 dimensional representation. It is a way to represent categorical data. It is not always needed. You can also use Label Encoding , One Hot encoding, or other encodings. The advantage is that since you have a higher dimension representation, your model understands the data in a better way. You can look at below links to understand embeddings. https://jovian.ai/aakanksha-ns/shelter-outcome https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/embeddings/categorical-input-data
