I first introduce some notation and set up the problem using the simple approach you mentioned. Then go further. I will use $\mathbf{z}$ to refer to the vector Z you gave. Consider the following model, which lacks the explicit mention measurement error: $\bar{Z} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\mu_{Z} + \epsilon_i}{n}$, where $\bar{Z}$ is the estimated average value of $\mathbf{z}$, and $\mu_Z$ is the true average value of Z. Here, $\mathbf{\epsilon}$ is a vector of the errors in your data, and you expect that if your sample is large $\bar{Z}$ will converge to $\mu_Z$. If you simply take the observed $Z$ values and average them, you get $\bar{Z}$ and if you compute the sample standard deviation you get $\hat{\sigma}$, the estimate of the true population standard deviation $\sigma$. What if you would like to make use of some knowledge about the measurement error? First, note that we can reformulate the initial model as: $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{1}\beta + \epsilon$, where $\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of ones, and $\beta$ will end up being $\bar{Z}$. Now this really looks like regression, but we are still basically just getting an estimate of $\mu_Z$. If we perform a regression like this, we will also get an estimate for the standard error of $\epsilon$, which is almost what we want - this is nothing but the standard error of $\mathbf{z}$ (but we still want to account for measurement error). We can augment our initial model to obtain a mixed effects model. $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{1}\beta + \mathbf{Q}u +\epsilon$, where $u$ is a vector of random effects, and $\mathbf{Q}$ is the regressor relating $\mathbf{z}$ to $u$. As with any random effect, you will need to make an assumption about the distribution of $u$. Is it correct that $Z_\sigma$ is the distribution of the measurement error for $\mathbf{z}$? If yes, this can be used to provide the distribution of the random effects. Typically, software to perform basic mixed effects modeling will assume the random effects have a normal distribution (with mean 0...) and estimate the variance for you. Perhaps you can try this to test the concept. If you wish to use your prior information about the distribution of the measurement error, a Bayesian mixed effects model is in order. You can use R2OpenBUGS. After estimating this model, the standard error you get for the residuals $\epsilon$ is the standard error you express interest in. Intuitively, the random effects component of the model is soaking up some of the variation that you can explain because you know there is measurement error. This allows you to obtain a more relevant estimate of the variation of $\epsilon$ See this paper for a deeper discussion on this approach of random effects to account for measurement error. Your situation is similar to the one the authors introduce for $\mathbf{D}$ and its measurement error corrupted version $\mathbf{W}$. The example in Section 4 may offer some insights into your situation. As mentioned by whuber, you may wish to account for autocorrelation in your data. Using random effects will not solve that problem.
