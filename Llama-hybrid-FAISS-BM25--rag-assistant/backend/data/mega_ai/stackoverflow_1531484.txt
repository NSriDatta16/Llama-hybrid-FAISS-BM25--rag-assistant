When using DragDrop.DoDragDrop(), I use a Sub that Handles the Me.DragOver event (in VB) so it looks as follows. Mind you, my control has a ListBox wrapped in a ScrollViewer. Private Sub ListBox_Items_DragOver(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.DragEventArgs) Handles Me.DragOver Dim currentMousePoint As Point = e.GetPosition(_containtingScrollViewer) If Math.Abs(currentMousePoint.Y - _containtingScrollViewer.ActualHeight) This gives me the ability to scroll whilst dragging items. You can tweak the tolerances to get better/smoother scrolling as needed.
