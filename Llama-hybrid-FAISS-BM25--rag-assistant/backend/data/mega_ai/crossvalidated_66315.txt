Gentler approach to Bayesian statistics

I recently started reading "Introduction to Bayesian Statistics" 2nd Edition by Bolstad. I've had an introductory stats class that covered mainly statistical tests and am almost through a class in regression analysis. What other books can I use to supplement my understanding this one? I've made it through the first 100-125 pages fine. Afterwards the book begins to talk hypothesis testing which is what I'm very excited to cover but there a couple of things throwing me: The use of probability density functions in calculations. In other words how to evaluate such equations. This whole sentence: "Suppose we use a beta(1,1) prior for pi. Then given y=8, the posterior density is beta(9,3). The posterior probability of the null hypothesis is..." I believe beta(1,1) refers to a PDF where the mean is 1 and the stdev is 1? I don't get how it would change to a beta(9,3) as a posterior density function. I do get the concept of priors vs posteriors and understand how to apply them using a table manually. I get (I think!) that pi represents the supposed population proportion or probability. I don't get how to connect this together with data I would run into on a day to day basis and get results.
