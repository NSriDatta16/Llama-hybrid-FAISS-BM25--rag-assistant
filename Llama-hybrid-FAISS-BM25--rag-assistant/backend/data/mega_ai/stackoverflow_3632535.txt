How to change position of newsletter box in Magento sidebar?

I have a newsletter box in my Magento sidebar that I need to change the position of. It appears beneath the app/design/frontend/default/theme/template/callouts/right_col.php template. I've been trying to get my head around the XML files for layout. I couldn't find any mention of newsletter in page.xml or catalog.xml . There is a newsletter.xml , but I couldn't get my head around it. How do I move it?
