What is "feature space"?

What is the definition of "feature space"? For example, When reading about SVMs, I read about "mapping to feature space". When reading about CART, I read about "partitioning to feature space". I understand what's going on, especially for CART, but I think that there is some definition that I have missed. Is there a general definition of "feature space"? Is there a definition that will give me more insight into SVM kernels and/or CART?
