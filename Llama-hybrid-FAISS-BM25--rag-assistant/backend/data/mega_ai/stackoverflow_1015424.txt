Occurrence prediction

I'd like to know what method is best suited for predicting event occurrences. For example, given a set of data from 5 years of malaria infection occurrences and several other factors that affect the occurrences, I'd like to predict the next five years for malaria infection occurrences. What I thought of doing was to derive a kind of occurrence factor using fuzzy logic rules, and then average the occurrences with the occurrence factor to get the first predicted occurrence, and then average all again with the predicted occurrence and keep on iterating for all five years, but I decided to seek for help online.
