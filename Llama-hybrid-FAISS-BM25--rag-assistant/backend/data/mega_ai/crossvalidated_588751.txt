How can fully convolution neural networks handle images of different sizes?

I've read that if we want to use images of different sizes in a convolutional neural network without resizing the images to a default size, we can use Fully Convolutional Neural Networks. But I do not see how they solve the issue of images of different sizes. In this video Andrew Ng explains how we can turn a fully connected layer into a fully convolutional layer, you can see the complete drawing which presents the idea at 3:45 , if you don't want to watch the entire video. But with only this change we still couldn't use images of different sizes. The critical part is where Andrew transformed a $5$ x $5$ x $16$ volume into a $1$ x $1$ x $400$ volume using $400$ filters with size $5$ x $5$ . But given an input image of a different size, this won't work anymore. If the input image will be larger, then the volume at that layer won't be $5$ x $5$ x $16$ anymore, and so the $5$ x $5$ filters won't turn the volume into a $1$ x $1$ x $400$ volume, and the rest of the neural network won't work anymore. So what do people mean when they say that a fully connected network can work with images of different sizes, since this fully connected network couldn't accept an image of a different size if we wanted to do that. What am I missing? I've tried to read the original Fully Convolutional Neural Networks paper, but I am not sure I understand it.
