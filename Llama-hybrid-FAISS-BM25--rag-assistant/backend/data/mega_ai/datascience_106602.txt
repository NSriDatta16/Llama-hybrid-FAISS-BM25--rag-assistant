Question on embedding similarity / nearest neighbor methods [SCANN Paper]

Question on embedding similarity / nearest neighbor methods: In https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04426 the DeepMind team writes: For a database of T elements, we can query the approximate nearest neighbors in O(log(T)) time. We use the SCaNN library [https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/announcing-scann-efficient-vector.html] Could someone provide an intuitive explanation for this time complexity of ANN? Thanks! A very Happy New Year Earthling's!
