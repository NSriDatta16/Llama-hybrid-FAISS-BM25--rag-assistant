The .obj file format is highly conserved between VS2005 and VS2010. This should not be a problem, especially since it is a simple non-mangled symbol reference. And especially not when it works in the Release configuration but not in Debug. A simple explanation is always better than a convoluted one: your customer simply forgot to add your .lib file to the linker's Additional Dependencies setting. Beware that the setting change needs to be made for both configurations, use the "Configuration" combo in the upper left corner of the dialog. You can help your customer fall into the pit of success by using #pragma comment(lib, "mumble.lib") in your .h file.
