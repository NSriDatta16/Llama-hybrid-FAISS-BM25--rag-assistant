Oftentimes scalability and performance are ultimately married to each other in the sense that six months from now management comes back and says "Function Y in Application X is running unacceptably slow, how do we speed it up?" And all too the often the answer is to upgrade the back end solution. And when it comes to upgrading back ends, its almost always going to less expensive to scale out than to scale up in terms of hardware. So, long story short, I would recommend building a middleware app that specifically handles incoming requests from the user app and then routes them to the appropriate destination. This will sufficiently abstract your front-end user app from the back end storage solution so that when scalability does become an issue only the middleware app will need to be updated.
