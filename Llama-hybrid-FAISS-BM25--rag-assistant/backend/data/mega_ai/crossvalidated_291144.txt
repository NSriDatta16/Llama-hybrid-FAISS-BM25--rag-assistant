I believe too that your series can jump all over the place with the 2nd approach, but have a (near) constant mean. That's why people detrend or difference time series. for me, i would normalise both series in terms of each observation and compare them. To compare, you would have to apply the same normalization to both time series. And which one to use depends on correlation or variance. Or, couldn't you index both series? Let's say the first observation in each series is 10. Then you have them on the same scale, and you can compare them
