Interpretation of PCA principal components

As a result of a PCA analysis with some initial correlated variables $X_1,..,X_k$ we often do a plot of the loadings to intepret the principal components: PLOT 1: Plot of the loadings: We call $v^i,i=1..K$ the principal components (so that $v^{i}\cdot v^{j}=\delta_{i,j}$ ). Indicating the components with a lower index $v^i_a,i=1..K,a=1...K$ , we plot for a fixed i the loadings $v^i_a, a=1...K$ . Given the formula for every data point $x$ : $x=\sum_i (v^{i}\cdot x) \ v^i$ , we can interpret $v^i_a$ as the contribution of variable $a$ to component $i$ . Alternatively we can do what I call here a correlation plot (my terminology): PLOT 2: Correlation plot: We can interprest a principal component $i$ defining the score $S^{i}=\sum_a X_a v_a^{i}$ (by theory $E[S^{i}S^{j}]=0$ if $i \ne j$ ), and define $y^{i}_a \equiv E[S^{i}X_a]=\sum_{a'}E[X_aX_{a'}]v_{a'}^{i} $ . We can plot (at fixed $i$ ) $y^{i}_a$ as a function of $a$ and interpret $y^i_a$ as the contribution of variable $a$ to the principal component $i$ as well. Question: which one is the more meaningful plot to intepret the principal components? I would be tempted to say that the correlation plot does not make much sense because the $X_a$ are not independent. Therefore a correlation between $S_i$ and $X_a$ could be spurious and due to a correlation between $S_i$ and an $X_b$ with whom $X_a$ is correlated . But I would like to know other opinions (since I am not sure) and if the correlation plot has some application or interpretation. PS: Note that the correlation plot, according to my understanding, is very much related to the circle plot, where one tries to intepret/group the original variables (not the principal components) by considering, at a fixed original variable $a$ , $y^{i}_a$ as a function of $i$ (in a circle plot just for i=1,2). Told another way, in this context a parallel of the correlation plot similar to the circle plot, would be a plot where (at fixed original variable $a$ ) $y^{i}_a$ is plotted as a function of $i$ . Since the $S_i$ are independent between each other maybe the spurious effect discussed above does not show up. Any opinion/comments/answers? I am always confused about PCA intepretation and would like to fill this hole in my understanding...
