Markdown and image alignment

I am making a site that publishes articles in issues each month. It is straightforward, and I think using a Markdown editor (like the WMD one here in Stack Overflow) would be perfect. However, they do need the ability to have images right-aligned in a given paragraph . I can't see a way to do that with the current system - is it possible?
