MSAccess 2003 - VBA for passing a value from one form to another

So how can I pass a value from one form to another? For example: The user select's an organization from a list and this opens up a trip form that allows a user to enter various information regarding the trip. At one place I would like to add another little pop up form where they can enter contact information (just a name and phone for POC) of the organization they are visiting. So when that initial form opened from the selection screen it has two IDs that are simply hidden in text boxes (one being the tripID, and the other being the OrgID), so how do I pass these to the second little pop up form so that the contact information has the relative IDs with it. Thanks.
