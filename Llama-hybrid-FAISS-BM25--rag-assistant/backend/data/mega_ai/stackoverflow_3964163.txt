From Hulu's website Who are some of Hulu’s top technology partners? Hulu leverages several technology partners to help provide a high-quality and trusted service for our users including Akamai, who manages our content delivery network (CDN), and Adobe who is Hulu’s video player platform provider. It appears Netflix also use Akamai for 51% of their traffic for a reported $0.015 per GB (sources here and here ).
