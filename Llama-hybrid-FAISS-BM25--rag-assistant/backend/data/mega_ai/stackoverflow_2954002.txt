How can I save content from another website to my database?

I want to upload dynamically content from a soccer live score website to my database. I also want to do this daily, from a single page on that website (the soccer matches for that day). If you can help me only with the connection and retrieval of data from that webpage, I will manage the rest. website: http://soccerstand.com/ language: php/java - mysql Thank you !
