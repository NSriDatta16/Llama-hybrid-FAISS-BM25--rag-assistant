I would add to Dan Levin's answer that when you want to justify a method, the "scientific/engineering way" is to first produce a bibliographical study , where you basically prove that your approach covers an important part of what is commonly known as state-of-the-art methods. I would resume this as follow: Look for commonly used methods that are known to be efficient for outlier detection. Summarize their applicability domains (medicine, biology, network security..) and try to link their strong points to your application in order to select some promising methods. Try the selected methods with usual validation processes inherent to machine learning problems. Defining what the state-of-the-art consists of a lot of work , is absolutely necessary and is very specific to your application .
