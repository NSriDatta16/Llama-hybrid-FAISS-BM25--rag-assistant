Variable declarations can only be declared in blocks, basically. Looks at the grammar for "statement" in the Java Language Specification - it includes Block, but not LocalVariableDeclarationStatement - the latter is part of the grammar for a block . This is effectively a matter of pragmatism: you can only use a single statement if you don't have a brace. There's no point in declaring a variable if you have no subsequent statements, because you can't use that variable. You might as well just have an expression statement without the variable declaration - and that is allowed. This prevents errors such as: if (someCondition) int x = 0; System.out.println(x); which might look okay at first glance, but is actually equivalent to: if (someCondition) { int x = 0; } System.out.println(x); Personally I always use braces anyway, as it makes that sort of bug harder to create. (I've been bitten by it once, and it was surprisingly tricky to spot the problematic code.)
