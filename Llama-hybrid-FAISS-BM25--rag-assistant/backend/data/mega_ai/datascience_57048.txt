Something easy and simple is to get the absolute difference of each point from the two time-series and then use those values to decide. For example, you can get the average, standard deviation, maximum and minimum of the absolute differences and see in what limits you can safely accept the deployment. Another way is to use a Granger Causality Test , which is used (among other things) to find if two time-series are statistically different.
