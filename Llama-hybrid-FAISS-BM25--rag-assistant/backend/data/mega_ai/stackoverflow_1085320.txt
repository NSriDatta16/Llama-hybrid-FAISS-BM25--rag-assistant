It depends on the conditions.. Profilers are nice for general global views however if you really need an accurate view my recommendation is KISS. Simply run the code in a loop such that it takes a minute or so to complete. Then compute a simple average based on the total run time and iterations executed. This approach allows you to: Obtain accurate results with low resolution timers. Not run into issues where instrumentation interferes with high speed caches (l2,l1,branch..etc) close to the processor. However running the same code in a tight loop can also provide optimistic results that may not reflect real world conditions.
