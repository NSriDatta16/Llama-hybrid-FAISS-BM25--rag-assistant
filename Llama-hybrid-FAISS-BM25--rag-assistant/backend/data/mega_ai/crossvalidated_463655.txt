I don't think adding counts of named entities can help. You should ask a question: do you think that you would be able to better decide about sentiment of a sentence if you knew the number of entities in the sentence? I don't think so. If you prefer more data-driven reasoning, you can try to plot your training data with respect to the features and have a look if the features seem to separate the classes in the train data. If not, they are probably useless. When using deep learning, we usually do not explicitly introduce linguistically features. A typical approach would be using a pre-trained encoder (such as BERT) or pre-trained word embeddings and add an LSTM/CNN to get a single vector from the embeddings. The pre-trained components are usually somehow aware of the linguistic features and using them as an explicit input does not further improve the performance.
