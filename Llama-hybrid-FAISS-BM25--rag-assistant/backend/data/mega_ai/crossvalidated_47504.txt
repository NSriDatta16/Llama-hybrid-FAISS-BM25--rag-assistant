The $Y^*$ you propose is a weighted average of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, with weights inversely proportional to their variances, which seems to me right. The problem then is the existence of missing data. I think you might define your index as $Y^*$ when both $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are observed, and just $Y_1$ or $Y_2$ if you only observe one. The problem might be that the resulting index would be non-homogeneous in variance, as in some periods it makes use of more information than in others. How large is this effect depends on the correlation among $Y_1$ and $Y_2$. A more sophisticated method to derive an index from several overlapping an possibly incomplete time series might follow the method in CASTROVIEJO, P.M. y TUSELL, F. (2007) Using redundant and incomplete time series for the estimation of cost of living indices , Review of Income and Wealth , vol. 53 , p. 673-691.
