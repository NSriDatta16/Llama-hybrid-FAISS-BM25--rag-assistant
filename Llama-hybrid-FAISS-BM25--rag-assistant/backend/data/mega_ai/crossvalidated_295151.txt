Finding weights of a neural network by hand

Given the four points $(x_1,x_2) = (0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)$, corresponding class labels $(1,1,1,-1)$ and activation units $y = f_H (w_0+\sum_i x_i w_i )$ and $f_H(\alpha)$ $\begin{cases} -1 ; \alpha We have to show by specifying parameters that the above dataset can be classified with a single activation unit. Plotting the points, I can see that (this NAND function) is linearly separable - but i) how do I show analytically that the solution only requires one activation unit? Furthermore, the four equations for $w_0,w_1,w_2$ seem to be underdetermined ii) what would be the systematic approach by hand (I can find solutions just by random guessing, but...)? Thank you
