Android mdpi drawables for use on both Droid phone and Xoom?

I have an app developed for a Droid (phone). In the app, I use: Bitmap b = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), R.drawable.bg); To set the background bitmap in the application. The bitmap is sized 480x800 which is the WVGA screen size of the Droid (without status or title bar). Two questions: When I rotate the phone, the Droid goes into landscape mode and the background no longer fits correctly. How do I tell the App it needs to use landscape mode when I'm not using a layout? Second, when I run this app on the Xoom, it picks the mdpi drawable which is nowhere near the size of the Xoom screen. How do I define a second mdpi drawable that has a 1280x800 size? I think if I were using layouts, I would create a layout-xlarge directory and place a 1280x800 background in the imageview of that layout, correct? Thanks! Update * : Thanks for the great answers! I upvoted everyone. I updated the code to use drawable-xlarge-port/drawable-xlarge-land for the Xoom and drawable-port-mdpi/drawable-land-mdpi for the Droid. I'm not using layouts as I needed to draw directly onto the activity canvas and not sure how to use setContentView() from within the class where I extend View and hook into onDraw() in order to do the animation (would need to be a separate posting). If I can figure out how to rotate the image myself I could indeed do away with the drawable-*-land and *-port directories.
