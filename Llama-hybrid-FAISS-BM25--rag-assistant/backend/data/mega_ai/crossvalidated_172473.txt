A PMF of demand for humanitarian meals based on a Time Series

Given previous quarterly data on the demand for humanitarian meals, how should I create a Probability Mass Function (PMF) of demand per year? I do not seek an actual function; a table of probabilities of annual demand would be perfect. For example: Annual Demand Probability 500,000 .25 1,000,000 .32 ... I've considered using ARIMA or Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, but I only know how to use these to forecast future values. I don't know how to create a PMF/PDF using these methods. I have data from 29 previous quarters. Here is the R code to create the dataframe. meals Plotting the data does seem to show a seasonal component, but no trend. This makes sense, given that demand is based on disaster events, including seasonal storms. plot(meals, typ="l", col="brown", lwd=3, main="Humanitarian Meals Demand")
