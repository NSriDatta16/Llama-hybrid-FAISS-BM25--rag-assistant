loading XML string into Xslt sheet

I am trying to load a xml document I created using PHP and DOM into a xslt sheet, but having no luck. $xml_string = $doc->saveXML(); //echo $xml_string; $xml = new DOMDocument; $xml->load($xml_string); $xsl = new DOMDocument; $xsl->load('musicInformation.xslt'); // Configure the transformer $proc = new XSLTProcessor; $proc->importStyleSheet($xsl); // attach the xsl rules echo $proc->transformToXML($xml); I created a xml file based off some data extracted from a database and instead of saving it as an actual document I saved it as a string, I put the string into the xslt sheet and this error occurred Warning: I/O warning : failed to load external entity Warning: xpath.c:11079 Internal error: document without root in /home/dd615/public_html/webservice.php on line 73 Any help would be much appreciated.
