Don't even try to erect limits on the web! It really is as simple as this. Every potential measure to discourage ripping (aside from a very strict robots.txt) will harm your users. Captchas are more pain than gain. Checking the user agent shuts out unexpected browsers. The same is true for "clever" tricks with javascript. Please keep the web open. If you don't want anything to be taken from your website, then do not publish it there. Watermarks can help you claim ownership, but that only helps when you want to sue after the harm is done.
