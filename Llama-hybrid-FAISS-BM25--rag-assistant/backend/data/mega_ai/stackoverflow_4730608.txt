When using NSTextStorage , you can use the words method to get to the number of words. It might not be the most memory-efficient way to count words, but it does a pretty good job at ignoring punctuation marks and other non-word characters: NSString *input = @"one - two three four ."; NSTextStorage *storage = [[NSTextStorage alloc] initWithString:input]; NSLog(@"word count: %u", [[storage words] count]); The output will be word count: 4 .
