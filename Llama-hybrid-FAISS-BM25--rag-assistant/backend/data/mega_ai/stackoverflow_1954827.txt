Browser-populated form input text gets styled differently, makes input fields unreadable

I'm working on the my site which is done with a black background. I've changed the coloring on the form input fields. However, when I return to a page with saved text in a field, the background color becomes white, and the text color stays a light color (grey) and thus becomes somewhat unreadable. e.g. input{ background-color:black; color:white; } Presumably there is some way to style this "text that is pre-populated by the browser based on previous responses", but I don't know what css allows access to it, or what it would be called to search for it. Tried: Searching through the css pseudo-classes, google searching through form styling tutorials, etc. Browser inspecting the form elements for relevant user-agent css, nothing. Point me in the right direction?
