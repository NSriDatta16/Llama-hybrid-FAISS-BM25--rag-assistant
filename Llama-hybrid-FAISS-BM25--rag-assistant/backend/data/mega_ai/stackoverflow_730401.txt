Upcasting and generic lists

I have the following class hierarchy: public abstract class BaseData { //some properties } public class CoData : BaseData { //some properties } I am working with a method that requires the return type to be List . In the method, I have access to List public List Save() { List listCoData = GetData(); return listCoData; } If I understand correctly, I can upcast from a CoData to a BaseData . But, when I have a list, it errors out even if I explicitly try to typecast. Error: Error 118 Cannot implicitly convert type 'System.Collections.Generic.List ' to System.Collections.Generic.List ' EDIT: mquander's Conversion approach seems to work for me in 3.0 Is downcasting done the same way as well? from ie., Can I do this - List listCoData = listBaseData.Cast ().ToList();
