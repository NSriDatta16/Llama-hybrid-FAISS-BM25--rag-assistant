Anyone know of an Asp.Net C# CMS type system with a Forms Module

We have a large internal data collection website. I don't have time to create form based data collection pages for every department. I was thinking that there might be some kind of WYSIWYG forms creation module that could be run on top of our website. System would be like a cms, but one that allows custom pages to be created. All the form page setup is run from the database. So when a department head needs to implement a forms data collection page they can go in and create a page, and drag and drop all the form fields and position the elements. Then all form submission data is saved to one primary set of tables that I can query and generate custom reports on the data or utilize for custom page processing. System should allow: Choose the names of fields on the form Choose the field type: textbox, checkbox, radio buttons, dropdown Choose the validation: required, max length, data type, as well as the error message shown when validation fails Choose the order in which the fields are displayed To be able to add conditional logic to the fields (i.e. if this is yes, then that is required or hide that field) Choose to capture data into a database when the form is submitted To retrieve the data stored in the database so it can be transformed into something meaningful To be able to create forms by copying other forms and editing them To be able to reuse the forms in many pages To be able to add pagination to the forms (so the form isn't soooo long) To be able to display a customized message when the form is submitted.
