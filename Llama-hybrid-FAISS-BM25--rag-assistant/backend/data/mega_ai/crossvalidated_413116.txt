Generally speaking, your features need to be scaled (normalized, standardized, etc.) before processed by most Machine Learning techniques. There are several for which this is required. A couple are: Many distance-based models (e.g. k-NN, k-means) might treat features with a higher range of values with more importance. Neural Networks trained with Gradient Descent converge faster if their input features are scaled to the same range reference . Additionally, it helps keep their activations and subsequently their weights small. There are however algorithms (e.g. tree-based ones) that don't gain any benefit from normalizing your features. In any case, though, it's a good practice to do so.
