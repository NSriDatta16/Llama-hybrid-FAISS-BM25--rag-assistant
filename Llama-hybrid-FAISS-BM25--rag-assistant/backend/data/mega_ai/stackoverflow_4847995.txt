I admit this is not an area in which I have a great deal of experience, so I may be completly wrong but it could be that requests are being made by flash content on a third party site. It's also possible that the host making the request has an application or browser extension installed (EncycloPDF?) that added to the browser's User-Agent value to announce it's presence to servers in the same manner as Windows Media Centre, the .NET Framework and Silverlight do on Windows
