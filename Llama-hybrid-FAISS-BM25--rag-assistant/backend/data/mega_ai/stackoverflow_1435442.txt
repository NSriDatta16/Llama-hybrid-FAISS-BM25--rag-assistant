What is the best way to store and instantiate list of classes in C++ without using STL?

I have a code similar to the following: class News { public: virtual void get() = 0; } class Cnn : News { void get () {...} } class Msnbc : News { void get () {...} } class Bbc : News { void get () {...} } main () { News * news = new Cnn; news->get () News * news = new Msnbc; news->get () News * news = new Bbc; news->get () } Instead of creating each sub-classes, what is the best way to store the sub-classes (Cnn, Msnbc...) and iterate over and get a news from all of the feeds (I can't use STL at a moment) Thanks
