I would say that this is not a use case for machine learning. Since each data point has only one dimension you can just intelligibly pick a threshold. Density estimation (KDE, GMM, etc..) would help you determine how to do this correctly. If you are using this as a simple example of a machine learning algorithm, then try logistic regression. It will project your data between 0 and 1, from which point you can scale it between -1 and 1.
