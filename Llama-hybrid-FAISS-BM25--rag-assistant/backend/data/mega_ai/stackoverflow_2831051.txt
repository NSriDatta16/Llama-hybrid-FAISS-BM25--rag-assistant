A pretty straightforward solution would be to assign a common (thumb or whatever) class to all the small images, and store the filename of the bigger images within their rel attributes, e.g.: $(".thumb").click(function() { $("#bigImage").attr('src', $(this).attr("rel")); }); data is another storage mechanism you might consider. It is also quite common (and simple) to follow a particular convention and 'assemble' the filename of the larger image based on the src of the clicked smaller one, for example: $(".thumb").click(function() { $("#bigImage").attr('src', 'big_' + $(this).attr("src")); }); That assumes that all of your full-sized images are prefixed with 'big_', so it's a simple matter of appending 'big_' to the src of the clicked thumbnail.
