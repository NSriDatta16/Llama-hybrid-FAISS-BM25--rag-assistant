Gnuplot : xtics - place strings at tics

I am new to gnuplot, and am trying to create a stacked histogram for a project. The problem I am running into is, that I am not able to put ticlabels on the x-axis (even if I could, they are not getting formatted in a neat way). My gp file is as follows: Here is a snapshot of my data file: CC P1-X P1-Y P2-X P2-Y 1 0.1097586 0.3262812 1.980848 5.9098402 2 0.1010986 0.2988812 0.9966702 5.8378412 3 0.4017474 0.7559452 4.41813 11.7404132 4 0.1028442 0.2974772 1.418744 6.0554552 5 0.1097316 0.3216112 1.967492 5.8007364 6 0.954794 0.3004874 0.9568386 5.778537 And here is my gp file: set title "GCC compilation option by average execution time as stacked histogram" set terminal jpeg medium set output "histosmalldata.jpeg" set boxwidth 0.9 absolute set style fill solid 1.00 border -1 set key autotitle columnheader set key outside right top vertical Left reverse enhanced autotitles columnhead nobox set key invert samplen 4 spacing 1 width 0 height 0 set style histogram rowstacked title offset character 0, 0, 0 set style data histograms set xtics border in scale 1,0.5 nomirror rotate by -45 offset character 0, 0, 0 set xtics norangelimit set xtics ("O2-ffast-math-finline-functions" 1, "O2-funroll-loops-march=barcelona-ffast-math-finline-functions" 2, "GCCFLAGS_O0" 3, "O2-ftree-vectorize-funroll-loops-march=barcelona" 4, "GCCFLAGS_O2" 5, "O2-ftree-vectorize-funroll-loops-ffast-math" 6) set xtics 1,6 nomirror set ytics 0,100 nomirror set ytics 1 set yrange [0:20] set ylabel "Time" set xlabel "GCC Compiler Options" plot 'smalldata' using 2:xtic(1) ti col, '' using 3 ti col, '' using 4 ti col, '' using 5 ti col This is the image of the graph: Now, in the x axis, I am having 1,2,3 - 6 which I don't want, instead, I would want "O2-ffast-math-finline-functions" for 1 and so on in a neat formatted way. I wrote this script after consulting some examples from gnuplot page and do not have a good understanding of some of the verbs, so apart from the solution, any general comments are welcome. Thank you, Sayan
