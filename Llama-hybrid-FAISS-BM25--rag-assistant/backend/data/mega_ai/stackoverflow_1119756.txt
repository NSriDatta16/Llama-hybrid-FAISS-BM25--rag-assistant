If you're using c++ you can use custom memory allocators. But probably you don't need to track every memory allocation, only most memory intensive parts of your program need to. One option is allocate blocks of memory at start-up and use a LRU cache to reuse your allocated memory blocks and keep in memory only most recently used data. Your program will also be faster (no allocation is needed during runtime) and you will prevent memory fragmentation due to allocating/freeing memory.
