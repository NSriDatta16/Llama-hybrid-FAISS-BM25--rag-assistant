Case sensitive Vs insensitive syntax

Can anyone make really a good case ( :-) ) for being case sensitive? C#: case sensitive VB.NET: not case sensitive C++: case sensitive ... Worse part: XML which is used inside a language like VB.NET is case sensitive. I was making the case that it is ridiculous and can only cause harm after we found a bug in our system due to the fact that XML had both V alue and v alue nodes... I am asked over and over in comments "Perhaps you can come up with a single argument for why case insensitive is the right choice in such a world?" Here is an example: I see it analogous to the issue of: URL's should be case sensitive? www.cnn.com <> Www.cNN.com ? Of course they should be the same, ID theft heaven! because humans don't put that much attention to 2 strings that are the same but might have otherwise different casing. Programmers are humans. So getAge() and getage() are the same in most human's minds. Please notice: I do not think we want the code to actually have a function defined as getAget() and then have code calling it getage(), VS (vb.net) will automatically correct getaget to getAge. So the code is clear and the programmer is aware of the correct capitalization. My point is: good IDE makes the issue non relevant, but it works better in a non case-sesnsetive language like vb.net then lets say c#. Reference: here
