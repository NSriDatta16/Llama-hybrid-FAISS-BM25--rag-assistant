Book for Learning XML and Java

I have a very basic knowledge regarding XML. But now I want to dig more related to this. I am using Java so I would like to ask for advise on what particular book is useful in my case. Can you share with me the best possible book that I could purchase. I tried to look at amazon but I got discouraged in some of the reviews that these book are out of date while other says that this one is worthless. My knowledge in java is perhaps ahead of the beginner stage. Any recommendations?
