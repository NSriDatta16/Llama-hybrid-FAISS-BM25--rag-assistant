Sending UDP datagram without fragmentation

I want to send broadcast message to all peers in my local network. Message is a 32 bit integer. I can be sure, that message will not me fragmented, right? There will be two options: - peer will receive whole message at once - peer will not receive message at all Going further, 4 bytes is maximum size of data, that can be sent in one UDP datagram? I use Ethernet based network in 99%.
