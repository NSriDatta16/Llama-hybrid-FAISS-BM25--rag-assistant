Z Score Values Used and Interpretation

I have been working on a time series-like data set from using calcium indicators (waveform data). A script I was given transforms the voltages (x values) into Z-scores. However, the mean and standard deviation used in calculating these scores are from a baseline period before the trial, which makes it look something like this: $$ x_{trial} - \mu_{baseline} \over \sigma_{baseline} $$ I know that the "x - mu" represents the difference between voltages during the trial and mean voltages at baseline, but how would using a baseline standard deviation affect the interpretation? Similarly, how would using a mu value from the trial and sigma value from the baseline period be interpreted? Thanks in advance!
