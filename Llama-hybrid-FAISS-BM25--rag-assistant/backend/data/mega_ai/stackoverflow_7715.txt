Naming conventions allow the development team to design discovereability and maintainability at the heart of the project. A good naming convention takes time to evolve but once it’s in place it allows the team to move forward with a common language. A good naming convention grows organically with the project. A good naming convention easily copes with changes during the longest and most important phase of the software lifecycle - service management in production. Here are my answers: Yes, table names should be plural when they refer to a set of trades , securities , or counterparties for example. Yes. Yes. SQL tables are prefixed with tb_, views are prefixed vw_, stored procedures are prefixed usp_ and triggers are prefixed tg_ followed by the database name. Column name should be lower case separated by underscore. Naming is hard but in every organisation there is someone who can name things and in every software team there should be someone who takes responsibility for namings standards and ensures that naming issues like sec_id , sec_value and security_id get resolved early before they get baked into the project. So what are the basic tenets of a good naming convention and standards: - Use the language of your client and your solution domain Be descriptive Be consistent Disambiguate, reflect and refactor Don’t use abbreviations unless they are clear to everyone Don’t use SQL reserved keywords as column names
