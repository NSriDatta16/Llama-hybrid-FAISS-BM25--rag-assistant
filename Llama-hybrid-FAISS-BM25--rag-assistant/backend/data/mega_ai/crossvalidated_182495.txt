Note that the case where the number of heads and the number of tails are equal is the same as "exactly half the time you get heads". So let's stick to counting the number of heads to see if it's half the number of tosses or equivalently comparing the proportion of heads with 0.5. The more you flip, the larger the number of possible counts of heads you can have -- the distribution becomes more spread out (e.g. an interval for the number of heads containing 95% of the probability will grow wider as the number of tosses increases), so the probability of exactly half heads will tend to go down as we toss more. Correspondingly, the proportion of heads will take more possible values; see here, where we move from 100 tosses to 200 tosses: With 100 tosses we can observe a proportion of 0.49 heads or 0.50 heads or 0.51 heads (and so on -- but nothing in between those values), but with 200 tosses, we can observe 0.49 or 0.495 or 0.50 or 0.505 or 0.510 - the probability has more values to "cover" and so each will tend to get a smaller share. Consider than you have $2n$ tosses with some probability $p_i$ of getting $i$ heads (we know these probabilities but it's not critical for this part), and you add two more tosses. In $2n$ tosses, $n$ heads is the most likely outcome ($p_n>p_{n\pm 1}$ and it goes down from there). What's the chance of having $n+1$ heads in $2n+2$ tosses? (Label these probabilities with $q$ so we don't confuse them with the previous ones; also let P(HH) be the probability of "Head,Head" in the next two tosses, and so on) $q_{n+1} = p_{n-1} P(HH) + p_n (P(HT)+P(TH)) + p_{n+1} P(TT)$ $\qquad i.e. if you add two more coin-tosses, the probability of the middle value naturally goes down because it averages the most likely (middle) value with the average of the smaller values either side) So as long as you're comfortable that the peak will be in the middle (for $2n= 2,4,6,...$), the probability of exactly half heads must decrease as $n$ goes up. In fact we can show that for large $n$, $p_n$ decreases proportionally with $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ (unsurprisingly, since the distribution of the standardized number of heads approaches normality and the variance of the proportion of heads decreases with $n$). As requested, here's R code that produces something close to the above plot: x1 = 25:75 x2 = 50:150 plot(x1 / 100, dbinom(x1, 100, 0.5), type = "h", main = "Proportion of heads in 100 and 200 tosses", xlab = "Proportion of heads", ylab = "probability") points(x2 / 200, dbinom(x2, 200, 0.5), type = "h", col = 3)
