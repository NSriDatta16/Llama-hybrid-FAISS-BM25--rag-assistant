Ive just look into Inkspace sources and found such code, may be it help you: // Magic Bezier Drag Equations follow! // "weight" describes how the influence of the drag should be distributed // among the handles; 0 = front handle only, 1 = back handle only. double weight, t = _t; if (t front()->move(first->front()->position() + offset0); second->back()->move(second->back()->position() + offset1); In you case "first->front()" and "second->back()" would mean two control points
