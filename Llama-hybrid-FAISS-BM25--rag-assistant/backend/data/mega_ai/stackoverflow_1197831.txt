This event log information, faulting module etc, is not for you to use it to track the exception, but rather on Microsoft part to properly organize errors. The fault address is almost never the same between 2 different crashes on the same module, so its useful to distinguish the crash when Windows Error Report runs. Right now the best thing you can do, is when the application crashes, make sure you send the report to Microsoft. Also if you really need, using this event log, someone inside Microsoft can help you track the issue. If this is windows vista, there is a BucketID in the event log, on the 1001 event that is useful for tracking this issues. Since w3wp.exe is a owned by Microsoft, someone probably already took a look at this crash, on the upcoming windows 7 you will get response back with a solution when available so you won't have to worry on looking for this codes.
