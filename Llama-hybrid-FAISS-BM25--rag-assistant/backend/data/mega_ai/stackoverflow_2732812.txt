How to add a hyperlink column in an UltraWebgrid that will redirect me to a popup window

I am pretty new to Infragistics controls and finding it hard to add a hyperlink column to the ultraweb grid. Can anyone help me out with this. Currently, I am binding the data coming from the Database to the grid. To this data I need to add a hyperlink column "View" that will redirect me to a popup. I need to pass some values from this page to the popup. Need pointers if this can be done on Javascript. I am unable to get the code anywhere. It would be really helpful if someone can help me out Regards, Sunitha
