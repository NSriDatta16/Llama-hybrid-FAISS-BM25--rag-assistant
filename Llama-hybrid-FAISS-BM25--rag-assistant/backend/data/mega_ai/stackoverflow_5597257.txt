I suppose that in GAE there is no really need for minify your html as GAE already gzip it Caching & GZip on GAE (Community Wiki) I did not test but minified version of html will probably win only 1% of size as it only remove space once both version are compressed. If you want to save storage, for example by memcached it, you have more interest to gzip it (even at low level of compression) than removing space as in python it will be probably smaller and faster as processed in C instead of pure python
