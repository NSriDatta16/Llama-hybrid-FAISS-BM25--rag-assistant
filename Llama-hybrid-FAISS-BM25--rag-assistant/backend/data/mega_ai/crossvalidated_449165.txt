Removing the impact of an independent variable from a time series

My business problem statement: What would be the total impact on sales if we stop spending any money on advertising a product Description and Context: My company spends money in advertising to acquire users (called inorganic users). But there are also those customers that research about our product and purchase them (I.e. Organic users, who irrespective of advertising are purchasing the products which owing to large sample space is assumed to be normally distributed) Within Organic also there is a sub classification: 3a. The ones that search by themselves and try our products 3b. Then there comes those sales which happen due to the inorganic customers referring the products (word of mouth, social media etc.) to the organic customers. Therefore the total impact if we stop advertising would be loss of sales due to no inorganic customers and loss of organic customers due to referrals by inorganic customers. My data problem: I have the following data points: Advertising spend Total organic customers (including both the subsets mentioned in point 3 above) Inorganic customers How can I remove the effect of advertising to account for these referrals.
