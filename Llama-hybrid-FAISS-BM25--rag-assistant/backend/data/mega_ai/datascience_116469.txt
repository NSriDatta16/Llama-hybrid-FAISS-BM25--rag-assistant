How to choose neural network architecture for a relatively small dataset with less than 10 features for regression?

How to go about selecting an architecture for a dataset with 80 datapoints and 9 features for a regression model? Working on the Desarhnais dataset , with "Effort" as the target variable. Would a simple NN with one hidden layer suffice since the data is not large or overly complicated? Thinking of using ReLU as the activation function since it is a form of linear regression model, but unsure how to select number of neurons in the hidden layer. Any tips and advice would be helpful.
