Good question. I sat down and reflected on the last time I addressed table formatting issues, then navigated to following links: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.4 http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html After some meditation and drinking water, wrote some code for you to refer: body { background: #e4e4e4; font-family: sans-serif; } th { background: #d5d6d6; } td { background: #fff; } table { border-collapse: separate; border-spacing: 1em 0.5em; background-color: #ddd; } th, td { border: 1px solid #000; padding: 4px; } tfoot { font-weight: bold; } Question Women Men Yes No Yes No Question1 42% 58% 61% 39% Question2 53% 47% 69% 31% Question3 26% 74% 51% 49% Average 40% 60% 60% 40% Mostly when I try to see such layouts, I attempt to count how many rows and how many columns will be necessary in the final html. This helps to construct the html properly. CSS then simply becomes a selection of those elements with either classes or elements. For your question I chose elements. HTH! @gsvolt
