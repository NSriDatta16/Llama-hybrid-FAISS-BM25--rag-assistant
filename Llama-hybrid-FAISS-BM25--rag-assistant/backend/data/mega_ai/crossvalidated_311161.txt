Evolution from year to year in text sets

Say that we collected some essays last year and we collect other essays this year. The goal is to apply machine learning and NLP to analyze the overall difference/tendency. How to do that? First attempt To run TF-IDF on both sets, do cluster analysis, quantify the presence of essays in individual clusters. The result will be a table where rows are clusters and columns are years. Are you aware of anything more sophisticated? Many thanks for any help.
