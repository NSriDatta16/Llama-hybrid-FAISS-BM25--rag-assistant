It seems that with VAR models there is a consensus that selecting a lag order to match the data's seasonality is usually appropriate (so lag=4 for quarterly data, 12 for monthly data). There's no such consensus, and seasonality should not be dealt with by autoregression. If you have seasonal trends/patterns, you should deal with this by detrending. Specifically, you need to include a term for time of year. If you have seasonal sales data, a good regression to run might be something like lm(x ~ predictors + autoregression + sincosn(day/365.24)) . Here, sincosn denotes an n-th order trigonometric polynomial (sometimes called a Fourier series), i.e.: sin(θ) + cos(θ) + sin(2*θ) + cos(2*θ) + ... sin(n*θ) + cos(n*θ) You can determine an appropriate order for n by using AIC (or AICc, which fixes a rather large small-sample bias for AIC). I suggest reading more on time series analysis here , or better yet looking through the documentation for the R package Prophet .
