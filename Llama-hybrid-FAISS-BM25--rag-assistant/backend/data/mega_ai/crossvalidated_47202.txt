VAR vs STAR for space-time autoregression in Python

I want to use autoregressive model to build a predictor for some sets of spatio-temporal data. For example, I have historical traffic data (speeds at various segments of freeways). similarly, I have historical weather data for different cities. Needless to mention, there is significant spatial correlation between nearby sites. I can think of 2 ways of autoregressing (assume that the order of autoregression is small (say a. Use Vector autoregressive (VAR) model: where each site depends on values at all other sites in the previous time instants. b. Use Space-Time AR (STAR) model: where each site depends on values at known nearby sites in previous time instants. Which of the two models is more suitable? Python's statsmodels library has an implementation for VAR, but not for STAR. Since I am using Python for my work, I am tempted to use VAR. Could someone explain the advantages of one over the other? I am perhaps slightly better than an average coder. If I want to implement STAR model in Python, how difficult would it be? Is there a text that can help me implement it?
