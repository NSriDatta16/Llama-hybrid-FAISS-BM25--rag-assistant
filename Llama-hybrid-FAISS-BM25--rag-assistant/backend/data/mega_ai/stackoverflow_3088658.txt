I have already addressed this question to some extent here . The pros/cons of XUL are: it's open it's cross platform it's well established with a large community it still basically has to be run in a browser that supports XUL (firefox) one of the comments from my question stated that XUL is a bad choice because firefos is buggy The pros/cons of XAML are: it'll work on Windows/Mac it has a well established drag-drop IDE (VS 2010) to create GUIs it has a massive support community it's closed source it's a closed platform, IE. it not an open standard (not covered under ECMA like .NET and C#) there are legal issues regarding the use on non microsoft/mac plagforms (see my post) it requires either a browser with a the silverlight plug-in or the .NET framework to use it on the desktop it's developed/controlled by MS. This isn't an attempt to troll. Seriously, look it up on google. There are a lot of people who are suspicious of MS's intent behind creating XAML and it has garnered a lot of negativity behind the platform. It might be worth taking into consideration. The pros/cons of MXML: it's cross platform it's closed source it runs on a closed platform it requires adobe flash (which, a lot of people claim is a dying platform now that Apple is rejecting to support/allow it). it requires a browser with a plug-in Note: I can't really say much about MXML because this is the first time I've heard about it. I just pointed out the obvious pros/cons for completeness. I'll have to research it and add an entry to in the question I linked.
