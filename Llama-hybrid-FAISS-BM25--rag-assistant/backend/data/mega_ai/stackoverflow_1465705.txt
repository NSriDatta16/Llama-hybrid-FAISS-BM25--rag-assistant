As far as the JSON is concerned, it won't make a difference: I don't see how you can optimize the storage of that data. I think the question boils down to "How complex is the user data?". If there's a massive social graph connected with RDBMS foreign keys, and it's too difficult to map that data to a key-value store, I'd rather not expend the effort now. However, if the user data is just flat profile information, I'd rather move to a key-value store now, than later, before I use too many RDBMS features.
