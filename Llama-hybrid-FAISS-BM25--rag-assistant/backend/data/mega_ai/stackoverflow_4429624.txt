Are both databases on the same server? As others already said you should not have any problem then. If the two databases are on two different servers the only solution I can think of is creating federated tables one one server to access the other. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/federated-storage-engine.html To put it simple: Federated tables allow you to thread remote tables as local tables.
