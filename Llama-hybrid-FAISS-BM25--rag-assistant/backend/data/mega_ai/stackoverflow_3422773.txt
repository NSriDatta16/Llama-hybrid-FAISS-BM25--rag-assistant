Well, there are Thomson-Reuters and Bloomberg very very expensive, but comprehensive global coverage, both real-time data and fundamental stuff. Morningstar acquired real-time data provider tenfore recently. They are almost as comprehensive as the previous two, but slightly more afforable. All three have real-time "solutions" (these big words is what you pay for) that provide a nice (or at least workable) API. I have used them all, and they all have their issues and niceties. In my experience, if you can convince one of their salespeople of your potential as a customer you can generally get a trial for a month or so. Ask to get the API documentation before the trial starts so you can hit the ground running and by the end of the month you will be able to determine if the high price is worth it. In general though, real-time data is bloody expensive, and the fee you pay to the data provider is generally just the start. These days quite a few exchanges also require direct payment from parties receiving real-time data. $10.000 + $500/month is a very good deal, but spend some time reading the contract and note that using their API will probably lock you into their brokerage services. After giving you the cheap data, they might decide to get their profits elsewhere. UPDATE: I was just looking at the IB link you provide, and I see a 50 quotes/second limit note that -for example- just AAPL generates about 100,000 quotes during the 16 hours of main market activity. 2/second on average (peak periods, around regular open/close of market often have 10 times the average message rate or more). You'll regularly be hitting that 50 quote/second limit the moment you become interested in more than a few dozen stocks. This NANEX article about the may-6 flash crash has some interesting info about the volumes involved in the HFT field. Also, their NxCore product might interest you.
