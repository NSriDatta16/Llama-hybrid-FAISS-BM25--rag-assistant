With a separate table for each day's data, summarizing across a month is going to involve doing the same analysis on each of 30-odd tables. Over a year, you will have to do the analysis on 365 or so tables. That's going to be a nightmare. It would almost certainly be better to have a soundly indexed single table than the huge number of tables. Some DBMS support fragmented tables - if MySQL does, fragment the single big table by the date. I would be inclined to fragment by month, especially if the normal queries are for one month or less and do not cross month boundaries. (Even if it involves two months, with decent fragment elimination, the query engine won't have to read most of the data; just the two fragments for the two months. It might be able to do those scans in parallel, even - again, depending on the DBMS.) Sometimes, it is quicker to do sequential scans of a table than to do indexed lookups - don't simply assume that because the query plan involves a table scan that it will automatically be bad performing.
