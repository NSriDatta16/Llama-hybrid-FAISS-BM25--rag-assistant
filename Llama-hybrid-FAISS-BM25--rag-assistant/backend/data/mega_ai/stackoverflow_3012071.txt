OData is a way of exposing all sorts of structured data over an HTTP interface. The underlying repository for data may be relational or not. For example, when using WCF Data Services on top of SQL Server it's certainly a relational data set, but the OData endpoints in SharePoint Server 2010 or on Windows Azure Table Storage run on top of other data models. The high order bit is to make all data available in a web-friendly way. As for your specific question about MySQL/PHP, there is an OData client for PHP but to my knowledge there isn't a server implementation available. I know there is a MySQL provider for ADO.NET, maybe if it has Entity Framework support you can use WCF Data Services, but that means you'd be running on .NET and not on PHP, don't know if it's acceptable for your situation.
