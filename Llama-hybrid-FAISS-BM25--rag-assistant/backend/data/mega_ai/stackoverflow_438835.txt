add a vanity url to subtext article

So I'm running subtext 1.95 on IIS6 and .net 2.0 framework. What I'd like to do is create a nice vanity URL to a particular article that is published inside the subtext system. The vanity url should look like this: mydomain.com/blog/toc/, but the subtext article that it is pointing to actually has a path like this: mydomain.com/blog/archive/2009/01/11/table-of-contents.aspx I can probably just set up a forward within IIS to do this, but I'm looking for a more elegant solution that doesn't require any custom IIS configurations like that. I'd also like to refrain from changing any of the subtext core code, as to leave an upgrade path for myself. Is the best solution to just put a default.aspx file inside the /toc/ folder and have that page forward on to the long path? Thanks in advance!
