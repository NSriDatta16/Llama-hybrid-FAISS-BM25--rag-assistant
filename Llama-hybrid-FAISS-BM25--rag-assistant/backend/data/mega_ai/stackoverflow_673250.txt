In my previous project I had a widget that was embedded on other sites, and to prevent name conflicts I prefixed all names that would be used in the embedding sites with a two letter prefix (I got the idea from Objective C, where all classes start with a prefix like NS...). Of course I also used namespaces (e.g. var Foo = { bar: function() { ... }}) and "classes" (using John Resig's class implementation), because I use them regardless if I have a widget or not, but the names of the namespaces, classes and global variables or functions were prefixed - e.g. HMWidget, HMClass, hmDoSomething(), etc. Regarding DOM IDs and CSS classes - first, I had to get rid of most IDs because of the possibility of having multiple widgets from my service on the same site. So the only IDs that were left were something like "widget_12345" to tell the widgets apart. The rest of the elements were identified by CSS classes, and all CSS declarations were done in relation to the main widget container (e.g. ".my_widget .left_column" instead of just ".left_column").
