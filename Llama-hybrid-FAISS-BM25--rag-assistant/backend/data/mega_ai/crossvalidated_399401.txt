How to simulate AR(p) model with trend

Backgrounds I have a time series, and I fitted an AR(p) model with trend of $t^2$ , with the help of auto.arima , in R package forecast . result = auto.arima(X, max.order=10, stepwise=F, max.d=0, max.q=0, xreg=I(t^2)) And I got AR(3) model, and I inspected the fitted coefficients as follows: ## z test of coefficients: ## ## Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) ## ar1 some_number - *** ## ar2 some_number - *** ## ar3 some_number - *** ## intercept some_number - *** ## xreg some_number - *** which clearly tells me the results of $\hat{\phi_1}, \hat{\phi_2}, \hat{\phi_3}$ , and the intercept, $\hat{\mu}$ , and the coefficient of $t^2$ term, say $\hat{\beta_{t^2}}$ . Problem I would like to simulate from the model fitted above, with $\hat{\phi_1}, \hat{\phi_2}, \hat{\phi_3}, \hat{\mu}, \hat{\beta_{t^2}}$ . $$ (X_t - \hat{\mu}) = \hat{\phi_1} X_{t-1} + \hat{\phi_2} X_{t-2} + \hat{\phi_3} X_{t-3} + \hat{\beta_{t^2}} t^2 $$ But I'm stuck at how I should proceed. Any help will be appreciated.
