Base class for an ASMX webservice - calling the derived method from the base class it self

I have a bunch of asmx web services, and in all the methods inside the webservices follow a common pattern public virtual TestObject Test() { LogRequest; try { DoSomething; } catch { LogException; } LogResponse; return response; } and all the methods follow this pattern, there is a lot of code repetition; I want to know if there is a way to do this generically ie: may be in a base class constructor? is it even possible? EDIT: The Template Method pattern was a good solution, but in the End the most elegant solution for us was AOP!! the logging was all extracted out in to an aspect and all methods that needed logging were decorated using an attribute and post sharp rules!
