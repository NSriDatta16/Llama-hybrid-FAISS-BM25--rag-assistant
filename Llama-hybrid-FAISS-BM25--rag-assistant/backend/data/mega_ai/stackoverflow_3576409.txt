You'll need to replicate -i 's behavior yourself by storing the results in a temp file and then replacing the original file with the temp file. This may seem inelegant but that's all sed -i is doing under the covers. sed '$ s/OLD/NEW/g' test > test.tmp && cat test.tmp > test && rm test.tmp If you care you could make it a bit more robust by using mktemp : tmp=$(mktemp test.XXXXXX) sed '$ s/OLD/NEW/g' test > "$tmp" && cat "$tmp" > test && rm "$tmp"
