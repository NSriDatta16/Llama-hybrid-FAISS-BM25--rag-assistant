By default it will run them sequentially. You can customize the build workflow by adding a Parallel activity and running different sets of tests in each. Or if you want to parallelize the test run across multiple build machines you can have the build use multiple RunOnAgent activities to do so ( http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jimlamb/archive/2010/09/14/parallelized-builds-with-tfs2010.aspx ). Note: If you execute the tests across multiple test runs you will end up with multiple test reports (.trx files) that will not be merged together without further customization of the build.
