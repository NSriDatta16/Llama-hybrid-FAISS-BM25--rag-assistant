Depends what your goal is. If you want to retrieve a list of items and it happens once during your application's entire run for example, it's probably not worth the effort of using a stored procedure. On the other hand, a query that runs repeatedly and takes a (relatively) long time to execute is an excellent candidate for database storage, since the performance will be better. If your application lives almost entirely within the database, stored procedures are a no-brainer. If you're writing a desktop application to which the database is only tangentially important, ad-hoc queries may be a better option, as it keeps all of your code in one place . @Terrapin: I think your assertion that the fact that you don't have to recompile your app to make modifications makes stored procedures a better option is a non-starter. There may be reasons to choose stored procedures over ad-hoc queries, but in the absence of anything else compelling, the compile issue seems like laziness rather than a real reason.
