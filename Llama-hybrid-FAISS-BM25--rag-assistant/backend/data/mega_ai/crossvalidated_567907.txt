I'm not an expert, but here's my guess: It may be useful to do feature extraction from the variables that consist of unstructured text data. Useful features that come to mind include the length of the comments and their sentiment. It may be useful to come up with several models for your data that can be used to classify a device as failing in the first year or not. I would consider using a random forest as one of these models. Then, looking at these models, you can see which variables were important. I think that essentially what you are trying to do is causal inference. You want to know the cause of the failures. This is a good resource on causal inference . Once you have an idea of what may be causing the failures, then you could do a randomized, controlled experiment for verification.
