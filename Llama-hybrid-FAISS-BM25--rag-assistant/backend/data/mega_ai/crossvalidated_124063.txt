Collinearity is a problem when two predictor variables are almost perfectly correlated, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. Your proposal to run regression with an interaction term seems like a reasonable way to proceed. If your outcome is "risk of diabetes," on a probability scale from 0 to 1, you should be using a logistic regression rather than a standard linear regression. Do not, however, be so quick to assume things like "heartrate does not affect risk of diabetes." There is always a problem in cases like this in distinguishing correlation from causation. There might be no obvious reason to you why heart rate per se might affect risk of diabetes, but there might well be an underlying hidden variable (like propensity to develop metabolic syndrome in this case) that affects both in parallel.
