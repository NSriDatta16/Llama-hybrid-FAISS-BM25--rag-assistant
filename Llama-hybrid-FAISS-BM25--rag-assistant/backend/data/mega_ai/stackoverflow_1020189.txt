The answer really depends on what you usually need to do with logs, what is your business and your (company?) security policy. On my side, I usually never delete logs. They are really useful to spot security holes, behaviors, trends. If storage is a problem, consider to use a storage service such as Amazon S3 and don't forget to compress them! I usually move there all the gzipped logs older than one month.
