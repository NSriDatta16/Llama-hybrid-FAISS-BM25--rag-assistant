Any checksum will give you a false positive for a very small number of cases. If you can live with that, fine. If not then the way to do this is to do the checksum comparison first, and if the checksums are equal then to a byte-by-byte test. The byte-by-byte test will be done very rarely, so the cost averaged over a lot of comparisons will be very small. HOWEVER this is not the case when most of your comparisons are expected to return 'true'. It also depends on how many different files you are testing. Calcualting a high-reliability checksum is nearly as expensive as doing a comparison - if each file gets compared approximately once then it may be cheaper to do the comparisons.
