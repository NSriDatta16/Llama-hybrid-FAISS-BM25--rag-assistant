How do I tell a (managed) object to notify its KVOs that one of its properties needs to be recached?

When we have an object who has a property that's generated based on other properties, usually we implement the +keyPathsForValuesAffecting{PropertyName} class method. What I'm trying to do is basically the same thing for a property on my NSManagedObject, but traversing a relationship. My model is simple; I have two Entities, App and Version (I'm creating an appcast-generating app). When the App's properties are changed, because I implemented the method above, the -appcast string is changed, and all bindings are updated appropriately. However, when any properties on any of a specific App's Versions (to-many relationship) change, the -appcast property is not generated appropriately. I can haz fix/workaround?
