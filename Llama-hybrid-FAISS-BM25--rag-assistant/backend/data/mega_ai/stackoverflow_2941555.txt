Spatial extensions to relational database systems provide storage and indexed access the geography/geometry datatypes. They allow you to perform spatial joins and all sorts of spatial queries. In short, they are exactly what you need. If you are using the open source stack I would recommend PostGIS , the spatial extension to Postgresql. If you are using the MS stack, try the spatial extensions to SQL Server 2008 .
