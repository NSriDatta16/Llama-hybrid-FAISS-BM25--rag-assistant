Estimating Fourier spectrum from multiple time series of a system

I have a set of N time series, each of length T, that describe separate realisations of a single physical system. For each series, I can compute an FFT to find the Fourier spectrum up to a period 2/T, and this is slightly different for each realisation. What is the best way to estimate the true Fourier spectrum of the system up to period 2/T using these samples?
