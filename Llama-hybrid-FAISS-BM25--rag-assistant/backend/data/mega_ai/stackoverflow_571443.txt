Robert Gould > One of those is the mandelbrot test (Generate Mandelbrot set portable bitmap file N=16,000), where it scores a horrible 1:109 When you quote numbers from the benchmarks game please show where those numbers come from so readers have some context. In this case you seem to have taken numbers measured on the quadcore machine where the fastest programs have been re-written to exploit multiple cores. Instead of looking at elapsed time sort by CPU time and you'll see the ratio drop to 1:28 . Or look at the median and quartiles to get a better impression of how the set of C++ measurements compares to the set of Lua measurements . Or there's a whole set of measurements where programs are forced to use just one core - Lua compared with C++ - and if you take a look at those Lua pi-digits programs you'll see that they use the C language GNU GMP library.
