Does the Windows Phone 7 WebBrowser control implement a same origin policy?

I have some HTML files I'm putting in Isolated Storage and then loading them up in a Windows Phone 7 WebBrowser control. I want to make an AJAX request in JavaScript to a remote host to get some data. This appears to fail with a "No transport" error. I assume there is a same origin policy which is preventing my request from going through. Does anyone know if this is the case, and if so, can the policy be disabled?
