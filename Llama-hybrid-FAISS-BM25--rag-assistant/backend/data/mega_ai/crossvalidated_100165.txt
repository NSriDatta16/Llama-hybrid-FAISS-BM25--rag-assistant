The Central Limit Theorem is about the limiting distribution of the sample average as the sample size gets large. That limit is the normal distribution, under certain conditions (mean and variance exist, the observations are independent.). CLT-like results exist for dependent data when the dependence is sufficiently weak. I assume you want to know if your sample is large enough for the normal distribution to be a good estimate for the distribution of the sample average. To this end, I would create a bootstrap distribution of the sample average and see if it looks normal. I'm not sure exactly how you would test for normality ... maybe a Kuhlback-Leibler. Alternatively, you can just wing it. The CLT works pretty quickly if the original distribution is symmetric. If your sample size is at least 30, and your data are symmetric and don't have hideous outliers, you can safely use the normal distribution for the distribution of the sample average.
