Cosine similarity or logistic regression for spam filtering

I'm trying to choose an algorithm for filtering spam. I found two options: Create word dictionary for spam and not spam data. Calculate average TF-IDF for each word and use cosine similarity for filtering. Or use word dictionary for training logistic regression model. Could you suggest what fit the best for my goal. Maybe I should use some another algorithm.
