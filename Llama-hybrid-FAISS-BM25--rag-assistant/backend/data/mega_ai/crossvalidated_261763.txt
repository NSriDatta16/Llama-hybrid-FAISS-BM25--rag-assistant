The WoE method consists of two steps: to split (a continuous) variable into few categories or to group (a discrete) variable into few categories (and in both cases you assume that all observations in one category have "same" effect on dependent variable) to calculate WoE value for each category (then the original x values are replaced by the WoE values) The WoE transformation has (at least) three positive effects: It can transform an independent variable so that it establishes monotonic relationship to the dependent variable. Actually it does more than this - to secure monotonic relationship it would be enough to "recode" it to any ordered measure (for example 1,2,3,4...) but the WoE transformation actually orders the categories on a "logistic" scale which is natural for logistic regression For variables with too many (sparsely populated) discrete values, these can be grouped into categories (densely populated) and the WoE can be used to express information for the whole category The (univariate) effect of each category on dependent variable can be simply compared across categories and across variables because WoE is standardized value (for example you can compare WoE of married people to WoE of manual workers) It also has (at least) three drawbacks: Loss of information (variation) due to binning to few categories It is a "univariate" measure so it does not take into account correlation between independent variables It is easy to manipulate (overfit) the effect of variables according to how categories are created Conventionally, the betas of the regression (where the x has been replaced by WoE) are not interpreted per se but they are multiplied with WoE to obtain a "score" (for example beta for variable "marital status" can be multiplied with WoE of "married people" group to see the score of married people; beta for variable "occupation" can be multiplied by WoE of "manual workers" to see the score of manual workers. then if you are interested in the score of married manual workers, you sum up these two score and see how much is the effect on outcome). The higher the score is, the greater is probability of an outcome equal to 1.
