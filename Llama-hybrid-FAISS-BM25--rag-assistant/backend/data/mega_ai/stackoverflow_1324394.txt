If you add in a call like NSLog(clicks) , and you run the code, do you get the log message 4 times? Are other buttons connected to this IBAction? Have you connected this IBAction to more than one outlet of your single button -- i.e. Touch Up Inside, Touch Up Outside, Touch Drag Inside, Touch Drag Outside, etc.?
