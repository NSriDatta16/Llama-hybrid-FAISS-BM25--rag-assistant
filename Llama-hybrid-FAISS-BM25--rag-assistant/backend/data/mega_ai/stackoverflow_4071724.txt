NSWindow's dragging behavior automatically keeps windows from going under the menu bar â€” because they aren't supposed to. If you have some special case, you can override the standard dragging behavior. But think carefully before throwing away standard functionality prescribed by the HIG. Also, it isn't possible to drag a window over the menu bar (rather than under ) unless it's also over everything else, because the menu bar is normally above every other window.
