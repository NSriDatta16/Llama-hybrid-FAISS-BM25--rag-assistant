Run a process and kill it if it doesn't end within one hour

I need to do the following in Python. I want to spawn a process (subprocess module?), and: if the process ends normally, to continue exactly from the moment it terminates; if, otherwise, the process "gets stuck" and doesn't terminate within (say) one hour, to kill it and continue (possibly giving it another try, in a loop). What is the most elegant way to accomplish this?
