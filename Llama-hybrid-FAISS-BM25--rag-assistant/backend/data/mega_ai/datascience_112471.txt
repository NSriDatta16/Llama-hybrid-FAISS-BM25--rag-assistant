You can solve this problem using a neural network of just one layer which contains one neuron. The only requirement for an activation function is that it should be non-linear for at least one neuron in the network (because if all neurons are linear, the network can be replaced by a simple linear function because a linear combination of linear functions is a linear function). As $x^2$ is non-linear, it can be used as an activation function of a neuron. A neural network with a single neuron having $x^2$ as an activation function will solve your problem with a 100% accuracy.
