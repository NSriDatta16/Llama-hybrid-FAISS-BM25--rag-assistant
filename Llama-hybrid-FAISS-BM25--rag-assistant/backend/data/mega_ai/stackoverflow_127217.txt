At the moment I'm working with CouchDB for a computer science thesis. I'm writing about my progresses and opinions on my blog, http://metalelf0dev.blogspot.com . I think the project is well done, but the existing documentation isn't organized as it should. A quick tutorial about the Futon web interface could be really useful for starters IMHO :)
