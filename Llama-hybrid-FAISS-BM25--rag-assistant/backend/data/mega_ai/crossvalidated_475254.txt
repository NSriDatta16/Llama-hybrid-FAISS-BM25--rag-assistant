How to De-seasonalize a time series based on trading days?

I have a time series of monthly data points with a corresponding cost. Within these months, if you strip out the trend, I believe the cost to be highly correlated to the number of trading (or business days). What I don't understand is how exactly to strip this out? If the month's trading days can vary (example - January has 21 days one year and 22 another), I don't think I can rely on a typical method of averaging the historical monthly seasonalities. Is there a better way to go about doing this?
