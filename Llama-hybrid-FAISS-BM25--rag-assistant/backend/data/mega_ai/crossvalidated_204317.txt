Posterior Predictive Distribution - Normal model with unknown mean, and known std dev

I do not understand how one can prove that in a normal model, where we know the variance, but not the mean, the posterior predictive distribution is also normal... Below is cut of a page from Gelman's Data Bayesian Analysis. I don't understand how the authors can state that the posterior predictive dist. will be a Normal one, i.e., why can they conclude that it's a joint normal posterior distribution and then conclude that the marginal is also normal? Any help would be appreciated.
