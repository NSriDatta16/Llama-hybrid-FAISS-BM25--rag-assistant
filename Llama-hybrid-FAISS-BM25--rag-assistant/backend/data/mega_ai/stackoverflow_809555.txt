Change is hard, for all of us. In the DOS days we used the MTF Menu-Table-Form pattern. MVC has been around for a long time now and there is a flavor for all major languages used in internet programming. Once you use MVC for a while you will probably not want to go back. It provides for code separation and reuse. I have used RoR, Django and ASP.NET MVC and the MVC pattern made my development. I would encourage you to keep at it! Buy a book or find a mentor.
