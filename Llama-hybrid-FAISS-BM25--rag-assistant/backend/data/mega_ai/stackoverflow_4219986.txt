What's the downside of bitmap caching in Silverlight 4?

We were able to solve a high CPU usage problem by taking advantage of Silverlight's bitmap cache, as described here: Silverlight 3 and GPU Acceleration Discovering Silverlight 3 – Deep Dive into GPU Acceleration We added the EnableGPUAcceleration parameter to the tag. To bring the CPU usage down to a reasonable level, we had to add CacheMode="BitmapCache" to the root visual grid for the whole app. So I'm wondering if there's any downside to relying so much on the bitmap cache. If it was always beneficial, I assume it would be enabled by default. I found this similar question with a good answer by AnthonyWJones: Any reason not to check “application library caching” and “GPU acceleration” in silverlight apps? So one downside is that it uses more video RAM. I guess this could make things worse for other graphics-intensive apps running at the same time. Are there any other downsides? If the graphics card doesn't have enough video RAM to cache everything, I assume Silverlight will degrade gracefully and will just use more CPU cycles to re-render the UI. Thanks for your help, Richard
