Model averaging and intercept interpretation in Splines

I have two questions regarding Multivariate Adaptive Regression splines (MARS) 1) How is intercept interpreted in MARS? In linear regression, my intercept is shown in the image below In a linear regression, the intercept is simply the mean response if the x is 0. How is an intercept interpreted in MARS and which one of the three below is the intercept? 2) If I have two MARS model: model1 = 25 + 6.1max(0,x1-13) - 3.1 max(0, 13-x1) model3 = 19 + 6.1max(0,x1-13) - 3.1 max(0, 13-x1) + 2.3max(0,10-x2) How do I take the average of these two models similar to what is done in multi-model inference and IT-AIC approach using the MuMIN package in R?
