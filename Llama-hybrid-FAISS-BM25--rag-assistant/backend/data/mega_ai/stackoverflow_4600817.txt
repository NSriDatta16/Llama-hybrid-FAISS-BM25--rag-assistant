How do you create a textbox in visual Studio with c#?

I feel kind of silly asking this question as it seems really simple, but how do I create a text box that I can type in instructions and stuff like that. I don't need the user to be able to change it, it is just to give instructions. I tried the label, but it only allows one line. I need something that can allow about a paragraph or so. Similar to the box in an installer that describes what the program does. What did I miss?
