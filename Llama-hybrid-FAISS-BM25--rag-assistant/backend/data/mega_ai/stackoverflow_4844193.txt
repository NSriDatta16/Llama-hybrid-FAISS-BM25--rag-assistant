You could use blocks for that. For instance, void forCount(NSUInteger count, void(^block)()) { for (NSUInteger i = 0; i and it could be used like: forCount(5, ^{ // Do something in the outer loop forCount(10, ^{ // Do something in the inner loop }); }); Be warned that if you need to write to variables declared outside the blocks you need to specify the __block storage qualifier.
