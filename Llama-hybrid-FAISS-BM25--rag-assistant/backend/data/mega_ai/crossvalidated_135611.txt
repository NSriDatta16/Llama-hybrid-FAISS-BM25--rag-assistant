A perspective from Gelman & Hill's Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models may point in a helpful direction. G&H entirely eschew the terms 'fixed' and 'random', arguing that these are misleading (see pp. 245-6). Instead, they emphasize describing the model itself, in terms of the assumptions it embodies, as they relate to our understanding of real-world phenomena. Turning attention to that latter principle, I would offer the following direct response to the question about separate models. If your 7 hospitals were: (1) a maternity hospital with a neonatal intensive care unit, (2) an academic childrens' hospital, (3) a small-animal veterinary hospital, (4) a veterinary unit of an aquarium, (5) a specialty cancer care hospital, (6) a rural community hospital and (7) an academic medical center, then clearly separate models are indicated! However, to the extent that you think your analytical aims (exploratory? testing theory-based hypotheses?) will be served by sharing information between the separate hospitals, then unifying them in a hierarchical model makes sense. So, if your 7 hospitals seem similar enough with respect to the mental picture underlying your approach to your scientific questions , then you may well want to share information between your 7 models. Hierarchical modeling can be understood as a way to connect the 7 hospital models to achieve that information sharing. It should be noted that a ready analogy presents itself here to the question about whether to discretize a continuous variable. If you use an infant/child/adult categorical variable in a model, you lose the opportunity to share information about 17 year-old patients with information about 22 year-old patients, which you might accomplish with splines on a continuous age variable. But of course, in an analysis of the patients (mothers, neonates) at a maternity hospital, there are limited opportunities to share information in this way between two clearly distinct categories of patient.
