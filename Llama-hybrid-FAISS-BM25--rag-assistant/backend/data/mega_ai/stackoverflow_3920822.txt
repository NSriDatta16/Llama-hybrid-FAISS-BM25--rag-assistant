initialize is used internally to Rails to, well, initialize a new instance of your controller so it can then serve requests on it. By defining this method in this particular manner, you are breaking Rails . There is a way through! A light at the end of the tunnel. A pot of gold at the end of the rainbow: def initialize @title = "Admins" super end See that little super call there? That'll call the superclass's initialize method, doing exactly what Rails would do otherwise. Now that we've covered how to do it your way, let's cover how to do it the "officially sanctioned" Rails way : class AdminsController Yes, it's a little more code but it'll result in less frustration by others who gaze upon your code. This is the conventional way of doing it and I strongly encourage following conventions rather than doing "magic". EDIT: If you're using Rails 5 then you'll need to use before_action instead of before_filter .
