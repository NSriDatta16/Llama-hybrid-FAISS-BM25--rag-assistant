Do we consider inputs to a VAE to be samples from p(x) and outputs to be samples from p'(x|z) or are they probabilities of x?

In a Variational Autoencoder we say that the encoder and decoder networks model p(z | x) and p(x | z) respectively as seen in the image below: My question is -- is the output of the decoding layer a sample from the approximate p(x|z) itself, or a set of probability values corresponding to the probability of each pixel for some decoded $\mathbf{z}$ ? If it is a set of probability values for each dimension of $\mathbf{x}$ , how is it that we consider the input to also be a set of probability values for each pixel? Just because of the normalization between (0,1)? Could someone convince me of that if true?
