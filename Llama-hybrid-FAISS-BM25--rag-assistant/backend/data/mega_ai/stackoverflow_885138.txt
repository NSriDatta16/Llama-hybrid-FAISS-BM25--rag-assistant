LINQ and Devexpress Grid Datasource

I have a DevExpress grid (DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl 8.2) with a datasource set at runtime like so: private DataContext db = new DataContext("connection string"); gridControl.DataSource = from t in db.sometable select new { Field1 = t.Name, Field2 = t.Email, Field3 = t.City }; This means that the view has no idea what the data is going to look like at design time. I like being able to set a LINQ query as the datasource, but I'd also like to specify what the view will look like at design time. Is there a way that I can tell the view that it will be using this query? Would the best solution be to create a small object for holding the contents of what gets returned from this query?
