How to examine if a Doc2Vec model is sufficiently trained?

I started experimenting with gensim's Doc2Vec for sentiment analysis. For the training of the embedding itself, I have seen examples using a reduced learning rate with a few 10s or even a few hundred epochs. However, there does not seem to be a straightforward way to use early stopping to prevent overfitting, and it is not yet clear to me how I should access loss values for each epoch to detect overfitting. What should be the proper way to examine if word2vec or doc2vec model themselves are sufficiently good? Thank you!
