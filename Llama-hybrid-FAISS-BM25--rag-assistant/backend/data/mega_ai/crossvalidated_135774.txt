Saturated essentially means "perfectly fitted". In a saturated model there are as many estimated parameters as there are observations. Take a simple case of only 2 observations. Say "height" is the DV and one person is male and one female. Now a model with just "sex" as an IV will fit perfectly. In a linear model, the intercept would be the average height of the two people and the effect of (say) maleness with be the difference between the man and the woman.
