Help me understand rails authentication w/r/t assets, like swfs

I am a rails noob. I am having a problem conceptualizing how assets work in an authenticated system. All of the tutorials I've seen so far talk about putting your swfs in the public folder and embedding them in your view. However, the swf I'm using is a flex gui that should only be used by users logged-in through restful-authentication. I imagine that putting the gui into the public folder would be defeating the whole purpose of having an authentication system. So what is everybody doing to restrict access to this kind static content?
