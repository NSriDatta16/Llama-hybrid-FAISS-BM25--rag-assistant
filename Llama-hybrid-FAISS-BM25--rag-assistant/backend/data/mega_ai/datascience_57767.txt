Multivariate Time-Series with Differing Selling Windows

I have a data-set in the format below. I am attempting to forecast the target_value by Product_Id for an upcoming season, which is always 26 weeks in length. The main challenge is that in an upcoming season, a product may sell in a different group of stores than last season, and may be sold in a different set of weeks than a previous season (some products sell all 26 weeks, others sell in windows i.e. wk 6-13). I wanted to rely on product attributes to help determine how a product would sell in a different set of weeks/stores based on how similar products had sold in those weeks/stores. The data is time-series and has many different products. It consists of categorical variables, numerical variables, as well as a store_id which indicates what store the sales are coming from. Summary for data: has 3 years of history, target variable is sales for a 6 month forecast horizon multi-variate time series consists of categorical and numerical variables has products that are sold in differing time-frames (those time-frames may change in the future for the same product. i.e. last year it sold in weeks 3-10, but in the forecast horizon next year it's expected to sell in weeks 6-14) has products that are sold in different stores in different time-frames (can also sell in different stores in the future forecast horizon than it has sold in in the past) is sparse for subsets of products My questions are: What is the appropriate algorithm that could handle the sparse history as well as multiple variables What is the proper way to structure the data as input into the algorithm? --For this I had planned on converting categorical variables to dummy variables, but was unsure on whether to keep time as is or convert the week to a dummy variable also since I could be forecasting different sets of weeks for different products. I had the same question for store_id. I'm new to structuring these problems, so please forgive any errors or missing information, and let me know what additional data is needed. Any and all feedback is appreciated!
