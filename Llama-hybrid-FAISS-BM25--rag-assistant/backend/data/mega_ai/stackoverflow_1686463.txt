You would have multiple questions to answer: It seems the current hosting provider can not be very reliable if it is the way you say: they create a new database every time the initial one gets more then 1GB - this sounds strange... at least they should increase the storage for the current db and announce you that you'll be charged more... Find other hosting solutions with better options... Is there any information into your current DB that could be archived? That's a very important question since you may carry over "useless" data that could be archived into separate databases and queried only when special requests. As other colleagues told you already, that would be difficult for us to evaluate since we do not know the data model. Can you split the data model into two total different storages and only replicate between them the common information? You could use SQL Server Replication ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms151198.aspx ) to maintain the same membership information between the databases. If the data model can not be splited then I do not see any practical choice to have multiple databases - just find a bigger storage solution.
