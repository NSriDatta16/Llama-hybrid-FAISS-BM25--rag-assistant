Why exactly is it, that you try to find maximum over some chunks? Also, what is this code supposed to do: if (_pcmData.bytesAvailable) { var la:Number=_pcmData.readFloat(); var ra:Number=_pcmData.readFloat(); var l:Number=la > 0.0 ? la : -la; var r:Number=ra > 0.0 ? ra : -ra; ++_divCount; var ml:Number=0; var mr:Number=0; var a_ml:Number=ml > 0.0 ? ml : -ml; var a_mr:Number=mr > 0.0 ? mr : -mr; ml=a_ml > (l) ? ml : l; mr=a_mr > (r) ? mr : r; } ml and mr are always 0, so what is the point of checking that? and what is divCount? If it is for drawing a waveform, I'd draw it with a certain resolution. If I want to draw a waveform on an area 500 pixels wide, than basically 500 samples will do the job. If you want it to average out a little, than a hand full of samples per pixel really should be enough. So from the time frame represented by a pixel, you choose 4 samples (equidistant or random) and calculate the average. Should the variance exceed a certain treshold, you could try to get a more reliable value by getting more samples. In general, waveforms are continuous and smooth. The time to draw the graph should scale linearly with the size of the graph, not with the number of samples involved. greetz back2dos
