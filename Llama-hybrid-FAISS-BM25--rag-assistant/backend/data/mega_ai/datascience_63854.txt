Actually 200 isn't that much. It depends more how those are distributed. How do you extract features from raw text? For example: embedders give you fixed-size numeric vector and they're well suited for resampling. No free lunch You cannot state, that resampling might damage your decision space, unless you actually try it. I advise you do simple resampling with SMOTESVM followed by Tomek-Links . Run it and compare the metrics calculated in weighted mode. Then we'll decide what to do next.
