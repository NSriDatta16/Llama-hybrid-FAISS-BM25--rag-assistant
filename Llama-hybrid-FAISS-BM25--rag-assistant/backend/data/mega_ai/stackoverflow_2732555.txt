Overcoming C limitations for large projects

One aspect where C shows its age is the encapsulation of code. Many modern languages has classes, namespaces, packages... a much more convenient to organize code than just a simple "include". Since C is still the main language for many huge projects. How do you to overcome its limitations? I suppose that one main factor should be lots of discipline . I would like to know what you do to handle large quantity of C code, which authors or books you can recommend.
