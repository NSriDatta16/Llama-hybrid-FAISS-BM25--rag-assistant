You could make the $x \times \beta$ values be on average substantially below (or above) zero instead of approx. zero (e.g. subtract 2 from all x values). That results in a more unbalanced data set. Or you could reduce the number of observations. Or you could add additional covariates to the model that also need to be estimated.
