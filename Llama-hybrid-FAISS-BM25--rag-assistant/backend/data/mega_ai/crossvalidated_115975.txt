I would think that introducing an ad hoc statistical method is going to be a no-go with the court. It is better to use methods that are "standard practice". Otherwise, you probably get to prove your qualifications to develop new methods. To be more explicit, I do not think that your method would meet the Daubert standard. I also very much doubt that your method has any academic reference in and of itself. You would probably have to go the route of hiring a statistical expert witness to introduce it. It would be easily countered, I would think. The basic question here is likely: "Was jury challenge independent of racial grouping?" These are small numbers to which to be applying asymptotically based statistical methods. However, the "standard" for testing association in this setting is the $\chi^2$ test: > M dimnames(M) M Challenged Group No Yes A 9 1 B 6 4 C 2 4 D 3 1 > chisq.test(M) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: M X-squared = 5.775, df = 3, p-value = 0.1231 Warning message: In chisq.test(M) : Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect Using the Fisher exact test gives similar results: > fisher.test(M) Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data data: M p-value = 0.1167 alternative hypothesis: two.sided The note about the hypothesis being two-sided applies to the case of a $2\times2$ table. My interpretation is that there is not much evidence to argue racial bias.
