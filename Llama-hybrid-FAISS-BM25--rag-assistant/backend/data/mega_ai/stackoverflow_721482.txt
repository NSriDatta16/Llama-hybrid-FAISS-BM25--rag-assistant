I suggest using Eclipse RCP, as far as I can see, it has many useful aspects like action and command mechanism, Eclipse Forms, data binding, etc. You can use GEF and Zest for graph based visualization and visual editors. Also Window builder is a convenient choice for drag and drop ui creation. Also there are many sources for learning Eclipse4 RCP, vogella.de is a good starting point. cheers...
