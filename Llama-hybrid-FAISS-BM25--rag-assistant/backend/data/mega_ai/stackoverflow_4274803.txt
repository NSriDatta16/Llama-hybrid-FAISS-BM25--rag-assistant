#pragma once is non-standard (but widely supported), so you may/may not want to use #ifdef guards instead. As for whether you need to #include any particular header, it depends. If the code only requires a forward declaration, by all means avoid the import by just forward declaring the type. And with the exception of template stuff, I think it is probably not-too-pretty to place long function definitions in the header files. Having said that, I think that ClassA.h should actually include ClassB.h because any user of ClassA.h (presumably to use ClassA ) will have to have ClassB.h . Well, if it is doing anything like allocating it.
