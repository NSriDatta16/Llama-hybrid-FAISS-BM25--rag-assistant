Huge page buffer vs. multiple simultaneous processes

One of our customer has a 35 Gb database with average active connections count about 70-80. Some tables in database have more than 10M records per table. Now they have bought new server: 4 * 6 Core = 24 Cores CPU, 48 Gb RAM, 2 RAID controllers 256 Mb cache, with 8 SAS 15K HDD on each. 64bit OS. I'm wondering, what would be a fastest configuration: 1) FB 2.5 SuperServer with huge buffer 8192 * 3500000 pages = 29 Gb or 2) FB 2.5 Classic with small buffer of 1000 pages. Maybe some one has tested such case before and will save me days of work :) Thanks in advance.
