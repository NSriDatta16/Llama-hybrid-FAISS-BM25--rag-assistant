As already mentioned, any serious hosting company will easily be able to cope with the traffic. I just wanted to mention a couple points : Are you sure you want to send the entire game state back and forth each time? You should be able to get away with sending only what changed... This of course depends a lot on how your game works. The only other issue you might have to consider is lag : a server request can easily take a second or more for the whole encode/send/wait/receive/decode process. Now if your game is turn-based this probably isn't a major hindrance, but it's always something to keep in mind (also think of people who are on a slow connection, ie no 3G coverage). In any case, you're looking pretty good right now. If I were you, I'd go and write a few tests to see how it goes. Other than that, good luck! ;-)
