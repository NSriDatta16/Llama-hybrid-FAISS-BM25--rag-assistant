Bayesian SEM: LOO-CV / Fit Measures

I am running various bayesian path models in r ('blavaan' package). I understand that LOO is a more robust fit index when working with a smaller samples size (and weakly informative priors). I am using LOO-CV (PSIS) method to compare path models; however, I have additional questions. How do I interpret LOO-CV values to determine which model has the better fit? Should multiple fit indices be present in bayesian SEM results? Is there an alternative r package that runs 'loo-cv' analyses? The "loo" package will not load. Thank you.
