webSQL floating point issue

I am working with the PhoneGap API on Android. The API emulates webSQL for storage. I have encountered an issue, and I'm not sure whether to attribute it to my limited knowledge of JavaScript, or to something I'm missing with PhoneGap / WebSQL. Long story short, I'm storing UNIX epoch timestamps as a FLOAT via WebSQL. tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO timeline VALUES(0, 10, 100, 1297618964.65, '2011-02-13')"); tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO timeline VALUES(0, 8, 120, 1297618985.65, '2011-02-13')"); These values are then queried with a simple select statement and read with the following code: for (i = 0; i The issue is that the "timestamp" value appears to be truncated. The log shows 1.29762e+09, and the resulting graphs I'm plotting reflect this loss of precision. Using parseFloat or toFixed here gives the same loss of precision, just in a different printable format. The table definition is using FLOAT for timestamp, so I'm at a bit of a loss as to why my values are transformed thus before I do anything with them.
