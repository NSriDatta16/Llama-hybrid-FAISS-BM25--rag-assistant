i'm using the CPPlotSpaceDelegate protocol to receive touches on ios. after setting the delegate for your defaultPlotSpace you'll get called on the following methods when touches are received -(BOOL)plotSpace:(CPPlotSpace *)space shouldHandlePointingDeviceUpEvent:(id)event atPoint:(CGPoint)point; -(BOOL)plotSpace:(CPPlotSpace *)space shouldHandlePointingDeviceCancelledEvent:(id)event; -(BOOL)plotSpace:(CPPlotSpace *)space shouldHandlePointingDeviceDownEvent:(id)event atPoint:(CGPoint)point; -(BOOL)plotSpace:(CPPlotSpace *)space shouldHandlePointingDeviceDraggedEvent:(id)event atPoint:(CGPoint)point;
