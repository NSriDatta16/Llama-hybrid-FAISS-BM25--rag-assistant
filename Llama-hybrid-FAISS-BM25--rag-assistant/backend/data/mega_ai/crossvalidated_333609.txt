I would say no, that's not what probability theory fundamentally is, but I would say it for different reasons than the other answers. Fundamentally, I would say, probability theory is the study of two things: Stochastic processes, and Bayesian inference. Stochastic processes includes things like rolling dice, drawing balls from urns, etc., as well as the more sophisticated models found in physics and mathematics. Bayesian inference is reasoning under uncertainty, using probabilities to represent the value of unknown quantities. These two things are more closely related than they might at first appear. One reason we can study them under the same umbrella is that important aspects of both of them can be represented as non-negative functions that sum/integrate to one. But probability isn't just the study of those functions - their interpretation in terms of random processes and inference is also an important part of it. For example, probability theory includes concepts such as conditional probabilities and random variables, and quantities such as the entropy, the mutual information, and the expectation and variance of random variables. While one could define these things purely in terms of normalised non-negative functions, the motivation for this would seem pretty weird without the interpretation in terms of random processes and inference. Moreover, one sometimes comes across concepts in probability theory, particularly on the inference side, which cannot be expressed in terms of a non-negative function that normalises to one. The so-called "improper priors" come to mind here, and AdamO gave the Cantor distribution as another example. There certainly are some areas of probability theory in which the main interest is in the mathematical properties of normalised non-negative functions, for which the two application domains I mentioned are not important. When this is the case, we often call it measure theory rather than probability theory. But probability theory is also - indeed, I would say mostly - an applied field, and the applications of probability distributions are in themselves a non-trivial component of the field.
