iphone nsurlconnection read cookies

I am using async NSURLConnection to connect to a web site from iPhone. Handle didReceiveResponse is activated on response and I am trying to get all cookies, by using allHeaderFields from NSHTTPURLResponse I see many hreader, but no Set-Cookie - it looks like iphone simulator just ignores them... And I am sure cookies are present in response - network monitor shows they present I do not use any http storage - all that I am trying to do is to print to log all header - and do not see cookies info Does anybody know about this issue? UPDATE I have made some research: if my website returns custom header, like "Custom-Header: value" - then this header is visible in java client, but is not in iphone... thanks
