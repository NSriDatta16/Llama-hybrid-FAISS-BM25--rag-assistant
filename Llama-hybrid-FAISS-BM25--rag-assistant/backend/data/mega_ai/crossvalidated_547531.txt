Incremental update of Normal Distribution

There's a price time series $\{p_{t}, t=1..n\}$ . Is it possible to estimate Normal Distribution for every data point $N_{t}(\mu_{t}, \sigma_{t})$ efficiently (like incrementally or online calculation)? I.e. for $N_{10} = N(p_{1},...,p_{10})$ , $N_{11} = N(p_{1},...,p_{11})$ , and so on. It's possible of course to calculate it the usual way as $N_{t}=N(p_{0},..., p_{t})$ for every $t$ . But it has complexity $O(n^2)$ and is slow. I'm looking for a way to speed it up. About the assumptions of independence, stationarity and normality of the distribution. I don't know if these assumptions are true. I know that it works ok if the $N_{t}$ calculated the usual way, slow brute force way. And looking for way that would produce same $N_{t}$ but faster, with more efficient computations. P.S. Could the Kalman Filter be used for this? Or it solves some another task? And, what's the proper name for this approach, incremental estimation?
