I suggest you to read " File I/O and efficiency " post on Android Google groups. After the benchmarks author came to the conclusion that the most efficient way of file I/O is "batch operation on a memory mapped ByteBuffer" . In your case it may be more efficient to use one big file for thumbnails storage instead of hundreds of small ones. You may also need a separate file for indexing (e.g. for mapping between file name/number and start/end position in big thumbnail file) - this however depends on your logic.
