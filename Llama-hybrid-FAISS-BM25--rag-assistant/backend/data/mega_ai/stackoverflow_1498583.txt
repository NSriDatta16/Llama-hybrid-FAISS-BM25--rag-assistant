I don't think there is one, sadly, from an official perspective. Perhaps we need to make one up? Personally, I think the term DML is misleading because the term doesn't really describe the way SELECT works, as it (usually) doesn't actually modify anything. It only "collects" the relational data in a different fashion in temporary space and returns a specified set of it. So, if it was my choice, I would say that: DML would describe INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE and DRL ( data retrieval language ) would describe SELECT .
