Multiclass AUC score higher than binary

I just built a random forest classifier and wondered about the results. I have 4 classes: A, B, C and control. When I compare A vs control, B vs control, C vs control I get a lower average AUC score (0.8) compared to a multiclass approach with all 4 classes (0.85). Would one expect this result and when yes why? I would appreciate any help!
