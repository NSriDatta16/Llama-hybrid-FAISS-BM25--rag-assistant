According to the documentation, setFrame is not defined in the View class ( not strictly true - see edit ). Surprising, each subclass, TextView and ImageView , define it themselves. You'll have to have to extend the specific subclass for each widget you want to override this behavior. This is based on the docs for Android 2.3 r1 - 05 Jan 2011 12:43 . See the documentation: Classes that define setFrame http://www.google.com/search?q=site:developer.android.com+%22boolean+setFrame%22 TextView and ImageView . Edit: As the OP points out in the comments, the method is clearly defined in the View.java source code. However, the documentation acts as if the method isn't defined there. The reason for this is that the setFrame() method in View has the @hide Javadoc tag: /** * Assign a size and position to this view. * * This is called from layout. * * @param left Left position, relative to parent * @param top Top position, relative to parent * @param right Right position, relative to parent * @param bottom Bottom position, relative to parent * @return true if the new size and position are different than the * previous ones * {@hide} */ protected boolean setFrame(int left, int top, int right, int bottom) { Apparently, this hides the method from the Javadoc: http://www.androidjavadoc.com/?p=63 The especial [sic] attention is need to turn to the @hide tag which standard doclet can’t interpret and which hides non-SDK source and thus this code shouldn’t be used in applications . Is it possible that the reason it can't be overridden is that the Eclipse plug-in for Android or the Android compiler is somehow enforcing the @hide tag? I don't know.
