Generate and Save the files automatically to my local disk using Selenium

I have a Report Generator which is an intranet web application generates some reports. There are about 100 reports. Those reports are of PDF and Excel type. And I want to ensure that all these reports are generated without any issue. This is a daily job. Each report takes an average of 2 min. Manual checking process takes 200 min. As this is a testing process and not bothered about the contents in the files I want to automate the process. We are using Selenium test cases to test our web application. Is there any way to Save these reports on my location disk using Selenium ?
