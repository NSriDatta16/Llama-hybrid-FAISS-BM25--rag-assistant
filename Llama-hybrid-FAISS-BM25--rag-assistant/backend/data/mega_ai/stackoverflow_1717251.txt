As a general rule parameterized queries should always be used. It prevents malicious user input from being executed against your database (SQL injection attacks). [You should do user input validation as well to ensure that malicious code isn't rendered on the page and that JavaScript can be run against your server.] It enables you to re-use your queries. You can precompile your queries. It organizes your input and makes it more readable. You might want to use the same parameter in more than one location. It has better support for different data type such as dates, strings and the like. You won't run into problems with weird characters when you use parameterized queries. In my use case I always generate parameter based queries. I have a wrapper that will always compile them so that if a second query gets executed in the same request path, it will run that much faster on the same connection. This takes a fair bit of work to setup, but is worth the performance gain in any medium to enterprise level system.
