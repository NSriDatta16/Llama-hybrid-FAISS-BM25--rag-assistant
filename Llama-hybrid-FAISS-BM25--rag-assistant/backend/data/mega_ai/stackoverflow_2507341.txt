could you rig something like adding new paragraphs with small height and text="---------" PdfPCell Cell = new PdfPCell(new Paragraph("------")); Cell.Height = 0.2f; You can also draw the borders yourself using a PdfPCellEvent. There are different layers to add to. See the API here: http://api.itextpdf.com/com/itextpdf/text/pdf/PdfPCellEvent.html
