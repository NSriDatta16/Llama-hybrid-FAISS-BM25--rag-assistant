policy iteration convergence

There is a question here for 2014 about the convergence of policy iteration algorithm with two answers > Question However, it is not clear for me how we change the value functions after one policy improvement and it does not affect our convergence. Actually, the user in the mentioned question asks exactly the same thing in the last paragraph but I think answers are not satisfying! I have attached a screenshot from the last paragraph too.
