Execute Ant action always and independently from target

Is there a way to specify actions like in an Ant buildfile that get executed every time the build file gets read by ant (regardless of the target which is called)? The background is: I want a *.properties-file to be automatically created from a template when it's not present. I know, I could specify a target which does this and then include it at the root of the dependency-tree but maybe there is a more elegant solution. Because actually the problem is a bit more complex: the ant file where the *.properties-file is read-out is imported by other build files and I don't want to cross-reference targets between them. I hope I explained my problem sufficiently. In cases of questions do not hestitate to ask. This is my first posting here. Hope you can help - Greetings from Germany, Ben.
