Have you tried R's built in density estimation plot(density(a$UT4)) Should give you an appropriate density estimate. Otherwise you could look into estimating parameters in a normal mixture model (using EM algorithm or something) ================================= Perhaps what you are trying to do is not 'density estimation' but rather non-linear regression? Perhaps you would like to fit some splines to your data? Here are some examples of non-linear fits: plot(a[,6]~a[,2]) lines(supsmu(a[,6],a[,2]),col='magenta',lwd=2) lines(supsmu(y=a[,6],x=a[,2]),col='cyan',lwd=2) lines(lowess(y=a[,6],x=a[,2]),col='green',lwd=2) lines(ksmooth(y=a[,6],x=a[,2]),col='black',lwd=2) lines(smooth.spline(y=a[,6],a[,2]),col='yellow',lwd=2) lines(y=gam(a[,6]~s(a[,2]))$fitted.values,x=a[,2],col='brown',lwd=2)
