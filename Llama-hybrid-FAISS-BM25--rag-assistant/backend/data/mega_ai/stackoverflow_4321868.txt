custom scrollbar in UIWebView iphone

My UIWebView has a huge data to display and the default scrollbar that comes with UIWebview takes lot of time to scroll. Is it possible to implement a scrollbar on which user can tap and drag that were he wants. Any hint in the right direction would be highly appreciated. Waiting for your reply. Thanks in advance
