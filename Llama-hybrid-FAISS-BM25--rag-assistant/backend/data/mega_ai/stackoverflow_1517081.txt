Option 1 : Your easiest option would be to use the ScrollPane control in Flash. You could get away with no code at all initially. Drag a ScrollPane component from the Components Panel ( Ctrl + F7 on Windows/Linux / CMD + F7 on OSX) Set scrollDrag to true in the Parameters tab Input the path to a movie clip's linkage id in the ScollPane's source parameter. Have a look at the documetation and examples. Option 2 : Use a mask: set a mask in the IDE or using actionscript to your bigMovieClip add event listeners for MOUSE_DOWN and MOUSE_UP to setup dragging actioncript 3 required: bigMovieClip.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, dragOn); stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, dragOff); function dragOn(event:MouseEvent):void{ event.currentTarget.startDrag(); } function dragOff(event:MouseEvent):void{ bigMovieClip.stopDrag(); } Option 3: Use the scrollRect property of MovieClip If your clip is 1000x1000 for example, and you want your visible area to be 500x500 starting from 0,0 all you need to do is bigMovieClip.scrollRect = new Rectangle(0,0,500,500); then when you need to scroll, you store the rectangle, modify the x or y depending on your needs and update the scrollRect var sRect:Rectangle = bigMovieClip.scrollRect; sRect.x += 20; bigMovieClip.scrollRect = sRect; Good luck
