You can use: BoundPropertyOfViewModel = CollectionViewSource.GetDefaultView(AgentDeploymentDetail); and bind to the view instead of binding directly to the ObservableCollection. This is the same object that allow you to filter/sort your output without touching the collection. When you want to stop changes, use DeferRefresh() . When you are done, call Refresh() . WARNING This will not pervent showing of changes in each item itself, only the list.
