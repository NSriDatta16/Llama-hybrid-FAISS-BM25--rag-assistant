OK, I just refreshed my memory in Crystal Reports. I'm going by version XI R2, so things might be different in your version. Here's what I did: Define a parameter for the Property ID. It's up to you to define it as either a free field or restricting its values to what's in the database. Whichever makes the most sense to your report. Open up the database expert. Go to the "links" tab and make sure you have links defined between these tables. If you don't, then define them (think of them as foreign keys). Close the database expert. Open up the select expert. Click "new" to define a new selection restriction. In the new window that pops up, drag your parameter and the Property ID field from the tblProperty table, with an equals sign between them. This is basically the report's WHERE clause. Your formula should look something like {?Parameter}={tblProperty.PropertyID} . And that should do it.
