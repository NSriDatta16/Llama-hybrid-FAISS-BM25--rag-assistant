One class SVM to detect outliers

My problem is I want to build a one class SVM classifier to identify the nouns/aspects from test file. The training file has list of nouns. The test has list of words. This is what I've done: I'm using Weka GUI and I've trained a one class SVM(libSVM) to get a model. Now the model classifies those words in test file that the classifier identified as nouns in the generated model. Others are classified as outliers. ( So it is just working like a look up. If it is identified as noun in trained model, then 'yes' else 'no') So how to build a proper classifier?. ( I meant the format of input and what it information it should contain?) Note: I don't give negative examples in training file since it is one class. My input format is arff Format of training file is a set of word,yes Format of test file is a set of word,? Thanks.. EDIT My test file will have noun phrases. So my classifier's job is to get the nouns words from candidates in test file.
