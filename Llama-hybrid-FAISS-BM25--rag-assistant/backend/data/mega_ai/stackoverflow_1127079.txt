Try to put in the cpp implementation files after they include your header the following preprocessor line(s): //in compswitch1.cpp #ifndef CompSwitch1 # error "inconsistent header included" #endif //in compswitch2.cpp #ifndef CompSwitch2 # error "inconsistent header included" #endif If you compile wrong header/cpp pairs you should get at least compilation errors and not linking errors. There are much easier to identify/fix ;) Another possibility is that the cpp-files are not included into compilation at all. Put a message pragma inside the cpp file to see if they get compiled at all: #pragma message( "Compiling " __FILE__ ) Or try to identify in the build directory if there object files created, which relate to cpp-compilation units. Hope that helps, Ovanes
