Root Mean Square Log Error (RMSLE) Interpretation

I would like to clarify my understanding of Root Mean Log Squared Error (RMSLE): $$\text{RMSLE}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left [\ln \left ( \frac{y_{i}+1}{\hat{y_{i}}+1} \right ) \right ]^{2}}$$ RMSLE effectively quantifies the average exponential-multiplicative error. For instance, a model with an RMSLE of $1$ indicates that, on average: $$\frac{y}{\hat{y}}=e^{\pm 1} \rightarrow y \approx \hat{y} \cdot 2.7^{\pm 1}$$ Essentially, a typical prediction would be off by a factor of $2.7$ . Technically, this interpretation is only approximately true because the above equation adds $1$ to both the predicted and actual values to ensure that its domain is $[0,\infty)$ . However, when both $y, \hat{y} \gg 1$ , the distortion is negligible. Is this correct??
