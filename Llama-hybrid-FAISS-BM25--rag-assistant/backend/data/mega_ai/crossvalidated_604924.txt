SVMs: the distance from a point to the decision boundary

I came across this diagram while learning the derivation for SVMs: The author makes the claim that $\textbf{x} = \textbf{x}_{\perp} + r\frac{\textbf{w}}{||\textbf{w}||}$ , where $r$ is the distance from x to the decision boundary. The decision boundary for binary classification is defined through $f(\textbf{x})=\textbf{w}^\textbf{T}\textbf{x} + w_0$ . I don't understand this; shouldn't this be defined as $\textbf{x} = \textbf{x}_{\perp} + r\frac{\textbf{w}}{||\textbf{w}||} + (\frac{-w_0}{||\textbf{w}||})(\frac{\textbf{w}}{||\textbf{w}||})$ ? That is to say, in the original equation, should't $r$ also include the distance $\frac{-w_0}{||\textbf{w}||}$ ? The projection of x on the decision boundary should be represented by the black leftmost diagonal vector, no?
