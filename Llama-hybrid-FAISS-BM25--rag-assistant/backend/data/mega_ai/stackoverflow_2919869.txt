Ok, lets see what you have in line 3 : echo "".$_SESSION['eventnum'].""; Obviously you are generating output ( echo ) in this line and this line comes before you call header . Move it below header : session_start(); $urlRefresh = "testremot.php"; header("Refresh: 5; URL=\"" . $urlRefresh . "\""); echo "".$_SESSION['eventnum'].""; But note (from Wikipedia ): The W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (7.4) discourage the creation of auto-refreshing pages, since most web browsers do not allow the user to disable or control the refresh rate.
