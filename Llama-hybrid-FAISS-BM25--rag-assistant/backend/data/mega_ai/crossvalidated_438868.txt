The mean accuracy and overall accuracy are nearly what you defined. But the mean accuracy is the average across all classes not just 1 like you listed. In fact they can be computed from each other given k target class labels where k >= 2 : avgaccuracy = (2*overallaccuracy + k-2)/k =2(overallaccuracy-1)/k+1 overallaccuracy = (k*avgaccuracy + 2-k)/2 =k(avgaccuracy-1)/2+1 This formula is straight forward to derive by simply reformulating the average accuracy in terms of the overall accuracy. Actually it is quite logical since its merely a ratio between 2-classes and k -classes, and subtracting and adding 1 before and after. Just a very simple re-scaling operation. For your example: 0.9912 = (2 * 0.956 + 8) / 10 So 0.9912 is the mean accuracy. As the other post mentions, there is also a mean average which can be taken by k-folds cross validation. In this case it is the k-folds score mean of the mean accuracy. And the k-folds score mean of the overall accuracy. With k-folds there is no way to express an overall accuracy which is not averaged. This type of details is usually implied as most people understand that k-folds has to average scores, and in this context they are the overall and mean accuracy.
