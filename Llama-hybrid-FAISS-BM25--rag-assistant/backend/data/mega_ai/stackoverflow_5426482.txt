Using PIL to detect a scan of a blank page

So I often run huge double-sided scan jobs on an unintelligent Canon multifunction, which leaves me with a huge folder of JPEGs. Am I insane to consider using PIL to analyze a folder of images to detect scans of blank pages and flag them for deletion? Leaving the folder-crawling and flagging parts out, I imagine this would look something like: Check if the image is greyscale, as this is presumed uncertain. If so, detect the dominant range of shades (background colour). If not, detect the dominant range of shades, restricting to light greys. Determine what percentage of the entire image is composed of said shades. Try to find a threshold that adequately detects pages with type or writing or imagery. Perhaps test fragments of the image at a time to increase accuracy of threshold. I know this is sort of an edge case, but can anyone with PIL experience lend some pointers?
