The purpose of factor analysis is evaluating the relationship between observed variables. Exploratory factor analysis is usually used to find the underline structure of the observed variables and identifying the latent structs. PCA is mathematical tool used for finding such underline structure between variables. PCA is subjected to scaling and actual relation between variables(such as correlation). I wouldnt linger on filtering variables pre factor analysis, mainly because the math behind most such process(PCA specifically) handles it well.
