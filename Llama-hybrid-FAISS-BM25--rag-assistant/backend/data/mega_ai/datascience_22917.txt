Based on the comment by Ricardo Cruz I tried switching the value of false from 0 to -1 and also normalization on and off. Neither switching the value from 0 to - 1 or normalization of features had any impact on the values predicted by the SVM. In this case I was using a Gaussian kernel and Sequential Minimal Optimization for my SVM.
