One- vs two-sided credible interval for Poisson process with all zero counts

In a related question , I asked about a confidence interval for the estimate of the mean of 50 observations of a Poisson random variable, for which all 50 observations had a count of zero. In the comments to an answer to that question by whuber, it was pointed out that you shouldn't use a one-sided confidence interval just because you have all zero counts. If you used a two-sided interval in situations where you observed non-zero counts and one-sided intervals when you observed all zero counts, your confidence intervals would no longer have their nominal level of coverage. In that question a simulation of coverage convinced my that that was a bad strategy. My question here is how would a Bayesian argue one way or the other for one- vs two-sided credible intervals for the same situation with all zero counts. Consider a prior distribution of $gamma(1, 0)$ , with a Poisson likelihood, that results in a posterior distribution of $gamma(1, 50)$ , for data consisting of 50 observations of zero counts. How would you argue against using a one-sided credible interval?
