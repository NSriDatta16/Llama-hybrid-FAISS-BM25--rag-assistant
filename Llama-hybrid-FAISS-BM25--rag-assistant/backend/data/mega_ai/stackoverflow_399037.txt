Wow. I feel your pain. Looks to me as if the first source of your problem is the techPM who is "protected". Why is she protected and by whom? I once was on a project where the ceo's secretary became first the business analyst and then (after he quit) the project manager because they were having an affair. She didn't know what language we programmed in and thought requirements were a waste of time. Since she was protected by someone as high as possible in the organization, the only real solution was to look elsewhere for employment. You seem to think you can fire her and her protector so it may be someone lower than you but above the lead PM so he couldn't do anything about it but you can? Yes, you should fire the two of them. The lead PM may or may not be salvageable depending on who the protector was. He could have been between a rock and a hard place where he knew what to do but due to the nature of the relationship between the tech pm and her protector was unable to exert any influence over her and the people who reported to her. I was in that position once where two of my bosses were having an affair with one of my subordinates and it creates all kinds of organizational havoc (which is why the protector must be fired as well as the tech PM). Give him the benefit of the doubt and discuss with him how he would would handle things differently if the tech pm and her protector were out of the way. If you like what you hear, you can keep him but organizationally you will need to step in and make sure that is it clear this person is in charge and no one will be allowed to ignore him. Once a lead has lost authority, he can only get it back with the strong backing from management. I would also sit down with the lead and the developer and explain exactly what is unacceptable in the project as it currently stands. If the developer feels unable to take direction from the lead (assuming you decide to keep him) or is unable to adjust to a new way of doing business or cannot understand why the code as it stands is unacceptable, cut your losses and get rid of him as well. A new person is likely to work better for the lead if he is salvageable anyway because he won't have a history of ignoring him.
