Input background colour destroys styling?

I am creating a form which is validated under jQuery Validation . I want to apply a light-red background colour to inputs which are invalid and need to be corrected. When I apply background-color: #FFCCCC; to the input, the attractive styling seems to be removed and a hard border replaces it. For example, with a text input in Firefox: Styled and unstyled text input http://liranuna.com/strager/b/textbox-difference.png ( Live demo ) This occurs with several browsers. It also occurs if I set any background other than #FFFFFF . Is there a way to preserve styling while applying a background colour? I am open to Javascript solutions which emulate the style somehow.
