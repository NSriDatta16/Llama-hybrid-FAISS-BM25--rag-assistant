Is it discouraged to save the same piece of data in two places in a relational database?

I am in the process of writing a Django/Python based app and I want to avoid writing code or making more requests to my DB than I have to. Would it be unreasonable to store a piece of data already stored at a higher level in a lower level so that it is easier to access from the lower level? Hopefully that was clear - please tell me if you need clarification. Thanks!
