Robert and Casella (RC) happen to describe the family of conjugate priors of the beta distribution in Example 3.6 (p 71 - 75) of their book, Introducing Monte Carlo Methods in R , Springer, 2010. However, they quote the result without citing a source. Added in response to gung's request for details. RC state that for distribution $B(\alpha, \beta)$, the conjugate prior is "... of the form $$ \pi(\alpha,\beta) \propto \Big\{ \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)} {\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)} \Big\} ^{\lambda} x_0^{\alpha} y_0^{\beta} $$ where $\{\lambda, x_0, y_0\}$ are hyperparameters, since the posterior is then equal to $$ \pi(\alpha,\beta \vert x) \propto \Big\{ \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)} {\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)} \Big\} ^{\lambda} (xx_0)^{\alpha} ((1-x)y_0)^{\beta}." $$ The remainder of the example concerns importance sampling from $\pi(\alpha,\beta \vert x)$ in order to compute the marginal likelihood of $x$.
