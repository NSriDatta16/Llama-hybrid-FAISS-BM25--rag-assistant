Remember how PCA works: It starts by finding the single dimension (direction) of greatest variation in your dataset. That becomes PC1. Then it finds the direction of greatest variation that is at right angles to that. It becomes PC2. Etc. The important thing to recognize is that if your data aren't centered, the direction of greatest variation might well be from the origin of the space (e.g., $(0, 0)$ in a Cartesian plane) to the centroid (mean vector) of your data. Every subsequent principal component is constrained by that first one: They all have to be at right angles to it. That means that the resulting PCs may not uncorrelate your data. Here is a quick illustration (written in R): library(MASS) # we'll use this package set.seed(7668) # this makes the example exactly reproducible X = mvrnorm(100, mu=c(-5, 0), Sigma=rbind(c(1, 1.6), # here I generate data c(1.6, 4) )) windows(height=4, width=7) layout(matrix(1:2, nrow=1)) plot(X[,1], X[,2], xlim=c(-8, 1)) abline(h=0, col="gray"); abline(v=0, col="gray") points(mean(X[,1]), 0, pch="*", cex=2, col="red") biplot(prcomp(X, center=FALSE))
