In VEGAN ADONIS, what does "method='bray' do when I pass in a distance matrix I already have (UNIFRAC)?

Suppose I have a distance matrix created by applying the weighted unifrac measure. For instance, using a phyloseq object: weighted_unifrac = UniFrac( physeq=ps, weighted=T, normalized=T, parallel=T, fast=T ) weighted_unifrac is now a distance matrix. Then I perform PERMANOVA using adonis , and showing the default method parameter: permanova = adonis( formula=weighted_unifrac ~ CaseString, data=sample_data, permutations=999, method='bray' ) What is method doing here? I think of Bray-Curtis as a way to generate the distance matrix itself. How does method="bray" or my choice of another method value affect my PERMANOVA analysis?
