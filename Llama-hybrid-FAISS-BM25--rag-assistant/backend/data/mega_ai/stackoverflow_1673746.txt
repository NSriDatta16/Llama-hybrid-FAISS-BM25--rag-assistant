The best solution would be to use a database or storage which already supports versions, for example Apache Jackrabbit . If that's not an option, then you must decide where you want to store the articles. On the file system? Then make each article a directory and save the revisions as numbers (00001, 00002, etc.) and put the number of the last revision in a special file (like current ). Then you can quickly find out how many versions there are (just look into current ) and go forward and back. If you use a database, then add a version number field to the article table and add a second table or a flag which says which one the current version is. You could also select with max(version) but those SQL constructs tend to be pretty ugly and confusing. It's much more simple to save this information elsewhere.
