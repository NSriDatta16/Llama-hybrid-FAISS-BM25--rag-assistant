The choice of license is personal, and depends on how you want your project used. I would recommend reading up on this at the Open Source Inititive. In particular, they have a page describing licenses grouped in categories . Here are some of the more common, by goal: For encouraging commercial usage of your project, I'd recommend looking at the BSD and MIT licenses. For encouraging commercial and noncommercial work, but forcing that all users share any modifications to your code, look at the LGPL license. If you want to force everybody who uses your code to share any modifications, look into the GPL license. There are many others listed, each with their own significant benefits and downsides... These are just four very common choices.
