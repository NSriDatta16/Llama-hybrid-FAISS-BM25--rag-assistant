It's absolutely true that SQLite is focused on the functionality that belongs in the data storage layer and NOT on functionality that belongs in the user interface, like formatting dates with month names and the like. I strongly suggest that you take this as a very helpful hint to keep each kind of functionality in its proper layer!-). If you're absolutely keen to misplace UI functionality in the data storage layer, this can to some extent be shoehorned in, e.g. by writing your own formatting functions in C and hooking them up in SQLite, or going through incredibly clumsy SQL gyrations, but I cannot imagine ANY use case where that would be worth the bother.
