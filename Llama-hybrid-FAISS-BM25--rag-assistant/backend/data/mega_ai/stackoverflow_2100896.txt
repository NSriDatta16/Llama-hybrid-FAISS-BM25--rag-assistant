Jquery drag /drop and clone

Hi I need to achive this .. I have a set of droppable items ( basically I am droping designs on a apparel ) and I am dropping a clone.. If I don't like the dropped object (designs) - I want to delete that by doing something like hidden . But I am unable to do that. Please help me.. here is the code var clone; $(document).ready(function(){ $(".items").draggable({helper: 'clone',cursor: 'hand'}); $(".droparea").droppable({ accept: ".items", hoverClass: 'dropareahover', tolerance: 'pointer', drop: function(ev, ui) { var dropElemId = ui.draggable.attr("id"); var dropElem = ui.draggable.html(); clone = $(dropElem).clone(); // clone it and hold onto the jquery object clone.id="newId"; clone.css("position", "absolute"); clone.css("top", ui.absolutePosition.top); clone.css("left", ui.absolutePosition.left); clone.draggable({ containment: 'parent' ,cursor: 'crosshair'}); $(this).append(clone); alert("done dragging "); /lets assume I have a delete button when I click that clone should dissapear so that I can drop another design - but the following code has no effect //and the item is still visible , how to make it dissapear ? $('#newId').css("visibility","hidden"); } }); });
