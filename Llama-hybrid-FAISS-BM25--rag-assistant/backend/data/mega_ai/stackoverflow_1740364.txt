Was it Meyers who came up with aLongAndTotallyUnreadableMethodeName vs an_even_longer_but_perfectly_readable_method_name comparison? If you are already used to one, then your favorite convention will look more natural. But new programmers may prefer underscores (sample size N = me, in the year 2001). I think some languages use camelCase because their API can be really horrible. You need the extra space so the code can fit in the IDE without wrapping. For example: poly = geometryLibrary.polygonGenerator.createFromPointSet(myList.listContentsToPointset())
