Parts of this sound like a job for NServiceBus, which is built on top of a queuing infrastructure--such as MSMQ. Thea idea is that when something happens in one part of the system, it publishes an event that other parts of the system listen to. Then, those other parts receive this event (typically via MSMQ) and update their own local storage according to their needs. http://www.nservicebus.com/
