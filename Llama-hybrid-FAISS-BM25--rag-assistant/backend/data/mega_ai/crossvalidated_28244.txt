I am familiar with Wahba's work in splines using RKHS and her dissertation advisor Manny Parzen. I had no clue that you were talking about that. Part of my problem as I said is that I am not familiar with SVM and its jargon. I was making a guess that since you were talking about classification that you were talking about kernel discriminant analysis. Since I was wrong about that you can ignore my comments on that topic.
