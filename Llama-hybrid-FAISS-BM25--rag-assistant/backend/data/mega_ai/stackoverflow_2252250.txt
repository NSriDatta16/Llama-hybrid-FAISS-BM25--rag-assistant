mysql recount column in mysql based on rows in secondary table

I took over a database with two tables, lets name them entries and comments . The entries table contains a column named comment_count which holds the amount of rows with entry_id in comments corresponding to that row in entries . Lately this connection has become terribly out of sync due to version switching of the codebase. I need help to build a query to run in phpmyadmin to sync these numbers again. The amount of rows in entries is around 8000 and the rows in comments is around 80000 so it shouldn't be any problems to run the sync-query. Structure: entries countains: id | comment_count | etc comments contains id | blogentry_id | etc The only way I can think of is to loop each entry in the entries table with php and update individually but that seems extremly fragile compared to a pure SQL solution. I'd appriciate for any help!
