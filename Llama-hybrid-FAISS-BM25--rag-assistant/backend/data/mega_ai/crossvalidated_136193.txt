From exp (coefficients) to Odds Ratio and their interpretation in Logistic Regression with factors

I ran a linear regression of acceptance into college against SAT scores and family / ethnic background. The data are fictional. This is a follow-up on a prior question, already answered. The question focuses in the gathering and interpretation of odds ratios when leaving the SAT scores aside for simplicity. The variables are Accepted (0 or 1) and Background ("red" or "blue"). I set up the data so that people of "red" background were more likely to get in: fit Questions: Is 0.7 the odd ratio of a person of "blue" background being accepted? I'm asking this because I also get 0.7 for " Backgroundblue " if instead I run the following code: fit Shouldn't the odds ratio of "red" being accepted ($\rm Accepted/Red:Accepted/Blue$) just the reciprocal: ($\rm OddsBlue = 1 / OddsRed$)?
