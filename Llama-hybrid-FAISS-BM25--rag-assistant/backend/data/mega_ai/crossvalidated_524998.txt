ANOVA is to ANCOVA as Kruskal–Wallis is to...?

ANCOVA is an ANOVA with an added covariate, and I find it quite elegant how both can be seen in a general regression framework. If, however, I want to do a Kruskal–Wallis-type of test that accounts for some covariate, what would that be? That is, what kind of regression model(s) turn into the regular Kruskal–Wallis test if the covariate is ignored? (If it helps, I am probably interested in two-sample comparisons, not the full $k$ -sample comparison that ANOVA and KW do.)
