Correlation between temperature and gas consumption

I have two time series; (1) with average daily temperature (which is negative in Q1 and Q4 on some days) and (2) gas consumption of a client: A part of the process I am trying to achieve is to calculate the relationship between gas consumption and temperature. I expect the consumption to be higher on average when it's colder. How shall I calculate the correlation between the two series? I can check the correlation between the absolute values of temp in deg. C and gas consumption, the correlation between the log (temp, t-1 / temp, t) & log(consumpt, t-1 / consumpt, t), or either of the options with the temperature in Kelvin. Every method gives a substantially different result and I do not know which is correct. Any input would be helpful.
