As far as the Team Provisioning profile goes: Does your console say anything? Are you using Xcode 3.2.5? I'd file a radar at http://bugreport.apple.com . Do you see the Team Provisioning file in the iOS Provisioning Portal? Does it have a green light? You might try revoking it and letting Xcode create a new one. As far as getting your app to work You can always create an app-specific development profile. Choose your certificate and the app you are working on. Also make sure to select your device in the checkbox list. Then download the profile (once it is ready) and double click on it to import it into Xcode. If you look at the Xcode organizer, you should see your development profile in the list. If it's red, that means your certificate has expired If it's yellow, that means you don't have the private key present to sign using the selected certificate In the project's Get Info window, under code signing, choose iPhone Developer for both pickers. Take a look at see which one is automatically selected (sometimes you have to manually choose the right one). Then do a Clean & Build and you should be good to go.
