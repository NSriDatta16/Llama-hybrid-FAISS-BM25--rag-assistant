About your minor sub questions 1) In case ... the errors are homoscedastic ... why would one prefer a glm? GLM does two things: model different link functions model different conditional error distributions If the errors are homoskedastic then the latter is not important, but the first might still be useful. Related: Conditions for Poisson regression to outperfom OLS in linear inverse problems 3) Why would logistic regression still be important if the values won't be zero? It is inappropriate because it is obviously a wrong model. However, occasionally it works fine. You can use linear link function if You only model with a predictor that has two values.( Should I use a Simple Linear or Logistic Regression ) When you model only a small range of outcomes. ( Interpreting logistic modelling and linear modelling results for the same formula ) 2) Using generalized linear models over OLS and why do estimates differ? While both are unbiased (if the model of the mean is correct), they do not have the same error! So the coefficients do not need to be the same. The coëfficiënts can differ because the weights of the data points will differ. Fitting with a Gaussian family will give all points equal weight. Fitting with Gamma family will give more weight to lower values (which are considered to be measured with less error). See the example below. In this case the data was generated with a misspecification ( $E[y] = x^2$ but fitted with linear function) to make the differences more clear. The Gamma fit alligns more with the smaller values which have a smaller variance. The Gaussian fit will not know that these have a smaller variance and fits them as if the y had a larger variance. Fitting with the correct weights will reduce the error/variance of the estimated coëfficiënts. Related: Can robust standard errors be less than those from normal OLS?
