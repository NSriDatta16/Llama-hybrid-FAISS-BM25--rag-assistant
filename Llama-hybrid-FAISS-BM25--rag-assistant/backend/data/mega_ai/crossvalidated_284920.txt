For exponential families, you should assume that the carrier measure is part of the prior, and so if you have two beliefs $X$ and $Y$, then combining them should not double-count the carrier measure. If their densities are $$f_X(x) \propto e^{\theta_X^T T(x) + h(x)}$$ and similarly for $Y$ using natural parameter $\theta_Y$, then by independence, their combination should have density $$f_{Z}(x) \propto e^{(\theta_X+\theta_Y)^T T(x) + h(x)}.$$ Therefore, for an exponential family, the Bayesian way of combining evidence is to add natural parameters. This is close to a pointwise product of densities (also called a product of experts ), but doesn't make the mistake of double-counting the carrier measure. For normal distributions, the carrier measure is zero and so this distinction is irrelevant. This “Bayesian evidence combination” does almost exactly what you describe except in the second case, $b If I measure my quantity to be equal to $10 \pm 0.5$ and my friend gets $10 \pm 0.7$, intuitively the new estimate should be $10 \pm a$ in which $a If you work this out for a normal distribution in your chosen parametrization (mean and variance), you will find that the combined distribution's mean is the weighted average of means (weighted by precision) $$\frac{\frac{\mu_X}{\sigma^2_X} + \frac{\mu_Y}{\sigma^2_Y}}{\frac{1}{\sigma^2_X} + \frac{1}{\sigma^2_Y}},$$ and its variance is the “harmonic sum” of variances $$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sigma^2_X} + \frac{1}{\sigma^2_Y}}.$$
