If you can visit all states, dynamic programming (DP) will often find the optimtal solution. A slightly more complex optional is value function approximation (VFA). It can be impossible to perform tabular Q-learning on continuous data. VFA replaces a look-up table with a function. If you have enough data, it is possible to use deep learning within VFA.
