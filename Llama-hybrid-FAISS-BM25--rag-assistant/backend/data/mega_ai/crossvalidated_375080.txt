You have baseline differences on the pretest. You can attempt a regression adjustment. Use both pretest and group assignment to predict posttest in a regression model. The treatment effect in this model is the average difference on the posttest between those in the treatment and control group for those who had the same pretest score. But if the groups differed on the pretest, both groups may differ in other ways not captured by the pretest. So you cannot interpret the group difference from your regression coefficient causally. It is simply an observed group difference for those with similar scores on the pretest. Be sure to check the data to see that there are enough individuals in both groups with substantial overlap on the pretest. This is a starting point from which you can explore further.
