A relatively recent way to create instrumental variables--when your data set does not include instruments yet--is the method proposed in the following paper: Lewbel, A, 2012. Using Heteroscedasticity to Identify and Estimate Mismeasured and Endogenous Regressor Models. Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 30:1, 67-80. http://fmwww.bc.edu/EC-P/wp587.pdf . In short, potential instruments are created exploiting the existence of heteroskedastic error; thus, the greater the degree of heteroskedasticity, the higher is the correlation between the generated instruments and the endogenous variable(s). Lewbel's approach may be applied when: (i) no (or too few) external instruments are available; (ii) to supplement external instruments to improve the efficiency of the IV estimator (you have the right amount of instruments, but you want more). Point (ii) is relevant also because it allows the researcher to conduct Sargan-Hansen tests on the orthogonality conditions or overidentifying restrictions--the latter test is not feasible when the number of instrumented variables is equal to the number of instrumental variables. [For interested Stata users, the user-written xtivreg2 and the ivreg2h routines allow the researchers to construct these instruments automatically]
