If you were intending to use XML as a way of not properly defining database tables that would indeed an architectural cop-out. I'm not sure about your scenario, it seems dangerously close to that. But key-value pairs are probably worse. The best thing is to use a specialist XML datatype, if your database has one. In addition to RageZ's list, Oracle as had an XMLType for ten years now (since 9i). The advantage of using XMLType is two-fold. It announces to the casual observer that the documents in this column are XML. It also gives you access to built-in functionality, such as validation with XML Schemas, should you want it. Other features could prove handy if you subsequently have to start referring to the contents of the XML. For instance, Oracle's XDB supports an XML index type which can dramatically improve the performance of XPath queries.
