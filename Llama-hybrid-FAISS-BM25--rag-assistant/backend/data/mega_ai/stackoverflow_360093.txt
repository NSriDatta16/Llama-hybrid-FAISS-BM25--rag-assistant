If you don't need to process stop, don't embed. For example, you can do: if(input == null && input.getSomeClass2() == null && ...) return null; // Do what you want. Assuming you're using a language like Java that orders the conditionals. Alternatively you could: if(input == null && input.getSomeClass2() == null) return null; SomeClass2 obj2 = input.getSomeClass2(); if(obj2 == null) return null; ... // Do what you want. For more complex cases. The idea is to return from the method if you don't need to process. Embedding in a large nested if is almost impossible to read.
