The main thing you need to understand here is, SVM always tries to maximize the margin between support vectors to differentiate classes. Logistic Regression uses the Logit Function (using log-likelihoond function) and Odds ratio that obtain the probabilistic values to find [0,1] output. SVM has kernel methods which can classify features by mapping data in higher dimensions using orthogonal projections and RBF kernels. Since SVM can handle complex data, there would be less room for errors compared to Logistic Regression. Logistic regression is more sensitive to outliers, hence SVM performs better in presence of outliers. SVM is preferred when there are higher dimensions and higher classes in data and Logistic regression is great when there are less dimensions and less dependent features.
