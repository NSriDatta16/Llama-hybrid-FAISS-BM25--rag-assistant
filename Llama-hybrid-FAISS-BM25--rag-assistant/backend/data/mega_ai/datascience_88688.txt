Once a predictive model is in production, how it can be evaluated?

I have a data science project, predicting customer's next purchase day. Customer's one year behavioral data was split to 9 and 3 months for train and test, using RFM analysis, I trained a model with different classifiers and the best one's result is as follow: Accuracy of XGB classifier on training set: 0.93 Accuracy of XGB classifier on test set: 0.68 This is my school's project, and I was wondering, in real world projects, how can we evaluate a model's performance after it's on production. How can I measure how successful my model was? What if the performance measures in production are much lower than my test result?
