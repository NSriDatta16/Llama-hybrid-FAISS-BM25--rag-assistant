You can treat this task as optimization problem. Test statistic is function to optimize (+ penalty for number of removed data points or limit on how many data points to remove), each data point has binary coefficient associated with it (include/exclude). Then you can try greedy solution, random search or some variation of bayesian search (used for hyperparameter tuning). If you examine your test statistic more accurately, maybe you can come up with more efficient search strategy.
