What does "Norm" term mean?

In this paper (page 1 abstract) which considers regularization technique, the author used the word "norm" - what does it stand for? Is it related to Batch Normalization / L1 or L2 Normalization? "We stabilize the activations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by penalizing the squared distance between successive hidden statesâ€™ norms" Googling "what is a norm Neural Net" doesn't provide any links
