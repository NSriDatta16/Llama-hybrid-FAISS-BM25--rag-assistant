Actionscript 3.0 Dragging Loader image but getting error that it can't be converted to a movieclip

I have a script that loads an external image into the stage(I have the addChild() script somewhere else) but I keep getting an error that says: TypeError: Error #1034: Type Coercion failed: cannot convert flash.display::Loader@b1b7101 to flash.display.MovieClip. at project1_fla::MainTimeline/drag() var my_loader:Loader = new Loader(); my_loader.load(new URLRequest("http://i54.tinypic.com/anom5d.png")); my_loader.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, drag); function drag(event:MouseEvent):void{ var my_loader:MovieClip = MovieClip(event.target); my_loader.startDrag() my_loader.scaleX = my_loader.scaleY = .95; What I do to make the image draggable? *(The image is loaded when the swf starts but the image won't because I put the addChild() in a if() statement. Could it be that since the image isn't loaded, it can't be a movieclip?)
