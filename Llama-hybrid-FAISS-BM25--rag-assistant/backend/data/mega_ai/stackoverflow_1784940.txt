Solved! Finally. Thanks guys, for your attention! It was something like what Balus guessed at the first time. It was a static hidden in a dark corner. I had really double, triple checked everything looking for statics, but -- don't ask me why -- someone created a second bean ( Foo ) which was holding a static reference for SearchBean . In the JSP, there was an action="#{foo.search}" instead of searchBean.search . Class Foo had a method with the same name as in SearchBean , that was doing no more than a searchBean.search(); . I think pressure for fixing this bug for yesterday didn't allow me to see this trap in the JSP.
