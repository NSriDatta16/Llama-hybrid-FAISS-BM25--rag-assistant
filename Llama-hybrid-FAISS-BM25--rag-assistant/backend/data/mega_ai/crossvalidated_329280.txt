Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD)

I would like to understand the functional form of the Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) presented in Wikipedia . My questions are: what is the rationale for replacing $z$ with $\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$. Also, in Picture 2 in the last paragraph it is mentioned " ... extend the family by adding the location parameter $\mu$". what is the interpretation of the location parameter $\mu$, and scale parameter $\sigma$ when we are dealing with the distribution of threshold excesses. Picture 3 features an extract from Extreme Value Modeling and Risk Analysis: Methods and Applications, Dipak K. Dey, Jun Yan Picture 1. Picture 2. Picture 3 .
