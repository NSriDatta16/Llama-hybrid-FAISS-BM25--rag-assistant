How to do moderation / mediation anaylsis in a binary logistic regression?

For my master thesis, I am trying to find a way to test my moderation and mediation but it is getting to complex and I have not found anything adequate yet. During my study, I would like to address the following research questions : What is the impact of perceived control over own body shape (body mobility) on self-control in terms of healthy food consumption? To what extent is perceived control over own body shape (body mobility) related to self-control in terms of healthy food consumption and is this relation moderated by the level of consumerâ€™s self-esteem? Is the relation between perceived control over own body shape (body mobility) and self-control in terms of healthy food consumption mediated by goal attainability? These are my variables in the study: My independent variable is " Perception of Body mobility " and is categorical (Either High or low body mobility condition) The dependent variable is " Self-control " which is dichotomous (Either healthy food choice or unhealthy food choice). The moderator I choose is " Self-Esteem " and it was measured on a likert scale so it is continuous . My mediator is " Goal attainability " and is also continuous and is measured on a likert scale. For my main effect I have decided to use a binary logistic regression as I have a dichotomous dependent variable. But I am struggling to find a way to test my moderation and mediation which are both continuous variables. What would the easiest way to do so? Thanks a lot in advance.
