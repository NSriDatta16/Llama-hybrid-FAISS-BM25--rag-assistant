Python. Showing text from a file in fragments of 20 lines every time ENTER is pressed

This is the code i have at the moment print "Please input the filename:" n = raw_input() f = open(n,"r") x = 0 for line in f.readlines(): print line x+=1 if x % 20 == 0: break q = raw_input() if q == "": x+= 20 continue Things the program should do: 1) Ask for a filename 2) Read the file 3) Print the first 20 lines of the file 4) Stop working after the first 20 lines and wait for an Enter keypress 5) If Enter is pressed show the next 20 lines of the file (20->40 and so on) Current problem: The loop doesn't restart, it only shows the first 20 lines and then stops working.
