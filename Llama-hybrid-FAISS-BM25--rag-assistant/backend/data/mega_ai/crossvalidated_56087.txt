Are you looking for techniques, or might you be looking for packages, such as R's coda ? As you note, you'd ignore the first N data points in each chain, which are called "burn-in". How large N is depends on how quickly your model converged and there are a whole host of methods that you can use to give an idea of convergence. (Some of these methods require multiple chains.) If you're not sure your run has become well-mixed (converged), any calculations you do with your results will be meaningless. I would run M chains, drop the first N points from each chain, then pool the rest of the points together. Then do a density plot to see what kind of distribution you have. As you suggest, you can take the mean value. (Especially if you can see that the distribution is reasonably normal.) I wouldn't average the last sample from different runs.
