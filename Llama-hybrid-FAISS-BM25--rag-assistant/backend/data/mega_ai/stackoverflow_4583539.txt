How to renew subscriptions after IISRESET?

This is my scenario: Web application with a self-hosted bus (publisher) Windows service with NServiceBus.Host.exe (subscriber) Imagine that trigger an IISRESET (never mind on the why I have to do that) that makes the bus re-initialize and lose the subscriptions that already had. I'm using MsmqSubscriptionStorage and the publisher (web app) implements the IAuthorizeSubscriptions interface. How can I renew the subscriptions and also call the AuthorizeSubscribe()? Is that possible? What's your suggestion to this scenario?
