What tests for dependent variables for Likert scale outcomes?

My dependent variable is Likert data (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree). My independent variables include age and 3 categorical variables (one has 3 levels, two are binomial). I want to see which independent variables are associated differences in agreement with X, Y, and Z statements. Would I first run a Pearson's chi-square for test of independence for each statement for each independent variable? Or should I do an ordinal logistic regression? I would also like to say something like older people are more likely to strongly disagree/disagree with this statement. I don't mind turning age into a categorical variable and I don't mind condensing my Likert data into strongly/agree vs. neutral vs. strongly disagree/disagree. I'm obviously a non-statistician and am drawing from minimal experience during college years ago! I would appreciate any help I could get.
