Let's look at the factors. Case 1: When you display the post you display the comments. That means you retrieve them all and can count them as you display them. In that case, no. Case 2: When you display the post you do not display the comments, but a link that says "15 comments." In that case there is an equation. Materializing the count: Cost of one comment save = 1 Insert + 1 Update Cost of one post display = 1 Read Average Number of blog displays = D Average Number of Comments = C So, for what ratio of Displays D vs. Comments C is it true that: C * (Insert + Update) Since it is usually true that D >> C, I would suggest that the cost of that extra update vanishes. This may not be so important for a blog, but it is a crucial formula to know when you have many tables and need to make these decisions.
