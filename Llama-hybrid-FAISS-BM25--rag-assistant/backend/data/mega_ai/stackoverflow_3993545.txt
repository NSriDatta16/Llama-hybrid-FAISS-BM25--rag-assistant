Object Oriented Javascript vs. Pure jQuery and .data storage

My current style of programming is OO javascript using the Class.extend function by John Resig: http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/ This has been fine but I find myself writing numerous setters and getters that only get used on init. Also, it seems to lead to memory leaks in IE when storing instances of these objects in an array for later use. I am starting to favor smaller, cleaner, and more readable code over the seemingly overkill OO approach. My idea is to now just base everything off the dom using jquery and storing data properties using the .data method. For example, instead of creating an instance of a new Tweet object, you would simply add a div to the dom with class tweet and simply add the properties like author, timestamp, reply to, sent from, etc. in the .data cache for that dom element. What do you think of this less structured approach when creating instances of things such as items in a stream like twitter? Is OO and prototypal inheritance the best approach or is strict dom manipulation better?
