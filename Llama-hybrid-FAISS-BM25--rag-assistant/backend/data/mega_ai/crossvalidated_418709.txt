The biggest problem with drawing from the prior is if a user is using a rather flat prior. For example, if a user is using a logistic regression model and they don't want the prior to have much of an effect on the posterior, they may choose to make the prior a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 100. Taking a draw from this prior will, with very high probability, lead to numerical errors (i.e., NaN ) in computing the likelihood. As such, the Stan authors are betting that values in the range $[-2, 2]$ are less likely to lead to computational errors than a draw from the prior.
