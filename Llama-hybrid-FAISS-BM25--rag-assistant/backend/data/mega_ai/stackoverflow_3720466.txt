You can use hibernate.connection.autocommit=true This will make hibernate commit each SQL update to the database immediately and u should be able to see the changes from the other application. HOWEVER, I would strongly discourage you from doing so. Like Aaron pointed out, you should only use one Hibernate SessionFactory with a database. If you do need multiple applications to be in sync, think about using a shared cache,e.g. Gemstone.
