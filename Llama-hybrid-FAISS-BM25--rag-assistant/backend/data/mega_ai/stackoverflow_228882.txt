This is a bit of a hassle in flash, but it is entirely possible. What you will need to do is to "embed" the font inside a separate swf, load this swf from your main application and then register that font inside that swf aswell. This will allow you to do runtime loading of fonts. This will require you to either specify the font per language in the application or in whatever files you store the translations in, which perhaps isn't perfect, but neither is embedding all fonts in your main application. That would amount to possibly hundreds of kb of fonts loaded for no reason. This blog post has a good rundown of what you need to do to get it working. I have done this myself too, so if you're interested I can expand this post with some examples later.
