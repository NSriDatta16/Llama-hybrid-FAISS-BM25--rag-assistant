You could try line fitting prediction using linear regression and see how it goes, it would be fairly easy to implement in your language of choice. After you fitted a line to your data, you could calculate the mean standard deviation along the line. If the novel point is on the trend line +- the standard deviation, it should not be regarded as an abnormality. PCA is an other technique that comes to mind, when dealing with this type of data. You could also look in to unsuperviced learning . This is a machine learning technique that can be used to detect differences in larger data sets. Sounds like a fun problem! Good luck
