wordpress widget prob

I am using widgets in my wordpress theme and I need to remove the: that appears around the widget's content. I am using this in my function.php file: if (function_exists('register_sidebar')) register_sidebar(array('name'=>'Church Address', 'before_widget' => '', 'after_widget' => '', 'before_title' => ' ', 'after_title' => ' ', )); but I need to remove the div from around the text widget's body. Is there some way to do this? I also have another question. When I put let's say, a tag in the before_widget and a in the after_widget shouldn't it put a paragraph tag around the entire widget? Instead, it put them both before the entire widget.
