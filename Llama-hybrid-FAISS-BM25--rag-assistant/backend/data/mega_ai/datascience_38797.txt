Batch data before feed into CNN network

I am working on a project to classify CT scan images using the CNN model, the image size is huge and I want to feed it into the network using the idea of batches, tried doing that with this pieces of code: # train_data size = 5460 num_epochs = 14 batch_size = 390 batch = 0 print("Starting training...") for epoch in range(num_epochs): train_batch = train_data[batch:batch_size] batch += batch_size batch_size += batch_size ep_loss = 0 for data in train_batch: X = data[0] Y = data[1] _, c = sess.run([optimizer, cost], feed_dict={x_img: X, y_label: Y}) my questions are: 1- Is this a right way to do batching? or there is a better way? 2- with the above code I am using 'AdamOptimizer' is it a good optimization technique for the idea of batching or I should use another one?
