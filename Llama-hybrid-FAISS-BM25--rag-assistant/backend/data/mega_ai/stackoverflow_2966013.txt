#pragma once is non standard. If you're happy with the prospect of changing every single one of your header files when you discover your app or library won't build when you try to port it to a different platform, it's probably a good choice. Otherwise, stick with #ifndef/#define/#endif . Especially if you're building library code for other people to use.
