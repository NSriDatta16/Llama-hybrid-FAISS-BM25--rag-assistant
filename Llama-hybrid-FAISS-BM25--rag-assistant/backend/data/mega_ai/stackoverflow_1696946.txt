Simply put, cloud computing combines CPU virtualisation, software as a service, and utility computing. Utility computing refers to treating computing services as a utility that can be delivered like you would deliver water or gas. Easy to turn on, turn off, or increase the flow. This was enabled by effective CPU virtualisation, and the tools to manage these virtual CPUs in a zero-touch manner. Add on top of that, software as a service, and you have cloud computing. Some services are very barebones such as Amazon S3 storage, and others are more complex like salesforce.com CRM.
