Mark James Sewards MP (born 6 January 1990) is a British Labour Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament for Leeds South West and Morley since 2024. Early life Sewards studied at Morley High School and studied Law at the University of Leeds, where he was also elected as the University Union's Communications and Internal Affairs Officer. He later served as Head of Maths at a comprehensive school in Middleton, Leeds for eight years. Pre-parliamentary career Prior to his election as Member of Parliament, Sewards stood as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Harrogate and Knaresborough in 2017 and 2019 general elections, finishing third of four candidates on both occasions, with 20.1% and 9.6% of the vote respectively. He was elected as a Leeds City Councillor for Farnley and Wortley in 2022 until his resignation on 28 August 2024, following his election to the House of Commons on 4 July. Parliamentary career In August 2025, Sewards became the first British MP to create an AI version of himself, in order to interact with constituents. The move was met with a mixed reception, with Sewards' claim that it would allow him to be 'more efficient and more present' for his constituency countered by suggestions that the chatbot could create confusion and damage trust in politicians. Personal life His wife, Alice Smart, has served as a Labour councillor for Armley on Leeds City Council since 2014. The couple have two sons.
