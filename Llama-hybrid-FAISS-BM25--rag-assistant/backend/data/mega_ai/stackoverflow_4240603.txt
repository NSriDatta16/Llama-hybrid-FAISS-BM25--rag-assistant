Like so many questions asked on SO, this one is like "how long is a piece of string?" You can't say really say what's appropriate except if you consider the environment. For a read-only website, Jet/ACE can perform quite splendidly if you know what you're doing. Michael Kaplan's http://trigeminal.com is backed by a Jet database, but it's read-only. Back in its heyday, MichKa used to say he was getting 100K pageviews per day (or some number that was outrageously high, so far as I was concerned!). But with a read/write site, you wouldn't be able to support nearly as many users. That doesn't mean you could use Jet/ACE as the back end. If you have five users max, and it's an Intraweb app, you can be just fine with it. I wouldn't want to use it myself, but it's not going to be a problem with user populations that are appropriate for the Jet/ACE database engine to begin with, and particularly if you manage your connections properly. Jet/ACE works better with a single shared connection than it does with constant opening and closing of connections (because of the overhead of creating and recreating the LDB file), so you have to code against it differently than you would with your standard server-based database. Also, Michael Kaplan used to point out that via ADO/OLEDB, Jet was threadsafe, but via DAO, it was not. Use of ADO/OLEDB made it marginally acceptable as a back end for a web site, though I would tend not to choose it for anything other than a site that was very small or disposable, or where there were no options that were not outrageously expensive. But the key point is that there is no blanket statement that can be made here -- whether it will work reliably depends entirely on the specifics of the environment in which you're using it.
