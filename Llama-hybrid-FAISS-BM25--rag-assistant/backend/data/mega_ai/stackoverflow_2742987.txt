An ORM-tool isn't mandatory! Jon's advice is sensible, but I think using DataTables isn't ideal. If you're using an ORM tool, the object model is far simpler than a full-blown OO domain model. Moreover, Linq2Sql and Subsonic , for example, are straight-forward to use. Allowing very quick code changes when the database changes. You say you won't move the data around or process it a lot, but any amount of processing will be far easier in ORM objects rather than in DataTables. Again, if the application changes and more processing is required the DataTable solution will be fragile.
