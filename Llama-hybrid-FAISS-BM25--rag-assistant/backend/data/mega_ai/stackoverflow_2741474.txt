Compilers will let you specify on the command line (or a response/configuration file) the directories to search for header files. You can generally configure this in a makefile or IDE's project settings if you're driving a build using one of those tools. However, in general, I prefer to specify the relative path for headers that 'belong' to a project (as opposed to maybe libraries that are used across projects). That way when you add a new module, you don't have to muck around with project settings or make files to get things to continue to build. That's if you like to keep the header for a module along-side the module's implementation instead of having the headers piled into a single (or small set of) directories. Either organization is arguably as good as the other.
