This is not a good application of a bar plot. Tufte would not be pleased, even with the allegedly "Tufte`rized" bar plots recommended in another answer. Bar plots simply have too much ink used for the information conveyed. See Tufte's website and books, and if possible attend one of his seminars on how to display data effectively. Displaying these data requires no more than a line plot of turnout versus year. The line plot, with equal spacing of actual years along the x-axis, will also remove the implication contained in the bar plot that the observations are equally spaced in time. Here's an example that emphasizes the changes over the range of observed values: I find that the connecting lines between the points help to keep track of the time relationships, even though there are only 8, unequally spaced, observations. Nick Cox rightly noted in a comment that this might tend to suggest linear changes in between dates. The lines are gray, with black dots at the observations, in an attempt to de-emphasize such a suggestion. If you are more interested in changes with respect to a baseline of 0% turnout you could adjust the y-axis limits accordingly. But have you ever had anything close to 0% turnout for an election? Also, figures are not good places to show results down to 2 decimal places. For that, use a table. Code is all from R base graphics. You can probably do something more elegant with ggplot but I have little experience with that. First, change your "years" into numeric from text: dat$years Then for the plot: plot (freq~years,data=dat,xlim=c(1990,2016),xlab="Year",ylab="Percentage Turnout",type="l",axes=FALSE,col="gray") points (freq~years,data=dat,pch=19) axis(1,at=seq(1990,2020,10)) axis(2,at=seq(42,54,6)) Standard R graphics put a potentially distracting box around the entire plot, which is omitted here by the axes=FALSE specification, in the plot command that draws the gray lines. The points command then places the points. The separate specifications with axis allows control over where the tick marks are placed and labeled; R may tend to over-label a bit to some people's taste.
