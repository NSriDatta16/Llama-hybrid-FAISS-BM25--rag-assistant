There is an approach I use, but there is no UI support for it. You may find it a bit tedious for onsey-twosey uploads, but it saved me hours once for serious bulk uploads. The same WebDAV functionality that we get when using "Open with Windows Explorer" on a document library is available for a list. Say I have a list at http://myorg.com/sites/Widgets/Lists/MyList . I can open the list in Windows Explorer by going to the address \\myorg.com\sites\Widgets\Lists\MyList . Attachments are stored in the sub-folder Attachments , which contains folders with numeric names (1, 2, 3, ... and so on). The numbers correspond to the item ID of the list item. Pick (or create) a folder with the ID corresponding to the item you want to upload to, and it's drag-and-drop from there.
