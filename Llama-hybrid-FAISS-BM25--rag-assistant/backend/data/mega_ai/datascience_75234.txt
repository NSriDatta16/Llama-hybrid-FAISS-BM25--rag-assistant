No. The key to implementing neural networks easily and fast is having automatic differentiation . This is the key feature that allows programs using Python libraries like Pytorch or Tensorflow (and Keras ), to implement only the forward pass of a neural network and have the backward pass computed automatically. Octave does not have automatic differentiation. While Matlab's deep learning toolbox seems to include automatic differentiation, I think it is not included with Octave. And even if it were, the deep learning community is mainly focused on the Python ecosystem, and the rest of the environments like R or Matlab are paid almost no attention in comparison.
