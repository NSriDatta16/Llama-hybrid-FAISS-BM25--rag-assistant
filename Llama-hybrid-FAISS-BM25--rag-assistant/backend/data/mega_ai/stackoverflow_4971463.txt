HtmlHelper.Button(..., string onClickMethod, ...) HTML-encodes single-quotes!

I'm upgrading an old project from MVC 1.0 to MVC 3.0 (yes, it's that old), and I've run into an issue where calling HtmlHelper.Button(..., onClickMethod, ...) HTML-encodes single quotes into &#39; I can see how this would not be an issue if onClickMethod was just the name of a method to be called in javascript, however this is how we are using it: return helper.Button(name, buttonText, HtmlButtonType.Button, string.Format("window.location='{0}'", url)); which obviously is now broken. Is there any way to bypass this encoding? I can see hacking it by changing the return type of the method to string, and doing: return string.Format(helper.Button(name, buttonText, HtmlButtonType.Button, "window.location={0}").ToString(), "'" + url + "'"); but this is more or less a hack, and not elegant.
