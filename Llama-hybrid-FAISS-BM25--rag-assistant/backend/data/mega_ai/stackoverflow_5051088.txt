The jaxb libraries are included in java 1.6. You'll get all kinds of crazy classloader errors if you add the jar too. In this case, it looks like it xjc picked the wrong version of the jar. edit xjc should be bundled in the JDK, in your post you are using the xjc that comes in the jabx stand-alone pack. Go to the folder where you installed java 1.6, check that you have the xjc.exe or xjc.bat there and run it from that folder. And like Robert mentioned above, be sure that you're using Java 1.6
