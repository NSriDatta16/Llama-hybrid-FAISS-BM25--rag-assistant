The diagram (on the page you referred) shows what's the problem: The gradient will be pointing in the direction of the arrow, because the slope of the surface is steeper in South East direction, rather than North East where the bottom is. One way to see this is by looking at a hyperboloid $z=x^2+100y^2$ Let's take two partials: $$\frac \partial {\partial x}z=2x\\ \frac \partial {\partial y}z=200y\\$$ Let's see which direction the gradient is in the point (1,1). If it's what we want then it has to be along the line that goes through the origin, i.e. it must be (c,c), where c is a constant. This line is on the 45 degrees line, and goes through the origin. Here's what we got for our curve: $$\nabla z = (2,200) $$ It clearly point to a different direction, definitely not the 45 degree line. Actually, it's pointing almost vertically, because out curve is the steepest along y-axis. So, with a naive implementation of the steepest descent you can easily end up in a slow convergence, where your algorithm will be zig-zagging up and down while very slowly moving horizontally towards the minimum if the initial step size is too big. That's why at the very least you want to pay attention to the size of the step. Just for the sake of completeness the gradient at the same point for a circular contours such as $z=x^2+y^2$ is $\nabla z(1,1)=(2,2)$, i.e. the steepest descent direction goes through the origin.
