You either have to submit a form and process country selection differently (i.e. only updating form contents by returning a block) or try using ideas from FormFragment component and TriggerFragment mixin (probably you can't use them directly but you can try extending them to support select components). Personally, I go with first option - I have a "SubmitFormOnEvent" mixin and attach it to select-s in the form. Then I found that similar approach is demonstrated at http://jumpstart.doublenegative.com.au/jumpstart/examples/javascript/ajaxselect1 -> so you just can start with that example and update it to your needs.
