Creating synthetic data from existing data

I have data with 8 features and 900 rows each. Those features are dependent on each other in some way. I want to conduct machine learning, but the data size is small. I was suggested to generate synthetic data from the existing data considering those correlations between the features. What solution can be applied to this problem?
