Multiple imputation would provide a principled way for you to proceed. You make a collection of datasets each of which has the same known values but has separately imputed values for the missing data points. You analyze each of those datasets separately, then consolidate the analyses into a single result to provide means and confidence intervals of interest. Multiple imputation thus takes into account both the inherent variability and the additional variability added by the imputation. As you are already doing NN modeling for imputation and you are repeating NN on multiple bootstrap samples, if you separately impute the missing data for each bootstrapped data sample you might accomplish this all together. If that doesn't work in your case (for example, I'm not sure how you are bootstrapping these time series) you could alternatively consider the multiple-imputation and analysis-pooling facilities provided by the R mice package .
