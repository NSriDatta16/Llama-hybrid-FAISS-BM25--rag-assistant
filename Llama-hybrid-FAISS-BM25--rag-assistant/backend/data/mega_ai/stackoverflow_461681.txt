You have a couple of working answers already, but I'll add a little gratuitous advice: Using regular expressions for parsing is a road fraught with danger Edit: To be less cryptic: for all there power, flexibility and elegance, regular expression are not sufficiently expressive to describe any but the simplest grammars. Ther are adequate for the problem asked here, but are not a suitable replacement for state machine or recursive decent parsers if the input language become more complicated. SO, choosing to use RE for parsing input streams is a decision that should be made with care and with an eye towards the future.
