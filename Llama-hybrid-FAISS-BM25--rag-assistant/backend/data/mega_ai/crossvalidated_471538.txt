If $S_t \sim LogNormal (\mu, \sigma^2)$ . It is important to remember that a LogNormal distribution $\implies S_t > 0$ . Now by the definition of the Log Normal distribution: $\log S_t \sim Normal (\mu, \sigma^2)$ ; $\mu$ is the mean of $\log S_t$ and $\sigma^2$ is the volatility (variance) of $\log S_t$ . $\log(x)$ here is the natural log; $\log (x) = log_e(x) = \ln (x)$ . Notice how $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ but $ S_t > 0$ so automatically $\mu \neq E (X)$ . If you want to find $P(40 \leq S_{0.4} \leq 55)$ then we just apply the definition of the LogNormal: \begin{align} $P(40 \leq S_{0.4} \leq 55)$ & = P( \log 40 \leq \log S_{0.4} \leq \log 55) \\ &=P\left(\frac{\log 40 - \mu}{\sigma} \leq \frac{\log S_{0.4} - \mu}{\sigma} \leq \frac{\log 55 - \mu}{\sigma} \right)\\ &= P\left(Z \leq \frac{\log 55 - \mu}{\sigma}\right) - P\left(Z \leq \frac{\log 40 - \mu}{\sigma}\right) \end{align} where $Z\sim Normal(0,1)$ . This final probabilities can be found bey looking at e.g. z tables, provided you have $\mu$ and $\sigma$ . How to estimate $(\mu, \sigma)$ ? Well depends on your approach to statistics, but wikipedia explains quite well how to find the maximum likelihood estimates, provided you have obtained some data. You could take a Bayesian approach if you prefer.
