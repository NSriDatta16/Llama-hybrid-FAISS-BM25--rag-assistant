Using standard deviation to calculate Control Limits for Individual Control Chart

To compute the control limits using the 3 sigma rule, the standard deviation is usually approximated by the formula: $\sigma=\frac{\overline{MR}}{1.128}$ , where $\overline{MR}$ is the average of all the moving ranges of two observations, given by pattern: $\overline{MR}=\frac{\sum_{i=2}^{N}|x_{i}-x_{i-1}|}{N-1}$ $N$ is the number of observations (batches). Why do we calculate $\sigma$ such, not using the pattern: $\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}$ ?
