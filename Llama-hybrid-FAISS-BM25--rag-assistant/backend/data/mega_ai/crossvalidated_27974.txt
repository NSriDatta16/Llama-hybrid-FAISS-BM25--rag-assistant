Time-Series Data and Omitted Variable Bias

I understand that ,usually, time-series studies do not aim to provide a causal explanation of anything but rather aim to forecast. In which case it does make sense that most time series studies aren't concerned with omitted variable bias. However, I've come across a time series study that seeks to explain Soviet defense expenditures over a specific time period. The authors caution against using their model for forecasting purposes. Is it fair to say that omitted variable bias would be something we are concerned with in this specific case? Maybe the answer is obvious to most of you but just looking to verify my thoughts. Thanks!
