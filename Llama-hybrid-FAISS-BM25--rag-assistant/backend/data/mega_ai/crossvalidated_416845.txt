What neural network structure to use for multiple correlated time series predictions?

The specific scenario I have is this: I have a bunch of players playing a game in which they sequentially make choices that do not affect each other. I believe that each player has some patterns of choices that they have a tendency to follow, but also that there are patterns that all players follow. I have the data of the decisions that all player made at all time points. I also have auxiliary data on each player that could be helpful in predicting what choices the player is likely to make. For concreteness, as an example, suppose that the players are MLB pitchers, and they want to choose a pitching zone to throw the ball out. Each player is going to have his own pattern of throwing, but there are likely other patterns that I could get the machine to learn by looking at the data from the other players that could be used to help in predicting the current. I'm trying to train a neural network to try to predict a player's future decisions. What is a good ANN architecture to use? I think some sort of RNN would work best, but I don't know what design would work.
