Addition and concatenation are special cases of multiplication, where the weights are equal to 0 or 1. As a result, one can view using addition and concatenation as assumptions of what the network should be doing. E.g., in https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03475 , figure 1, we used concatenation to create the token emdeddings $e_i$ from the characters as we want to motivate the higher layers to consider the information from both the forward character-based RNN and the backward character-based RNN.
