Using jQuery to "highlight" content under cursor

I'm trying to write some jQuery code that will highlight the element the cursor is currently hovering over by adding a border around it. Here is the code I have so far: Hover Test $(function() { $("*:not(html, head, body)").hover( function () { $(this).css("border", "2px solid purple"); }, function () { $(this).css("border", "none"); }).click( function () { alert($(this).html()); }); }); This is paragraph one This is paragraph two The problem is when I hover over something like a paragraph in the example below it also highlights the parent tag in this case the div. Additionally, when I click on the paragraph it gives me the html of the p and then the html of the div, however, I only want the html in the p tag. Any suggestions on how to fix this?
