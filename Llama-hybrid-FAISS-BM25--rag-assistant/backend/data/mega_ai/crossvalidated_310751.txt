PCA tries to select orthogonal directions which capture maximum variance. I suspect the following is happening in your case, If your data is spatially uniformly distributed (that is if input data is simply set of all points point on the grid), then probably it can't find any best direction. In other words, if there's almost equal variation along each direction, then there's no way to rotate the grid to select directions which cover maximum variance.
