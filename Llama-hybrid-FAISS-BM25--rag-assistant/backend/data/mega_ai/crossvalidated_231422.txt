R - randomForest resample - replacement or not

I am studying the randomForest package to deal with an extremely imbalanced dataset (target: 98% vs 2%). I realize I can utilize parameters sampsize and strata to do Balanced Random Forest (downsizing). However, assuming I am taking 70% of the minor group and the same size of the major group as my sample size (e.g. sampsize = c(minorSize*0.7,minorSize*0.7)), should I do replacement = TRUE or FALSE?
