How do I approach this regression problem

I want to estimate a monthly released financial value between 0 and 150. To do so, I have lots of daily stock data. What would be a good way to use the information of the temporal evolution in my regression? I obviously could compute the average of all days in a month, but I would lose a lot of information. Lets say I'd use a NN for the regression (btw: is this a good idea?). How do I incorporate 30/31 different data vectors to predict a single value? I hope i made somewhat clear what my problem is. If not, let me know and I will try to edit my question. Thanks in advance
