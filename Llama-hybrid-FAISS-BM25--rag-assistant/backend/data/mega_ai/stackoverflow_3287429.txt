In case the user moves the touch beyond your range you should be setting the center of the joystick to the original center position, (probably 230, 408), i dont see that being done anywhere in your code. It is ok if you don't set anything in touches began, as you want to move the joystick only in if the touch is moved. Just check [touch view] == joystick in touches moved. You don't need to check for x and y separately as moving the joystick beyond the range in any direction should bring it back to the center. You need to animate the motion of the joystick returning to the original center else it wont look good. So, have the original center as a constant CGPoint. And in touches moved check for the distance between this center and the touch location. If it is beyond a range animate the joystick back to that original center. - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; //self.joyStickCenter is the defined original center CGPoint. if ([touch view] == self.joystickImageView) { CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.view]; if((fabs(location.x - self.joyStickCenter.x) 40.0) || (fabs(location.y - self.joyStickCenter.y) > 40.0)) { [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:nil]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.25f]; [self.joystickImageView setCenter:self.joyStickCenter]; [UIView commitAnimations]; return; } } }
