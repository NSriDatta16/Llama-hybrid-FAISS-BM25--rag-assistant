Logistic in Time Series Data

I want to use logistic regression, but my data are time series data. Every observation is a different day, and I have days consecutively for 20 years. I have three variables(the predictors) that are daily measurements in these 20 years. My dependent variable is if it snows or not that day. I cannot use Logistic regression because the data are not independent. I was thinking of generalized estimating equations, but the data are neither clustered nor longitudinal. Any idea?
