In your conf.py , there is the following paragraph (around line 57 in a conf.py created by sphinx-quickstart ): # The language for content autogenerated by Sphinx. Refer to documentation # for a list of supported languages. #language = None In my case, I changed it to: language = nl # bug! Which of course should be: language = 'nl' # don't forget the quotes :-) This will work for all Sphinx output; in my case, I only checked the html and latex output. On the Spinx website, there is list of supported languages .
