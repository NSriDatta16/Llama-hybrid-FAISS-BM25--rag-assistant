Relation between Nonparametric Statistics and Statistical Learning Theory

I used to hear some Statistics professor complaining about Machine Learning theories: "It is just Non-parametric Statistics". And, when I read Vapnik's book "Statistical Learning Theory", it seems he has been influenced a lot by non-parametric statistics. So, would anybody explain the similarity and difference between the two? My current guess (I am not familiar with the classic Nonparametric Statistics) is that Statistical Learning Theory cares much more about generalisation/prediction than Non-parametric Statistics?
