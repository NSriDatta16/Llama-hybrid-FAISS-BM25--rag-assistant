Impact of rounding a variable to the nearest unit

I have created composite variables after a factor analysis. The original variables were categorical (levels 1-7) and the composites were created by averaging the items loading into each factor. I decided to round the new variables resulting from the averages to the nearest units. It seemed logical, as the original variables were categories, I thought the resulting composite variable should also be categories. I am using these rounded variables as dependent variables in ANOVA's. Is the rounding a bad thing? Should I ditch it? Keep it? I couldn't find a clear answer on this elsewhere.
