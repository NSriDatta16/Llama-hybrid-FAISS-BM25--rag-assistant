How to account for participants in a study design?

I have a conceptual problem. I want to find out if stress during the day leads to (stronger) teeth grinding (bruxism) at night. I have a number of participants. They will fill in a self-report questionnaire rating their level of stress during the day. During the night, the durating and strength of their teeth grinding are measured electronically. Each participant will do this on a number of consecutive days. As a result I will have data in this form: participant stress_day_1 bruxism_night_1 stress_day_2 bruxism_night_2 1 5 8 1 3 ... What I'm usure about is wether I should take all the stress/bruxism value pairs and do my analysis on them, disregarding the fact that they come from different patients, or if I should calculate means for each patient and do my analysis on these means, or something else entirely. My variables are stress and bruxism, but I'm confused as to what place the participants should have in my analysis. I only have three nights, so cannot do a time series analysis. I would greatly appreciate any feedback. Also, please edit the tags as you see fit. I wasn't sure which ones to choose.
