When you click on the title bar, there's a brief pause while the window manager tries to determine whether or not you're clicking or beginning a drag (moving the window). If you're still holding down the button, then it's a drag: the window manager sets up its own message loop and pumps messages until you release the mouse. Your window should still be able to process messages, because they'll still be dispatched, but if your animation depends on a custom message loop then you'll be stuck 'till the modal drag loop ends. Work around it by triggering your animation in response to messages: a timer seems like a good choice to me.
