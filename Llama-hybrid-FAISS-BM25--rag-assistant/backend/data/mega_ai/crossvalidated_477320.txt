"Fixed" and "random" effects is terminology from frequentist models. In fact, it is not the best and not consistently used terminology. In frequentist statistics you are trying to find point estimates for the parameters, with the exception of random variables, where you want to learn about the distribution of those effects. In Bayesian statistics every parameter is treated as random variable and we want to learn about it's distribution, so there's no such distinction.
