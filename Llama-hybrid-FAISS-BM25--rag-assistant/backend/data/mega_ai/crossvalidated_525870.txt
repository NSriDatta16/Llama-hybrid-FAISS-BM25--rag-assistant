Negatives can be much easier than positives in this territory, and here are two: In principle and in practice, this distribution is not plausibly normal. The numerical skewness and kurtosis results are less emphatic than the clear graphical asymmetry on your plot and the fact that values must be positive, which constraint is biting hard. A variable that is positively skewed will tend to plot as convex down on a normal quantile plot. (FWIW, quantile plot or quantile-quantile plot is a much wider class than normal quantile plot.) It's a happy accident if data are close to a brand-name or named distribution, but the fit to any such can often be poor. One reason among several why fits can be disappointing is if any kind of heterogeneity is producing a mixture. Something like a volume I would expect to be closer to a gamma or lognormal, but my explorations were not especially encouraging. Just to show some results, I played with how far a square root, cube root or logarithmic scale might help. I see a slight edge to working with a cube root scale. It's suggestive if not definitive to mention that the cube root of a volume is simple dimensionally, as a length, and that, to a good approximation, the cube root of a gamma distribution is a normal distribution. At the same time, it seems likely that your objects have a minimum volume rather above zero. All that said, it's interesting if data are close to any named distribution, but contrary to myth normal distribution is an ideal condition (often mis-stated as an assumption) for methods only rarely.
