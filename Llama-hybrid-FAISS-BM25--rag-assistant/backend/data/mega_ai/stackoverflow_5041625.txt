Magento - importing images from a 3rd party XML file

I am wondering how I'd upload images from a 3rd party XML feed to use as a products images? I've seen the use of addImageToMediaGallery() but I am unsure what I'd need to do. My assumptions are: 1) I will need to download all the images to a folder from my XML feed 2) Pass the image path into the addImageToMediaGallery method and set the image, small_image and thumbnails 3) call this method Thanks
