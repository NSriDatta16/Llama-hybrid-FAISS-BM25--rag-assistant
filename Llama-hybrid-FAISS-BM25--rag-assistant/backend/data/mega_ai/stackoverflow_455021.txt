How to use a slowly changing dimension in Sql Server Analysis Services

In a data warehouse, I want to have a fact table which tracks certain metrics of a university application (average score on a standardized test, for example) and also the status of applications during different times of the year. For simpliciy, let's say a given application progresses through 3 states: New Being Assesssed Assessed and these states change over time. I believe I want to use a slowly changing dimension here, but I can't figure out how to get to work properly. Can someone give me an example of a fact table and dimension table which tracks two applications as they progress through these states? I'm using SQL Server Analysis Services 2005. The goal is to be able to do year on year analysis for the number of applications in each state.
