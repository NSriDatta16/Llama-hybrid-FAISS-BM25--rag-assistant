suse install rpm package with all depends to computer that has no internet connectivity

Before reading, please attention, my processor is 64-bit and so my oS is Suse_10 for 64 bit. I am trying to install wireshark on suse_10(64bit). The host does not have internet access. Therefore, I need to have all the files needed for installation; that is even the dependencies. This is to be able to install wireshark on a host with no internet connection. (Zypper, Yast would complain when no connection. It would try t go to net and find the dependencies.) Currently, when I execute the rpm command like 'rpm -i wireshark-devel-1.2.8-2.8.x86_64.rpm', of course I get the errors that say, briefly, dependencies needed. So, what I am looking for is the answer if I can make a "package" which has everything, and everything needed to be able to perform an flawless installation. And of course, if the answer is yes, could you please tell me how? I would really appreciate your help. Or, a friend talked about "aptoncd". This works for ubuntu. This software can make the package I want, if I understood my friend correctly. But, what software can I use for "suse_10". If I can find the software, I am thinking about to install a Suse_10 to my computer, and then using this program I would be able to make a package (that has everything needed in it). Then, I would take this package to the host that I am trying to install wireshark on. Can you please help? thank you in advance..
