Is the Dynamic Time Warping constraint Itakura Parallelogram based on series length?

I'm looking into the Itakura Parallelogram global constraint for Dynamic Time Warping. I am confused about the maximum width of the parallelogram, is it solely based on the length of the two time series being compared, or can it be varied to achieve a bigger or smaller warping window?
