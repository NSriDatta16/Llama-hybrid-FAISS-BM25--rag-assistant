How to show two data series are out-of-phase

I have two time series as shown below. Now I need to show that they are out-of-phase. The data here is ice volume in Antarctica (Red) and Greenland (Blue). I need to show that the glacial cycles are anti-phased, i.e. when Red is at peak, blue is at a trough. But the catch is they may not be exactly aligned. What is the best way to show the out-of-phase behaviour?
