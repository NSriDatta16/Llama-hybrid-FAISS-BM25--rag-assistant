I would concatenate them into a single input vector. Essentially, your model treats each latent variable from the word embedding as a single feature (think about a regular ML model). Adding a couple to the end of this wouldn't hurt your performance too much. Another option is to follow what @djstrong said, about multi-inputs. But I would start with just concatenating the extra variables at the end of your input vector.
