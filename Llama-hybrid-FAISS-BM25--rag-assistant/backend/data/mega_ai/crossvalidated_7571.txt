How to apply a Kalman filter to use both previous and future measurements of a random variable?

I'm trying to estimate the state of a Gaussian random walk with central tendency based on time series measurements with varying uncertainties. My random variable has the following form: $ \frac{d x}{d t} \equiv F(t) - \alpha x $ Where F is a Gaussian random variable. I've noticed that this problem is analogous to the velocity of a bubble experiencing Brownian motion. (See for example, F. Reif, Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics , p. 565). As a result of the $ -\alpha x $ term, the position has a central tendency (i.e. the variance does not become infinity as time approaches infinity). Now, like any good physicist, I know that I cannot exactly measure the value $x$ . The best I can do is to measure it at time $ t_i $ within some uncertainty, $ \sigma_i $ . Using a Kalman filter, I can estimate the value of $x$ from several measurements. Let's call that $ \hat x $ . The approach is as follows. For each measurement, we compute: $ \delta t = t_i - t_{i-1} $ $ P(t) = P(t_{i-1}) * e^{-\alpha\, \delta t} + \langle x^2 | \delta t \rangle $ $ K = {{P}\over{P + \sigma_i}} $ Our incoming est estimate of $x_i$ : $ \hat x_{i-} = \hat x_{i-1} \, e^{-\alpha\,\delta t} $ $ \hat x_i = \hat x_{i-} + K [x_{obs} - \hat x_{i-}] $ This works great for propagating our estimates forward in time. My question is: If I have measurements at times that span the time at which I want the best estimate, how do I compute an $\hat x(t) $ where $ t_i ?
