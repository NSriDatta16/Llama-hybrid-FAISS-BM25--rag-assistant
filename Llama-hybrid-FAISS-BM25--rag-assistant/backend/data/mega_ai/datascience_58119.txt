If anyone is looking for something that is more robust than MTCNN, try this but you need GPU with Cuda I believe. It says Tesla P40 on requirements but that is for training only. I could infer on new images with the provided parameters on a GTX 1080 with Cuda. It's called DSFD from Tencent in China. Their results on some well known benchmark datasets surpass MTCNN. I can concur that it detected the above-mentioned side faces (not profile but lying sideways). It is on Github: DSFD Tencent There is a demo.py where you can designate your own image as an arg on command line. If you figure out how to use this with CPU only, please let me know.
