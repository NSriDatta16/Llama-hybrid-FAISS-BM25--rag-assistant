Issues with JavaBeans Form

I have an assignment to use JavaBeans to create an online Banking application. I am trying to make the signup form but I am having some issues. When the form submits I am not able to get the values. The Form: Create An Account Personal Info First Name: Last Name: Address: City: State: Select A State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virgin Islands Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming Zip: Phone: Email: Login Info Username: Password: Reenter Password: The JSP page that the for submits to (its is short just for testing until I get it to work): Welcome! Thank you for creating a new account with JAC Bank! There is also a class called Customer that has a default constructor and a String getZip() and void setZip( String zip ) methods.
