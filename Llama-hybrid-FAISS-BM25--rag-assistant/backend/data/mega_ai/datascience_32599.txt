Why Self-Organizing Map (SOM) units are called neurons?

In the self-organizing map method, each of the output units is called neurons. But after reading the details about the algorithm, I could not find any logistic regression unit which is the neuron in a neural network architecture. I find it closer to the clustering algorithms like K-NN. Is there any explanation why SOM units are called neurons? And why is it linked to neural networks (while ANN does a completely different job i.e., classification) P.S.: In this paper ( https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6007170/ ), the SOM is called as an ANN. Here is a sentence from the abstract: the SOM is a type of artificial neural network that is trained using unsupervised data to produce a low-dimensional, discretized representation of an input space of training samples in a cell map.
