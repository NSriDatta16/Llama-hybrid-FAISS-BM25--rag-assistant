Is the Elo "rule of 400" a variation on EWMA?

tldr: The Elo rule looks like an ewma-style running average to me. Is that right? Details: The Elo rule of 400 ( here ) could be expressed this way: $$ rating_{N} = \frac{1}{N} \Sigma_{i=1}^{N}\left( r_i + sign\left(w_i \right)\cdot 400\right) $$ where $r_i$ is the rating of the ith opponent at time of play, $w_i$ is whether the game was won or lost, and $rating_N$ is the rating of the player of interest after the $N$ th game. With a little algebra this can be rephrased as: $$ rating_{N} = \frac{N-1}{N \cdot \left( N-1 \right) } \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \left(r_i + sign\left(w_i \right ) \cdot 400 \right ) + \frac{1}{N} \left(r_N + sign\left(w_N \right )\cdot 400 \right ) $$ or $$ rating_{N} = \frac{N-1}{N } \cdot rating_{N-1} + \frac{1}{N} \left(r_N + sign\left(w_N \right )\cdot 400 \right ) $$ Which is the EWMA running average operating on the opponents rating and whether the game was won or lost.
