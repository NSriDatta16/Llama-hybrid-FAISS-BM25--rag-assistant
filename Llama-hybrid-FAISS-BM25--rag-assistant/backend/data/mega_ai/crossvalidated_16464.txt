Average number of failures before success

By the title, you must instantly think that it's a geometric probability distribution (or perhaps binomial, by the story below) that I'm looking for, but my stats is failing me. Allow me to put this as a story: An office worker is given 13 phone numbers for technical support. Each phone number will reach one and only one support agent. Each agent specializes in their own field. The office worker has no idea which agent can answer which question in advance. When they have a query, they start phoning the numbers one by one, in some random, non-repeating order. They stop after they have reached the correct number. It is guaranteed that their query will be answered by only one support agent. What is the average number of calls the worker needs to make? I.e. what is the average number of failures before he has a single success? If I try with the geometric distribution, I have p = 1/13. The number of failures before a success is k = {0,1,2,3..12}, since there is a 1/13 chance that they will get success on the first trial. The mean is defined as (1-p)/p = 12. This translate into "The average number of calls the worker is expected to make is 12". This seems excessively high. Is this correct? Thank you.
