What are some "mainstream" lightweight alternatives to storing files in .csv format?

I'm on a project which heavily favors the use of .csv files for data storage. I see many issues with using .csv, especially for storing relational data. Parsing .csv is generally a pain , particularly when using ad-hoc column assigments. I've advocated the use of XML and minimal databases such as SQLite , but I'm looking for "faster, better, cheaper" alternatives. What are some other, "mainstream" lightweight alternatives to .csv files? Also, what about CouchDB . How does it compare to SQLite in terms of lightweight-ness? EDIT: I missed it. This question has been asked before .
