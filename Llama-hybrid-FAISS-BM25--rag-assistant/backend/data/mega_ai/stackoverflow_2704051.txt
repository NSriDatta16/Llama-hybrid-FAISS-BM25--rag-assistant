WPF - TextChangedEventArgs being fired twice, and when can e.Changes be greather than 1?

TextChangedEventArgs is being fired twice in my RichTextBox control. Is this normal? Also, when will e.Changes (you know the TextChangedEventArgs) be > 1. The only case I can think of is someone pasting content into it. But other times it seems in normal typing a person can really only change 1 paragraph right?
