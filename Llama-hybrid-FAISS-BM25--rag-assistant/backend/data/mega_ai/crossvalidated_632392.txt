Strange interaction term estimate in a logistic regression with a large class imbalance between exposure groups. How to interpret?

EDIT 2 In reply to one of the commenters, here is the 2x2x2 table. Y = 1 : Y = 0. X = 1 X = 0 M = 1 9 : 73 3 : 29 M = 0 34 : 245 1,214 : 21,204 EDIT 1 In my attempts to make things simpler when posting this question, I've made things more complicated. Here are the actual values. X = 1 X = 0 Y = 1 43 1,217 Y = 0 318 21,233 X = 1 X = 0 M = 1 100 49 M = 0 331 26,748 M = 1 M = 0 Y = 1 12 1,248 Y = 0 102 21,449 $Y = X$ -> OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.5, 2.9) $Y = M$ -> OR 2.6 (95% CI: 1.5, 4.5) $Y = X + M$ -> OR_X 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.7); OR_M 1.7 (95% CI 0.9, 3.1) $Y = X * M$ -> OR_X 2.2 (95% CI: 1.5, 3.1); OR_M 4.4 (95% CI 1.8, 9.4); OR_interact 0.2 (0.06, 0.7) For only subgroup of only $X = 1$ , $Y = M$ -> OR 0.9 (95% CI: 0.3, 1.9) For only subgroup of only $X = 0$ , $Y = M$ -> OR 4.4 (95% CI: 1.8, 9.4) These logistic models were all weighted using survey sampling weights. I have a group of about $27,000$ people, $431$ of whom had an exposure $X$ (binary), the rest did not. $149$ used a certain medication $M$ (binary), most of whom ( $100$ ) were people who also had exposure $X$ . About $1,260$ people had outcome $Y$ (binary), including $43$ people who had $X = 1$ and $1,217$ % people who had $X = 0$ . $4,347$ datapoints for $Y$ were NA. I'm fitting a logistic regression $Y = X + M$ . $X$ has a significant OR ( $1.9$ ) at an alpha of $.05$ , but $M$ is insignificant ( $1.7$ ). When I test $Y = X * M$ , $X$ has a higher OR ( $2.2$ ), still significant, and $M$ now has a much larger OR ( $4.4$ ), this time significant. The interaction term is significant, with an OR of $0.2$ . I'm really surprised seeing the OR for the interaction term. My knowledge of the field pushes me to think something is wrong, as I would've expected the OR of the interaction term to be either above $1$ or not statistically significant. My question is as follows: could this interaction term be the result of an imbalance between my two exposure groups? Does the fact that most people who took M were also people with exposure X matter? When I test $Y = M$ in only the $X = 1$ group, $M$ has a non-significant OR. When I test $Y = M$ in only the $X = 0$ group, $M$ has a large, significant OR. Should I even be testing for interaction when my exposure groups have such different sizes?
