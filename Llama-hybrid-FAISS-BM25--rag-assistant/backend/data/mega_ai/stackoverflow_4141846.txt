jquery Draggable DIV with slider inside

Spent a few hours trying on Google and trying myself but no avail. What I am doing is creating a DIV and making it draggable. And adding a slider inside it in order to rotate image. Creating DIV and making it draggeable and adding slider is all done on the fly. What I am doing basically is clicking on an arrow tool and it clones arrow tool inside a container and making it draggeable and adding a slider at the same time. Result would look something like this below. The problem is the slider is draggable inside the DIV. How can I make DIV draggable but still have slider to work normally? New solution Yes, I did figure it out and decided to do another solution using SHIFT key to do rotation. I was able to use http://www.elated.com/articles/smooth-rotatable-images-css3-jquery/ solution and now I can simply rotate images using SHIFT key while moving mouse. Much simpler than slider and works great!
