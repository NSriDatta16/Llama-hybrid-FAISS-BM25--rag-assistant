First Question For standard GLMs, the null distributions of the standardized coefficients are taken to be asymptotically $N(0,1)$ aka $t_{inf}$ . Normally the significance of these linear models is computed from a $t_\nu$ distribution, but I suppose for consistent outputs, it makes sense to also just set the degrees of freedom for GLMs at infinity. Second Question You have specified the following model: $$ E[log(Y_i)]=\beta_0+\beta_{Year}x_{Year}+\beta_{Loc}x_{Loc} $$ Suppose you ask to compute the expected value at Location i, then the above reduces to this: $$ E[log(Y_i)|Loc=Loc_i]=\beta_0+\beta_{Year}x_{Year}+\beta_{Loc_i} $$ However, you want the marginalized means, so you need to compute the following, where you marginalize out over the remaining variables: $$ E[E[log(Y_i)|Loc=Loc_i]]=E[\beta_0]+\beta_{Year}E[x_{Year}]+\beta_{Loc_i} $$ So then your observed marginal mean should be $\beta_0+\beta_{Year}\hat{x}_{Year}+\beta_{Loc_i}$ , where $\hat{x}_{Year}$ is the average value of the years. So, the marginal means yields an estimate at the average year value.
