What are good sites or blogs for statistical analysis case studies?

I'm NOT looking for articles that focus on presenting R/Python libraries or how-tos on new/cool/advanced techniques or "data science". I AM looking for articles that show how classical, established statistical analysis techniques, such as regression analysis or ANOVA, are used in demographics, politics, psychology, medicine, climatology or any other field. Background for question: I'm a data scientist with a computer science background, trying to learn how to think like a classical statistician. The techniques themselves I can find in any book on statistics, but I want to understand how these techniques are used in practice.
