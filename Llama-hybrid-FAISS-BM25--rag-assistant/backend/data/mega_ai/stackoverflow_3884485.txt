Starting javascript function due to URL Link in "Browser"

I'm using wininet to get the sourcecode from some homepages, afterwards I analyse that for some information. I use VB in Excel to do that. All of this is working fine, but now I want to get information from a special page. I have to open this page and click a link to go to the side with the wanted information. My problem is, that this link is a javascript function. So my question: is it possible to open a side and start the javascript function due to a URL? I use following VB Function: 'API-Deklarationen: Private Declare Sub InternetCloseHandle Lib "wininet.dll" ( _ ByVal hInet As Long) Private Declare Function InternetOpenA Lib "wininet.dll" ( _ ByVal sAgent As String, ByVal lAccessType As Long, _ ByVal sProxyName As String, ByVal sProxyBypass As String, _ ByVal lFlags As Long) As Long Private Declare Function InternetOpenUrlA Lib "wininet.dll" ( _ ByVal hOpen As Long, ByVal sUrl As String, _ ByVal sHeaders As String, ByVal lLength As Long, _ ByVal lFlags As Long, ByVal lContext As Long) As Long Private Declare Sub InternetReadFile Lib "wininet.dll" ( _ ByVal hFile As Long, ByVal sBuffer As String, _ ByVal lNumBytesToRead As Long, lNumberOfBytesRead As Long) 'Enumeration für Internet: Public Enum InternetOpenType IOTPreconfig = 0 IOTDirect = 1 IOTProxy = 3 End Enum Public s As String Public Function OpenURL( _ ByVal URL As String, _ Optional ByVal OpenType As InternetOpenType = IOTPreconfig _ ) As String Const INET_RELOAD = &H80000000 Dim hInet As Long Dim hURL As Long Dim Buffer As String * 2048 Dim Bytes As Long 'Inet-Connection öffnen: hInet = InternetOpenA( _ "VB-Tec:INET", OpenType, _ vbNullString, vbNullString, 0) hURL = InternetOpenUrlA( _ hInet, URL, vbNullString, 0, INET_RELOAD, 0) 'Daten sammeln: Do InternetReadFile hURL, Buffer, Len(Buffer), Bytes If Bytes = 0 Then Exit Do OpenURL = OpenURL & Left$(Buffer, Bytes) Loop 'Inet-Connection schließen: InternetCloseHandle hURL InternetCloseHandle hInet End Function
