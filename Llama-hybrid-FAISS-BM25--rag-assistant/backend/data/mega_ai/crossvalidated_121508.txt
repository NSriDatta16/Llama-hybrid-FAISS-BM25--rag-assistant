Residuals vs fitted - there should be no strong patterns (mild patterns are not a problem, see @gung's answer) and no outliers, residuals should be randomly distributed around zero. Normal Q-Q - residuals should go around the diagonal line, i.e. should be normally distributed (see wiki for Q-Q plot ). This plot helps checking if they are approximately normal. Scale-location - as you can see, on Y axis there are also residuals (like in Residuals vs fitted plot), but they are scaled, so it's similar to (1), but in some cases it works better. Residuals vs Leverage -- it helps to diagnose outlying cases. As in previous plots, outlying cases are numbered, but on this plot if there are any cases that are very different from the rest of the data they are plotted below thin red lines (check wiki on Cook's distance ). Read more on assumptions of regression as in many aspects there are similar (e.g. here , or tutorial on regression in R here ).
