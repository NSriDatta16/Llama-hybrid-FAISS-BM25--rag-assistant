I think it depends on what you want to do. Looking at your example from finance, it seems to me as if you want to estimate your total return (in euro or dollar) for a portfolio, using an estimated percentage return on a sample. Let's say you have a sample of securities with values $v_i$, and returns $r_i$, $i=1, 2, \dots n$, so the rates of return are $rr_i=\frac{r_i}{v_i}$. This is a sample of your whole portfolio of size $N$. The total value of your portfolio is $V=\sum_{i=1}^N v_i$. The total return of the portfolio (in euro or dollar) is $R=\sum_{i=1}^N r_i$. Your goal is to estimate the rate of return of the whole portfolio $\frac{R}{V}$, using only information from the sample. In this case you can estimate the rate of return $\widehat{rr}$ from the sample in two different ways: Mean of the returns in the sample : $\widehat{rr}^{(1)}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n rr_i$ (this is what you do in the example) the second option is to use $\widehat{rr}^{(2)}=\frac{\bar{r}}{\bar{v}} $, (where $\bar{r}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n r_i$ and $\bar{v}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n v_i$) or the ratio of the average return (in euro) in the sample and the average value in the sample. It can be shown that both estimators are biased estimators for $\frac{R}{V}$, but that the bias of the second one is smaller (see this link ) So the less biased estimate of the return of your portfolio is $\hat{R}=\frac{\bar{r}}{\bar{v}} V$. The one you talk about is the first one, so the one with the highest bias. There is a whole theory on this, you should google for ''ratio estimator'' or ''ratio of means versus mean of ratios''. I found an example at this link EDIT because of your comment below: first of all, you asked for a reference, follow this link the sample average $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n rr_i$ is an unbiased estimator of the population mean ratio $\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N rr_i$ (note the $n$ for the sample and $N$ for the population). However, and as I said at the beginning of my answer, it depends on what you want to do. (a) if you want to estimate the mean population ratio, then you can use the sample average, (b) but you seem to look for a rate of return that you can estimate from your sample and that you want to use to estimate the rate of return for the whole portfolio. If you know the whole portfolio then its total value is $V=\sum_{i=1}^N v_i$ and its total (euro-) return $R=\sum_{i=1}^N r_i$. Note that I use $N$ so it is about the population. This means also that the population mean value is $\mu_v = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N v_i$ and the population mean return (in euro) is $\mu_r = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N r_i$. On the other hand, the rate of return for the population is $\frac{R}{V}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N r_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N v_i}$ which is obviously equal to $\frac{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N r_i}{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N v_i}$ which is equal to $\frac{\mu_r}{\mu_v}$, or the population rate of return is equal to the population mean return in euro divided by the population mean value. Hence the idea to use $\frac{\bar{r}}{\bar{v}}$ as an estimator for the population rate of return. So if you want to estimate the rate of return of the whole portfolio then it is better to use the ratio of the averages. If you want to estimate the mean of the individual securities' rate of return then it is better to use the average of the returns.
