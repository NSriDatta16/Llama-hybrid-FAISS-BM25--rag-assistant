Are there any methods of testing how well a Gaussian Process fits your data?

Are there any methods of testing how well a Gaussian Process fits your data? I have been looking online and can not seem to find any statistical metrics that measure how well a Gaussian Process (Classification or Regression) fits your data. The only thing which comes to mind is use Cross Validation (e.g. K-Fold, Leave One Out Cross Validation). For example: Split your data into 70-30 train-test Fit a Gaussian Process on the train set See how well the Gaussian Process performs on the test set (e.g. MSE, F-Score) Record the performance Repeat the first 3 steps many times and average the performance from each iteration. Doing this would (in my opinion) would allow you to assess the Bias-Variance Tradeoff and Overfitting of the Gaussian Process Model. But apart from Cross Validation: Are there any methods of testing how well a Gaussian Process fits your data? Thanks!
