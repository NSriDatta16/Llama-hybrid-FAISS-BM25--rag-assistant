I think what you are looking for is the android telephony manager. http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html Checkout the getNeighboringCellInfo() method The getNeighboringCellInfo() method is dependant on the phone model on some phones it works and on some it doesnt. It seems this an area where you will feel the pain of android fragmentation. I hope it works for you..
