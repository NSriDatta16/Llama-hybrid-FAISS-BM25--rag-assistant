Not to discourage you, but I think you would get more out of embedding something like Squirrel or Lua into your project and learning to use the API and the language itself. The upside of this is that you'll have good performance without having to think about the implementation. Implementing scripting languages (even basic ones) from scratch is quite a task, especially when you haven't done one before.
