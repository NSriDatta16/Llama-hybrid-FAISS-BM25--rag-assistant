The answers can be made numeric for analysis purposes, example: RespondentID IsSelected Q1AnsA Q1AnsB Q1AnsC Q1AnsD Q2AnsA... 12345 1 0 0 1 0 0 Use association analysis to see if there are patterns in the answers. Q3AnsC + Q8AnsB -> IsSelected Use classification (such as logistic regression or a decision tree) to model how users are selected. Use clustering. Are there distinct groups of respondents? In what ways are they different? Use the "elbow" or scree method to determine the number of clusters. Do you have other info about the respondents, such as demographics? Pivot table would be good in that case. Is there missing data? Are there patterns in the way that people skipped questions?
