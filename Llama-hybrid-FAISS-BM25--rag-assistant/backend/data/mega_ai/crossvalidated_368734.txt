Where to start: own simulations on logistic regression. Hosmer-Lemeshow, Farrington, Pearson Chi-Square

I'd like to run my own simulations on the logistic regression model. I want to test on different grouping strategies, spare data and strategies for combined small groups. I read a lot of papers by Hosmer and Lemeshow refering to logistic regression. Even further papers by Ku√ü, Allison, Paul, McGullgh etc. Now I'd like to check some results by my own simulations. Problem is, I don't have much experiences with simulations. Can I run my simulations on R ?`Is there a better application (SPSS, MATLAB, Python, ... ?) Is there a guide for such simulations?
