Check out YSlow's documentation. YSlow is a plugin for Firebug, the amazing Firefox web development plugin. There is lots of good info on a number of ways to speed up your page loads, one of which is using one or more subdomains to encourage the browser to do more parallel object loads. One thing I've done on two Django sites is to use a custom template tag to create pseudo-paths to images, css, etc. The path contains the time-last-modified as a pseudo directory. This path component is stripped out by an Apache .htaccess mod_rewrite rule. The object is then given a 10 year time-to-live (ExpiresDefault "now plus 10 years") so the browser will only load it once. If the object changes, the pseudo path changes and the browser will fetch the updated object.
