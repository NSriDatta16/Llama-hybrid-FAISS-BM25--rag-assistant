performing PCA first before logistic regression

I am reading this: https://towardsdatascience.com/pca-using-python-scikit-learn-e653f8989e60 This is performing PCA before performing a logistic regression (in Python). I am not fluent in Python (I am using Matlab). My questions are regarding the mathematical side of the process being performed. I have taken the pca of my data sets, and found that I have 95% of the variability in the first three principal components. I do not understand (from the link above) what is being trained/what is being done to the original data to train the logistic regression. Here are my specific questions: Given that my first three principal components account for 95% of the variability of the data, what do I do with it? Do I transform the data? How do I use the loadings to train the logistic regression? Can someone please give a mathematical supplement/lecture regarding this procedure? Thanks
