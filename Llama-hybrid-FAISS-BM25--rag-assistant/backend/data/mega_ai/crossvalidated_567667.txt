Apply machine learning to predict discharging and risk of readmission based on medical data

I am new to machine learning. I have a problem where I have to predict patients to be/not to be discharged using hospital data and depending on that prediction (i.e. if the patient is successfully discharged), I have to predict the risk of those patients being readmitted. I have created the feature set but the target class is missing from original dataset. I have provided a snapshot of the feature set. How to apply machine learning solution to this problem as one output will be used in the prediction of another output? Please help.
