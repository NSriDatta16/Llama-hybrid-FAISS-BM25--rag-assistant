If the predictor variable that you are interested in ("X25" in this case) varies both between and within units (that is, it varies "at level 1" in multilevel model parlance), then yes, the procedure you described can make sense. This is in fact exactly the procedure that Bafumi and Gelman ( LINK ) describe when discussing the problem of fitting multilevel models where the group effects are correlated with one or more of the predictors. Another paper I recently found that I think is very helpful in explaining these issues can be found HERE . Although both of these papers are primarily concerned with solving a particular statistical problem that you did not specifically bring up here, the point in bringing them to your attention is both to point out that fitting models like the one you described can indeed be a sensible thing to do, and also to direct you to some information on interpreting the resulting parameter estimates (see in particular the second paper on this point).
