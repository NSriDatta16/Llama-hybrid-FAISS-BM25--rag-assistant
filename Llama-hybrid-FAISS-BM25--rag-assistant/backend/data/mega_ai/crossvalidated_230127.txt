scaling up an SVM classifier

I am working on a problem of trying to classify materials using image data. I have tried several classifiers and have ended up that an SVM with a non-linear kernel gives me the best results up to now. My problem is that when I create a training/testing set for e.g. 10 materials, everything works fine. When I am trying to create a training/testing set for e.g. 25 materials, classification accuracy drops dramatically. Could you propose any solution to this problem? Thanks!
