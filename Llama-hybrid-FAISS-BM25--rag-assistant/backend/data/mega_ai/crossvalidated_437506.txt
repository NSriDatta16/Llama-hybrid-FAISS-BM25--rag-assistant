Need help understanding logistic regression output with seemingly contradictory results after swapping reference group

Some background, each of these predictors are 0, 1 one-hot-encoded categories that represent items in a basket (think e-commerce). Each observation can have multiple 1s. For instance, a single observation can have both x1 and x2 and x3, and not purchase x4, or any other items, resulting in a vector such as (1,1,1,0,0,0,0). The aim is to find the odds of Y occurring when purchasing X1,X2,X3 etc. I have the following logistic regression odds, where X1 is the reference group: | - | pvalue | odds | |-----------|---------|---------| | X2 | 0 | 1.58781 | | X3 | 0 | 1.37795 | | X4 | 0 | 1.31701 | | X5 | 0.00038 | 1.05357 | | X6 | 0.00583 | 0.95571 | | X7 | 0 | 0.5504 | | INTERCEPT | 0 | 0.45808 | Based on this, my interpretation could include something such as "Compared to X1, X2 has 1.58 times the odds of the outcome" However, if I switch the reference group to X2 I get the following: | - | pvalue | odds | |-----------|---------|---------| | X3 | 0 | 1.46834 | | X4 | 0 | 1.34498 | | X1 | 0 | 1.2982 | | X5 | 0 | 1.12634 | | X6 | 0 | 0.57685 | | X7 | 0.47621 | 1.01191 | | INTERCEPT | 0 | 0.43695 | Now I can say something such as, "Compared to X2, X1 has 1.29 times the odds of the outcome". However, I feel like this contradicts the results, because when X1 is the reference group I also get an increased odds...I would expect by swapping the reference groups, I would get odds that are less than 1 for X1. Why would something like this occur?
