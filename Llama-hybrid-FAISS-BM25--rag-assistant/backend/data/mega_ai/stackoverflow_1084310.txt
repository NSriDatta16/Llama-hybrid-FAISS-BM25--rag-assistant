Want to make use of a DB without installing a DB engine in .NET

There is a small enhancement I'm adding to an application. It would be nice to provide the user with the ability to filter and sort without having to write a lot of code that's already implemented in a database engine. However, I cannot justify installing a full database environment for this small piece of functionality. I did have an implementation that was using the Jet engine against a CSV file. That provided me the query capabilities I needed. However, that (the Jet engine) does not work on Vista 64. I have read that there are workarounds, but implementing workarounds increases the likelihood that you'll be less portable and I want to avoid that. If I want the full query capabilities of a database engine, even if I'm querying against a CSV file, am I stuck with installing it on every user's machine? The application is currently xcopyable and doesn't leave a footprint after it's deleted and I'd like to keep it that way. As I was writing this, and XML file and XPath came to mind, but I don't think that will be the most elegant solution for this problem. XPath is slow, the file would get to be huge, and I'd like to have multiple concurrency handled for me. I ask so much.
