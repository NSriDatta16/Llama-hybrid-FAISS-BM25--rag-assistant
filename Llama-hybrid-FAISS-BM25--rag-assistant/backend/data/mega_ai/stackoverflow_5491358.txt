You can't use ´longjmp´ to exit from an asynchronous event like a timer. It is only designed to save and restore registers and the stack pointer that are saved by the normal calling-convention. Side note: Consider using the volatile keyword on your local variables, as specified in 7.13.2.1: All accessible objects have values, and all other components of the abstract machine have state, as of the time the longjmp function was called, except that the values of objects of automatic storage duration that are local to the function containing the invocation of the corresponding setjmp macro that do not have volatile -qualified type and have been changed between the setjmp invocation and longjmp call are indeterminate.
