Folder for 3rd party controls in Team Foundation Server 2008 source control

I am setting up a new TFS 2008 Server that we are going to migrate to (from VSS) and I am trying to layout the source control repository. Having read the question How do you organize your version control repository? I am trying to organise my folders in a similar way. I want to create a top level folder called 3rd Party Tools or similar but from the Source Control Explorer it seems I cannot create a folder at the top level such as $/3rd Party Do I really have to create a new Team Project for this? Is there a blank template I can use rather than having to pick from the built-in Agile or CMMI templates?
