How do I create drag-and-drop Strawberry Perl programs?

I've got a Strawberry Perl program that accepts a single-file as a command-line argument. How can I set things up such that I can drag and drop the desired file onto the Strawberry Perl program (or a wrapper around it) and the program runs with that file's name as an argument?
