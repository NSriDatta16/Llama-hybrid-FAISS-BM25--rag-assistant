Whenever I have some cross-browser issues I think about markup first, then code. I'd suggest to run a validation (http://validator.w3.org/) and see what you find.. Also, if possible, attach part of your html markup so we can test it as well - nothing like team debugging :) wait, I just noticed the div is empty, that means you must have used css to position the gif (background image?), please attach the relevant styling as well edit: OK, I took the liberty to fix the errors jslint pointed out (even meaningless semicolons) and forked it to a new jsFiddle . Notice how i stacked most of the js in 1 place. Also, chrome should have a built-in "debugger" like firebug in firefox, maybe you can see the errors that comes up there as well. Lastly, I know this is probably annoying to hear, but I really do suggest seperating styling, js code markup completely for better readability, and please try w3 validator
