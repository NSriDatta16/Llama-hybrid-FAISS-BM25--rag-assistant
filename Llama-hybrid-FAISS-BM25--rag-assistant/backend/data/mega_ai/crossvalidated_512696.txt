What is the exact accuracy score for k-fold cross validation?

In my sentiment analysis work ı have used k fold cross validation, and ı got below results precision recall f1-score support 0 0.906 0.916 0.911 878 1 0.865 0.845 0.855 1142 2 0.849 0.864 0.857 950 accuracy 0.872 2970 macro avg 0.873 0.875 0.874 2970 weighted avg 0.872 0.872 0.872 2970 val-accuracy for each fold [0.7805452709525412, 0.8114478114478114, 0.8454545454545455, 0.8494949494949495, 0.8720538720538721] average val-accuracy 0.8317992898807439 I wonder that what is my model accuracy, ı got 87 for last fold but ı got only about 70s when ı tested my model with unseen data. I think when we test with unseen ı am getting results like first fold. For kfold cross validation after first fold the model knows every data, because of that reason at second or third... fold we got more accuracy,am ı true? ıf ı am true kfold doesnt increse accuracy
