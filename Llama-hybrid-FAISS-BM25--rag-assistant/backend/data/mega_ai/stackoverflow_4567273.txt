sorl-thumbnail 10+ is very different from version 3.2.5-. It will require you to rewrite everything that uses sorl-thumbnail if you want to upgrade. However difficult and time consuming this might seem, its usually not such a big job. I have upgraded from the old version to new in numerous projects, some of them very big and ut has been a pretty simple and fairly quick job. Most of all, it has been worth it considering the new features with storage support, quality images using pgmagick and easy admin integration just to name a few. As mentioned the other route is probably to use easy-thumbnail which still has alot in common with the old sorl-thumbnail.
