I took out the nested loop to make it clearer for me and stuck the prior for delta in its own loop, giving this for mu : delta[i] -> delta[id[r]] note the explicit id vector for municipalities that is as long as the data which I've labelled 'id' I think that's the biggest change I made? Model below (also some extras in case you want to include them). require(rjags) y Edit: Included full script. My version seems to be more consistent with lmer and MCMCglmm. So I'm not so sure what the difference is between your nested loop for the municipality level intercept and my method of doing it. Did you model your code from somewhere? I would also consider weakening the priors, unless you have a strong reason for them.
