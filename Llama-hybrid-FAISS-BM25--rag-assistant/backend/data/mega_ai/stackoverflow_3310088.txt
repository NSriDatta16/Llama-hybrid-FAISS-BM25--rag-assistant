To store some databases on the NFS mounted drive, just mount it as say 'test' in your storage location on your server and append 'test/' as a prefix to all databases that you want on your mounted storage instead of on your local. If the NFS goes down you should still be able to extract the data from the databases that are stored on your local machine (if you mount it as described above). CouchDB stores your databases as JSON-files on your HDD, so you can just access the database files and open them as long as you have access to the storage.
