As described elsewhere Time Series Forecasting with Daily Data: ARIMA with regressor daily data presents complications to some automated procedures and opportunities to others. I used AUTOBOX http://www.autobox.com/cms/ ( a commercial piece of software expressly designed and funded by major US beverages/retailers ) to extract information from the data that I have helped develop,. Apparently our monkeys/heuristics are up to this task as it was totally autonatic. A picture is worth a thousand words. Here is a graph of the actual/fit and forecast which I believe suggests a reasonable model/approach. The final model included ( no surprise here) two different trends, daily effects, monthly effects , particular days of the month effects, long weekend effects , a few unusual values , very significant pre and post holiday effects along with major end-of-the-year effects . Specifically the forecasts for the next 365 days is interesting The residuals from the final model exhibited reasonable stability All models are wrong and some are even wronger (sic) . EDIT AFTER @forecaster comments... This is an excerpt from the equation . .The size of the coefficients for the daily effects are small compared to the holiday effects which is why you are not seeing a strong day-of-the-week profile in the forecasts. EDIT: DELIVERING FORECASTING ACCURACIES FOR MY NINJA BADGE I developed models/forecasts from 6 origins for a 30 day out forecast and reported the MAPE. There were 1338 original observations thus the forecast origins were 1308,1278,1248,1218,1188 and 1158 respectively.
