I would suggest that each project have a dependencies folder that contains the appropriate dlls that are required for each project. When a project that is depended upon is built it would be up to you to automatically update the dll in the dependencies folder or not via your build process (cruise control/nant/msbuild?). However, I would also give some consideration around deploying versions of the depended upon dll just in case you blow up the dependent projects usage of that dll. It would suck for someone to update their project (the depended on project), kick off a build, deploy their build output to the dependent project) only to break the project that relies on their code base. That sounds like a fragile way of managing dependencies.
