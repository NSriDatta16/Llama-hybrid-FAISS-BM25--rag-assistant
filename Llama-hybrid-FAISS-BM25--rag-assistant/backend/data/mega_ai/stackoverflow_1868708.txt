How do you tell if a key exists for an object using Key-Value Coding?

I'd like to test whether an object has a writeable @property in the iPhone SDK. One possible way of doing this is to check the -valueForKey: method, but that seems rather inelegant! Example: @try { id *value = [instance valueForKey:@"myProperty"]; } @catch (NSException * e) { // Key did not exist } Is there a better way of doing this?
