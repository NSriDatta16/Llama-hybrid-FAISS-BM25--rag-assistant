jQuery realtime form validation

I am currently using $.blur(fn();) for form validation, but this only takes effect when the form field loses focus. Is there a way of doing it on keypress to get realtime validation? I suppose I could do the 'poll all fields every second' approach, but I am sure there must be a more elegant way?
