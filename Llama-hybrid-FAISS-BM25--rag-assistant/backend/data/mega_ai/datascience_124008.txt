My opinionated answer is I don't see much point in having multiple LSTMs. I would map all categorical features to an embedding. For the numerical features, I would use a MLP to map them to a vector of the same size as your embeddings. Then cat all those together into a sequence of embeddings and send that to a single LSTM layer.
