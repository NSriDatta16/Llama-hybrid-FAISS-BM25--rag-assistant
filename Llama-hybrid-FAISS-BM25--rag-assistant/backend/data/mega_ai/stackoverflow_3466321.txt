Draggable UIImgeView Rotation

I have a UIImageView object that I rotate with frame property and CFAffineTransformMakeRotate and then I want ot move it with moving origin of its frame, but my image moves and reshape strangly. @implementation TimberView (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { // Retrieve the touch point CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; startLocation = pt; [[self superview] bringSubviewToFront:self]; } (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { // Move relative to the original touch point CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; CGRect frame = [self frame]; frame.origin.x += pt.x - startLocation.x; frame.origin.y += pt.y - startLocation.y; [self setFrame:frame]; } The TimberView class is a subclass of UIImageView
