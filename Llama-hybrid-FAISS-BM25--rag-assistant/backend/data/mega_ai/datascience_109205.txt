In order to see whether one single attention head is enough, we can simply try it. This is precisely what it's done in the article "Are Sixteen Heads Really Better than One?" (publised at NeurIPS'2019). The authors conclude that, for some tasks, having multiple heads is needed especially at training time, while at inference time is it possible to prune a number of heads (depending on the task) without significant performance loss.
