No, you cannot embed an Android app into a webpage and have it work like the app. However, if you write and organize your code in a modular fashion (lookup Model-View-Controller design patterns), then you should be able to reuse A LOT of your code making it easier to create a new Applet-based interface. It's not a drop-in solution, but it should get you 80% of the way there.
