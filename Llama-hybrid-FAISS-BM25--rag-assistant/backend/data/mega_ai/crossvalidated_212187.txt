It sounds like your researchers already gave you a weight to the original target population. My guess is that you're using a program like SPSS, and you want to use the weight given to you by these researchers, but you want your observations to sum to 1,730 and not to 50,000. That's not unusual at all. This is what is often called 'normalizing' your weights. To do this, just divide each weight by the average weight. The new weight will sum to 1,730. To your three specific questions: Yes, it's okay. But you're not "weighting back to the original target population." You're just scaling the same weight (i.e. using a different denominator). If you want to go back to the original sample (without the weights), then just turn them off. Divide each individual weight by the average weight for the total sample. If you're in SPSS, do this by going to Data -> Aggregate. If you're working with percent estimates, nothing much will change. The caveat is that if you have a design effect greater than 1 (you probably do), then your "effective sample size" is probably less than 1,730. But to work this out, you'd have to go back to whoever did the original weighting for you; there's not enough information here for me to work this out. What it means is that you're probably going to underestimate your variance with whatever weight you use (normed or otherwise), unless you're using a complex samples design (like with the 'complex samples module' in SPSS or the 'survey' package in R). And yes, you're results are still generalizable to the total population even after you've rescaled your weight. Estimate the percent of people who drink Pepsi, multiply this by 50,000 and that is the number of people in the total population who drink Pepsi.
