Don't worry about 100% code coverage. Just get as close as you reasonably can. Attaining 100% code coverage is a waste of time. All that matters is that you are confident in your tests covering the code that needs to be covered. You can have a solid set of tests that only cover 70% of your code. Your best tests likely only cover a few lines, but they are the ones that will prevent most of the bugs. They are the 'edge case tests'. The ones that without them, the other tests are useless. Your entire test suite is useless, as they are the cases that test the mistakes that would typically keep getting reintroduced into code base if they didn't exist.
