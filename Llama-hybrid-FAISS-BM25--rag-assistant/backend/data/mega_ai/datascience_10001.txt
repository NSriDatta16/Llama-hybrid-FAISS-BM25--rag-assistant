In several subfields, some were simply called analysts . If you go back earlier in time, in a pre-science era, I tend to believe that people involved in divination or astrology (several of them because they were paid for that, much more than for serious science) were precursors. On a lighter note, I like the neologism dedomenology (in French, dédoménologie ), and I tend to consider that Hugo Steinhaus (the inventor of $k$-means) was, due to his interest in many applied fields, one of the first to spark the fire of data science.
