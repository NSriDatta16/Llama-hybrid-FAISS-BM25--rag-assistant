You can do CCA if you want to attribute variation just to the factors of the study (PCA just condenses species information to fewer axes but can be followed up with multiple regression on the resulting axes). The answer to the second question depends on the point of your study: interested in the overall variability in invasive spp community structure or species-specific responses?
