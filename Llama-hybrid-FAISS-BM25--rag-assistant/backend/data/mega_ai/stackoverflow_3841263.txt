Yes, Magento would be well suited for this, assuming you hire a developer who knows what they're doing . The only way I'd recommend the from scratch build is if you have a client who has deep pockets and wants to go along on that ride. Magento's architecture was built, from the ground up, to allow users to make these kind of modifications without hacking on core code. From a high level you would build a Module (module actually means something in Magento talk, it's not just a generic term) that would insert an event listener (or override a code method) that would, at some point in the checkout process, collect up information about the order and pass it on to the next system. The problem you're going to run into isn't one of code, it's one of culture. For all its object oriented architecture, Magento is still implemented in PHP. That means ambitious but inexperienced developers (both offshore and onshore) are going to find it easier to hack on the core source to get the results they want out of the system. Its always faster to get results this way, at the cost of long term stability.
