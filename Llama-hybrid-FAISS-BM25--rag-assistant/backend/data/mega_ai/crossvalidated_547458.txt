What is the name for this metric?

I have been using the metric shown below for a while, in a power forecasting context. We call it WAPE (Weighted Average Percentege Error , but I have never seen any references in papers, just some questionable like blogs : $WAPE = 100 \cdot \frac{\sum_i |y_i - \hat{y_i}|}{\sum_i y_i}$ where $y_I$ defines de observed value and $\hat{y_i}$ the predicted one. Is there any name for it? Exist any reliable publication or reference? EDIT Found an entry on Wikipedia with this metric, named Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error (wMAPE) : $$ wMAPE = \frac{\sum_i |y_i - \hat{y_i}|}{\sum_i y_i} $$
