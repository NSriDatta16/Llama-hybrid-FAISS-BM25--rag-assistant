Custom trained model in Azure ML

I have a predictive model which I trained on a training set. I have written it in R. Now I want to deploy it as a web service so anyone can just input the data into it and get the output from the predictive model. I wanted to use Azure ML for deploying. I wanted to know whether I can drag and drop my already created/custom trained model to Azure ML studio instead of re-training it there ? I know we can train and save models in AML Studio but I am not sure about adding already created models and using them in AML solution. Help regarding this will be appreciated.
