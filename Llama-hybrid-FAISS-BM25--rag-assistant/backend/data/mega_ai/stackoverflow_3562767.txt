Moving from C# to C++

I'm a slightly-below average programmer in C#, and I only write apps with GUIs. I might be getting a Mac soon. Since there isn't the .NET Framework or Visual Studio on Mac, I'm going to be using Xcode and Cocoa. I think this will be a good opportunity to switch to a well known and well supported language (C++). I learned C# very easily without knowing C, so I'm hoping that C++ will be the same. I also want to learn Java. What do you suggest I do? Can I write apps with GUIs in C++ and Java? (can i do this with the tools included with xcode?). Do you reccomend any books/sites that will help? Thanks, David
