Classifier or regression for binary system?

Lets say you want to create a random forest model that predicts whether a user will click on your search engine ad. Lets say the training data set marks the independent variable (i.e. whether the user clicked or not) as a 0 if it's a miss, and a 1 if it's a hit. Should this type of model be a classifier or a regression model? Or can it be either? Background I am trying this both ways, and I am finding that in the classifier version of this model, the model predicts a miss nearly every time. I'm not sure if there is a problem in the way I've defined the model, or if this is by design, because for a given data point, if you repeated that data point 100 times it might only be a hit 10% of the time, even for the likely-to-be-a-hit data points. In other words, there is almost no single point where the user is actually likely to click on the ad, so I think that maybe given that the probability is always less than 0.5, the model is simply predicting a miss every time
