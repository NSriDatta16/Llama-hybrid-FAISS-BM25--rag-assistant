I apologize if this isn't a full answer but here's what I found so far: Short Answer: It depends on what you're using in their api. Long Answer: According to sklearn's svm documentation , they use the libsvm library for implementing their classifiers for SVC and NuSVC. For those cases, it is based on top of libsvm which is implemented using this paper . The paper is long so I won't summarize it but you should read it for further understanding. For other implementations, they have the CalibratedClassifierCV . You can read their source code for it here if you'd like their exact implementation. (Hint: Hold Ctrl and click a method to see its implementation. Some mice have a button to go back a page on their side if you'd like to back out too) I hope this helps!
