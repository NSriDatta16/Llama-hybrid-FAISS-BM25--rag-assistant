As I see this transformation is similar to a uniform transformation, $\frac{x-\min_x}{\max_x-\min_x}$. the only bit that is added to this transformation is replacing $\min_x$ with $\mu$ in the numerator and the goal is getting zero mean, $\mathbb{E}X_{norm}=0$. Maybe you can find some references in machine learning journals(but I am not completely sure)
