How to Forecast Non-Numeric Data

Is it possible to include non-numeric data in logistic regression i.e. education level and occupation? This is a dataset for kaggle credit card approval prediction . I can create IDs to represent the education level i.e. 1 for higher eduction, 2 for secondary, etc. but I'm not sure if it would give me reliable results. I'm just learning.
