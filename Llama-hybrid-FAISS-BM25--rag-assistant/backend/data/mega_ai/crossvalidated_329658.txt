Is a Chow test appropriate for this intervention analysis?

I am fairly new to R was wondering if this approach was appropriate. Sorry if I forget anything in my question. I have long-form panel data for 15 years (2001-2015) for hundreds of counties and corresponding BEA linecode data for each of these counties (i.e., personal income, employment, etc). For each county, I have known intervention times (some have multiple) that occur sometime between 2001-2015. I need to test whether or not the intervention had a significant effect after it was implemented in the simplest way possible. After researching intervention analysis extensively, I thought that I would try using ARIMA to forecast what the data would look like after the intervention and determine whether the difference between the forecasted values and the actual values were statistically significant. If I had only a few counties, I could manually review each one and determine the best arima model, whether or not there was autocorrelation, account for stationary/non stationary data, however, because I have so many counties to analyze, I abandoned the forecasting approach. I am now using the Chow test (see link 1 below) because I think I can apply this to all my counties? I settled on this method because I know the intervention periods and if I sort each county by when the intervention occurred, I can run a loop to analyze all counties that have an intervention in point=8, (2008), then point=9 for example. I will provide sample data below. CHOW TEST EXAMPLE: Comparing slopes in a time series following an intervention Using Wald test to compare: Method for quantifying intervention effect in time series DATA : I first started by using a subset of one county (Essex County in NJ) and one line code (linecode 10 of table ca30, personal income). This particular county has an intervention in 2012. X I used the Chow test sctest(Y~X,type="Chow",point=12) and the summary gave me Chow test data: Y ~ X F = 5.1536, p-value = 0.02635 Signifying that in 2012, there was a structural change in the data. Would using this method be appropriate for the rest of my data? Keep in mind I wouldn't be able to manually examine every county BEA combo. My next step, if this test is appropriate, would be to write some sort of loop that runs through every county, each linecode of importance, determines the year of intervention, runs the chow test for that county/linecode combo and specific year. I think I would need to ask another question about the loop because I have no experience writing loops but my thought process is that the loop would need to be subsetting each county/linecode combo to be able to isolate the chow test for that specific county/linecode.
