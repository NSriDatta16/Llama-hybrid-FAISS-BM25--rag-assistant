All CCWeb views have a storage stored at the CCRC server (which in turn communicates with the VOB server). That differs from classic ClearCase views, where the view storage is either on the user's computer, or in a close View Storage server. Since the clients using CCRC cannot always directly access that view storage (on the CCRC server), it needs "local" view storage, which are defined within the CCWeb view, with the .copyarea.dat and a .copyarea.db directories. Since you are not the first to getting rid of those directories (.db and .dat), CCRC 7.1 now allows for .dat directory to be restaured , allowing then ClearCase to reassess the status of each file, keeping relevant information in the .db storage directory.
