The mean would be totally acceptable. Some people like to think that it doesn't make sense because the distance between two values (e.g. 2 - 3 vs. 4 - 5) are not necessarily homogeneous. Those aren't the kinds of issues that keep me awake at night. Another option is to consider proportions of top-box responses. In survey design, you can look at the binomial outcome of getting a 5 or 4 or above as Y/N indicators of achieving a desired level of satisfaction. You would easily be able to cluster within sets of questions by taking the average number of top-box responses. A 100% here would indicate that the trainer achieved top-box responses on all questions whereas 66% indicates that 4 out of 6 achieved satisfactory levels.
