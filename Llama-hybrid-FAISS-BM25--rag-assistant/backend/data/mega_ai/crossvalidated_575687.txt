Bayesian model comparison with systematic error

Two parameters $(x,y)$ were measured for 3 different objects, wielding the following results: $$\{ (x,y) \}= \{ (1,3), (3,5), (5,9) \}$$ Knowing that the error in the estimation of the values $y$ is described by a normal probability distribution: $p(y|x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt {2 \pi}} exp \left ( - \frac{(y-f(x))^2}{2} \right )$ , where $f(x)$ represents the expected value for $y$ , which can be calculated two in different models: Model 1: $f_1(x)=2 x$ Model 2: $f_2 (x,\theta)= x + \theta$ where $\theta$ is assumed to be an unknown parameter that can vary between $[1,5]$ . Calculate the probability associated with each model and determine which is more likely. Then, consider the there is a systematic error associated with the estimation of $y$ that can reach a maximum amplitude of $10%$ . Assuming the prior distribution for this error is uniform, explain how the probabilities for each model would change. The first part of the exercise, I understand. In this scenario, $p(y|x)$ is essentially the likelihood probability distribution for $y$ , then, in both models, and since we know the measurements are independent from each other, I can determine the probability associated with each model by computing the "total" likelihood, that is, the product of the individual likelihoods: $$p(M_i)= \prod_{D} \frac{1}{\sqrt {2 \pi}} exp \left ( - \frac{(y-f_i(x))^2}{2} \right )$$ for model 1 and, for model 2, since there is an extra unknown parameter, $\theta$ , the final probability is found by marginalizing the "total likelihood" described above over this variable (in practice, by integrating it over all possible values of $\theta$ ). What I don't understand is how we then take into account the existence of the error in $y$ . My first thought was to consider the systematic error as a new parameter which can vary between $0$ and $10%$ , and marginalize each of this parameter as well, but I really don't know if this is correct. Does anyone know how this could be solved?
