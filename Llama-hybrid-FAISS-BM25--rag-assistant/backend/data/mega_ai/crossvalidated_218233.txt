A suitable repeated measures (with something like a random timepoint with depth a random effect nested within timepoint) would account for multiple measurements at the same time and at different times being from the same animal. So, yes, depth would needs to also have a random effect associated with it, because the assessments in the same animal at different times and depths are presumably all to some extent correlated. If you do not have any missing data at any of these combinations, then looking at a set of data with one record from each animal (but never more than one record from the same animal) with ANCOVA should give more or less the same result as an equivalent repeated measures model that has all key interactions (such as pre-treatment value by timepoint by depth, treatment by timepoint by depth etc.), main effects (treatment, timepoint, depth and pre-treatment value), an unstructured covariance matrix (or unstructured combined with unstructured, if you treat the timepoint and depth as nested) and an appropriate calculation of the denominator degrees of freedom (e.g. Kenward-Rogers). If you have some missing assessments, then using a repeated measures model will do an implicit data imputation for you under a missing at random assumption. Once you are combining multiple depth measurements from the same animal at different times, or different depth at the same time, or different depths across times for the same animal, you would be violating the assumption of independence of residuals and any standard ANOVA/ANCOVA/linear regression would be invalid. The effect would be an inappropriate exaggeration of how much evidence you have, which is avoided by a repeated measures model. This all works nicely for discrete times and depths. Averaging over some time interval seems a plausible thing to do, if the time intervals are sensibly chosen - e.g. so that not much of a change beyond a bit of random fluctuation should occur during an interval (and if there is important changes e.g. during the course of a day, then you either split the day into sensibly small intervals or take the whole day so that you have a whole cycle). Of course there are also options (even more complicated) that would use the continuously collected data.
