searching on the net there are two common ways of achieving this. My favorite though is in PHP its just so clean? wow. :D In PHP you can write and in javascript you can write var agent = navigator.userAgent; var isIphone = ((agent.indexOf('iPhone') != -1) || (agent.indexOf('iPod') != -1)) ; if (isIphone) { window.location.href = 'http://www.yourwebsite.com/phone'; } Hope that helps.
