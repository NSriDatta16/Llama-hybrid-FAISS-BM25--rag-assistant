Some sites, like MySpace, don't want users connecting through a proxy, so they go to lengths to detect this. By default, CGIProxy, does add any header to make it detectable. An easy way to check your http headers is to visit http://www.ioerror.us/ip/headers . The usual method to detect this sort of thing is for a bit of client side Javascript to inspect the URL of the page it's on, and send that to the server. Using nph-proxy.cgi I'm able to visit Myspace without any such redirections. Other methods are for detection include embedding a Flash or Java object on the page, and having that object attempt to connect to a hard coded server.
