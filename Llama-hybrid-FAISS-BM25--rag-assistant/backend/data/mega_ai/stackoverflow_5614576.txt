Build and Archive for TestFlight produces big question mark

I'm using TestFlight to get beta users to test my iPhone app. I've never done this before and so I'm a bit concerned with the process. I've been following these steps to create my .ipa , but after step 3 I see lots of question marks in the organiser window (next to the name of my app to be specific). Should I be concerned. It seemed as if everything else worked.
