I don't know about embedding Tomcat, but you can embed a servlet container inside your application using embedded Jetty . If what you want is to add an HTTP interface to an existing server, I think that's the way to go. It also should be perfectly workable to launch your server's TCP listening components from a standard servlet in Tomcat. Then the servlet can call methods in your existing application directly, while it continues to listen to its usual TCP ports. A third option is to write a servlet that just talks to your existing server in the same way other clients do.
