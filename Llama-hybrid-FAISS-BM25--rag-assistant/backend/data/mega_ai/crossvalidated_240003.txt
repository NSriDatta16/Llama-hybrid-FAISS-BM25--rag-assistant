Consider the size of the rolling window and the weighting scheme as hyperparameters for the model. Perform a grid search on different combinations and you'll find the answer. Basically, you have to find the balance between over-fitting for smaller windows/more aggressive weighting and bias due to "irrelevancy" of the sample for longer windows due to structural changes within. It depends on the stationarity of your time series data. In my practice, the longer the train window, the better OOS performance.
