I'm not familiar with DHR models, however in general for choosing between two different models, it's up to a test on the performance. You state that DHR is doing a little better - however not how you measure that. So starting from the measurement I would recommend taking a look Evaluating point forecast accuracy in Forecasting: Principle and Practice . Depending on your use case you might also want to have a look at time series cross-validation . Also, good way to ensure your models are appropriate is to validate them against a benchmark Final point: if your models perform similarly, you should favor the simpler model - see more here Green, Kesten & Armstrong, J..
