File structure for PHP-based website

I'm building a PHP-based web app for the first time and I haven't found anything to pattern it after. At this point I'm mostly curious about how the files should be arranged into directories so that development of the website can be manageable. This includes javascript scripts, images, stylesheets, cgi scripts, html files, pure php files that define common functions, etc. Question: Can someone point me to an explanation about how such a website is typically organized on the server?
