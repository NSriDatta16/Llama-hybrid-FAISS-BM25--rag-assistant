As far as i know the samples are generated independently. That would be very inefficient. So random.sample draws a number in the interval $[0, 620]$ and moves on to the next index. Because the probabilities of drawing a certain character are independent the probability of repeating a character, i.e. $..., 10, 10, ...$ is $\frac{1}{620} \frac{1}{620}$, which is very low. The chance of generating two consecutive samples that are equal, e.g. $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ two times is $\frac{1}{620^9} \frac{1}{620^9}$ which is even lower . So there are $620^9$ combinations which means that on average the same combinations occurs after $620^9$ trials. However, the chance is very low but it could happen faster. As i said, its on average , because it's a random process.
