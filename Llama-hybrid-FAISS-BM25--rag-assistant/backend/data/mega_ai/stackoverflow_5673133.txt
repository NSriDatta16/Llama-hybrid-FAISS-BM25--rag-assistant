Scrolling the image by dragging the mouse

I have the image that scroll when i used the horizontal and vertical scroll bars. But I want to scroll the image by dragging it like in Photoshop (using hand tool and exploring through the zoomed image). Is there any way to do in such way in Visual Basic 6.0? I have changed the default cursor of the mouse to the hand cursor. Now i just want to scroll by dragging the image.
