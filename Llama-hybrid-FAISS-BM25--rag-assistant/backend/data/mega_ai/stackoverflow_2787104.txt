The documentation says Context.openFileInput either returns an inputStream (file found) or throws a FileNotFoundException (not found) http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#openFileInput(java.lang.String) So it looks like the exception is your "test". You could also try using standard java.io.File file = new java.io.File(PATHTOYOURCONTEXT , FILE); if (file.exists()) { FileInputStream fIn = new FileInputStream(file); } But that is not recommended. Context.openFileInput() and Context.openFileOutput() make sure you stay in your applications storage context on the device, and that all of your files get deleted when your app gets uninstalled.
