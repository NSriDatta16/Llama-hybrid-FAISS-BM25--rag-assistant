You'll lose sessions not just when your website is recompiled, but also when the IIS worker process is recycled. Technically, that can happen at any time (there are ways to minimise it, but I prefer to architect applications that can survive worker process recycles anyway), so if sessions are important then you really do need to be storing them out-of-process. ASP.NET comes with a built-in "state server" which is just a windows service that stores session state. Another option is to use the SQL Server session state storage. A lot of people will tell you that storing session state in SQL Server is a performance problem, but I disagree: losing sessions due to process recycles is more of a concern than the performance of SQL Server. Besidess the ASP.NET state server is faster if that's what you really need (and if you want to survive power cycles you could even write a custom provider that stores state in a NoSQL database!)
