Identify original features corresponding to high singular/principal component values

In MATLAB, while SVD gives a diagonal matrix S of decreasing singular values, PCA gives a column vector LATENT of decreasing principal component values. How can S be used to obtain a subset of original features that best describe the data? How can LATENT be used to obtain a subset of original features that best describe the data? NOTE: QR decomposition in MATLAB gives a permutation vector E which enables the above.
