Adding more information to Magento packingslip or Invoice PDF

How can i add additional information to the Magento Packingslip PDF. I am using integrated label paper, so i would like to add repeat the customers delivery address at the footer and also, some details like total quantity of items in the order and the cost of the items in the order. I am currently modifying local files in: Mage/Sales/Model/Order/Pdf/ but I have only managed to change to font. EDIT: Okay, i have made good progress and added most of the information i need, however, i have now stumbled across a problem.. I would like to get the total weight of all items in each order and Quantity. I am using this code in the shipment.php: Under the foreach (This is useful in case an order has a split delivery - as you can have one order with multiple "shipments" So this is why I have the code after here: foreach ($shipment->getAllItems() as $item){ if ($item->getOrderItem()->getParentItem()) { continue; ... then I have this further down: $shippingweight=0; $shippingweight= $item->getWeight()*$item->getQty(); $page->drawText($shippingweight . Mage::helper('sales'), $x, $y, 'UTF-8'); This is great for Row totals. But not for the whole shipment. What I need to do is have this bit of code "added up" for each item in the shipment to create the total Weight of the whole shipment. It is very important that I only have the total of the shipment - not the order as I will be splitting shipments.
