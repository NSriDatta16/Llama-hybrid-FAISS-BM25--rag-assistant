Actually there is at least one security issue. Suppose your applet: Is signed Has debugging code left in its main method that does something potentially dangerous like write to a file Then an attacker can create a Java Web Start application descriptor that points to your .jar file and launches your main method with full privileges. This specific attack can be defended against by adding an empty file called JNLPâ€‘INF/APPLICATION.JNLP to your .jar file. But there may be other possible attacks, so I think your professor is right to avoid it.
