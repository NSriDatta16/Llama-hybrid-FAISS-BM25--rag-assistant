I never heard the term before, but quick googling leads to papers by Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011a, 2011b) on "Bayesian persuasion", who define it as follows (p. 10 in the linked pdf to the 2011a paper): A distribution of posteriors is Bayes-plausible if the expected posterior probability of each state equals its prior probability: $$ \int \mu d\tau(\mu) = \mu_0. $$ So the name seems to be chosen to be self-explanatory: a Bayesian choosing informative prior would expect the posterior to be close to the prior (otherwise, why would he choose the obviously wrong prior ?). Such outcome would be the most plausible for the Bayesian before seeing the data. It does not imply that "on receiving no new informations, other than $\mu_t$, you can anticipate the new distribution to average to the current information you have", it simply defines the kind of distributions that follow this property as "Bayes-plausible". So if distribution is Bayes-plausible, then it follows this property by definition. More precisely: it seems that it's not a property of any particular disruption, but rather of a prior-posterior pair. It is not my area of expertise, but you can see the original papers for more details on game-theoretic implications and further discussion. Kamenica, E., & Gentzkow, M. (2011a). Bayesian persuasion.
