Have you tried a Negative Binomial distribution or a zero-inflated Poisson? These distributions are often used to take care of overdispersion. You have been suggested below a Weibull distribution, which may fit the data but it is not appropriate for count data. A Weibull is a distribution for continuous measurements, and not for discrete data. Negative Binomial distributions are routinely used for RNAseq and Microbiome data, among other types of data. So are the zero-inflated Poisson distribution. They are standard tools and are easily implemented in R packages See Cameron-Trivedi (2013, Regression Analysis of Count Data). Now, there are also Discrete Weibull distributions, but they are not so much used. See the R package "DiscreteWeibull" and related manuscripts. The negative binomial fit above is similar to the Weibull and it is more appropriate, since it takes into account the nature of the data. If you really wanna be flexible, mixtures of Poisson-Gamma may help you to capture overdispersion in a Bayesian fit. They are of course not trivial. But if the question is about fitting the data, then all the options should be proposed. Now, your data show that histogram because there are probably bumps at the right end of the x-axis. No parametric model can capture those bumps correctly. That's why I was suggesting mixtures of parametric models. And in such case, the Bayesian fit is probably the way to go. The right model depends of course on the objective of your inference, which is not clear from your question.
