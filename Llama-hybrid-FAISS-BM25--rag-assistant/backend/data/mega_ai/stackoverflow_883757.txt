SubSonic Multiple column primary key

we have certain tables where we have multiple columns which together make the primary key. When SubSonic generates all it's classes for our tables for the tables with multiple columns there are still methods, like FetchByID, that only use one value for the primary key. Because of this the foreign key property will return the wrong items. For instance we have a product table that has a primary key of multiple columns. A class with a relation to the product table will have a product property with the get method like : Product.FetchByID(this.SalesOrganisationID). This should be Product.FetchByID(this.SalesOrganisationID, this.ProductID). Does anyone have any advice for me about what i should do to make SubSonic work with these kind of primary keys?
