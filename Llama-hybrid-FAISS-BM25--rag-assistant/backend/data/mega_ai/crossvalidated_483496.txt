Selection of variables based on clinical knowledge in multiple logistic regression

Dear Cross Validated community, I am conducting a multiple logistic regression for a case-control study. There are too many predictors to be investigated. My question is "Can I choose which predictors to be included in the regression model based on clinical knowledge of the consultant PI in the research team instead of selecting them based on univariate statistical significance?" I believe selecting variables based on their statistical significance in a univariate analysis test is biased. What are other options to considered?
