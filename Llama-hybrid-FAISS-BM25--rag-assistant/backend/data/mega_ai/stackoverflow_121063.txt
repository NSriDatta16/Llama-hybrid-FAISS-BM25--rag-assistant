Why can't VS2008 place an exception helper popup onto a secondary monitor?

I've recently acquired a second monitor and now run VS2008 SP1 maximized on my secondary (and bigger) monitor. This theoretically has the benefit of opening the application under development on the primary monitor, where -- as it seems to me -- all newly started applications go. So far, so good. The problem though is now, that the exception helper popup is not opened on the secondary monitor. Even worse, it is only shown when the Studio window is far enough on the primary monitor! If I drag the studio with an opened exception helper from the primary to the secondary monitor, the helper is dragged with the window until it hits the border between the two monitors, where it suddenly disappears . Has somebody experienced this too? Is there any workaround? Anything else I should try?
