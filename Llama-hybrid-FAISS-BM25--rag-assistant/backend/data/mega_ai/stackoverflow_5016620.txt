How to make WIX installer adapt to the version of Windows Installer available - like the Hyperlink control

Windows Installer 5 added support for the Hyperlink control which I would like to utilize if available. I cannot set a dependency towards Windows Installer 5 (doesn't support WinXP), but I would like my installer to be able to utilize the hyperlink control if Windows Installer 5 is available when running the installer. How do you manage to do this? Conditional imports of fragment files based on the versionMsi property? A Google code search or regular Google search didn't reveal many samples.
