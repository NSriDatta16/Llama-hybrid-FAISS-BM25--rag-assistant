Can I use binary variables in VAR? How to interpret the IRF?

I am trying to forecast a time series based on other monthly time series variables. The variables are: endog -> number of users; exog -> marketing campaigns(in euros), Number of Updates, number of partners, Google Search views and Release(binary). I found that the VAR model is a good approach to do that. However, one of the variables is a binary variable. Not sure about the impact of this variable on the model. In order to avoid non stationary variables, the transformation for all the time series variables (except the binary) is just the difference of the variable on time T with the variable on T-1. is that Ok? Finally. In order to interprete the result of the VAR I am using the IRF, however, the interpretation is not clear for me. Any suggestion on the steps that I took?
