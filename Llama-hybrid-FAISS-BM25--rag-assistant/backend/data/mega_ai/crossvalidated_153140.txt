Have you tried using Statistical Process Control rules (e.g. Western Electric http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Electric_rules )? I use them for time series data - often with a touch of intuition about the data - to assess whether the data is going somewhere I don't want it to go. Like your example, these rules say if the delta / change is consistent over several data points, it flags that there may be an issue. Also Statistical Process Control (SPC) can be good for working out if you are getting better or worse than before. One issue with SPC is that much of it relies on a normal distribution which probably doesn't suit your data which can't go below zero. Others better than I with SPC can suggest options here. I like using it to flag an issue but, like all models, is best used with a grain of knowledge about the data itself (and source).
