Jon Waltman http://bitbucket.org/jonwaltman/sphinx-info has forked sphinx and written a texinfo builder, it can build the python documentation (I've yet done it). It seems that it will be merged soon into sphinx. Here's the quick links for the downloads (temporary): http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1276730/python.info http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1276730/python.texi Steps to generate python doc in texinfo format: Download the python source code Download and install the sphinx-info package (in a virtualenv) Enter in the Python/Doc directory from the python sources Edit the Makefile, to the build target replace $(PYTHON) tools/sphinx-build.py with sphinx-build , then add this target to the makefile, pay attention, the space before echo is a TAB: texinfo: BUILDER = texinfo texinfo: build @echo @echo "Build finished. The Texinfo files are in _build/texinfo." @echo "Run \`make' in that directory to run these through makeinfo" \ "(use \`make info' here to do that automatically)." Edit the Python/Doc/conf.py adding: texinfo_documents = [ ('contents', 'python', 'Python Documentation', 'Georg Brandl', 'Python', 'The Python Programming Language', 'Documentation tools', 1), ] Then run make texinfo and it should produce the texifile in the build/texinfo directory. To generate the info file run makeinfo python.texi
