One thing, as others have mentioned, is to not use the name as the key in your DB. Use the user's SID from AD as the key in your database, as this is persistent in AD and will not change. The GUID could be used too, but in some scenario's this may change i believe. There are two approaches I would look into: Have your application 'lookup' the users in AD before adding them to the DB . So your applications "create user" screen would actually allow the admin to search AD for the appropriate users, then they would choose that user. You would then have all the information about the AD account, and could add that to your DB at the time of user creation. The association would always exist. Move all of the user creation process into your application . The admin would come to your system to create a user, and you could wrap creating them in AD, and adding them to the DB with the AD information in a single transaction. Note there is a good chance this would not be allowed in many organizations, as there are probably other things that happen in AD and need to be set. But it may work for you.
