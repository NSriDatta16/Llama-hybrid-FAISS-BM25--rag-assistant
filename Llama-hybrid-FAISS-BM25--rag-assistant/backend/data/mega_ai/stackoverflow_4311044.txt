android - dynamically changing the position of an imageview

i'm currently using the matrix method to implement drag and pinch zoom for an image (image A) Now i want a part of image A to be clickable so i put another imageview (image B) over image A and set the layout_margins for it in the xml file. My question is...is there a way to dynamically change my layout_margins as i'm scaling my image for drag and pinch zoom? I guess the simpler question is...how do i dynamically set the layout_margins for an imageview? thanks!
