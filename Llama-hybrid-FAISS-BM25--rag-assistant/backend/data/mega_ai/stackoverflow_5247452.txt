Does a wysiwyg editor for report lab's rml exist?

I've searched around for drag-and-drop editors which act similarly to MSAccess report builder but generates Report Markup Languageâ„¢ . However, I could not find any existing products. Could it be true then that everyone hand codes the designs of their PDFs? Surely there must be a WYSIWYG editor somewhere. Anyone know of any? It would help tremendously. Note. Would there be any demand for one to be built?
