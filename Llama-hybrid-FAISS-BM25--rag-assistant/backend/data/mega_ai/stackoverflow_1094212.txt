A few more issues that haven't been mentioned yet: Use autoreconf to (re)generate configure and Makefile.in . It calls the requisite tools in the correct order. Prefer using the make macros (“ $(FOO) ”) to the Autoconf substitutions (“ @FOO@ ”) in your makefile. The advantage of the former is that they can be overridden at make time should that be necessary. I'd encourage you to create a separate build directory and run configure there rather than building in the source directories. This is a setup that you probably don't want to break; and if you aren't testing it, you can inadvertently break it.
