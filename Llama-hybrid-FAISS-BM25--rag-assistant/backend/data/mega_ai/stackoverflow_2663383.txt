Loading PNG textures to OpenGL

I'm working on a game, and all of my graphics use magenta as transparent/magic color. They are all 32-bit and the magenta is just for conveniency. Anyway, I would appreciate if someone could advice me what library should I use to load my images (I need to load them in GL_RGBA format, both internal and texture specific).
