Assuming, you have you code organized like this ./project PrimeNumbers.java PrimeNumbers.class then you cd to ./project and type java PrimeNumbers Note - this only works because you didn't declare a package (iaw: you class is in the default package ). Usually you have a package declaration and then it looks a bit different. Bonus The getter is a good idea, but you should think twice before returning a collection, because this way, you grant the receiver full access to your (internal?) datastructure and he can alter the values of that collection. And you shouldn't declare it with the raw type . Here's a better way to implement it: public List getPrimes() { return Collections.unmodifiableList(listOfPrimeNumbers); } Now the receiver knows that he get's a list of Integer values and can't modify the result.
