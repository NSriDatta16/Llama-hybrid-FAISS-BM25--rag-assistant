Blurring a picture (Python, Jython, picture editing)

Trying to blur a picture in Jython. What I have does run but does not return a blurred picture. I'm kinda at a loss of what is wrong with it. FINAL (WORKING) CODE EDITED IN BELOW. THANKS FOR HELP GUYS! def main(): pic= makePicture( pickAFile() ) show( pic ) blurAmount=10 makeBlurredPicture(pic,blurAmount) show(makeBlurredPicture(pic,blurAmount)) def makeBlurredPicture(pic,blurAmount): w=getWidth(pic) h=getHeight(pic) blurPic= makeEmptyPicture( w-blurAmount, h ) for px in getPixels(blurPic): x=getX(px) y=getY(px) if (x+blurAmount The pseudo-code was as such : makeBlurredPicture(picture, blur_amount) get width and height of picture and make an empty picture with the dimensions (w-blur_amount, h ) call this blurPic for loop, looping through all the pixels (in blurPic) get and save x and y locations of the pixel #make sure you are not too close to edge (x+blur) is less than width Intialize rTotal, gTotal, and bTotal to 0 # add up the rgb values for all the pixels in the blur For loop that loops (blur_amount) times rTotal= rTotal +the red pixel amount of the picture (input argument) at the location (x+loop number,y) then same for green and blue find the average of red,green, blue values, this is just rTotal/blur_amount (same for green, and blue) set the red value of blurPic pixel to the redAverage (same for green and blue) return blurPic
