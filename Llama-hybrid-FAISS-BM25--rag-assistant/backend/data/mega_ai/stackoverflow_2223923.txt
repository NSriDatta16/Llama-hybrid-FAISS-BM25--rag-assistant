No, like most said. Plus, to add to their comments look at why you use C/C++ and why you use .NET and its languaes (liek C#): C/C++ was made to give you power over a computer in a nice abstracted way. It is converted ALMOST directly into assembly language and gives you great power for good (and evil.) Things like pointers are encouraged and there is no garbage collection. Hence, you have to should know what the assembly language code is doing because of what you can do. .NET languages were made to make great apps quickly and limit the damage you can do to these apps. It discourages you from using real power over the CPU (like pointers are discouraged and you need not worry about garbage collection for the most part.) Basically, the damage you can do is limited to the app; and little to do with the CPU (unless you dabble with unsafe code which is only used in rare cases [in my experience]). In addition, .NET code is converted to IL, then IL is converted to assembly and so on... you are not directly dealing with assembly language anyway. These said, it is good to know IL for head knowledge and can help you a little. But knowing it will not greatly help you create great app- which is the point of .NET languages for the most develop not working at Microsoft.
