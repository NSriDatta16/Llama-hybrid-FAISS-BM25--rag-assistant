Packaging a web app as a desktop app

OK so being a web programmer I'm building an ajax app, but my problem is that my target market isn't going to want it as a web app, they'll want it on their desktop with local file access, and possibly some optional cloud features and a sister phone app. So I've played around with Titanium and Air and both come up very short compared to running it straight off my local server in a browser. The Titanium build runs very slow. And its only really very small at this stage (126kb of code including jquery.js). Even the css:hover lags a second behind! And besides the documentation is mainly just placeholders telling you that there is no documentation for desktop. Their demo kitchen sink application doesn't even run properly, unless of course their whole desktop feature set is just an empty white background! Adobe Air makes a dogs breakfast out of it. Even though it works like a treat in Chrome, Air won't run any of my scripts and renders it like I'm making cubist art. No offence to any cubists out there. So my question is, what are the options for a javascript/php programmer in embedding a small server into an ssb and running it that way?
