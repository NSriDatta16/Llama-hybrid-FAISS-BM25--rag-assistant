Can anything be inferred about the tails of $f(\cdot|x_{t-1})$? By stationarity $$ \int f(x_t \mid x_{t-1}) \pi(x_{t-1}) dx_{t-1} =\pi(x_{t}). $$ By your assumptions of normality: $$ \int f(x_t \mid x_{t-1}) \phi^n(x_{t-1}) dx_{t-1} =\phi^n(x_{t}), \tag{2} $$ where $\phi^n(x_t) = \prod_{i=1}^n \phi(x_{ti})$. This (probably) means that $$ f(x_t \mid x_{t-1}) = N(x_t ; Ax_{t-1}, \Sigma), $$ for any $A$, $\Sigma$ such that $\Sigma + AA' = I$. So both densities have a standard kurtosis. Actually, I am not 100% certain about how multivariate kurtosis is defined. Edit: This won't completely satisfy what you're looking for but if you look at the LHS of (2) you get $$ (2 \pi)^{-1} \det(\Sigma)^{-1/2} \int \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left\{(x_t - A x_{t-1})'\Sigma^{-1}(x_t - Ax_{t-1})- x_{t-1}'x_{t-1} \right\} \right] dx_{t-1} \tag{3} $$ inside the curly braces turns out to be $$ x_t'\Sigma^{-1}x_t - 2x_{t-1}'A'\Sigma^{-1}x_t + x_{t-1}'\left[ A'\Sigma^{-1}A-I\right] x_{t-1} $$ and you can complete the square and re-arrange this as $$ (x_{t-1} - Bx_t)'C^{-1}(x_{t-1} - Bx_t) - x_tB'Bx_t + x_t'\Sigma^{-1}x_t $$ where $C^{-1} = A'\Sigma^{-1}A-I$ and $B = \left(A'\Sigma^{-1}A-I\right)^{-1}A'\Sigma^{-1} $. Completing the square like this allows us to integrate (3) by recognizing a Gaussian density. You integrate out $x_{t-1}$ and what should be left is a Gaussian density for $x_t$ with mean $0$ and variance $I$. This is technically only a sufficient condition for the marginals to be Gaussian, and not the other way around, which is what you're looking for, but you can start playing around with what happens if you don't have this. The integral would be pretty tough to get. In the univariate case, the tails you're after, $E[X_t^4 \mid x_{t-1}]$, on average have to be $3$ by the law of total expectation. But with this example, we just assume these are all $3$, regardless of $x_{t-1}$. If you find an example that's different from this one, where $x_{t-1}$ influences more than just the mean of $x_t \mid x_{t-1}$, then I would be interested in hearing about it.
