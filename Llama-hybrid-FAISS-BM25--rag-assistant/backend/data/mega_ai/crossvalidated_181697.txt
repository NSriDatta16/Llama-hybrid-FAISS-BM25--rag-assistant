differences between fake computer-generated data & real data

generally, is there a/some formula(s) or algorithm(s) to prove that a data set is a fake one generated using computer and not by field work? more specific, recently I got a research questionnaire data (with likert scale) which I believe is not real. firstly everything is way too nice considering old results within the same subject; descriptives, correlations, reliability, PCA & factor analysis etc. secondly data collection processes ended quite sooner than usual and ... there are more reasons and I can not prove anything. I think the answer is "no you can't" but I would greatly appreciate any assistance.
