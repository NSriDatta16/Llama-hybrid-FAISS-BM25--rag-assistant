As stated here , this is probably a bad idea to "force" coefficients to have a positive value. A negative one could indicate problems in the data (outliers, noise, pseudo-replication ...), missing covariates, non-linear relationships, ect. However, in a Bayesian framework, you can use your knowledge on the subject as priors. In your case, you could use priors that put a lot of weight on the positive values of the coefficient. This would be an informative prior and must be justified. brms could be a good pick because priors are easy to specify and the syntax is the same as in lme4. If you really want to do it, it seems to exist some methods/packages in R (see this discussion ), but I would not recommend it.
