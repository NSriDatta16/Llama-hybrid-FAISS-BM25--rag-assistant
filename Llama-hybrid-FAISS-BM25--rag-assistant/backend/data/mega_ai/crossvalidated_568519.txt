Compare model accuracy with null accuracy

My current model of Logistic Regression return a accuracy of: Training set score: 0.8476 Test set score: 0.8502 Comparing model accuracy with null accuracy: y_test.value_counts() #No 22067 #Yes 6372 null_accuracy = (22067/(22067 + 6372)) Null accuracy score: 0.7759 We can see that our model accuracy score is 0.8502 but null accuracy score is 0.7759 Can we conclude that the model its making a good job ? why ? from what incremental improvement can it be said to be doing a good job ?
