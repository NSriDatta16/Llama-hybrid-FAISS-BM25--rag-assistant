Yo dawg...The browser security model will prevent any DOM access to an iFrame from a different domain. This is to prevent somebody embedding a page and them sabotaging the content/layout, capturing form data and so on. If you have access to the source of the iFramed page you can (via a third iFrame on the same domain as the browser viewport) send information to the top page via url parameters. Otherwise you're out of luck. There isn't much point doing this if you just want to change the layout of the page since you'll have css access anyway. But it is useful for setting the height of the iFrame to whatever the scroll height of the iFrame is. Edit I think this is what you were looking for: http://simple.procoding.net/2008/03/21/how-to-access-iframe-in-jquery/ $('#iframeID').contents().find('#someID').html();
