WPF Binding: Refreshing Binding after reload of combos from database

I've got two combo's 'Make' and 'Model', they've got their SelectedValue properties bound to an Vehicle object with a ModelID and a MakeID. Heres Model ... A user can search for Vehicles in a seperate control and this swaps out the underlying Vehicle object. Everything works fine if your switching between vehicles of the same Make, however if the Make changes I go away to the database and reload the ModelSpec collection. The combo dosnt display the Model Description because the binding needs to be refreshed. My current work-around is to add this at the end of the method thats reloading the Models - it works fine, but is not a particularly elegent solution. var modelID = ViewModel.Vehicle.ModelID; ViewModel.Vehicle.ModelID = string.Empty; ViewModel.Vehicle.ModelID = modelID; Basically I'm just triggering the INotifyPropertyChanged ... private string _modelID; public string ModelID { get { return _modelID; } set { if (_modelID == value) return; _modelID = value; OnPropertyChanged("ModelID"); } } I can think of a couple of similar inelegant solutions - but there must be a better way?! Any help appreciated!
