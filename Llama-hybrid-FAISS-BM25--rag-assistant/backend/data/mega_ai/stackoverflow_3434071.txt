How to make a load response have several conditions in it?

I have a function function preloadImage() { varLink=".... link to my picture..." $("#picture").attr("src", varLink).one("load", function() { // This is called after the image is loaded }} Now I call this function many times in my jquery script. But I need it to call different functions after the image is loaded. Is there any more elegant way to do that instead of sending parametrs to function like: function preloadImage(action) and making several if then statements after the function is executed to replace the: // This is called after the image is loaded in my code? So I basically need to do several things after image is loaded (callback) so I have to call this function with several different parameters or is there any other way? Thank you Jerry
