Mapping properties to (differently named) foreign key fields in Entity Framework CTP5

I'm trying to use the Entity Framework CTP5 Fluent API to map an exist database. I have the following classes: public class Shop { public long Id { get; set; } } public class Sale { public long Id { get; set; } public virtual Shop Shop { get; set; } } The corresponding tables are called "Stores" and "Sales". Sales has a StoreId foreign key that points to the Id field in the Stores table. I'm struggling to map the Sale.Shop.Id to the StoreId in the table. I'm not at liberty to change it to ShopId, so need to map it. In CTP4, I was using: modelBuilder.Entity ().MapSingleType(x => new { Id = x.Id, StoreId = x.Shop.Id }); I tried the following: modelBuilder.Entity ().Property(x => x.Shop.Id).HasColumnName("StoreId"); However, it seems this only works with a primitive type. How do I specify this mapping?
