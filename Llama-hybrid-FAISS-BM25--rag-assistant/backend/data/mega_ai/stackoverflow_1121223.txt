No, no real gain. To see bottlenecks because of the string size interleaves, specially base don an int PK, it would be a real extreme. On the other hand the mess of working with such a storage schema is very clear and present: you have to decide, based on the length of a string you did not yet retrieve on which table to look! You'll probably end up looking by trial and error (try one table, then the other), which is by far more wasteful than that any table nvarchar storage structure issue.
