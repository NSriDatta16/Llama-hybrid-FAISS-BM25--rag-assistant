I think (opinion more than fact) that this has to do with the organic growth viewpoint that Perl's creator Larry Wall has with the Perl language. Python is a study in the opposite approach, whose style often makes Perl hackers cringe at the perception of being forced to conform to a stylistic regime. Some of it has to do with Perl being designed to be "efficient" at writing quick scripts to do Perl*-ish* tasks, in both wall clock time, and in keystrokes. Some of it has to do with the TMTOWTDI mantra of Perl and its followers. Programmers tend to be opinionated about Perl's frequent usage of "magic", for some it is an eye-straining visual cacophony of chaos and disrespect for orderliness (which harkens back to the days of computer Priesthood in white lab coats behind a glass window), for others it is a shining example of getting things done efficiently, if not always obviously to the novice or outsider.
