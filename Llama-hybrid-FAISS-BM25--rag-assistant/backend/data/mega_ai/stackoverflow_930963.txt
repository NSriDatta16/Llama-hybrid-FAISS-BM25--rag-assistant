My rule of thumb is I'd much rather get a C/C++ programmer to write Java than a Java programmer to write C/C++. I can't tell which Java programmers can handle dealing with memory management and pointers until they try it. If all I had to choose from were Java school kids, I'd tell them a few horror stories about assembly and C, then try to break them down into three categories. Fearless. They weren't paying attention. Fearful and panicked because they know they couldn't handle that kind of complexity. Fearful and eager because they understand that even people smarter than them can get punched in the gut by weird-ass memory and hardware issues, but hell, it does sound like a good challenge. I'd hire from group 3.
