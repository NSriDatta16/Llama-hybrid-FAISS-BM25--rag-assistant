Looking for an algorithm which does Max Sum Clustering

I have a very limited background in data science and dataset processing and I was hoping I could get some help here. I am doing some work that requires clustering certain data points having $(x, y)$ position values and associated weight $W_i$ for each point. I started with looking at k-means clustering since I know how many bins or k clusters the data needs to be divided into but I also have an additional criteria regarding the sum of weights $W_i$ in each cluster being less than/equal to a value $W_{max}$ . I need to essentially cluster the points along k different $y=C_i$ lines on XY plane such that the sum of weights for points along each line is less than/equal to $W_{max}$ . Are there any constrained clustering algorithms that do this. It would a massive help if someone could point me to any open source C++ data science libraries that can help me achieve this.
