Method for quantifying intervention effect in time series

How can the magnitude of an intervention be quantified in a segmented time series regression? I am attempting to replicate the methodology of Decline in pneumonia admissions after routine childhood immunisation with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the USA: a time-series analysis . There are several other published papers with similar methodology where the methods chapter is not informative. All of these papers cite Wagner et al. , however that paper describes a much simpler linear model. I have a 120 month time series of count data that exhibits strong seasonal variation, has a baseline negative trend and a known public health intervention at $t = 72$ that would be expected to decrease the counts (increase the negative trend). I have fitted this with a negative binomial model with AR(2) errors and dummy variables for months, pre-intervention trend, an intervention indicator and post-intervention trend. I did this in R statistics with the function glm.nb from the MASS package. #In R version 3.3.1 with packages dplyr, MASS #generate a comparable time-series ts() base I have attempted several approaches I have tried using the forecast package to forecast the pre-intervention time series and then subtract the observed values from the predicted. However, the 95%CI intervals became so large that there would have been no theoretical way for the observed time series to fall outside them. I have refit the model without the intervention variables and subtracted fit_intervention from fit_nonintervention . The refitted model exhibits fairly similar fitted values with an overall decreased model fit.
