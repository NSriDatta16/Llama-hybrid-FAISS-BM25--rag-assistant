How to fit a simple count time series INAR(1) model

I am trying to perform a simple time series analysis with count time series data. My data is a sequence of small integer values like 0,1,2 and 3. I learned from various sources that INAR model would be appropriate with such data. My question is whether anyone knows R codes for fitting a simple INAR(1) model (regressing time series data on a binary dummy variable). Appreciate any assistance.
