This is not really an anonymous function. It has a name. The name is "bar", or, more specifically, "foo.bar". What this really is, to my way of thinking, is a function literal. To my way of thinking, a truly anonymous function is a function that really does not have a name, like an argument to another function: var intervalId = setTimeout(function() { // statements }, 1000); Now, according to David Flanagan in Javascript: The Definitive Guide , an anonymous function is one that is "created with the Function() constructor." He hedges his bets there, though, because he goes on further to state that such functions are only "sometimes" called anonymous. Why am I raising this issue here? Because I think if you have a name for something, it can't really be called anonymous. And I think the term "anonymous" with respect to Javascript functions is ambiguous at best, and ought to at least be clarified by someone somewhere.
