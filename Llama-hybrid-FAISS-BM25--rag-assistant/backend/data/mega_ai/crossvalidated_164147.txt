You have to set up your problem clearly. You are talking about regression but i think it's more a classification problem as you are trying to predict classes label for each instance. For this case, a simple Random Forest or SVM classifiers should do the work. If you want to go further, you should also perform some features selections. But if you absolutly want to do a regression, i'd suggest to choose logistic regression over linear regression.
