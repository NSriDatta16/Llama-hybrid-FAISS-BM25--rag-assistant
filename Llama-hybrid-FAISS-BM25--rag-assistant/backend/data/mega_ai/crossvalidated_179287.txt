If you are willing to assume that it is a reasonable approximation of the truth that the probability of an incorrect match follows a Bernoulli distribution independent of other matches then the following technique can be used to obtain an estimate and 95% confidence interval of this probability (a Bernoulli distribution is a binomial distribution with just 1 trial). Suppose we sample $n$ database pairings, and let $x_i$ have value 0 if the pairing is correct, and 1 if the pairing is incorrect. Let $\pi$ denote the true probability that a pairing is incorrect. Then it can be shown that the maximum likelihood estimator (i.e. one choice of reasonable estimator) is given by $$ \hat{\pi} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i $$ where $\hat{\pi}$ denotes this estimator and $x_i$ denotes whether the $i^{\text{th}}$ pairing was incorrect ($x_i = 1$) or correct ($x_i = 0$). Then it follows from the Central Limit Theorem that $$ \frac{ \sqrt{n} \left( \hat{\pi} - \pi \right) }{ \sigma } \stackrel{L}{\rightarrow} N(0,1 ) $$ where $\sigma^2$ denotes the variance of the Bernoulli random variable (and hence $\sigma$ is the square root of the variance, and is known as the standard deviation). The side to the right of the arrow denotes a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and variance 1 (often called a standard normal random variable). The arrow means that as the sample size $n$ gets larger and larger that the distribution on the left becomes arbitrarily close to the distribution on the right. Next, it can be shown that for a Bernoulli random variable that $\sigma^2 = \pi(1-\pi)$. Thus we can rewrite the previous result as $$ \frac{ \sqrt{n} \left( \hat{\pi} - \pi \right) }{ \sqrt{ \pi(1-\pi) } } \stackrel{L}{\rightarrow} N(0,1 ) $$ Furthermore, using the law of large numbers, it can be shown that $\hat{\pi} \stackrel{p}{\rightarrow} \pi$ (i.e. the estimate becomes arbitrarily close to the true value as the sample size $n$ gets larger and larger). Thus, we may replace the true parameter values in the denominator by their sample values to obtain $$ \frac{ \sqrt{n} \left( \hat{\pi} - \pi \right) }{ \sqrt{ \hat{\pi}(1-\hat{\pi}) } } \stackrel{L}{\rightarrow} N(0,1 ) $$ Finally to obtain a confidence interval we can do the following. Suppose that we want a 95% confident interval. Then the probability that a standard normal random variable has a value greater than -1.96 and less than 1.96 is 95%. Therefore, $$ \begin{align} 0.95 & \approx \mathbb{P}\left( -1.96 One final point to make. There are several other methods of calculating a confidence interval for Bernoulli data which are thought to provide better coverage characteristics. Some of these methods include a confidence interval based on the Rao score test, the Clopper-Pearson interval, and the mid-P-value interval. But the interval described above is the default method and should do fine for a decent sample size.
