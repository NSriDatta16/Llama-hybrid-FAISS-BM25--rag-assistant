Getting DUnit Test Coverage stats using FinalBuilder and AQTime

We have a large Delphi project (1.5 million lines of code), and we're moving to using agile processes. We already have a continous integration environment (FinalBuilder) which I've updated to include unit tests (dUnit) and code metrics (CodeHealer) in the e-mails to everyone in our development team. Our unit test coverage isn't great, so I'm now trying to get AQtime into the mix for some test coverage results on every build. I'm using the "Execute Program" task to run the unit test executable, log the results and parse the file afterwards. I intend to use the "Run Script" task to run AQtime (via COM) and export the results to XML so I can parse through those results. The issue I have is with AQtime running the unit test executable, I lose the ability to monitor the unit test executable directly. I'd like to get FinalBuilder to parse the results of both tasks. Does anybody know how to get access to the dUnit results when it's called from AQtime?
