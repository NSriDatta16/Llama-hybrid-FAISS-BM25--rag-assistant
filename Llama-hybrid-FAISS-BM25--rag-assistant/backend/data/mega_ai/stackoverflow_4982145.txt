Extensible biased number generator - Python

I am trying to get a random number generator that will be biased in that it takes a number, and prints a number that is likely to be close. Here's what I have now: def biasedRandom(rangen, rangex, target, biaslevel=1): if rangen > rangex: raise ValueError("Min value is less than max value.") return if not target in range(rangen, rangex): raise ValueError("Bias target not inside range of random.") return num = random.randint(rangen, rangex) for i in range(biaslevel): distance = abs(num - target) num -= random.randint(0, distance) return num This works pretty well, however it has on occasion given completely outrageous numbers; e.g. it once gave -246174068358 for (1,100,30,60) . I figure there is just a bug in there that I am not seeing. Thanks in advance.
