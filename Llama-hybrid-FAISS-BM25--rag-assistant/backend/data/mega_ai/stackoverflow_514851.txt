When I first began pascal programming (with TurboPascal!) and learnt as I went, WITH seemed wonderful. As you say, the answer to tedious typing and ideal for those long records. Since Delphi arrived, I've been removing it and encouraging other to drop it - neatly summed-up by Verity at the register Apart from a reduction in readability there are two main reasons why I'd avoid it: If you use a class then you dont need it anyway - only records 'seem' to benefit from it. Using the debugger to follow the code to the declaration with Ctrl-Enter doesnt work. That said, for readability I still use the syntax: procedure ActionOnUpdate( Sender : TObject ) begin With Sender as TAction do Enabled := Something end; I've not seen a better construct.
