rule-based model out of a binary features dataset

I have the following problem. I've been given a dataset where the features are binary which can be interpret as seen or not seen. The target value is categorical. My goal is to generate a list of rules. For example: $${v_1, v_3, v_4} \mapsto y_1 $$ One idea I had in mind is to train a logistic regression model (One versus all) and use the coefficients to determine which features affect the classification. In other words, for each $y_i$ we train a model to find the $k$ best coefficients. I can go over that list of sorted coefficients and build a subset of features with the preferred accuracy. The problem is that I think it's not a complete solution. With this methodology I can create only one rule essentially but there can be two (even distinct) subsets of features that maps to the same $y_i$ . What could be a better approach? Maybe even a brute-force approach could be applied?
