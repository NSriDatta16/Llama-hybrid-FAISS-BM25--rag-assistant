Choice of Software for bug tracking/changes for Mathematica Application Package Development CVS Vs. Bugzilla?

I am developing an application package in mathematica with workbench and it is starting to get complex with multpiple versions and components. I read in some mathematica documentation ( http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/BuildingLargeSoftwareSystemsInMathematica.html Paragraph:Use Source Control ) that CVS was a good system, but I have checked it ( http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/ ) and it does not seem to be under very active development and the download page is kind of cryptic. Am I going to the wrong page for CVS? I just got this page http://ximbiot.com/cvs/wiki/Main%20Page#CVS_Downloads for CVS also, but no clear indication as to where to download On a different project I managed many years ago, the developers used bugzilla and were quite happpy with it. I went to the bugzilla page and it seems to be a better choice ( http://www.bugzilla.org/download/#howtoget ). Any advice from active Mathematica developers? Or are both CVS and bugzilla complementary? In this case an indication of where to best get CVS with clearer installation and use instructions would be nice.
