Multiple correlated multivariate time series

I have forecast dataset containing multiple multivariate time series that are not independent from each other. A state in one of the the series in time "t" can influence the state in another in time "t+n". I was initially thinking in doing a LSTM model for each time series, but I ran in the problem of how to make a LSTM speak with another, is that possible? How could I do that? I also thought in transforming the multiple series in a single one, but the goal is to make a forecast of the class of each series and I don't think this way I could have the classification of each one as an output, right? Are there any other solutions? Could I make a CNN-LSTM work for something like this?
