Which significance test can be used in this instance? - paired, non-normal means

I have a data set of behaviours for a herd of captive elephants which I have attempted to quantify to compare for statistical significance, i.e., if a behaviour is performed once during an observation session, a score of 1 is given, if it is performed 4 times in the observation period a score of 4 is given. I have the original data, and have then averaged each behaviour for a period of time before and after an event, giving my paired means and want to compare the two averages to see if there is a significant difference between the two. I originally thought I could just perform a paired t test, however the data doesn't follow a normal distribution, as behaviour is random and so apparently this cannot be applied. Would anyone be able to help or suggest a test to apply to the data.
