Which files are taking most of my process's I/O time?

I have a fairly large python program that is causing a lot of disk I/O (on top , %wa can get as high as 80, and iotop says that my process is the culprit). There are several things that may cause this - I'm writing to more than one log file, and I'm saving cached results to disk in several places, so it's not immediately obvious where I should focus my attention. Is there a linux tool or a python trick that will allow me to see which subsystem is causing the most I/O operations?
