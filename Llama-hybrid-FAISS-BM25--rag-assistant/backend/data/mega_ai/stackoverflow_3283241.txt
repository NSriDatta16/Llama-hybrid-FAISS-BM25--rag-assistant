jquery draggable -- animate "clone" on drop

I'm building a widget which allows user to copy items from one list over to another, but dragging. I've figured out the helper: 'clone' option will allow me to drag a copy of my draggable, rather than the draggable itself. I'd like to have the clone animate/snap in to place when I drop it on my droppable, but it seems to be destroyed as soon as I release it. How can I prevent its destruction so I can animate it myself when it's released? I realize Sortable might give me some of the functionality I want, but then my lists will become sortable, which I don't want. I just want simple copy -> release - > snap functionality.
