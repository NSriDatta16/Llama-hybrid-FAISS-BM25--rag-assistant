LINQ hasn't gone away. LINQ to SQL hasn't either, but it is not Microsoft's strategic platform for data access, that would be Entity Framework. EF uses LINQ to Entities so if you've spent time learning about LINQ, it'll still be valid and useful. LINQ isn't a product-specific technology, though. It is easy to leverage the power and flexibility in collections of (almost) all kinds. eg. List myList = new List (); // populate the list here var filteredResults = from o in myList where o.property == "hello world" select o; is (conceptualy) valid, even if the code example here is flawed.
