Validation of viewstate MAC failed

I am currently receiving this error: Validation of viewstate MAC failed. If this application is hosted by a Web Farm or cluster, ensure that configuration specifies the same validationKey and validation algorithm. AutoGenerate cannot be used in a cluster. I have found multiple solutions to this error. The solution we are currently using is to add a static MachineKey field at the machine level and to use static validation keys and decryption keys. Will this solution work for .NET 3.5? Is there a more elegant solution?
