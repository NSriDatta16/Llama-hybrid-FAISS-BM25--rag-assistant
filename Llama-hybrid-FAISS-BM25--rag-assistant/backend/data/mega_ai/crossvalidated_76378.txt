The short answer is if you used leave-one-out CV for time series, you would be fitting model parameters based on data from the future. The easiest way to see how this is to just write out what both procedures look like using that same data. This makes the difference glaringly obvious. Following Hyndman's notation let $y(1), \ldots, y(T)$ be the time series and $m$ the minimum number of points need to build a model. Then the procedure described by Hyndman works as follows For t = m to T-1: Fit model with y(1), ... y(t) e(t+1) = y(t+1) - y*(t+1) Calculate MSE of e(m+1) to e(T) For leave-one-out CV the procedure look like For t = 1 to T: Fit model with y(1), ..., y(t-1), y(t+1), ..., y(T) e(t) = y(t) - y*(t) Calculate MSE of e(1) to e(T) Notice how in the time series version we're actually using a different number of points to fit each model, namel $m, m+1, \ldots, T-1$. Compare this to the other version where one is always using $T-1$ points.
