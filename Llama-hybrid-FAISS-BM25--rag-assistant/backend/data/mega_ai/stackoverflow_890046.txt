Tom, The problem is solved technically, let's talk about it theoretically. There are two schools of thought here. I do not think it is an acceptable answer to say "if the user can't figure it out it's their problem." Be firm about your user input and only accept credit card numbers that are well-formed. This requires keeping the user on the page until they get everything right. Be more lenient by assuming their intentions and adjusting their input for them (just be sure to give them a confirmation screen to verify the new input). In my opinion, #2 is the way to go, you can use regular expressions (as stated above) to pull all spaces, special characters, etc. out of the cc# field and keep the user from having to enter their information again. Either way you should inform the user of the proper input form (i.e. xxxx-xx-xxxx) as a rule of thumb, I tend to appreciate sites that are more elegant about the way they handle user input. For more tips on regular expressions check out regular-expressions . info Good luck, -Robert
