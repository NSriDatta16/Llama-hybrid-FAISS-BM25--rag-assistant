This book is very nice and gives you a general idea about cryptography and as far as I remember some it gives also some information about steganography (from the ancient times): The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography although not an academic book. For steganography you could check also the following two: Disappearing Cryptography, Third Edition: Information Hiding: Steganography & Watermarking or Digital Watermarking and Steganography: Fundamentals and Techniques . As you are a Java developer you may also want to take a look at the Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit . If you want to go deep into Cryptography (for example RSA algorithm) you should read math books about number theory, abstract algebra (for an introduction to these you can check this: A Primer on Algebra and Number Theory for Computer Scientists (it's a pdf file)). Or if you want to go much deeper you should read about elliptic curve cryptography. About hacking you may want to take a look at this one: Hacking: The Art of Exploitation . This book The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security is also nice to read in order to learn social engineering techniques.
