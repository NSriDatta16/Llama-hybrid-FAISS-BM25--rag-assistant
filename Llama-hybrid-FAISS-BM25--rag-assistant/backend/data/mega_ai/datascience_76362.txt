What is the time complexity of learning/testing phase neural network?

What is the time complexity of feed-forward neural networks? I didn't find a book or a reliable source that's talks about this. This link provides one version by breaking the structure of a simple neural network. But I need someone to confirm this, a reviewer asked me to compute a the time complexity of my model. So, I need to be sure. Also, if two models are trained in parallel, should I sum their time complexity or take the max?
