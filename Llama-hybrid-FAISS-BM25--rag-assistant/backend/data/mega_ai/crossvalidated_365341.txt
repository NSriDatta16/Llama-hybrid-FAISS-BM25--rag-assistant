Kernel functions with vector output

Kernel functions are used commonly with SVMs to make classification of non linearly separable data possible - i.e. the Kernel function provides the linear separability. But from looking at Kernel functions it seems to me that they produce a scalar output.... If I just want to make data linearly separable (and not immediately use some classifier on it), how do I make any given Kernel function (for example, an RBF kernel), produce a vector output?... many thanks in advance.
