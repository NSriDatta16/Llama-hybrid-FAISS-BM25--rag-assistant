Meaning of alpha = C in SVM

I have been studying SVM lately, following Andrew Ng's CS229 lecture notes . I can understand most of the notes. But for the case where the KKT condition is satisfied at alpha = C , I am not sure what that means. I know that for alpha = 0 , the KKT condition is satisfied with inequality constraint, namely, the point lies above the decision function yi * (w' * xi + b) = 1 . And for 0 , the KKT condition is satisfied with equality constraint, namely, the point is a support vector. Now as for the case where alpha = C , I wonder what does this mean, does it mean that the point violate the constraint and that the penalty is C * slack_variable ?
