Machine learning algorithm for validating a state sequence

I am developing a machine learning algorithm to validate a markov chain sequence. Currently I have : 1. A ngram predictor which predicts the next state from the state history and will check whether this state occurs in the next time step. 2. A function to check the time spent on each state and to compare it with the previously known time required in that particular state.(But time spent in a state may vary and may not be same to the previously known time. So I am stuck here also) 3. A function which compares the previous state with a known state sequence and tells whether it's a valid state change or not I need to use all these information to validate that the state change occurred is a valid state change so that i can use this information for my further application.For eg: Ã­f any invalid state change is detected it should give a bad validation result from above information and should give a reward(+ or -) based on the validation result to the next validation checking step Which algorithm is best suited for this kind of application?
