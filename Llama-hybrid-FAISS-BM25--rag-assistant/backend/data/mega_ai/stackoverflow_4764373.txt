While the code in leppie's answer will compile and execute, I would not recommend it for production use. If you want RegEx functions that: are coded using best practices (for performance and security) handle NULL s appropriately perform better / more efficient have more options (e.g. @StartAt , @RegExOptions for IgnoreCase , MultiLine , etc) provide more functionality (e.g. CaptureGroup , CaptureGroupCapture , Escape , Unescape , etc) require no additional effort to deploy (i.e. a single, self-contained T-SQL script that is portable and versionable, and installs cleanly with no need to manually enable "CLR enabled" or mess with the "CLR strict security" setting that was introduced in SQL Server 2017 ) and are also free, then check out the SQL# SQLCLR library (that I wrote). There are 13 RegEx functions in the Free version (and 2 more in the Full / paid version, plus the ability to increase the expression cache size, which can help if you frequently use a variety of expressions). I believe the function RegEx_IsMatch (or RegEx_IsMatch4k ) is what you are looking for (yes, it is in the Free version).
