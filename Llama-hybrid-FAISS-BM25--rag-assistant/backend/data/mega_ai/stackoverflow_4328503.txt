Since immediate mode is deprecated doing a "hello triangle" application is a bit more involved. There is a good tutorial on modern OpenGL here: http://arcsynthesis.org/gltut/ You should read it thoroughly. Bear in mind that it doesn't use VAOs so you'll have to read about it somewhere else afterwards. VAOs don't change things much so you won't have to unlearn things from mentioned tutorial to use them. And about your second question... Your vertex shader will be executed by OpenGL for every vertex. Your job is to calculate final position of the vertex and prepare data (like normals, light data...) to be sent to fragment shader, given the attributes of vertex and other data you send to shader (uniforms - you'll read about it in tutorial). Fragment shader will be executed per fragment and in fragment shader you are calculating the final color of each fragment. You can see here: http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man4/ that things like, glPolygonMode and glCullFace are still there.
