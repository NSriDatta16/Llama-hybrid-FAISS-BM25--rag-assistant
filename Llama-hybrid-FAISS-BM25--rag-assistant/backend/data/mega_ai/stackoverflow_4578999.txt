Skip to last paragraph for quick Solution :) Yes! this just happened to me. I was typing a line of code... a line in Intraweb's ServerController.... OnBeforeDisbatch.. anyways. I was typing.. If and then I typed a Space... so If If True then after the above line was in the system all hell broke loose.... hell being that the file would stay in a read-only mode.... I edited the file manually and removed the line if True then and all is good. just to update: I do believe it is file size... 125K and then bang. at least on the server controller... IW10/Delphi 2010 update again... 8 hours later... I reduced my source file (iwservercontroller) from 125k to well under 80k and all was good. then now right when I first press the control key to paste over a value the file goes read-only!! like wow.... going to reduce file again.. Minutes later... after shutting down d2010 and reloading project... I have narrowed down the problem to using the "paste" command.... the second I tried to paste a clipboard value read-only occurred... but a harddrive hit occurred for a instant before the read-only activated! Final solution!!! I got it! I couldn't believe there is a "Read Only" option in the Right Click Menu.... Click on the left side Pane where the check box is when the Read-Only appears! no more need to restart IDE and reload everything etc etc... All fixed... whoo hoo Nope... not all fixed... 3 hours later... I reactivate IDE and I am just about to paste in some data and then the file goes in read only (not explorer's file attributes) and the Pop up menu value is now grayed out!! like wtf!! Full day later.. trying everything.. I have a solution!! first time I got it to go off read-only without using the PUM/insert Key simply just access the unit in question that is causing read-only and do a single character change with a outside app. (ultraedit) and save. upon saving d2010 will detect outside changes and go switch back to insert-mode even with the pop up menu is disabled.... whoo hoo... * Final Solution * Things are all good now and not a single read-only but the solution is not too elegant in terms of keeping my text edit habits in check.. but if you open settings and change the editor to keep insert mode on you will be laughing to the bank... at least things are all good for me now. Delphi2010-->Options-->Editor Options-->["Insert Mode"] check that option. Seems since i have had the above checkbox clicked not a single Read-only.... good luck.
