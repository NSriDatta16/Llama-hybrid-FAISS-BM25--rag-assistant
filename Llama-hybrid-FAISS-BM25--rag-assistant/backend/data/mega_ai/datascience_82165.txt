The answer is within your question itself. Conservation means something which has been conserved. Here through the backpropagation process the output is conserved. And the output is the sum of the all the intermediate neurons/pixels that are contributing in determining which feature in a particular input vector contribute the most to a neural network's output. Hope it helps.. Thank you..
