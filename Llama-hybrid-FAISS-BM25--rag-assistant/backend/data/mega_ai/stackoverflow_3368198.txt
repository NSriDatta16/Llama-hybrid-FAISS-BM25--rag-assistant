This should work better: SELECT AVG(watts) AS average_watts, AVG(CASE WHEN watts > 10 THEN watts END CASE) AS average_watts_floored FROM MyTable WHERE meterID = 100 AND time >= '2010-07-29 00:00:00' You need a FROM clause if you have a WHERE clause. Actually, you need a FROM clause if you're calculating any kind of AVG() too. In the CASE , you should leave out the first column name if you're going to have expressions instead of literal values. Refer to syntax documentation . I recommend using column aliases.
