Lift webapp has directory and resource with the same name, but gives 302

I deployed example.war to Tomcat 6.0.32 (latest at time of writing), and the deployed webapp contains the following: $ find example | egrep -v "WEB-INF/lib|WEB-INF/classes" example example/_items.html example/_share_link.html example/all_items.html example/images example/images/ajax-loader.gif example/index.html example/item example/item/star.html example/item.html example/js example/js/c-jquery-1.4.2.js example/js/c-jquery-ui-1.8.2.js example/js/jquery-1.4.2.js example/js/jquery-1.4.4.min.js example/js/jquery-ui-1.8.2.js example/js/jquery-ui-1.8.8.custom.min.js example/js/jquery.blockUI.js example/META-INF example/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF example/search.html example/static example/static/index.html example/templates-hidden example/templates-hidden/default.html example/templates-hidden/wizard-all.html example/WEB-INF example/WEB-INF/web.xml Particularly note: example/item example/item/star.html example/item.html I try and request the above resource: $ telnet localhost 8080 Trying ::1... Connected to localhost. Escape character is '^]'. GET /example/item HTTP/1.0 HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1 Location: http://localhost:8080/example/item/ Date: Thu, 07 Apr 2011 08:24:39 GMT Connection: close Connection closed by foreign host. The server told me to try /example/item/ $ telnet localhost 8080 Trying ::1... Connected to localhost. Escape character is '^]'. GET /example/item/ HTTP/1.0 HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1 Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=6D97AD3A8F77697146163946B1BBBB64; Path=/example Expires: Thu, 7 Apr 2011 08:24:58 UTC Cache-Control: no-cache, private, no-store Pragma: no-cache Date: Thu, 07 Apr 2011 08:24:58 GMT X-Lift-Version: 2.3 Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 106 Connection: close The Requested URL /example/item/ was not found on this server Connection closed by foreign host. This is not what I expect. The first request to /example/item (without the trailing slash) should work -- at this point the Lift web framework takes over and renders my items, using star.html as a template. This works really well with Jetty 6.1.22 and Resin 4.0.16, but not Tomcat. Is there some special configuration I'm missing? Is there something in the servlet specification which denotes the correct behaviour in this case? The example code I used can be found here: https://github.com/dpp/simply_lift/tree/master/samples/shopwithme I raised the original issue here: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/liftweb/7QlFud1ieOU Note This question is not about Lift or its rendering pipeline -- it's about Tomcat, and why its behaviour differs from Jetty and Resin's. UPDATE: This is the classic "trailing slash" issue, and a bug report has been filed here: https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32424
