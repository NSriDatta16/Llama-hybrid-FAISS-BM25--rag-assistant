Why is the Hyndman and Fan 1996 recommendation for sample quantile definition to standardize on not more accepted?

The 1996 paper Sample quantiles in statistical packages is often cited as the comprehensive source of sample quantile definitions and many a software package refers to the paper in the description of which sample quantile definitions are supported and which one is the default in that package. However, the paper also has a conclusion which recommends a specific definition, definition 8, and the last paragraph of the paper shows much concern for the issue of a lack of standardization on a single sample quantile definition: The current variation in sample quantile definitions causes confusion, and so there is a need to standardize the definition of sample quantile across packages and within packages. This is an analogous situation to the problem of defining sample variance. In that case the statistical community has adopted the unbiased definition (with denominator n - 1 ) as the standard rather than the more intuitive average of squared deviations (with denominator n ) or the minimum MSE definition (with denominator n + 1 for a normal distribution). This avoids confusion and ensures comparable results on all software. We believe there is a similar need to adopt a standard sample quantile definition, and we propose that [definition 8] is the best choice. Since it seems the paper is quite well-known and even influential, how come the proposal to standardize on definition 8 isn't more accepted? What I mean is that I don't know of any software which has definition 8 as the default sample quantile. This post by Hyndman actually discusses the issue somewhat: https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/sample-quantiles-20-years-later/ No major software uses type 8 by default, and the diversity of definitions continues 20 years later. In fact, the paper may have had the opposite effect to what was intended. We drew attention to the many approaches to computing sample quantiles and several software products added them all as options. Our own quantile function for R allows all 9 to be computed, and has type 7 as default (for backwards consistency â€“ the price we had to pay to get R core to agree to include our function). I'd still like to know how is definition 8 perceived in the community, though.
