Let eclipse use your java vm directly! Put these lines at the end of eclipse.ini (located in the directory where eclipse.exe is present): -vm /bin/javaw.exe Pay attention that there are two lines. Also make sure that the -vm option is before the -vmargs option (and of course after "openFile"). Useful link Eclispe.ini at wiki.eclipse.org
