Non-orthogonal technique analogous to PCA

Suppose I have a 2D point dataset and I want to detect the directions of all the local maxima's of variance in the data, for example: PCA does not help in this situation as it is an orthogonal decomposition and therefore cannot detect both the lines I indicated in blue, rather its output may look like the one shown by green lines. Please recommend any technique which might be suitable for this purpose. Thanks.
