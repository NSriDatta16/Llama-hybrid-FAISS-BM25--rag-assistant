No answer or comment to date appears to address something utterly elementary, meaning here fundamental. Values within segments of time series are in general dependent on each other. This is naturally precisely what is examined by (e.g.) autocorrelation or variogram computations, but it does mean that standard tests from mainstream statistics cannot be carried over to comparing segments of time series, except in the not very interesting case of independent observations. That is, you can do the computations but the P-values and more generally inferential results will not be valid as independence assumptions will usually be inaccurate. This is not absolutely fatal, as with lesser or greater effort reference P-values can be determined by simulation from realistic processes and so forth, but here "lesser or greater" in practice means "greater". It is true, as clearly explained by @cjohnson318, that standard two-sample tests result in information conveyed by sequence being lost, but that is a different problem. Note that a test being non-parametric does not address the issue at all, as non-parametric does not mean assumption-free and, broadly speaking, exactly the same assumptions about independence come into play as well as with e.g. t tests. Some of the blame here lies with teachers and textbook writers of introductory statistics, who -- faced with an already overcrowded curriculum -- usually fail to spell out the independence assumptions behind mainstream tests. Hence while (for example) there is exaggerated awareness of the importance of normality assumptions among users of statistics, there is very widespread lack of awareness of the importance of independence assumptions. Two books that do an excellent job of explaining the issue are Box, G.E.P., Hunter, J.S. and Hunter, W.G. 1978 or any later edition. Statistics for experimenters. New York (later Hoboken, NJ): John Wiley. Miller, R.G. 1986, reissued 1997. Beyond ANOVA . New York: John Wiley (later London: Chapman and Hall). This is mostly negative, and more positive suggestions will be expected. Broadly speaking, I have to suggest that analysing change within time series requires time series modelling, and there is no escape from that.
