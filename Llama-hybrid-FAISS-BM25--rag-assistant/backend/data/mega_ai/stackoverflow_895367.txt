I think the void of academics should be filled by student organizations or independent student projects. At my university we had the Association of Computing Machinery student chapter specifically for CS students and we also had a student organization dedicated to video game development. These orgs helped to teach the students about the "real world" by bringing in speakers from the industry and forced students to work with each other. I would also recommend that students majoring in Computer Science minor in Business if they are interested in leading software groups or if students want become more technically adept they minor in Liberal Arts. I know it seems weird, but I did this and I've found that it actually teaches you how to think outside of a purely technical and mathematical perspective and how to apply human thinking to software development.
