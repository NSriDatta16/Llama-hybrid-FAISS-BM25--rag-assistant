Python encourages the programmer to allocate space for storage when it is needed. In your attempt, allocate empty lists for ip and myip , then use .append to add elements when necessary. The lists will grow to any (reasonable) length, and the code will not depend on initial allocation size. The ip[-1] notation references the last element of a sequence. The running index i is not used inside the loop. ip = [] myip = [] i = 0 while i Please go over the tutorial, and pay special attention to the lists introduction.
