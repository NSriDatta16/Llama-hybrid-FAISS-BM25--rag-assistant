multiple postback events in an update panel

I have an update panel containing several divs which utilize jquery ui's draggable. On drag stop i want to do a postback which only effects the update panel. This works fine, but before continuing down this road i was wondering if a second divs dragstop event occured during a previous divs postback would both postbacks be executed properly? Thanks in advance, shawn
