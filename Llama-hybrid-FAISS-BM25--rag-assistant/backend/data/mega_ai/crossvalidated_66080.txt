Can I use data for factor analysis with very low KMO (less than 0.4), determinant negative, and data not significant according to Barnett's test?

I am analyzing rainfall water quality with cluster analysis first and then principal component analysis (PCA). There are 7 variables. Results from cluster analysis that extracting with PCA, almost of them show negative determinant, KMO very low (less than 0.3) and according to Barnett's test on sphericity, those data truly not significant (only 10% of group samples have p value Can I use these data to get factors? What I must do with results like that?
