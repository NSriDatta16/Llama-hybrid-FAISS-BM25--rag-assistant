photogragher drupal site with thousands of images to sell

I'm developing a site in drupal for a photographer that needs to put online thousands of images each weekend and then sell them through the site, with ubercart i think; He takes photos on a circuit to users that pay to race with their vehicles and very often they want to buy pictures of their journeys. I would NOT like to "import" each photo as a node, doing so i'll have thousands and thoudsands of nodes uselessly, instead i would like to show images in galleries (galleries for me will be nodes, or something similar) i found the gallery2 drupal integration module and i was thinking about using this to show galleries and let the users buy only "prints" of pictures, integrating it with ubercart system, so the only node i would like to manage are galleries and product nodes such as 10x15 print, 30x20 print and so on. Which are the modules to best solve this task ?
