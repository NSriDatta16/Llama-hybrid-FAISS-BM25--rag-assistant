Adding to the answer by @Milos, youâ€™re assuming that the average number of events per day follows Poisson distribution. We know that for independent variables $$ X_i \sim \mathsf{Poisson}\left(\lambda_i\right) $$ the distribution of their sum is $$ \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \sim \mathsf{Poisson}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i\right) $$ So if you can assume that the variables are independent and identically distributed, you can just multiply daily average by the number of days.
