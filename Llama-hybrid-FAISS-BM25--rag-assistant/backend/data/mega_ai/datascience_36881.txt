Format for proposing a new algorithmic project?

I am working for an organization that is still new to implementing data science projects. I have an idea for a data spider/algorithm project that will require various pieces of code as well as datasets that I will need to gain access to. I know that this is something that I should just start doing instead of proposing, but unless I come up with a formal document, the org might see it as a "waste of time". So are there any generally accepted formats and/or project templates for proposing a new data science effort? To be clear: I am looking for something that I can present to management and be able to "sell" them on a new data science project idea. So the template I'm looking for isn't necessarily too technical, it's more high-level than that.
