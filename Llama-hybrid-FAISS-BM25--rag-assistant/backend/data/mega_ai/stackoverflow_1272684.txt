I had looked into this for a previous project, and I believe the only option for server-side data storage in Silverlight is a backend web service. You would have to create something in Asp.net to handle requests from Silverlight for voting, retrieving options, and retrieving votes. Although I believe the best option for this backend would be a database, I suppose you could store this data in XML and retrieve using LINQ-to-XML.
