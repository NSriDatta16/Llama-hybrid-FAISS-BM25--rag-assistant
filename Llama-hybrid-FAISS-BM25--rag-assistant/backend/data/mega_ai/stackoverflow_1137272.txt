TFS Build SourceTfs.Checkout

I am trying to get my build to checkout some files (using Microsoft.Sdc.Common.tasks) and then to check them in after the build has finished. But I can't seem to get this working at all, let alone before and after the build. Whaereabouts should this sort of code live? C:\Program Files\MSBuild\sdc\ 2 Build MYSERVER MyProject c:\buildagent\MyProject\ContinuousIntegration \\UNKNOWN\drops false Never Bug System.Reason=Build Failure;System.Description=Start the build using Team Build Build failure in build: This work item was created by Team Build on a build failure.
