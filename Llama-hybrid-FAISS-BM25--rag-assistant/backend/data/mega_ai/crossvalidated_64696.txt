Sara, Did you want to post your data to dropbox.com? Have you plotted the normalized the Y and X's and done a scatterplot to see if there is a strong correlation between X and Y? See page 215 of the 2013 "Principles of Business Forecasting" by Keith Ord and Robert Fildes. Have you looked at prewhitening your X's so that you can get a good crosscorrelation function so that you can decide which lead/lags to use? Have you looked for outliers?
