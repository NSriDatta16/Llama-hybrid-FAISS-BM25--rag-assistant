JQuery Star Rating

Can anyone suggest a simple JQuery five star rating script that is easy to setup. I just need a single instance on a single page. I don't care if it writes to a file or mysql database to calculate rating average. It should display the number of votes and the calculated average. It should also check if the person has already rated or should not allow more than 2 ratings at a time. Should have cookies or sessions to prevent multiple ratings or some other mechanism. I don't care if its free or cost money but the licensing should allow me to use it in commercial applications. Appreciate all suggestions! Thank you! P.S. I spent a couple of day trying different scripts online but have not found anything that was actually complete.
