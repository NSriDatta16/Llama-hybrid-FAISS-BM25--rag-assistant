I view it a little differently. Code should be formatted for readability, not necessarily"Prettiness"--although those two may usually be the same thing. but as a counter case, if(x != null) y=x.getParam(); else y=0; is just more readable than the prettier: y = x == null ? 0 : x.getParam(); I know the point is arguable, I totally get it and I love that operator and all, but for 95% of the programmers out there (including the next one to read your code) it's going to take a little bit more to parse. In fact, I even had trouble with ruby's quite elegant: y = x.getParam() if x Simply because I'm so used to seeing control statements by scanning the left line of the code. I do have to admit that I got a little weak in the knees when I saw this syntax (I think it's from hascal) y = x?getParam(); That's a level of elegance that can even overpower my jaded perceptions. Finally, although formatting can be really neat for bringing out patterns in your code, if you even HAVE patterns in your code you're probably not doing it right. Whenever you have patterns in your code, look for a refactoring opportunity. Try to identify data and pull it out, then factor out the repeated parts of the pattern to be a loop of some sort that consumes the data. By the way, your first example was data, not code--data very much needs formatting as well--maybe even more so.
