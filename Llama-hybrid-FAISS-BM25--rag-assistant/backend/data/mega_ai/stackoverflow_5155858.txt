Deinterlace tv tuner output in DirectshowNet

I am developing a tv tuner capture application in c#. I'm using DirectShowNet for it and my device is AverMedia Super 009. I am using capturegraphbuilder.renderstream() method and i'm using capture pin and not preview pin. Also I have used vmr9 renderer. But the output i'm getting is interlaced i.e whenever their is motion on the screen, picture appears as toothed edge, so I want to deinterlace it. On VMR9's input pin I'm getting it's format as 'FORMAT_VideoInfo'. When I checked the "videoHeader.InterlaceFlags & AMInterlace.IsInterlaced", it shows video is not interlaced. According to whatever i have read on the internet, I cannot deinterlace FORMAT_VideoInfo so, I have to convert it to FORMAT_VideoInfo2. So any one knew the method to convert videoinfo to videoinfo2. I have also used some Software Deinterlaced Filter like AlparySoft, ffdshow, DScaler. But Still the moving parts appears as toothed edged. So pls guide me how should I deinterlace the graph. Thanks, Ganesh
