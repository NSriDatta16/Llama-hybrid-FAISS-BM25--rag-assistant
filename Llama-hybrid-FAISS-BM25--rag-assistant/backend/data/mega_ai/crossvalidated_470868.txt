Formally show that $MLE_{unconstrained} \ge MLE_{constrained}$

This makes perfect sense - If a model doesn't even assume some structure on the data, then for every value of a predictor, e.g. $x_i$ , the MLE is simply the point in that position $\hat \mu_i = y_i$ (or the average of all points with the same predictor). Yet if you impose some structure on the data, say a linear line, your MLE will be shifted: Question is - how do I formalize this in the language of Math?
