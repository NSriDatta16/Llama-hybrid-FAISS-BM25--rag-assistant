Sorting words (not lines) in VIM

The built-in VIM :sort command sorts lines of text. I want to sort words in a single line, e.g. transform the line b a d c e f to a b c d e f Currently I accomplish this by selecting the line and then using :!tr ' ' '\n' | sort | tr '\n' ' ' , but I'm sure there's a better, simpler, quicker way. Is there? Note that I use bash so if there's a shorter and more elegant bash command for doing this it's also fine. EDIT: My use-case is that I have a line that says SOME_VARIABLE="one two three four etc" and I want the words in that variable to be sorted, i.e. I want to have SOME_VARIABLE="etc four one three two" . The end result should preferably be mappable to a shortcut key as this is something I find myself needing quite often.
