Searching for a string with / does not select it - it only highlights it. To select a region of text click and drag the mouse over it or use the v , V or ctrl-v keys in normal mode (to select a normal region, by lines or rectangular region respectively) then navigate with the usual movement keys to extend the selection. This will put you into visual selection mode. Once you have some text highlighted and are in visual selection mode you can use the normal editing commands to change the highlighted text, e.g. c will delete the text and put you into insert mode, y will yank the text, gU will change the text uppercase, g? will ROT13 it, etc. Once you have entered the edit command you will go back into normal mode and the visual highlight will vanish. You can reselect the same region with gv .
