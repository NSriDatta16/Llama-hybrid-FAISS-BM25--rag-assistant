How do I create a text field or label that resizes based on how much text is in it?

Possible Duplicate: How do I wrap text in a UITableViewCell without a custom cell I've seen at least one application that uses a grouped UITableView with a cell containing paragraphs of text, and the cell is taller or shorter based on the length of the text, but I don't quite get how this is done. How does one, given a variable width font, figure out how high a UITextField or something needs to be in order to display all of the text contained in it without reducing the point size of the font?
