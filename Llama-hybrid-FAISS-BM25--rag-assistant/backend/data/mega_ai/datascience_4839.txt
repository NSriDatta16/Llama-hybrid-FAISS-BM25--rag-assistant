Let me assume you intend to use Python libraries to analyze the data, since you are using Scrapy to gather the data. If this is true, then a factor to consider for storage would be compatibility with other Python libraries. Of course, plain text is compatible with anything. But e.g. Pandas has a host of IO tools that simplifies reading from certain formats. If you intend to use scikit-learn for modeling, then Pandas can still read the data in for you, if you then cast it from a DataFrame to a Numpy array as an intermediate step. These tools allow you to read CSV and JSON, but also HDF5 ... particularly, I would draw your attention to the experimental support for msgpack , which seems to be a binary version of JSON . Binary means here that the stored files will be smaller and therefore faster to read and write. A somewhat similar alternative is BSON , which has a Python implementation â€” no Pandas or Numpy involved. Considering these formats only makes sense if you intend to give at least some formatting to the stored text, e.g. storing the post title separately from the post content, or storing all posts in a thread in order, or storing the timestamp ... If you considered JSON at all, then I suppose this is what you intended. If you just intend to store the plain post contents, then use plain text.
