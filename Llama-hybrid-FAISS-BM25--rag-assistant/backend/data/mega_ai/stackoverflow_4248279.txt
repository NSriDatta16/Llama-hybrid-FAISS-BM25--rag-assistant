The problem is that you're trying to make E extend TextFragmentMode and Enum , which aren't related types. What type E would satisfy both constraints? I suspect you want two type parameters, something like this: public class TextFragment , M extends TextFragmentMode > Now you have each constraint expressed on a different type parameter, and they both make sense - you can definitely find an E which is an enum, and an M which is a TextFragmentMode . However, it's pretty complicated... ... do you definitely need it to be this generic? What will you be doing with M in the class? Could you not just take a TextFragmentMode as a constructor parameter (or whatever) and make it generic in one type parameter again?
