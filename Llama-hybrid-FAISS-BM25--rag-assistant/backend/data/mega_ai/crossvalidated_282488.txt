It is well known that logic gates NOT, AND, OR can all be done with very simple neural networks (NN), and that you can build a complete arithmetic calculator with logic gates using binary numbers as input. Therefore you should be able to create a NN to calculate n modulo k, for any n and k numbers expressed in base 2. If you wish to calculate n modulo k for a fixed k number (for example k = 4) you can actually create an extremely simple NN that does that: express the input number n in base k, and ignore all digits other than the lowest rank digit, and you have the answer!
