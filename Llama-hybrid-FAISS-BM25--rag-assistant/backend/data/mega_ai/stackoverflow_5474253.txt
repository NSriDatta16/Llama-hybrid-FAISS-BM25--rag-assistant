As a rough rule of thumb, storage engines will usually try to hold table records in as fixed a format as possible. As long as it knows the length of each field, it will mostly be a list of the total lengths of the fields for each row, plus additional bookkeeping data, like index links, FK links etc. Large fields ( binary , text , large varchar arrays) are held as pointers in the record itself, and the data is stored at the end of the file. Twice the indirection, but it's easier to increase the size on disk when needed (at the risk of wasting space). varchar specifically usually has a fixed, small buffer in the record in case it's small, and only uses the larger record at the end when the smaller one isn't sufficient. But yes, you shouldn't need to worry about this. If you do then you're doing something wrong.
