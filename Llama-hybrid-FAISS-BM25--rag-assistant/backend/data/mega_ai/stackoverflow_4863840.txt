It depends a lot on what you are trying to do. For example, to give a yet given example, you could imagine counting the elements in one but not both sets (length of the symmetric difference of two sets) - if the numbers correspond to measurements, it would be obviously very bad. You say time series, so can we assume the order matters ? For time series, it is often beneficial to compute things in the spectral domain, which is something else to consider. Something with a single number is unlikely to give you much information
