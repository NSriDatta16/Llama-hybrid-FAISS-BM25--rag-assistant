I can see your concern about SBT still using 2.7.7 internally, but it doesn't really matter since SBT downloads that version on its own. You do not have to install 2.7.7 or anything, just forget about it and pretend your environment is pure Scala 2.8. The configuration file that holds the SBT version setting is: project/build.properties . The content looks like this: project.organization=com.ab.web project.name=cool_proj sbt.version=0.7.4 project.version=1.0 build.scala.versions=2.8.0 project.initialize=false When you want to move up to the next SBT version, just change 0.7.4 to that version and SBT will update itself. Eventually SBT will use some other Scala version internally, but this will not matter to the user.
