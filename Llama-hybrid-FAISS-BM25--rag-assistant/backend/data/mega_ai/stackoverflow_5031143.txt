css margin-top property only works if border is declared

Well, It has been sometime since this keep popping in and I never had the time to ask why: so here is my very simple HTML: Page Title div{ width: 200px; background: green; } p{ background: yellow; margin: 40px; } Testing nothing particular, only a simple page with a div and a paragraph inside that div. but you can notice that on the css I declared the paragraph to stay away 40px from divs bounds...and this happens That's right...top and bottom margin being ignored.... but then if I add a 1px red border to the div like: div{ width: 200px; background: green; border: 1px solid red; } here's what I get: so yes, it really sounds weird for me...this is happening in safari, but I am sure it will happen the same on other browsers...my question would be..why this is happening? Is there any way to fix it? Thanks in advance
