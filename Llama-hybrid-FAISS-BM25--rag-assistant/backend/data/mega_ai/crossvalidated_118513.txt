Algorithm recommendation for string classification

I have numerous (hundreds to low-thousands) of pre-classified short strings of text, each string is just a few words long, some just a single word. The strings have been divided into a few dozen different categories, the number of strings in each category is quite variable - some categories have just a single string in them and some have hundreds. I am looking for a good algorithm to help match new strings to one of the categories. My only previous experience with this type of problem was using a Naive Bayesian Classifier, but given the 'unbalanced' nature of the data I'm not sure it would be the best fit in this case (perhaps I'm wrong?). I'm looking for something that is relatively easy to implement myself - this is partly a learning exercise, so I would prefer recommendations that don't involve just plugging in a library.
