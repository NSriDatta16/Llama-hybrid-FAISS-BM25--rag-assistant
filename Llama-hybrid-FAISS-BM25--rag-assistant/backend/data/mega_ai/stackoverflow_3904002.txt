Multi-targeting is your best bet. There is an article explaining this in Visual Studio from Microsoft at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921092(PandP.20).aspx Basically, you create both your Silverlight and standard .NET class libraries, each with a different name, and then include the same files into each. Usually the files are actually only in one of the class libraries and then soft linked in the second one. The key is to ensure that the code in your files is compatible with both runtimes. If there needs to be separate implementation for some of your methods depending on the runtime then you need to separate these with pragmas (i.e. #ifdef SILVERLIGHT...). If you're only doing data structures, however, there should be no issues as long as Silverlight supports the objects you are using.
