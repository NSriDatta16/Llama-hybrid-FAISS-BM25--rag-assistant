If you are an Emacs user, you may find org-mode 's markup to your liking. It has very nice support for tables, coordinates well with other Emacs modes like the spreadsheet, and has good export of images to HTML. Cf. the fine manual's HTML-export section . org-mode files are editable outside Emacs, for team members who do not use it, although the previewing and embedding of other Emacs modes can, naturally, only be done with Emacs.
