Design pattern for this application?

You're writing an application that manages online courses. A course is completed in many different ways. A user must do one or more of the follow to complete the course: spend x amount of hours in the course take a test, and pass the test (a passing score could be different for every course) take all the lessons in a course some other requirements you don't know about yet When a course is completed, some event needs to happen. The event depends on the course. One or more of the following may need to happen: A custom certificate is created for the user An organization is alerted via email, HTTP callback, or something else some other requirements you don't know about yet Many of the courses are almost identical with respect to their requirements, but some are completely unique. There are a lot of courses, upwards of 50, and more are always being added. How would you design an application like this? Is there a design pattern you can use to eliminate redundant code, and make it easy to add/edit courses?
