You need to impute other features if you want to use the same model. Otherwise, the model won't accept your input. Typically, ML models don't decide to use or not use an information depending on its availability. You'll either construct a new model using only age as a feature, or impute the features (e.g. mean substitution) and use the XGBoost with age and imputed features models that predict (another kind of imputation) other features from age and then input your predictions into your final XGBoost model,
