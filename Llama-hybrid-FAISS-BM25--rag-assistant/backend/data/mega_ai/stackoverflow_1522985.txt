i once worked on an application that used really large numbers (but didnt need good precision). What we did was store the numbers as logarithms since you can store a pretty big number as a log10 within an int. Think along this lines before resorting to bit stuffing or some complex bit representations. I am not too good with complex math, but i reckon there are solutions which are elegant when storing numbers with millions of bits of precision.
