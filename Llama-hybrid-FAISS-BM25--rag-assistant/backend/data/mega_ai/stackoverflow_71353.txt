I've done quite a bit lately with Java agents on Domino servers. The Domino 8.5 server supports Java 6 and its embedded so it won't take someone with a bit of Domino development experience long to put together an agent that runs when new mail arrives. In LotusScript its even easier but that needs more specialised skills which you'd probably need to get a contractor in to provide. The limitation your likely to encounter concerns the extracted file, you can easily place it on the Domino server's file structure but you may be limited by the OS security from placing it on a different server.
