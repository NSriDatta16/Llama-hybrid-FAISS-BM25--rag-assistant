Using Accuracy to evaluate clustering performance

Can I use accuracy, sensitivity, specificitity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value when i'm doing unsupervised classification (clustering) or do I have to limit my clustering evaluation to average silhouette width? if you wonder how come I'm talking about accuracy while working on clustering, it's just because i have the actual real labels of all my subjects (healthy and sick) and I just want to see how well the clustering predicted the real labels with a specific variable. And please, if you have other relevant evaluation criteria do not hesitate!
