In which language for example in c# you can do it simply as bellow: var strstr = "abcdacdc"; var sortedString = new string(strstr .OrderByDescending(x => strstr.Count(p=>p==x)) .Distinct().ToArray()); the algorithm is obvious (in for loop you can do the same). Edit: first we sort all the character of string by their count, after that we going to use characters without their repeated items(Distinct method). private struct CharCount { public int count; public char ch; } List sortedChars = new List (); for(int i=0;i x.ch == strstr[i]) x.count).Select(x=>x.ch).ToArray()); You can implement GetCharCount method like your way, array of 26 character and ..., So above algorithms first for loop is O(n^2) and last paragraph (sorting) is O(n log (n)) in all is O(n^2). You can simply change last paragraph as a way you want (in your specific language).
