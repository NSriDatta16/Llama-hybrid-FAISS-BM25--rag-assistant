You seem to be getting it. PCA and UMAP give functions that can be applied to new data. In that sense, you can learn a PCA or UMAP transformation for several folds and then apply that transformation to new data. Unfortunately, t-SNE does not work this way; t-SNE works on all data at once and does not produce a function to apply to new data. Thus, t-SNE is not a viable option for cross-validation where you apply a learned function to new data.
