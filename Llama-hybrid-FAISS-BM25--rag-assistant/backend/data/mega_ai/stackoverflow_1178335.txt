In Python 2.4, how can I strip out characters after ';'?

Let's say I'm parsing a file, which uses ; as the comment character. I don't want to parse comments. So if I a line looks like this: example.com. 600 IN MX 8 s1b9.example.net ; hello! Is there an easier/more-elegant way to strip chars out other than this: rtr = '' for line in file: trig = False for char in line: if not trig and char != ';': rtr += char else: trig = True if rtr[max(rtr)] != '\n': rtr += '\n'
