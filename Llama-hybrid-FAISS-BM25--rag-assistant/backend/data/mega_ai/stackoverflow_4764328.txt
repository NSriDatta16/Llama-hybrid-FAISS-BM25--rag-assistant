Map SQL table rows to C++ structures

I'm trying to implement some kind of persistent storage of C++ structures into an SQLite database. It looks nice in the beginning but then it becomes complicated with all those SQL requests, data binds and manual getting field values one after another. Ideally I'd like to have some kind of mapping from a table row in SQLite to a C++ structure, with a possibility of running SQL requests on that. On the other hand, I'd still like to keep it general enough to be able to run more complex requests with joins etc. I even thought that an external utility that would auto-generate the corresponding C++/SQL glue code could be helpful. What would be the right way to do this kind of mapping? I've heard people suggesting boost::serialization or Google's protocol buffers, would this be a much better option for what I want, or maybe there are some other good options?
