Yes, it seems that you have to add it to some of the individual handles themselves. That's because the handle is the first one that is loaded. The handle is only read later. If you check the file design/frontend/base/default/layout/customer.xml you will see that this very same handle sets a different template than the one. Look at this example of the order that the layout handles are read by Magento for the "Forgot Password" page: 1. default 2. STORE_default 3. THEME_frontend_default_babel 4. customer_account_forgotpassword 5. customer_logged_out There you can see why the handle's template setting is overridden. I recommend you use the Layout Viewer module for Magento by Alan Storm: http://alanstorm.com/layouts_blocks_and_templates
