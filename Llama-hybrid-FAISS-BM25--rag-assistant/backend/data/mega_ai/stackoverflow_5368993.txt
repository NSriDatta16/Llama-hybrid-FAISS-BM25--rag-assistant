Web app administration console

We have a web app that has so far been used by a single organization. We would now like to provide it as a service to more customers. An administration system is now needed, to manage the setup for new customers. I believe I have the app itself pretty much covered (that is, I can see what features need to be made customizable, etc) â€” I'm more concerned with back-end stuff for our own use, to quickly identify problems, and be able to easily offer support for common problems (whatever they might be). Would very much appreciate hearing about any related experiences. Basic/example features: signup (creates new account, sends activation email, etc) track billing status log login problems usage stats
