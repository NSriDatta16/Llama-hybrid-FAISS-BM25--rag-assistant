Using PCA to reduce dimensionality for a predictive machine learning regression model?

I'm currently working with a dataset of 4000 molecules and their values for a given physical constant. I use the molecules to calculate ~1400 descriptors, then use the descriptors to predict the constants via ML algorithms from scikit-learn. When using PCA, my understanding is the principal components are constructed from the whole dataset - I can then split the principal components into training and testing sets for use with a regression model (eg scikit-learn's GradientBoostingRegressor). If I want to use the resulting model to predict targets for new molecules with no associated constant, can PCA still be applied? I can still calculate the original 1400 descriptors, but I'm not sure if the PCA steps can/should be completed without retraining the predictive model on the new output.
