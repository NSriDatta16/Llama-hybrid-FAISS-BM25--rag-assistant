Time Series Simulation Design

I want to Compare methods (Such as exponential smoothing methods, ARIMA models, artificial neural networks, grey-Markov model) to forecast short time series using a detailed simulation study. How can I generate a simulated short time series data to compare the methods? OR, How can I get rid of the bias if using ARIMA models to generate simulated data?
