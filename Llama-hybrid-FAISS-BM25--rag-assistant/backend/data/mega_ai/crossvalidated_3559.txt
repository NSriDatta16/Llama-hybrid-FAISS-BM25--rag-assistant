Which pseudo-$R^2$ measure is the one to report for logistic regression (Cox & Snell or Nagelkerke)?

I have SPSS output for a logistic regression model. The output reports two measures for the model fit, Cox & Snell and Nagelkerke . So as a rule of thumb, which of these $R^Â²$ measures would you report as the model fit? Or, which of these fit indices is the one that is usually reported in journals? Some Background: The regression tries to predict the presence or absence of a bird (capercaillie) from some environmental variables (e.g., steepness, vegetation cover, ...). Unfortunately, the bird did not appear very often (35 hits to 468 misses) so the regression performs rather poorly. Cox & Snell is .09, Nagelkerke, .23. The subject is environmental sciences or ecology.
