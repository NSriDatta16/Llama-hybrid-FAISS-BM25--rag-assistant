A question of style/readability regarding the C# "using" statement

I'd like to know your opinion on a matter of coding style that I'm on the fence about. I realize there probably isn't a definitive answer, but I'd like to see if there is a strong preference in one direction or the other. I'm going through a solution adding using statements in quite a few places. Often I will come across something like so: { log = new log(); log.SomeProperty = something; // several of these log.Connection = new OracleConnection("..."); log.InsertData(); // this is where log.Connection will be used ... // do other stuff with log, but connection won't be used again } where log.Connection is an OracleConnection, which implements IDisposable. The neatnik in me wants to change it to: { using (OracleConnection connection = new OracleConnection("...")) { log = new log(); log.SomeProperty = something; log.Connection = conn; log.InsertData(); ... } } But the lover of brevity and getting-the-job-done-slightly-faster wants to do: { log = new log(); log.SomeProperty = something; using (log.Connection = new OracleConnection("...")) log.InsertData(); ... } For some reason I feel a bit dirty doing this. Do you consider this bad or not? If you think this is bad, why? If it's good, why? EDIT: Please note that this is just one (somewhat contrived) example of many. Please don't fixate on the fact that this happens to indicate a logger class with a poorly thought-out interface. This is not relevant to my question, and I'm not at liberty to improve the classes themselves anyway.
