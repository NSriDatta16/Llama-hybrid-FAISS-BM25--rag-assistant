I agree that the repeated measures ANOVA is appropriate for the first hypothesis. For the second hypothesis, I think it might be appropriate to view the outcomes as having binomial distributions, and that you are testing whether one proportion is greater than another. In one case you want to show equivalence. So there you would specify a small delta and show that the difference in the proportions is less than delta. This however would not address the ordering of the proportions by group. So to deal with that another approach would be to fit a logistic regression or a loglinear model to show significant differences in proportion as a function of group (BPD vs OPD and NPG). I would think that regarding the ordering you could set this up as a 2x3 contingency table with the 2 outcomes (remission vs no remission) vs 3 groups BPD, OPD and NPD). You can then apply the cochran-Armitage trend test. I would pick the sample size to be at least large enough to have good power to show that the difference between the "equivalent" groups is less than the prespecified delta that you choose. I hope that the contingency table approach is simple enough to be acceptable to your boss. I can't think of anything simpler that would achieve your objectives.
