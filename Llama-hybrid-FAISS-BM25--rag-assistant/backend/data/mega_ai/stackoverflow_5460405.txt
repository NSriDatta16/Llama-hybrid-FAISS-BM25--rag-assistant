embedding cshtml in dll for MEF pluggable site

I'm trying to get a pluggable archetecture with MEF and MVC3 (cshtml). Everything is compiling and the initial - non plugin page loads. when i try to navigate to the plugin area i get a Value cannot be null. Parameter name: stream error. When i break in the AssemblyResourceVirtualPathProvider.FileExists i see that it returns false for base.FileExists(virtualPath) i have ensured that the path is correct and the view is set as an embeded resource. Is there any way of validating that the view is being added as a resource? a tool to look in dlls perhaps? I can post more code if necessary - please specify if so. thanks [edit - adding code] here is the code for the AssemblyResourceVirtualPathProvider: monobin.com
