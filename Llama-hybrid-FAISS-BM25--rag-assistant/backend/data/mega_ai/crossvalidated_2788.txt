Combining repeated experiments into one dataset

I hope you all won't mind a basic question. We are examining the effects of a compound at various concentration on the behaviour of an organism. The compound is administered once at the beginning of the time course. Observations are made every minute for a period of 2 hours. Each concentration is applied to 12 individuals. If we repeat this experiment with different individuals, what is the best way to combine the 2 experiments? The issue that we're having is that although the distribution and shape of the data from each experiment is very similar, the plot of the medians by time is usually significantly shifted up or down between exp1 and exp2. It will no doubt be very evident that I'm unskilled in statistics. If this question needs more information to be answerable, let me know. Thanks, Jen
