I've needed this before, and it's not easy to do. I ended up writing my own graph component because of this requirement. It turned out better in the end because I put in all the features we needed. Basically, you need to get the range of data (min and max possible/needed index values), subdivide it into segments (let's say 100 segments), and then determine a value for each segment by some algorithm (average value, median value, etc.). Then you plot based on those summarized 100 elements. This is much faster than trying to plot millions of points :-). So what I am saying is similar to what you are saying. You mention you do not want to plot every X element because there might be a long stretch of time (index values on the x-axis) between elements. What I am saying is that for each subdivision of data determine what is the best value, and take that as the data point. My method is index value-based, so in your example of no data between the 0 sec and 10-sec index values I would still put data points there, they would just have the same values among themselves. The point is to summarize the data before you plot it. Think through your algorithms to do that carefully, there are lots of ways to do so, choose the one that works for your application. You might get away with not writing your own graph component and just write the data summarization algorithm.
