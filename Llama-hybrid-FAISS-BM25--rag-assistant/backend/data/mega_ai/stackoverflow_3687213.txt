building linux kernels

i Just got the book Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love . It has lots of places where you are required to modify and build the kernel . So how should i go with it . Is it better to use a VM , or should i somehow get a proper test machine for it , since i dont want to goof up on my system and data.
