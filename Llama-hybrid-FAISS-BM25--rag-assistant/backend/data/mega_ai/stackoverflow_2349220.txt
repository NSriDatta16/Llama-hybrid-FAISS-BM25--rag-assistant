The closest I can think of is the "scrap page" in eclipse. Don't think you can debug though. If I were you, I'd use moreUnit plugin + JUnit (+ preferably maven). That way, you can not only write some tests quickly, but they will be organized so that you can have a nice unit test battery afterwards...
