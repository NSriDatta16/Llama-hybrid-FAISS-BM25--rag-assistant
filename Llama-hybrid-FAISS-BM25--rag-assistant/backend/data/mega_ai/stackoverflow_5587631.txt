Milimetric actually got it right, I believe - you're missing the semicolon in your jsonData object literal definition. That combined with JavaScript's auto-semi-colon insertion and the way your braces {} are written to begin on a new line, is very likely the problem. Put in a semi-colon in there and it should work fine. In other C-like languages, putting the opening brace on a new line or on the same line is a personal preference but in JavaScript, it does make a difference and so I'd recommend you make a conscious effort to put opening braces on the same line. http://encosia.com/2011/03/21/in-javascript-curly-brace-placement-matters-an-example/ http://robertnyman.com/2008/10/16/beware-of-javascript-semicolon-insertion/
