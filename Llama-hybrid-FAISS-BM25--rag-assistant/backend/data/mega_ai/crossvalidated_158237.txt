Box Muller vs Numpy?

I used the Box Muller transform and pythons uniform random number generator to sample random numbers in a given interval [a,b]. Here's the approach I used: Note: I know the average and the standard deviation. a = mean - 3*std_dev b = mean + 3*std_dev summa = 0 begin loop generate 2 random numbers r1, r2 run function to calculate the Box Mueller transform (z1, z2) a1 = a + (b-a)*z1 a2 = a + (b-a)*z2 summa = summa + a1 + a2 end loop after 1000 samples find average of summa ** I do this twice since I need to calculate 2 values (namely voltage and current) for two different values of mean and standard deviation. This is then used to calculate resistance R and its deviation from a given value. Now, I tried this with the numpy sampling approach. To my surprise, my values were about +0.08 off. Numpy gave me a value closer to the mean. My question is that whether this is should be expected, or am I doing something wrong?
