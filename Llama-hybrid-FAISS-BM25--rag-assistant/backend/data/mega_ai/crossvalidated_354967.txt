There are both statistical and practical issues here. LASSO is a well established procedure for selecting a predictively useful subset from a large number of features. In your application, with a yes/no outcome, this would be done in the context of a logistic regression model. The number of features selected depends on a penalty factor, whose value is typically chosen to optimize a measure of performance as assessed by cross-validation. See An Introduction to Statistical Learning for an introduction to this and to many other modeling approaches. Note that AUC or classification accuracy are not usually the best measures of performance for selecting the penalty factor; minimizing deviance, the default in the glmnet package in R, is preferred. With a logistic model developed this way, providing probabilities of class membership instead of a simple yes/no prediction, you can trade off between false-positive and false-negative classifications based on their different costs. A potential difficulty with LASSO or any other feature-selection method is that the particular features selected may vary widely from study to study. With more features than samples there are necessarily correlations among different features, so those chosen from a set of highly correlated features will depend on the luck of the draw in terms of the samples, random analysis errors, and so forth. That's not necessarily a drawback for predictive ability, but it does mean that you should refrain from claiming that the selected features are the only important features. If you are trying to develop a limited test panel to replace a large-scale analysis like the microarrays for which limma was designed, you also need to take into account practical issues in designing and performing the new tests. For example, in microarray studies, a gene high up on the differentially expressed list or selected by LASSO might only be expressed at a very low level and thus difficult to use in practice. So there will necessarily be some back-and-forth between statistics and experiments in coming up with a useful limited panel of predictors. You might want to read this paper on breast cancer classification, in particular on tests to predict the probability of disease recurrence. Molecular classifications originally developed from microarray data have subsequently been reduced to small panels of genes whose expression can be determined with commercial tests on standard pathology specimens. As the paper notes, few particular genes are shared among the competing commercial tests, emphasizing the somewhat arbitrary nature of the selection of a useful set of features from a very large set.
