Of the two, Abs(CB-1BA) would be correct, since there was a change of .5 between the two readings. EDIT : To make it more readable, and assuming you're getting double values, you'd do something like this, but with error checking, and probably making the .25 a variable. double[] values = Oscillator(PoFast, PoSlow, PoSmooth); double currentBar = values[0]; double oneBarAgo = values[3]; if (currentBar > oneBarAgo && Math.Abs(currentBar - oneBarAgo) > .25) { // do something }
