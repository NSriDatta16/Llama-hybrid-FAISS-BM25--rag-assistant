The following technique actually uses more ink but is relevant to making a print version of a page. Let's say that there is a page where the hyperlinks actually are very important to the content -- say, it's a listing of useful websites for topic xyz. Not sure why someone would print this out, but if they do, a bunch of underlined sentences isn't going to help much. You can actually use CSS to print out the urls . For posterity, the code is a:link:after, a:visited:after { content:" [" attr(href) "] "; } I'd recommend only doing it for selected links by using a class, something like a.printable:link:after, a.printable:visited:after { content:" [" attr(href) "] "; } I've always liked angled brackets for this purpose, so I'd probably rewrite it a.printable:link:after, a.printable:visited:after { content:" "; } It's important to keep in mind that entities aren't allowed in the "content:" value in css. Basically you just put in the raw text that you want. Also, for print you should probably use pt rather than px or em for sizing. You can make the size smaller than the screen equivalent. The default size is often set at 12 point but you can easily make it 11 point and still maintain plenty of readability. That will save a fair amount of ink (and paper!) in the long run. With the possible exception of content-graphics (in other words, graphics which make up the meaningful content of the page, as opposed to graphics used for layout, beautification or eye candy), almost no non-text should make it to the page. Borders and backgrounds should be eliminated except in rare occasions (such as when attention must be drawn to a section of text, although simply setting it in bold would probably be just as effective, and again save ink). If you are using css to make fancy looking s, get rid of the styling altogether when printing and just use the built in styling, or replace all s with a plain black or gray line (and, again, use pt , as in 2pt, rather than px , to change the height). I can't think of many situations where you'd have content in an iframe that you'd want to be printed. If that's the case, it may very well be worthwhile to make a printable version of the page that takes the content out of the iframe and directly into the document, making it far better for printing.
