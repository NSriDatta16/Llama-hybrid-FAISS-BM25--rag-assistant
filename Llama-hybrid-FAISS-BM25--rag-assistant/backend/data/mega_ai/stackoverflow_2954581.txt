Importing ctype; embedding python in C++ application

I'm trying to embed python within a C++ based programming language (CCL: The compuatational control language, not that any of you have heard of it). Thus, I don't really have a "main" function to make calls from. I have made a test .cc program with a main, and when I compile it and run it, I am able to import my own python modules and system modules for use. When I embed my code in my CCL-based program and compile it (with g++), it seems I have most functionality, but I get a RUNTIME error: ImportError: /usr/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload/_ctypes.so: undefined symbol: PyType_GenericNew This is the code that is executed at Runtime error. void FFSim::initCKBot (){ Py_Initialize(); PyRun_SimpleString("execfile('logical.py')"); } logical.py imports modules, one of which attempts to execute 'from cytpes import *', which throws the runtime error. Can someone explain this to me and how to go about solving it? It seems like I've linked the objects correctly when compiling the c++ aspect of the code. Thanks.
