It looks like most of the code out there was written before "Open Source" really meant anything. I asked Mr Google : Craig Reynolds's Boids page has a bunch of links for various languages and some mostly-original Lisp. Embedding a Lisp interpreter should not be that hard. Christopher Kline, C++, Not-For-Profit . Licence terms for commercial apps negotiable with the author. Tom Bak, Thong Chau, Visual C++/OpenGL/GLUT, no licence . You could try contacting them. Robert Platt, VC++/D3D, no licence . You could try contacting him too. You're unlikely to find anything specifically "for the iOS" (or even written in Objective-C), but C and C++ versions should be easy to port. .NET versions should be easy enough to run using MonoTouch.
