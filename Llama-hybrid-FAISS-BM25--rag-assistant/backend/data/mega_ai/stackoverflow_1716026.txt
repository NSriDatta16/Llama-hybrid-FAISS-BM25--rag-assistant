Based on your description I sketched a simplified model and combined it with the observation pattern . This should enable you to track various item properties and user preferences for viewing them. Admittedly, the Preference table may grow large, but data has to be stored somewhere anyway, and you may retrieve it using sql, which simplifies the business layer. - Organization and person are types of users . User table has columns common to all users , while Organization and Person tables have columns specific to each one. - A stock item (widget class) can be found at several sites (warehouses); a site stores many items . - One item belongs to one user ; a user can own many items . - Measurement and trait are types of observations. Measurement is a numeric observation, like height. Trait is a descriptive observation, like color. - An observation is of a specific type (height, weight, color), there can be many observations of the same type . - One item (widget class) can have many observations , an observation relates to one item only. - A user can prefer to display many observations ; an observation may be preferred (to display) by many users . UPDATE We could simplify user's subscription to item details (observations) by tagging observation type , for example height, weight, width would be tagged with: all, dimensions, physical. Some other tags would be: accounting_interest, tracking_specific, etc. A user would then subscribe to tags only. Tags (could) form a hierarchy with ALL at the top. - One observation type (height, weight, color) can have many tags , one tag belongs to many observation types . - Each tag may have a parent tag forming a hierarchy. - A user stores preferences for a set of tags that she usually monitors. UPDATE 2 Now we can sort out who is who and who owns what. In this modification a user (now a person) can work for more than one organization (having several part-time jobs or contracts). An item belongs to a organization now. A logged-in user can see all items from all organization that she works for.
