I am not working at Google, but I think it is some sort of recommendation system based on the words which millions of users searched before. So those people who search for "animals" often search for "wild animals" for example. Like in many online stores they recommend you to buy something in addition to the product you are looking for based on the previous purchases of other users. There are many approaches how to build such recommendation system using machine learning, no one knows for sure what google uses.
