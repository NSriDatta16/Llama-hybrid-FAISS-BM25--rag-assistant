I think you need to ask whether you should write unit tests for private methods? If you write unit tests for your public methods, with a 'reasonable' code coverage, aren't you already testing any private methods that need to be called as a result? Tying tests to private methods will make the tests more brittle. You should be able to change the implementation of any private methods without breaking any tests.
