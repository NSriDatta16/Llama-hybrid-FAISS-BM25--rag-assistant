The New Project and New File commands don't really generate any code ; they fill in templates . You'll need to create your own templates (probably based on Apple's) with the changes you want. In Xcode 3.1 , the stock templates are in /Developer/Library/Xcode . You'll put your modified copies in ~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode . Pay attention to the subfolders of those folders.
