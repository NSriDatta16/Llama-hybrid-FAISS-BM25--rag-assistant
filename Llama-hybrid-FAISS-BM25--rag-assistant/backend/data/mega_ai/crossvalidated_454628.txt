Should data points of a data set be from the same distribution?

My question is with respect to real-world custom data sets used for Machine Learning applications. The collected data set contains numerous audio signals (File1, File2, File3, etc) of a moving machine part captured over different points of time. Features are extracted using basic signal processing techniques such as FFT, signal envelope, etc. The machine is located in the real world and hence the audio signals have noise. Is it possible that the feature set for each data point in the audio signal has different distribution? If so, does this affect the ability of a Random Forest or Neural Network or any other ML model to generate a good fit? Also, is it possible that the audio signals themselves do not share a common distribution due to noise and other environmental factors?
