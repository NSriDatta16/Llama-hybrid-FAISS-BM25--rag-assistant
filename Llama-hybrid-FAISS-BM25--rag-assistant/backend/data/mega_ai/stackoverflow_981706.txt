I'd be extremely careful with whatever trick you decide on. Odds are just as likely google will think you're trying to display different content to the user than to it. I've always believed that Google actually works by rendering the page (possibly using some server-side version of the Chrome rendering engine) and then reads the result back with OCR software to confirm that the text in the source matches what the user would see with JS and frames enabled. Google has always openly warned webmasters not to try serving robots different content to the users, OCR would be the perfect way to find out (especially if your 'verifier' used IE's user-agent string and crawled from IP ranges not registered by Google). Short answer then, serve the decoration as either: an iframe an object an SVG image Since your clearly linking the document into your page google will proably consider it a seperate resource and rate things accordingly, especially if the same text appears on every page. Which brings me to: Are you going to use the same text decor on all/most pages? If so Google will almost certainly treat it as "window dressing" and ignore it (it apparently does this with menus and such).
