C++ Python embedding: Run on machine with no Python?

I'm trying to make a small game that supports Python scripting. I've no problems with using the Python C-API, but I don't know how to ensure that the game will run on a computer with no Python installed. I know I need pythonXY.dll -- what else is there? When I try to run the program it tells me it cannot find encodings.utf_8. I tried copying the encodings/utf_8.py file in the same directory as my program, but the error still pops up.
