Why are exogenous variables not used in inference/recognition networks?

I have been working lately a lot on amortized variational inference. That is, doing variational inference using neural networks to approximate a variational distribution (such as in Kingma and Welling 2013 and Rezende and Mohammed 2014). I have read a lot on the matter and even implemented some of the basic models. I am now wondering why exogenous variables are never used to approximate the variational distribution. I think this would make sense in a lot of models. To give an example, if you wanted to do an economic model at country level of a specific variable (economic growth across time) you could use other country level variables to approximate the variational distribution better. Am I wrong? what am I missing? PS. I know that, for example, the Conditional VAE (Kihyuk et.al. 2015) could count as using exogenous variables in amortized variational inference BUT you are forced to condition both in the inference and generative model...
