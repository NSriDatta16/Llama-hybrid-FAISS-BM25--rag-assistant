Autoencoders allow us to attempt an approximation. For encoder $f: \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^m$ and decoder $g: \mathbb{R}^m \mapsto \mathbb{R}^n$ we can train to have $(g \circ f) (\vec x) \approx \vec x$ . So $f$ is approximately invertible and in that sense is approximately a bijection. For your application you will want to ensure that for your skills data $\vec x$ and band data $\vec y$ that $f(\vec x) \approx \vec y$ , which can be done by adding an additional loss term to your loss function.
