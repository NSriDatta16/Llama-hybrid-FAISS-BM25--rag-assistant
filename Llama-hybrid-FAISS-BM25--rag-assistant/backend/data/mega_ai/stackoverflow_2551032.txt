Querying Access to form columns from records

At work we've got a roster that's historically been maintained in a huge Excel workbook. That's getting a bit fragile because of staff changes and such, so I'm trying to re-implement it robustly as an Access database. I've got a table of People (fields include name and some other attributes of people) and a table of Vacations -- each vacation has a person_ID, a start date and an end date. What I'd ideally like to be able to generate from this is a roster grid like we had in the Excel workbook: Date Person A Person B Person C 01 Jan - - - 02 Jan - - - 03 Jan VAC - - 04 Jan VAC VAC - 05 Jan VAC VAC - 06 Jan - VAC - 07 Jan - - - 08 Jan - - - 09 Jan - - - (In this example the Vactions table has two records -- one for Person A, and one for Person B.) Is that kind of thing possible with Excel? Or am I going to have to write some code? Thanks!
