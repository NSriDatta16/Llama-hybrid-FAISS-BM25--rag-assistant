You can extend myWcfService.FooData with a partial class definition and define FooAverage() in the client, if the original FooAverage() doesn't have any dependencies that prohibit this: partial class FooData { public double FooAverage() { return Math.Average(Numbers); } } But remember that FooData is a data transfer object, and as such does not have any private state, which means that you can put all the data into non-member functions anyway: double average = Math.Average(foodata.Numbers);
