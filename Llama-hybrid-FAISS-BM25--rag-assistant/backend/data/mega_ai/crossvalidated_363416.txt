Performing Scoring Indicator : With principal component

iam trying to generate an engagement indicator from 5 variables which i feel that explained engaged behaviours in my application, for each specific user i will need to score it in an indicator so as to know his engagement with my application. So as to knowing the weights i should give to each variable for obtaining a final number (the number which i going to communicate as the final indicator) i used a principal component analysis. I am going to use the first principal component to know which are the weight i should give to each variable. (It is this logic ok ? i read in this post that it was a good way to know the weights to use https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_to_create_an_index_using_principal_component_analysis_PCA ) The result for my first principal components were variables PC1 PC2 nrosessions 71076.978 901.025 daysofuse -5150.779 -6799.831 searches -20780.789 18889.332 poster -22750.892 -7161.112 reply -22394.516 -5829.414 So PC1 would be my weights for my final indicator, i am thinking to use it in this way final_indicator = 71076.978 (nrosessions) + -5150.779 (daysofuse) + -20780.789 (searches) + -22750.892 (poster) + -22394.516 (reply) I am having difficulties in intrepreting my final result base on the heavy negative weights in poster and repliers, which for my are the guys which i will like to weight much more in my indicator due that i think are those which are my engage with my application
