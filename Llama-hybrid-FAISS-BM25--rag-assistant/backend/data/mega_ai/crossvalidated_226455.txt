You can often tell the seasonal period by the nature of the data. If the process at hand is affected by weather, the period could be 1 year. If it is affected by the working week, the period could be 1 week. If you don't really know, you could estimate the seasonal period(s) using spectral density as described in Rob J. Hyndman "Measuring time series characteristics" . Note that the data can have multiple seasonalities, e.g. both yearly and weekly. If you are going to fit a SARIMA model later on, there is something to keep in mind. SARIMA models don't work well with very long period such as 365 days per year. For data with long seasonal periods, Rob J. Hyndman suggests in "Forecasting with long seasonal periods" to use Fourier terms in a regression with ARMA errors instead of a SARIMA model. That is also attractive as you may have as many seasonal periods as you like, while SARIMA allows for one (and TBATS allows for two, if I am not mistaken). Moreover, you could include one-offs like Easter straightforwardly besides the Fourier terms, while that could not be done in SARIMA.
