When you say you cannot access the agent, are you getting an error? You do not need to loop through the agent collection looking for the first agent - you can use GetAgent("agentname") and then Agent.run(). If your Java code seems to be finding the agent and running it, but nothing happens, check the log.nsf database on your server for possible errors
