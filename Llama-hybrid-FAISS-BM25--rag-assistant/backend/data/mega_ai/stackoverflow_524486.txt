I wouldn't have thought that signal strength would work well: too many things interfere with it (like walls). But you might try measuring ping times, especially if you threw a hundred pings at the AP and took the average. Most of the time will be the AP digesting the ping and generating the pong, but there will also be a time-of-flight component for the signals. If the AP response time is consistent then you should be able to subtract it and hence compute the distance to the AP. By well-known hyperbolic maths you can then find your position from 3 or 4 APs.
