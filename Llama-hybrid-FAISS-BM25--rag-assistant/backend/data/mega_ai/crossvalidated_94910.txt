There's 2 good options that I've seen: Convert each zipcode to a dummy variable. If you have a lot of data, this can be a quick and easy solution, but you won't be able to make predictions for new zip codes. If you're worried about the number of features, you can add some regularization to your model to drop some of the zipcodes out of the model. Use the latitude and longitude of the center point of the zipcode as variables. This works really well in tree-based models, as they can cut up the latitude/longitude grid into regions that are relevant to your target variable. This will also allow you to make predictions for new zipcodes, and doesn't require as much data to get right. However, this won't work well for linear models. Personally, I really like tree-based models (such as random forest or GBMs), so I almost always choose option 2. If you want to get really fancy, you can use the lat/lon of the center of population for the zipcode, rather than the zipcode centroid. But that can be hard to get ahold of.
