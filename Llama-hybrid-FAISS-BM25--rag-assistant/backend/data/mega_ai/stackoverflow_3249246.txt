Scaling a polygon toward an edge?

I know that to scale verticies I simply have to multiply by a scale factor. But I noticed that most vector drawing applications show the shapes bounding box and by dragging one of the edge it will scale the geometry toward the opposite edge, then if you go past this edge it will end up mirroring the geometry on that axis. How is scaling toward an edge done? Ex: If you select the topmost edge of a circle, it will scale toward the bottom edge of its bounding box until it looks like nothing, sort of like a raindrop that collapses when it hits the ground. I hope this is clear enough. Thanks
