Appropriate sample size for model validation with RMSE errors

I have been looking over the internet for a way to determine the appropriate sample size for a validation experiment that validates the RMSE results from a deep learning (CNN) model. The network was evaluated with 40 subjects and resulted in a mean and standard deviation for the error ( mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2 ). I want to determine how many samples I need to have a 95% confidence in the results. There are numerous functions out there that are telling me different results, and I am not sure which to use or what would be an appropriate sample size. I am also pretty new to research statistics. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
