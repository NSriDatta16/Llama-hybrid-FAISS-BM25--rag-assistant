You run the risk of fragmenting your memory if you do this. This causes performance degredation and for 32 bit systems can lead to memory shortages due to lack of availability of large contiguous blocks of memory. I'm guessing you are increasing the length of an array by 1 each time round. If so then you are far better keeping track of a capacity and length and only increasing the capacity when you need a length that exceeds the current capacity. When you increase the capacity do so by a larger amount than just 1. Of course, the standard containers will do this sort of thing for you so if you can use them, it's best to do so.
