I think Insanodag is right. I quote Jollife's Principal Component Analysis: When PCA is used as a descriptive technique, there is no reason for the variables in the analysis to be of any particular type. [...] the basic objective of PCA - to summarize most of the 'variation' that is present in the original set of $p$ variables using smaller number of derived varaibles - can be achieved regardless of the nature of the original variables. Multiplying the data matrix with the loadings matrix will give the desired result. However, I've had some problems with princomp() function so I used prcomp() instead. One of the return values of the function prcomp() is x , which is activated using retx=TRUE . This x is the multiplication of the data matrix by the loadings matrix as stated in the R Documentation: rotation: the matrix of variable loadings (i.e., a matrix whose columns contain the eigenvectors). The function ‘princomp’ returns this in the element ‘loadings’. x: if ‘retx’ is true the value of the rotated data (the centred (and scaled if requested) data multiplied by the ‘rotation’ matrix) is returned. Hence, ‘cov(x)’ is the diagonal matrix ‘diag(sdev^2)’. For the formula method, ‘napredict()’ is applied to handle the treatment of values omitted by the ‘na.action’. Let me know if this was useful, or if it needs further corrections. -- I.T. Jollife. Principal Component Analysis. Springer. Second Edition. 2002. pp 339-343.
