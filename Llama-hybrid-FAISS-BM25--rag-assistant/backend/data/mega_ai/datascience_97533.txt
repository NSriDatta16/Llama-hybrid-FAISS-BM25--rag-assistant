It depends on the type of ranking that you want to achieve, for example if the unlabeled scraped data can be ranked by sentiment, you can use Transfer Learning models to give each document a sentiment score which will serve as a rank if you return the sentiment score probability instead of having "positive" and "negative" tags. Transfer Learning models usually give a good result but it's really up to your criteria for ranking the documents, and you should pay attention to the quality of the scraped data, it affects heavily the pre-trained model results. Now since you have mentioned MS macro dataset, i'm assuming that your documents are maybe related to Question and Answer datasets, I think you should also take a look at The Stanford Question Answering Dataset .
