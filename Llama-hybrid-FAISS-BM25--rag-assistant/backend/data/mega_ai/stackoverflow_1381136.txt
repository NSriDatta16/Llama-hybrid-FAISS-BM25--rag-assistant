When you fork off processes the WILL be running concurrently. But note that unless you have enough available idle processors, they might not actually be executing concurrently, which shouldn't really matter... Your second paragraph makes it seem like you aren't understanding how fork works, you have to check the return code to see if you are in the parent or in the forked process. So you would have the parent run a loop to fork off 10 processes, and in the children you do whatever you wanted to do concurrently.
