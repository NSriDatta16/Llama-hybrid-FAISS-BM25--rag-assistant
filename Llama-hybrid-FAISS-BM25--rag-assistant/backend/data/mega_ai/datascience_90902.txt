What models should I try with a time series database?

I've acquired and cleaned a dataset that shows statistics from every county in New York State during 2010-2019 focusing on the NYS School Aid correlating it to other growth and criminal statistics. Source County Year AidAmount Population JailPopulation CrimesReported Albany 2010 253982539.0 304086 698 20890.0 Albany 2011 227093331.0 304596 614 20290.0 Albany 2012 226720094.0 305723 622 18940.0 Albany 2013 235041459.0 306589 629 17908.0 ...

Can we predict counties becoming high or low risk overtime? I've done some EDA and now I'm trying to learn more about models and their applications, I want to know what kind of models should I use for this dataset. I know I might use some classification models where I'll create a high risk label for counties that present >0.7 per capita crimes reported and then use education aid per capita as the training samples. As for time series models I'm lost on what ARIMA model should I try, I want to predict Aid Amount, population and criminality values I would appreciate any input you have on this, I would like to learn as many models as possible.
