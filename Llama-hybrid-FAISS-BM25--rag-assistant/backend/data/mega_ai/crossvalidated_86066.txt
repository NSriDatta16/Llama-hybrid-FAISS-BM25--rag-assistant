Centering your set of ${Y_t}$ (i.e. ${Y_t^\ast} = {Y_t} - \mu_{I_i}$) has no influence on the variance. Therefore using centred data and a Inverse Gamma prior $IG(\alpha_0, \beta_0)$ results in an Inverse Gamma posterior with parameters $\alpha_0 + n/2$ and $\beta_0 + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=0}^n (Y_i - \mu_{I_i})^2$, which is equivalent to your idea (apart from the $^2$ you probably just forgot). Aside from this, there is no need to use MCMC estimation when having a closed-form expression for the posterior. You can just draw from the above mentioned distribution - for example in R by using alpha
