OpenMp Coding: warning: ignoring #pragma omp parallel

I am getting this warning during compilation of a C code with OpenMP directives on Linux: warning: ignoring #pragma omp parallel Gcc version is 4.4. Is it only a warning I should not care about? Will the execution be in parallel?. I would like a solution with a some explanation. I have provide -fopenmp with the make command, but gcc doesn't accept that, otherwise for single compilation of file, i.e. gcc -fopenmp works alright.
