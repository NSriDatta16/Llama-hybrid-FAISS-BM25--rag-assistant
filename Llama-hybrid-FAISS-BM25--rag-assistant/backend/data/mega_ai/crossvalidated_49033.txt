As another option here, how about using a multinomial logistic regression (with the outcomes being trauma, [non-elective] caesarean, and no trauma?) I'm not entirely sure if this approach will fully address the issue of bias, but one would get some measures of association about the associations between e.g. fetus size and having a non-elective caesarean section, and could see these side by side with the associations between the same exposure and trauma, and at the least make some qualitative comparisons about magnitudes of effect. [This question was bumped by an answer edit, with an inactive original questioner, so I'm really just floating another idea here (plus I'm interested in this kind of question)]
