density function estimation in r

I firstly generate data from a bivariate normal distribution. Here comes the code. n Now what I want to do is ignore that I know the data if from normal. I would like to approximate the density function from the data I sampled, and compare the estimated model and the true one. I try to search the literature but I did not see any code relevant to this.Do anyone know how to do this in R?Which kind of measure can I use to approximate the density function? The main question is I would like to approximate the density function from the data I sampled before(without knowing that it is normal).I am wondering is there any package or measures that I can do to approximate?Is that solvable? I also read some literature related to Neural Density Estimation which is use neural network to do the density estimation.I am wondering is that a suitable way to do so? I tried to use kernel density estimation and I can draw the density function of the data.But the point is I want to determine what exactly is the density function.
