HTML 5 is more web-application-centric than previous versions of (X)HTML. Perhaps the most important change is Web Forms 2.0 , which adds validation (!), crypto key generating inputs, several date and time inputs, number inputs, email and URL inputs, output elements, and more. There are other things, like the ability to list URLs to pre-cache, a better layout model (header and footer elements), and automatically convertable values: meter and time, e.g., that allow the browser to, say, convert miles to kilometers for display in certain cultures. There are many new elements for things like progress bars, aside (for sidebars), figure, expandable details, menu, and others. Too many people get caught up in the audio, video, and canvas tags, which will significantly simplify media embedding ( today, it's a mess ), and provide better user control. Despite what you may have heard, this doesn't mean the end of Flash or Silverlight, necessarily. These technologies could easily be leveraged by the browser to provide the functionality for these elements, but would have to compete at the user level, rather than at the developer level. It's still pretty controversial, and there's no guarantee that the browsers will implement this stuff completely (optgroup in HTML4 was a fail there), or well (client certificates were a huge fail there), and the spec isn't complete yet, so it may be something to wait a bit more to see if support fully bakes in the next year or so.
