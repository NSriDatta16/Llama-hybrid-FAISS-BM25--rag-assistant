What I do in this situation is add a tab control to the form, put the DGV in one tab, and a label ('Drag Here' or something similar) in the another tab. Hide the tabs. Then if the DGV is empty, show the tab with the label. Just like routeNpingme's answer you would handle the drag/drop event here, load the DGV in the background, and then switch tabs when it is finished loading. This is nice, because you also have the ability to easily switch back and forth between the tabs while in VS Designer.
