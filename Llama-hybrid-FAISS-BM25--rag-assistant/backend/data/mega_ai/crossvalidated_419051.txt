(Apologize in advance for quite late response) To my knowledge, for very sparse data you may want to first try out Truncated Single Value Decomposition (SVD), which is implemented in scikit-learn python library. See sklearn documentation / user guide for detail. There seems to be some research in using Autoencoders for sparse data. This paper proposes a seemingly simple, python-implemented algorithm, and shows it is superior to existing methods including SVD.
