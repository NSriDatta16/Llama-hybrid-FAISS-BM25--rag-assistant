Fastest MySQL storage engine for storing data without concurrency

I'm using a mysql base to store results from various test over a large amount of data (hundred of millions recordings). I'm the only user of the base so there won't be any problem of concurrency. I also want to use simple mathematical functions such as 'avg', 'std' etc What is the best engine in your opinion for such a task? I'm using InnoDB right now and it seems to me a bit heavy.
