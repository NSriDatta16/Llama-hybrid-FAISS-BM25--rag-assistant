Here's my final solution, which uses a prevValue variable but doesn't pollute the global namespace (window) or the dom element's properties. (function() { var input = document.getElementById('input_box'), prevValue; input.onkeyup = function(e) { if ( this.value != prevValue ) { prevValue = this.value; // execute some more code here... } } }()); Notice above that the onkeyup function serves as a closure around the prevValue variable. This prevents the namespace pollution so I don't have to create a global variable or attach a property to the input element itself. This is as elegant as I can get it. I actually wrote mine in jQuery but thought the answer itself should be pure JavaScript...
