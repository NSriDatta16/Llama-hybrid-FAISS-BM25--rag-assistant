@jsk 's answer is mostly correct, but perhaps needs more emphasis on the last sentence: No linear relationship. For example, if y = sin(x) and x goes from 0 to pi, then a linear regression of y on x will have a parameter estimate very very close to 0. In the real world, this might be approximated by the relationship between month of year (1 to 12) and average temperature. There are also some U and inverse U shaped relationships. For example, the relationship between exam score and anxiety is inverse U shaped. $\beta_1$ isn't 0 in this case, but it doesn't reflect the relationship.
