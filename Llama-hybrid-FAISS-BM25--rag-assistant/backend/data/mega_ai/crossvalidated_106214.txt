Where can I use kernels other than Gaussian (like Cauchy, laplacian) in kernel methods in machine learning? Or maybe in kernel density estimation?

In few papers I read that - kernel used doesn't really matter for kernel density estimation but bandwidth of the kernel is the most important factor. But I did not see any mathematical explanation to this and can't completely believe in this.
