You need storage for that pointer. You declared , but did not define it. In the implementation ( .cpp ) file do: A* A::p; Edit 0: By the way, do you really want to override that pointer every time a new instance of your class in created? Seems to me you are looking for the Singleton pattern . Edit 1: You can initialize static variables (and not unlike in Java, come to think of it, though the syntax is different). Say you have a static string member foo of a class X , then your implementation file might contain the following: std::string X::foo = "Happy Leif Erikson Day!"; But be careful - constructors for static objects run before main() is entered and their order between translation units is undefined, which often leads to "static initialization order fiasco" .
