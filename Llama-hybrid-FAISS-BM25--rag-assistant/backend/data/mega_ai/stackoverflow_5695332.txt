I am not sure what you need the app/installation ID for, but you can review the existing possibilities in a great article from Android developers: http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/03/identifying-app-installations.html To sum up: UUID.randomUUID() for creating id on the first time an app runs after installation and simple retrieval afterwards TelephonyManager.getDeviceId() for actual device identifier Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID on relatively modern devices
