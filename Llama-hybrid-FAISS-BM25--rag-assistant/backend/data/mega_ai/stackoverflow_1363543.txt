ScrollPane in Papervision3D

I am having major issues with a ScrollPane component in Papervision3D. This issue has been brought up at a couple of different forums, but not solved: http://osflash.org/pipermail/papervision3d_osflash.org/2009-March/029503.html http://www.nabble.com/ScrollPane-doesn%27t-size-or-display-properly-td22302394.html I have tried dynamically creating a ScrollPane, as well as dragging one onto the stage and it always appears at its default size (100, 100) when added to a MovieClip in a PaperVision3D environment. I can't even get a Tween to work on it's size.
