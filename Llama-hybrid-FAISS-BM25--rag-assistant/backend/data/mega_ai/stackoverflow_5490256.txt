Why does the csExWB2 Pass the Wrong User Agent for IE8

I am using the csExWB2 web browser control with IE8, and I am noticing it is sending the wrong user agent. It send the MSIE 7.0 in the user agent. While I know how fix this for each request issued by the control, I am concerned if there is something bigger happening behind the scenes with it - causing it to think it is IE7 . It seems like the project is not active anymore, and no one has answered this question on their group. http://groups.google.com/group/csexwb/browse_thread/thread/5868cdeea9e63356
