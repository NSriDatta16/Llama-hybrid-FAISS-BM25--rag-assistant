'Non-supported field type change' when modifying a feature

So, now that my previous problem was fixed, I was trying to organize the files a little bit. I found out a 'Note' type field (A multi-line textbox) was supposed to be a Multi-Pick User field. So, I decided to change that. I seemed to change everything, but it just doesn't want to change the type. Which is much a good thing to do, seeing changing from a Note type to a User type is not supported within Sharepoint (I have no clue why, but it's probably some architectural choice). However, I don't mind it if all the existing features get deleted, all the existing lists and their instances, and the fields. I've also tried giving the Feature a different name, the package a different name, but nothing seems to help. Which is even more weird, since I had this problem before, and that seemed to fix it. (Still doesn't seem to be a brilliant solution anyway) Is there anyone here that has had this problem, and knows a fix? I've looked on Google and all, but all there seems to be is some solution for a migration from Sharepoint 2007 to 2010, and not just plain development of a custom list. Greetings, Mats
