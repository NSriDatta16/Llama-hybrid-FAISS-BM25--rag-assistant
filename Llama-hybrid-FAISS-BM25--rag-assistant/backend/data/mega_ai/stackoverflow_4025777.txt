Add a local table named YrMos using the following code, adjusting the Start/End years as necessary (note: I'm using RunSQL here only because it is DAO/ADO agnostic; there are better alternatives specific to DAO and ADO): Sub CreateYrMos() Const StartYear = 1950 Const EndYear = 2050 Dim Y As Integer, M As Integer DoCmd.SetWarnings False DoCmd.RunSQL "CREATE TABLE YrMos " & _ "(MoStart DATE CONSTRAINT MoStartIndex PRIMARY KEY, " & _ " MoEnd Date CONSTRAINT MoEndIndex UNIQUE, " & _ " Yr Integer, Mo Integer, DaysInMo Integer, " & _ " CONSTRAINT YrMoIndex UNIQUE (Yr, Mo))" For Y = StartYear To EndYear For M = 1 To 12 DoCmd.RunSQL "INSERT INTO YrMos (MoStart, MoEnd, Yr, Mo, DaysInMo) " & _ "VALUES (#" & DateSerial(Y, M, 1) & "#, #" & DateSerial(Y, M + 1, 0) & "#, " & Y & ", " & M & ", " & Day(DateSerial(Y, M + 1, 0)) & ")" Next M Next Y DoCmd.SetWarnings True End Sub Once you've created the table using the above code, the actual query becomes trivial: SELECT YrMos.* FROM YrMos WHERE MoStart BETWEEN #1/1/2010# AND #5/1/2010# I keep a local copy of this table (with an appropriate range of years for my needs) within several of my access applications. I've found it to be a much more efficient and practical approach than other more 'elegant' solutions.
