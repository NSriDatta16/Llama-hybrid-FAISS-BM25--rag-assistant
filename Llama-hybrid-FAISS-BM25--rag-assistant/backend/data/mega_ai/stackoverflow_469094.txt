You need some kind of interfacing to the display. Obviousy you can create bitmaps in memory without any graphics hardware. There are a number of network display protocols, notably X Windows (X11) and the protocol used by VNC. You could also have a server display an interface throug applets and WebStart/JNLP. I understand Opera Mini uses a midlet to display bitmaps and return input to a web browser (presumably based on desktop Opera) running on a remote server. IBM used to have a remote AWT long ago (before Swing, IIRC).
