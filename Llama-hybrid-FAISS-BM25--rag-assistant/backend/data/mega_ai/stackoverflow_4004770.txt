GAE organizing data structure problem

Ok. I'm working with GAE. And i want create something like this: I have types "group" "topic" "tag": each "group" can have as many "topics" as needed each "topic" can have as many "tags" as needed each "group" can have as many "tags" as needed it's something like circle. right now i have something like this: class TopicGroup(db.Model): value = db.StringProperty(required=True) class Topic(db.Model): title = db.StringProperty(required=True) group = db.ReferenceProperty(TopicGroup, 'group', 'topics', required=True) class TopicTag(db.Model): topic = db.ReferenceProperty(Topic, 'topic', 'tags', required=True) group = db.ReferenceProperty(TopicGroup, 'group', 'tags', required=True) value = db.StringProperty(required=True) but this is no good (in my model "topic" can have only one tag, but i nead "topic" to have as many tags as needed) well i already have a crack in my head... is there someone who could help?
