Adonis test significativo, but Adonis pairwise test dont?

I'm analyzing microbiome data un R, and for beta diversity i got aitchison distance, unifrac (weighted and unweighted) and Bray Curtis. Then i usted Adonis test (from vegan) Note: i'm looking for differences in gut microbiota composition from 14 insect species. From Adonis test, p-value Is 0.001 afther 999 permitations (i guess, this Is significative); then, in order to check which of them are different i use pairwise.adonis and the issue starts here because all p-values (paired ones) are at less 0.1 I tried with other tools as PAST V4.0 but i have the same results, but this makes no sense for me. What should i do?
