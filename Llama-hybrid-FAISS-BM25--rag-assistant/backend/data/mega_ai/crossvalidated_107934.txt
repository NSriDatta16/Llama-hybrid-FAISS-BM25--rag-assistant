One possibility is to fit a time series model to the data you are interested in. Then you can resample the residuals from the fitted model and use them to simulate the data. For example, you can fit an ARIMA model, resample the residuals and then generate new data from the fitted ARIMA model. Instead of generating the innovations from a Gaussian distribution you would use the resampled residuals. You can find further details searching in the literature about bootstrapping time series. See for example this post and the references mentioned there. You should take care of events that you mention such as drought years or other particular events. Those events may be exceptional for a particular year or may be cyclical patterns observed in the data. You should choose an appropriate intervention variable to capture these effects in the model. Alternatively, you may fit a model for each subsample where the data remain relatively stable with no breaks or changes in the variance.
