Clone contents of node into different namespace

I've updated the title and the text of my original question after gaining more knowledge on what's really going on. I misinterpreted the symptom as whitespace not being preserved while what's really going on was that the HTML elements weren't being interpreted as HTML. I'm writing a transformation from a WADL document to HTML. I need to clone the contents of WADL elements while preserving whitespace because the elements may contain HTML elements like that care about whitespace while changing the namespace to HTML. Sample WADL element: Sample representation: ]]> Here's how I'm currently transforming this: ... What I'm seeing is that the contents of the copied element has the whitespace collapsed isn't interpreted as a element and therefore the representation sample looks out of whack. How can I instruct XSL output to preserve the whitespace override the namespace while copying the contents of elements? Or is this simply a problem with the way I select the contents of the elements? Update After being ticked off that this could be an output namespace issue, I created the following minimal setup to experiment on: The XML: This is an HTML paragraph And this is a preformatted block of text. The XSL: Doc Test When I inspect the DOM node of the or elements on Firefox, the namespace of the elements point to the WADL namespace, and they don't get properly rendered as HTML (they look like plain text). When I do the same on Chrome, the namespace is XHTML and the elements render as proper XHTML elements. So, I guess, since in the elements of my original WADL document I'm not using namespace prefixes explicitly, I need to find a nice way to force the contents of to use the XHTML namespace, or simply add an XHTML namespace prefix to the contents of (more work, but seems to be the proper way).
