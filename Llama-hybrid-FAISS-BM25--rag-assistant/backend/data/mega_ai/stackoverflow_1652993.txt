These are long shots: Quickly look through all of the stored procedures for things that are unusual and SQL Server should not really be doing, for example sending email or writing files, etc. SQL trying to send email to a non-exist email server could cause delays. The other thing to keep in mind is that as you restore the database before each test possibly your disk is getting more fragmented (not really sure about this though). So that may explain why run times get longer each time until they plateau.
