Mann-Whitney U test is probably what you're looking for. It's nonparametric, so skewness is not a problem for it. But, to be strict, it does not compare averages. It compares probability that ranking of an entity from group 1 is bigger than ranking of an entity from group 2 with probability that ranking of an entity from group 2 is bigger than ranking of an entity from group 1 Another commonly used name for it is Wilcoxon two sample test, hence R function that carries it is wilcox.test() .
