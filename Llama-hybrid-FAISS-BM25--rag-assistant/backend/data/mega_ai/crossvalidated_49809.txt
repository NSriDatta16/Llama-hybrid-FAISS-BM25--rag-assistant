It doesn't matter so much that the Z score is often compared to a symmetrical normal distribution. The key thing about your proposed approach is that it will give you a positive value when the partner has an "above mean" (common sense term = "above average") number of repeat visits, pages per visit, or time per page. So long as you are aware that this is what it is doing, it's not necessarily a bad approach. You might want to consider alternative cut off points - for example, the median of each of these variables is likely to be lower than the mean; if you used this as the cut-off point instead you would be getting the best half of partners against each criterion. However, any cut-off point is arbitrary and its use depends on whether the results are practicable (ie does it give you a reasonable number of partners to use). So the short answer to your question is - there is no problem with using these Z scores even when the underlying distribution is skewed. Just be aware that a positive Z score means that partner has a value higher than the mean for that variable, nothing else. And the mean is susceptible to outliers ie a single partner with a squillion repeat visits will result in the mean being so high that only that partner makes your list. So watch out for that problem and consider using another cut-off (median, or 75th percentile) instead. Ultimately, the answer depends on your business drivers. The next step up in analytical techniques is to find a single criterion against which to rank partners, which somehow takes into account all three of the variables you are interested in. A common naive way to go about this is to take averages of standardised scores; more sophisticated alternatives are to use principal components analysis or factor analysis. But this takes us away from the actual question. My most important tip - use graphical techniques, particularly scatterplots showing two variables at a time with a point representing each partner; ideally with the more interesting points neatly labelled for you (the number one feature lack of Excel, unfortunately). A "scatterplot matrix" is a handy technique if you have the software to do it easily.
