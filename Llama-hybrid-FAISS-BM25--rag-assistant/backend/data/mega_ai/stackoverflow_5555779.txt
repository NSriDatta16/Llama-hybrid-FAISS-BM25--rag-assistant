Server does not respond to Requests while File Download! Any solution?

The current PHP code being used is : header("Pragma: public"); header("Expires: 0"); header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); header("Cache-Control: public"); header("Content-Description: File Transfer"); header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream"); header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary"); header("Content-Length: ".filesize($file)); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"" . basename($file) . "\""); header($_SERVER["SERVER_PROTOCOL"] . " 200 OK"); ob_clean(); flush(); readfile($file); But when I download some file, the website stops functioning. The browser is sending the requests but it does not get any response from the server. They are in Pending mode until the download is finished, but once the download is finished, the server sends the response and the website starts functioning again. Can you please give a solution for this?
