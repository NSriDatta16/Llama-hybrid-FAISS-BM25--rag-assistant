Is it acceptable to use class probabilities as weights for a weighted average when the bins are numbers 1 to 5?

I have a Multi Class SVM that can predict what class some observation belongs to. There are 5 classes. They are trained for observation that scored 1 to 5. I want the MC-SVM to predict a class for some observation. The prediction is, for example, 0.5 probability to belong to class 5 and 0.5 for class 4. I know that there's a relationship between these bins where they are scores from 1 to 5. I was wondering if it makes sense to use a weighted average of these probabilities to say that the score is a weighted sum: 5 (class) * 0.5 (prob) + 4 (class) * 0.5 (prob) = 4.5 score Does this method make sense? Is it often done? Does it have a name?
