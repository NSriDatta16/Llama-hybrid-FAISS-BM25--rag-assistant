The volume of an $p$ -dimensional hyperball of radius $r$ has a volume proportional to $r^p$ . So the proportion of the volume more than a distance $kr$ from the origin is $\frac{r^p-(kr)^p}{r^p}=1-k^p$ . The probability that all $N$ randomly chosen points are more than a distance $kr$ from the origin is $\left(1-k^p\right)^N$ . To get the median distance to the nearest random point, set this probability equal to $\frac12$ . So $$\left(1-k^p\right)^N=\tfrac12 $$ $$\implies k=\left(1-\tfrac1{2^{1/N}}\right)^{1/p}.$$ Intuitively this makes some sort of sense: the more random points there are, the closer you expect the nearest one to the origin to be, so you should expect $k$ to be a decreasing function of $N$ . Here $2^{1/N}$ is a decreasing function of $N$ , so $\tfrac1{2^{1/N}}$ is an increasing function of $N$ , and thus $1-\tfrac1{2^{1/N}}$ is a decreasing function of $N$ as is its $p$ th root. On your final paragraph, if $p$ is large, then this median minimum distance from the origin can be close to $1$ even when $N$ is very large: for example if $p$ is a thousand and $N$ a million then $k \approx 0.9859$ so it is more likely than not that all million points are over $98.5\%$ of the way from the centre to the outer boundary, as less than $0.0001\%$ of the volume of the hypersphere is closer to the origin than that. With almost everything near the boundary, there could be little or no interpolation in your analysis.
