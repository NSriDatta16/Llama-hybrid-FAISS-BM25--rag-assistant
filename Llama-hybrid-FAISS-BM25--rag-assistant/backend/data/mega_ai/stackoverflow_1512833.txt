You should be using a UINavigationController and pushing new view controllers onto the navigation stack as you need them, and popping them off when you're done. This allows you to separate your functionality into separate discrete components which is helpful for code organization as well as adhering more closely to Apple's guidelines provided in the HIG. I would definitely suggest breaking it out into separate view controllers.
