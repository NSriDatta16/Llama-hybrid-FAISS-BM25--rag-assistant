Predicting with a GLM

I wanted to check my understanding of predicting with a GLM: A binomial/logistic regression model predicts the binomial parameter = p = P(success). To convert the probability into classes, we have to add a threshold or cutoff. The same idea applies for a multinomial logistic regression model. A poisson regression model predicts the poisson parameter = rate. To convert into counts, I use a threshold again? A gamma model predicts the scale and rate parameters. I do not need a threshold because the response is continuous.
