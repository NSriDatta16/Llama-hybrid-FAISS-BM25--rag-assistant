This will be the device with device instance ID usb\VID_04f2&PID_0111\5&39fe81e&0&2 . That's probably a mass storage device aka disk. Now, the problem you have is that a mass storage device doesn't actually have a drive letter; it's the volume on that disk which has a drive letter. If there are two partitions, a single USB mass storage device may have two drive letters. So, there's no direct function to get the volume. It looks like you need to enumerate the device tree rooted at usb\VID_04f2&PID_0111\5&39fe81e&0&2 to find children with device type "volume". The DEV_BROADCAST_DEVICEINTERFACE you get will have a dbcc_name field that you can pass to GetVolumeNameForVolumeMountPoint() .
