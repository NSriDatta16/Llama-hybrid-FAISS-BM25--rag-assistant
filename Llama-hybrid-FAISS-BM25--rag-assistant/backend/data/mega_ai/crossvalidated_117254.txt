Can you do a PCA on 3-point Likert to weigh items 20k responses

I am developing an inventory tool that has 21 items. I need to determine the weight of each of the items, as the presence of some may give a higher overall rating to a scenario than the presence of others. I need to be able to add up all those present to determine an overall weighting also. I have 20,000 respondents, and when thinking about each of the 21 constructs of the same idea, participants chose either not representative, somewhat representative, highly representative of the construct. Can I run a PCA to determine which of the 21 items are more representative than others, and thus warranting a higher weighting? Is this possible with only 3 points? Or rather, is it fairly widely accepted to do so? It's a high impact study, so I don't want my methodology shot down.
