Expected value of a Pareto distribution between two values

I try to calculate the expected value of a Pareto distribution. Suppose that we have a Pareto distribution for $x \ge \theta$ : $$f(x;k;\theta)= \frac{k\theta^k}{x^{k+1}} $$ We can calculate $ E[X]$ with the following $$ E[X] = \int_{\theta}^{\infty} \frac{k\theta^k}{x^k} dx = \frac{k\theta}{k-1} $$ provided $k>1$ . Now, what if we want to calculate the average value between two values $a$ and $b$ . We can do $$ \int_a^b xf(x)dx = \int_a^b x \frac{k\theta^k}{x^{k+1}} dx = \frac{k\theta ^k}{1-k} \left[x^{-k+1}\right]_a^b $$ $$ = \frac{k\theta ^k}{1-k} (b^{-k+1}-a^{-k+1}) $$ Now, if b is infinite, we can fin the expected value. And let choose some values for a, intuitively, if a increases, the average value between a and b (infinite) should increase. Mabybe I am wrong, but then I don't know. Now let's plot some values for a with r: theta=3 k = 1.1 a= seq(3,10,0.1) mm = - k * theta ^k/(1-k) * a ^(-k+1) plot(a,mm) we can see that mm decrease with the value of a. Could you please help me to understand why, or there may be an error in the formulas. Thank you
