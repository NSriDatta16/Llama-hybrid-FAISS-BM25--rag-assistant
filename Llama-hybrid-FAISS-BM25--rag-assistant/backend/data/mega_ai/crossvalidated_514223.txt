Why strong seasonality in time series of total shipped volumes not observed in customer groups?

In a time series dataset, demand from various customers are given on a daily basis. When the data is aggregated at month level for all the customers together it is easy to see the effect of quarterly and monthly seasonality. Higher volumes are seen in Q3 and to some extent in Q4. This is from simple cycle plots, STL decomposition, and ACF plots. Many customers do not receive volumes at regular time intervals, i.e. there could be many days on which a customer does not receive any volumes.However, some customers may be getting daily shipments. The volumes also vary from one shipment to another. Now, on similar analysis for a single customer, or even some groupings of customers, seasonal patterns are not evident. What is a good explanation for having a clear seasonality in the total volumes shipped but not in the components? In other words, where is the seasonal pattern in the total coming from if it is not present at lower levels of aggregation (e.g. customer)?
