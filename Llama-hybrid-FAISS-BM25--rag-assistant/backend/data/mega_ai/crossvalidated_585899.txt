How to create optimal observation given a classifier

Suppose that I have a dataset $D$ of cars and a classifier $C$ which, given two cars characteristics, predicts which car is "better". (It's a binary classification, the definition of better is not important) . My problem is to find (create?) an observation $x^*$ such that for any $x$ in $D$ , the probability that classifier $C$ says that $x^*$ is better than $x$ is maximal. How can this be done ? PS: It seems similar to the approach using Generative Adversarial Networks in Interpreting the Latent Space of GANs for Semantic Face Editing ( blog ). (I suppose that in this case output for the classifier will be something like average of probabilities against all cars of my dataset) Is it the way to go ? Are there better/simpler methods ?
