Associative arrays and binding parameters

I've gotten a little confused with the PDO::prepare functions. I have something like this array('user_email'=>'hello@net.com','user_pass'=>'password') and i'd like to translate it into something like this INSERT INTO user_info (user_email, user_pass) VALUES (hello@net.com, password) using parameterized queries with PDO (or mysqli, I'm open to suggestions). Another idea - array('uid'=>'10', 'first_name'=>'robert', 'last_name'=>'jones') array("email", "number") into SELECT email, number FROM t1 WHERE uid=10 AND first_name=robert AND last_name=jones I know the answer lies somewhere with PDO::prepare and call_user_func_array , but I've gotten really confused on how the latter function works, and would appreciate an explanation.
