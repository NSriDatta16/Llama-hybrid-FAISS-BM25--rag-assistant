No, an unsigned value is never sign-extended. Upcasting will always pad such a value with zeroes. More precisely, the unsigned variable represents a particular number, and it will still represent the same number after a cast, provided that is possible in the new format. Hexadecimal or no, C (although not C99) and C++ are designed to work in the absence of bits, eg with base-10 numerics.
