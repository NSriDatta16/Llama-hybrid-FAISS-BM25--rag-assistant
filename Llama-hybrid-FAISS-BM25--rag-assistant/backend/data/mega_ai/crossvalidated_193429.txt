First, about measuring the fit. The Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test is for a one-dimensional distribution. Though it was extended to multivariate data, it wasn't designed for time series. I'm not sure how do you use your time series data. If you are interested in just the probability of an event to happen, you can use the test. However, note that you will lose all information like "Event B always comes after event A" and that might be where the gold is. Going a step backwards, you said that you used your old data as the train and the new data as your test. You can split your data in different ways and avoid the problem in the first place. In case that you are interested in predicting future behavior, you can split each time series into past (train) and test (future). Note that you can choose a different point for any series. This way you can train on that that now is considered to be your future and still get a valid estimation. Sometimes it is required that all the series will be split in the same point in time. In this case, you might consider creating a few data sets (e.g., one ending in January, one ending in February, etc). The advantage here is that you will be able to estimate how good your model is as time changes. Note that while it is likely that the underlying distribution will change, your model is probably looking for a narrower aspect and might be more robust. You might be coping with a problem of concept drift (or time-related domain adaptation ). Reading some surveys on these topics might give you some useful ideas.
