Machine-learning regression coefficients

Say I want to do supervised learning of response variable $y_k$ (continuous) and feature variables $(x_k, z_k, a_k, b_k)$ where $k$ is the sample index. Instead of learning the general form $$ y \sim f(x, z, a, b),$$ I would like to learn the form $$ y \sim A(a,b) x + B(a,b) y + C(a,b). $$ This is because the coefficients $A$ and $B$ are more critical than the general (non-linear) form, and I know that the structure of $y, x, z$ is linear, but the coefficients may vary depending on the values of $a$ and $b$ . I am wondering if there is any learning method suitable for this situation. If I use neural networks for learning $A(a,b)$ and $B(a,b)$ , is it possible to optimize the RSS with tensorflow ? If I design the model with tensorflow, note that the last layer is not a typical NN layer in the sense that the products, $(A, B)$ and $(x,y)$ , depends on the feature variables. Much appreciate your help in advance.
