In the question, you ask about how to get variables associated with each PC, but also state that ultimately what you really need is a set of variables to move forward with. This answer is going to suggest using the CUR decomposition to pick a set of variables most strong associated with your first 14 PCs jointly. The linked method starts by defining what they call "normalized statistical leverage scores", as $\pi_j=\frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^K (v_j^i)^2$ , where $v_j^i$ is the $j$ th entry in the $i$ th PC. $K$ is a hyperparameter telling us how many PCs to look at, but it sounds like you have already settled on 14. They subsequently propose keeping the variable $j$ probabilistically based on a function of the $\pi_j$ . Namely, with probability $\min\{1,c\pi_j\}$ , where $c$ is essentially a tuning parameter (though they have suggestions on how to pick it). (But just between you and me, I prefer to simply keep the variables with the highest $\pi_j$ s deterministically rather than randomizing. We can use standard methods, perhaps an elbow plot, to decide how many to keep.)
