Actually you need an index on the name fields, on both sides However, may I suggest that you have way too many joins? In general there should only be one join from one table to the next. It is rare to have more than one join between tables, and exceedingly rare to have more than two. Have a look at this link: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/07/12/Tip_2F00_Trick_3A00_-Online-Database-Schema-Samples-Library.aspx Notice how all of the tables are joined together by a single relationship? Each of the fields labeled PK are primary keys. These are AUTONUMBER fields. Each of the fields labeled FK are foreign keys. These are indexed Number fields of type Integer. The Primary Keys are connected to the Foreign Keys in a 1 to many relationship (in most cases). 99% of the time, you won't need any other kind of joins. The trick is to create tables with unique information. There is a lot of repeated information in your database. A database that is reorganized in this manner is called a "normalized" database. There are lots of good examples of these at http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/
