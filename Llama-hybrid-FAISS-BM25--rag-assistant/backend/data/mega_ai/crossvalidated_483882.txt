Maybe a variation of the Winkler score would work. Let the $100(1-\alpha)$ % HDR be given by $R_\alpha$ . Then the score could be $$s_\alpha + \frac{2}{\alpha}1(y\not\in R_\alpha)$$ where $s_\alpha$ is the total size of the region (i.e., the sum of the lengths of the sub-intervals). However, note that the HDR is the smallest region with specified coverage by definition. So just checking the coverage is probably ok.
