IMHO it's not just a matter of how many people are using IE6, it's a matter of why they're using it. If 11% of people were using IE6 because they really liked IE6 and Ie6 had a chance of gaining popularity as time went on, I'd say they should be considered. However, given that probably 99% of people using IE6 are using it purely because of inertia and it's getting less popular every day, I don't think it matters too much. If anything, the fact that your website looks like crap in IE6 will encourage them to upgrade. That said, I think your page should probably explain to the relatively computer illiterate why it looks like crap and that IE6 his a browser from the caveman era and they should upgrade.
