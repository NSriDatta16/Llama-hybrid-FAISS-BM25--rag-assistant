C++ - basic container question

How should the following cases be handled: I have some geometrical storage, which is a template from vertex type. template struct Geometry { std::vector & GetVertices() { ... } const void* RawVertices() const { ... } } This works fine, unless I want to store different types of geometries (for instance, Geometry g1 and Geometry g2 in one container. Is this possible? Or how should I implement geometry storage (where I can store and retrieve different types of geometries using one container) or maybe somehow map T type to Geometry type? Any advices? Thank you.
