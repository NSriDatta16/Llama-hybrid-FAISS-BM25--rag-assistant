The matchit algorithm is performing logistic regression under the hood. The warning is telling you that the logistic regression model cannot be estimated due to perfect prediction, or singularity of the odds ratio. According to the formula, th_wechsel is the exposure of interest and age, sex, etc. are the possible confounders. Not knowing the sample size, nor the coding of these variables, you are probably dealing with too high a dimension to guarantee that the model can even be fit at all. In other words, there is a lack of an adequate propensity matched set for all levels of the exposure of interest. You can experiment with changing the model, usually categorical variables with sparse counts can be tricky, and practically a simpler model can be had be collapsing categories. For instance, if age is coded categorically by year, maybe coarsen it to age in 5 year increments.
