Machine learning & mathematics -

I am not from a statistics (or mathematics) major background. Just bachelors in computer science but had learnt algebra, probability, statistics, Integration & Differentiation, Permutation & Combination, etc. Over last ~3 months, I've made my hands slightly dirty with ML code and concepts. I've started doing few sample exercises and reading blogs/wikis and articles. But, is it really important to learn the mathematical notations to get a solid grasp on the internal concepts? For ex. SVM Wiki . I have some idea about Kernel Trick but wanted to learnt bit of internals, but it completely blew me off. How important it is to learn the mathematics behind the concepts? Please share your thoughts on this. RB.
