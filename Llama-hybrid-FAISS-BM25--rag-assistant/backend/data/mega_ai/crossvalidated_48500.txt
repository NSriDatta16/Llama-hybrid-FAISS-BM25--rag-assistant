Where can I find time series data to assess accuracy of forecast?

I created an algorithm for forecasting time series (mix of ML methods). Now I need some data so I can compare my results with others and assess accuracy. Unfortunately, I can't find anything like the MNIST dataset for digit recognition task (ie. table with the best results and used methods: example ). There are many articles about the topic but they usually use a different data (or stock data with no hope for any reasonable results). Do you have any suggestions how find some?
