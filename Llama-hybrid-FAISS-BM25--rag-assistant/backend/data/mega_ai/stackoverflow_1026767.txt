Erik, The specific problem of comparing two telephone number which are formatted differently is relatively easy to overcome by stripping all non-numeric characters. However I don't think that's really what you are trying to achieve. I believe you're attempting to compare whether the booklet data is different to the database data but disregard certain formatting. Realistically this isn't possible without having some very well defined rules on the formatting. For instance formatting on the organisation name is probably very significant whereas telephone number formatting is not. Instead you should be tracking changes within the database and then manually check the booklet.
