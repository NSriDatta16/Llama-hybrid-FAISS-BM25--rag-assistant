If you want to be database independant, polling can work. It's not very efficient or elegant. It also works if you are cursed to using a database that doesn't support triggers. A workaround that we've used in the past is to use a script that is timed (say via cron) to do a select MAX(primary_key_id) from saidTable . I am assuming that your primary key is an a sequential integer and is indexed. And then compare that to the value you obtained the last time you ran the script. If they match, tell the script to exit or sleep. If not, do your thing. There are other issues with this approach (ie: backlogs if the script takes too long, or concurrency issues, etc.). And of course performance can become an issue too!
