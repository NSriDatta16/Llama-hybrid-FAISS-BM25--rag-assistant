AIR has no means to know if browser is running and what it does (barring NativeProcess helpers). Flextras' answer made me think about proxies... Of course, proxy inside widget isn't practical. If widget is proxy, you can't have internet without it - that's silly. Instead, one can take an open source proxy, inside it check user agent header (to filter browser requests) and probably url (to exclude images, css and js requests). When you have request from browser and for html, you can make proxy open local socket connection to the same port your widget listens and notify it. But this can hardly be done urgently.
