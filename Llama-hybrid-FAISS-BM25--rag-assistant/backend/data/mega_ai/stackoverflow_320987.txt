I know nothing of Visual Build, but from your description it sounds like it is tied to Windows and doesn't run from the command line. If you are building Java software (I assume you are since you are using Ant), it's preferable to have a cross-platform tool. If you can run the tool from the command-line, then it is scriptable which is extremely important for automation. Ant is also extensible and a de facto standard. Many tools that you may use (Cobertura, TestNG, etc.) provide Ant tasks so that they can easily be intergrated with your build. I use Ant for all Java projects. Some people prefer Maven , but I'm not one of them. Ant is far from perfect (the XML syntax is a bit clunky) but it is well documented , extremely stable and pretty straightforward. If you use a standard tool, such as Ant or Maven, you will be able to take advantage of any number of Continuous Integration products. I doubt you will find many that work with Visual Build. Most IDEs support Ant, so they give you a GUI of sorts and your CI server will give you a web interface for doing builds.
