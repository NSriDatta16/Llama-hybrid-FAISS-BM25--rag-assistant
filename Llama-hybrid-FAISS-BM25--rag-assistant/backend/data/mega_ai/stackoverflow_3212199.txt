Magento custom image attribute. How do I get in frontend?

I've added an image attribute with name and label e.g. New Image, new_image. How do I fetch this from e.g. view.phtml? I thought it would be as simple as helper('catalog/image')->init($_product, 'new_image')->resize(150, 150); ?> But, this is throwing an error. Does anybody know the correct way to do this? Many thanks.
