It seems to me that the only information is in the tumor size process $M_i(t)$ , $i = 1, \ldots, n$ . Either you treat this as a longitudinal outcome evaluated at some follow-up times $t_{ij}$ , $j = 1, \ldots, n_i$ , and you fit an appropriate mixed effects model describing the average longitudinal evolutions; or you are interested in the time until $M_i(t) > c M_i(0)$ that should be interval censored data, and you fit an appropriate survival model for it. It is not evident why you want to consider the same process twice in a joint model.
