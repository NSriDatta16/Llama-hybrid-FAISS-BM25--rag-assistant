Android 1.5 emulator crashing apparently randomly [WIN DEATH]

I'm getting seeming random crashes (though they always happen at the same time) on the Android 1.5 Emulator (running under OS X). Code is built against 1.5 APIs and runs fine on other versions. App doing the same on an HTC Hero so it appears to be an Android issue rather than just an emulator issue. By random I mean a screen will display OK for a few seconds and then crash with no user input or state change. In at least one case it seems to be drawing a fullscreen image that causes it (though the image is drawn fine for a few frames). Stacktrace below which means nothing to me, any help appreciated... I/DEBUG ( 836): Build fingerprint: 'generic/sdk/generic/:1.5/CUPCAKE/150240:eng/test-keys' I/DEBUG ( 836): pid: 948, tid: 949 >>> com.bitbull.meat.android
