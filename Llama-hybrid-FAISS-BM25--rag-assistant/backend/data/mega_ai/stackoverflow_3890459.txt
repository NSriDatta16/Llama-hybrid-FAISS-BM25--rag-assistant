Converting MIDI byte array to MP3 byte array

Does someone know how to convert a MIDI file (average playback time of 30 seconds) which is represented in a byte array to an MP3 byte array ? So, ideally I need to have a C# function which accepts a MIDI byte array and returns a MP3 byte array. The conversion should not take more than 2 - 3 seconds. Are there any frameworks / tools / 3rd-party DLLs to perform this easily? Please let me know. Thanks, Vijay
