If this is part of a registration process or alike, then why don't you send back a "challenge" (e.g. URL to go for continuing registration or whatever, with a unique & time-bound key) to the (supposedly) originator? This way you can verify if the email address isn't forged. The "big guys" (e.g. Google) use this process a lot, there must be a reason. Disregard my suggestion if that doesn't fit your use-case. Updated : you could have the emails transit through another Web Service (To be determined) before reaching your GAE application? This way, you could still leverage GAE whilst having a low processing overhead job such as email verification done someplace else?
