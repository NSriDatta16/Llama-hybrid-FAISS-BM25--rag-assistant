WPF DataGrid (MultiSelector?) is raising SelectedItems CollectionChanged event multiple times

I'm not sure if this is an issue with the DataGrid control or with MultiSelectors in general, but when I select multiple rows within the grid, the CollectionChanged event is fired for every single row. This makes sense if I'm 'dragging' with my mouse, but it also occurs if I 'shift-click' to select multiple rows or simply click the top-left 'select-all-rows' button. I have seen on the MultiSelector that there are Begin/EndUpdateSelectedItems methods as well as an IsUpdatingSelectedItems property. Unfortunately my consumer of this collection/event is unaware of its source. Is there a way to make the DataGrid / SelectedItems collection only send the CollectionChanged notification when updating is finished? thank you kindly. Edit: I have found that for the DataGrid the IsUpdatingSelectedItems property is not being set even when changing a large selection. Edit: I have found that the DataGrid SelectionChanged event is correctly fired only once after the full change. It's unfortunate since this ruins the possibility of simple data binding, but it is a potential workaround if you have control over the consumer of the SelectedItems collection.
