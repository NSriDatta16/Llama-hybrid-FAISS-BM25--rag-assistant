Sorry, I do not have enough rep to comment on Rog's answer, so I will post 'Another Answer'. Try this code and see if it turns out well for you: UIVIew *view = [[UIView alloc] init]; view.alpha = 0; // alpha 1.0 is opaque, alpha 0.5 is translucent and 0 is clear Honestly, I have not tried that before as I do not require doing so. But when I drag a new UIView from the library, alpha option is in the properties. Hope this helps.
