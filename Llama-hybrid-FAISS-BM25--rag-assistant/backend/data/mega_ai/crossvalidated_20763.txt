Time Series representation and forecasting in R

I have to forecast a time series in R of a Internet network traffic bitrate. The data are in file http://www.forumaltavilla.it/joomla/datitesi/dati.dat and the sampling time is every 0.05 seconds. Now, i want to use HoltWinters forecasting. My problem is setting the parameter deltat. On the Internet i saw deltat is the number of samples in a year but in this case deltat=1.58443823e-9 (0.05 seconds in years). Is it true or i should set deltat=0.05? This is my script. deltat=0.05 dati.ts=ts(scan("dati.dat", deltat),start=0,deltat) model=HoltWinters(dati.ts) dati.forecast=forecast(model,h=100) plot(dati.forecast) Thank you very much,
