o discover collections of short Atomese programs that accomplish tasks; these can be thought of as performing a kind of decision tree learning, resulting in a kind of decision forest, or rather, a generalization thereof. A natural language input system consisting of Link Grammar, and partly inspired by both Meaning-Text Theory as well as Dick Hudson's Word Grammar, which encodes semantic and syntactic relations in Atomese. A natural language generation system. An implementation of Psi-Theory for handling emotional states, drives and urges, dubbed OpenPsi. Interfaces to Hanson Robotics robots, including emotion modelling via OpenPsi. This includes the Loving AI project, used to demonstrate meditation techniques. Organization and funding In 2008, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), formerly called Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI), sponsored several researchers and engineers. Many contributions from the open source community have been made since OpenCog's involvement in the Google Summer of Code in 2008 and 2009. Currently MIRI no longer supports OpenCog. OpenCog has received funding and support from several sources, including the Hong Kong government, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation and Hanson Robotics. In 2013, OpenCog began providing AI solutions to Hanson Robotics, and in 2017, OpenCog became a founding member of SingularityNET. Applications Similar to other cognitive architectures, the main purpose is to create virtual humans, which are three dimensional avatar characters. The goal is to mimic behaviors like emotions, gestures and learning. For example, the emotion module in the software was only programmed because humans have emotions. Artificial General Intelligence can be realized if it simulates intelligence of humans. The self-description of the OpenCog project provides additional possible applications which are going into the direction of natural language processing and the simulation of a dog.
