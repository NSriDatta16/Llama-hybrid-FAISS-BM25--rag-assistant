Which dimensionality reduction schemes are bijective?

I am trying to get a feel for which DR scheme is most suitable for my problem, with the stipulation that the scheme is bijectiv; i.e. there is a two-way map between the low-dimensional manifold and the original space. EDIT: For clarity: is it possible to select your dimensional reduction so that you can project UP from the low dimensional space that you have found, such that information loss is acceptable. E.g. say I have a high-dimensional joint configuration of some character, and I want to find its low-dimensional joint projection and then traverse that manifold, or sample it, and visualise those samples in the original space.
