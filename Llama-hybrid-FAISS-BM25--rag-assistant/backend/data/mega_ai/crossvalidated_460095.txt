Masked Autoencoder MADE implementation in TensorFlow vs Pytorch

I am following the course CS294-158 [ 1 ] and got stuck with the first exercise that requests to implement the MADE paper (see here [ 2 ]). My implementation in TensorFlow [ 3 ] achieves results that are less performant than the solutions implemented in PyTorch from the course (see here [ 4 ]). I have been modifying hyperparameters there and around, trying to identify the main differences in the loss-functions, dimensionalities, etc. to no avail. I would kindly like to ask for help in understanding what I am doing wrong, or what I could make better to improve the performance. Maybe someone could explain to me what makes the PyTorch implementation better since I have just lost it. Thanks for your help!!
