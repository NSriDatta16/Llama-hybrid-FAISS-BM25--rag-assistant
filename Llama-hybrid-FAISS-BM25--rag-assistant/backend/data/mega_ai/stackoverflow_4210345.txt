Split Subversion repository into multiple Mercurial repositories?

We're migrating from Subversion to Mercurial and have run into a bump in the SVN->Hg conversion process. Right now, our single SVN repo holds code for a couple distinct "projects", and we'd like to split them apart in the migration process. Our SVN repo is organized as: . |-- proj1 | |-- branches | |-- tags | `-- trunk `-- proj2 |-- branches |-- tags `-- trunk and we'd like to simply make proj1 and proj2 their own Hg repos. We'd like to, of course, not have history specific to proj1 appear in proj2 's log either. Right now, when hg convert does the conversion, it just reads all the files pretty dumbly, not even distinguishing branches from trunks. What's the process for filtering by directory and recognizing SVN branches in hg convert ?
