Scatterplots containing even modest numbers of data points always look like a blur. One approach to uncovering the "signal" summarized in a dependence metric like a Spearman correlation is to create ranked buckets of information based on the feature (or independent) variables. Then, based on those groupings, average both the feature and the target (or dependent) variable. A scatterplot can be formed with the x-axis as the feature buckets and the y-axis as the average of the target variable across those buckets. Here's an example based on 1,643 observations: Spearman correlation between X and Y, rho=0.261, p-value= Here's a scatterplot of the raw data: Here's a scatterplot of the same information after grouping X into 20 buckets:
