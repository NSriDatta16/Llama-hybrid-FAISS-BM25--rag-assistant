Can I calculate 'average call duration' from 'concurrent call count' and 'started call count' per periods of time?

I got two time series with samples per period of 5 minutes: A pink: Max concurrent calls B green: Count of calls started Can I estimate the duration of the calls? A gives me higher values than B so I think the calls last more than 5 minutes. So, many of them count on several intervals A and only one for B .
