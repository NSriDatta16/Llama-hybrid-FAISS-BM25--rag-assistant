Matthew's answer is sufficient, but I thought somebody should answer the actual question(s) as asked: What would following plot convey? Percentile values: This graph is the graph of percentiles; the median is always the center of the horizontal axis. If the horizontal axis is normalized over the total number of samples, 0-1 or 1-100, the percentiles can be directly read. Distribution possibilities: especially regarding its distribution Yes, every perfect distribution has a unique shape on this plot. Unfortunately, no randomly sampled variable is perfect. For example, if the values only included -.9 to 1 the data distribution could be classified as either skewed uniform or normal, given the near linearity over that range. Plot the various distributions and skews to get a feel for the overall shape and feel of each one. The information can then be extended to bi-modal and multi-modal data. The overall shape of the OP's given curve indicates a left skewed normal distribution. Slopes and curvature: When the points are connected, the resulting graph can be analyzed as a monotonically increasing line segments, with continuous slope values. Slopes(first derivative) can be calculated either discretely by subtracting consecutive values, or applying a spline calculation to approximate the slope of multiple consecutive values(allows interpolations if the "time" axis is not consistent). Repeat for 2nd derivative on same plot. The longest flat value indicates the mode. A stepped look indicates discrete values or fixed A/D resolution. Long straight lines are uniform distributions skewed by the slope amount away from 1. Non-uniform curvature about horizontal lines indicates multi-modal distributions. The 2nd derivative of your plot shows the left side of the data grows slower than the right, indicating a left skew. (Hard to see from your data plot, larger bend length or cupping on the left side.) Outliers: Long near vertical non-symmetric heads or tails indicate outliers in the data. From your graph, values(y-axis) below ~-2 or above ~1.5 are outliers and should be removed. Description of the visualization: This graph is not good for quantitative values other than percentiles, and obvious modes, but it does show qualitatively: discreteness, distribution, modality, skew and outlier presence in a single graph. Conclusion: For non-time series numeric data, this plot, along with its 1st and 2nd derivatives and the mean horizontal line, is the second plot, after the data itself, that I run, since it is the most versatile visualization when read correctly. Since, its data is not easily interpreted(slopes and curvature), its usefulness to most end users is limited, and as such should not be distributed as a final graph. To the trained eye, the information given is very useful and has very little computational overhead compared to convolution. Any conclusions found are then verified either numerically or via other plots.
