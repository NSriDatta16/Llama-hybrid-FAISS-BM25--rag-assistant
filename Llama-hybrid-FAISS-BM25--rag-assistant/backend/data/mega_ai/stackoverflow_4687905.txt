You can use any dvcs you'd like with it. MonoDevelop (at least in the trunk, not sure if it has been released yet) as Git support built in. There are some plugins for Visual Studio that give you Git too. Either way though, you don't need your source control to be integrated within the IDE, infact I prefer it not to be and use Git from TortoiseGit if I'm in windows, or from the command line on OS X (although I'm looking at Gitti for the OS X side). For build, I would suggest TeamCity, since it supports up to three remote agents allowing you to build on Windows/Linux/Mac with the free version. For build I'd use NAnt, although xbuild under mono works with solution files so that might be easier rather than maintaining two build scripts. I like NAnt for CI simply because I find it easier to break apart into build, test, cover, package, deploy etc. I've found that the combination of MonoDevelop, Git, TeamCity and NAnt gives you a few nice cross-platform development setup.
