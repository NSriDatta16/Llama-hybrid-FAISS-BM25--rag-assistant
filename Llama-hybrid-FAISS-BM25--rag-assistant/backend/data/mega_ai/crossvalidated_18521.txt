it's not 'sampled' at regular intervals, so I think it doesn't qualify as a Time Series data. Here is an idea about how to forecast the purchases: consider the data as an intermittent demand series . That is, you do have a time series sampled at regular intervals, but the positive values are obviously irregularly spaced. Rob Hyndman has a nice paper on using Croston's method for forecasting intermittent demand series. While I also program a lot in Python, you'll save a lot of exploration time by using Croston's method, as well as other time series forecasting methods, readily available in Rob's excellent R package forecast .
