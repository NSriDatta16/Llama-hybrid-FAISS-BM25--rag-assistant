XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open, standard protocol for near-real-time exchange of XML-structured data. The protocol is commonly used in instant messaging (IM) applications, but can be used to exchange any kind of data. It can also be leveraged for multi-user chat, collaboration, voice and video, message-oriented middleware, and many other applications. XMPP works by initiating a bidirectional XML stream between two entities. The stream is used to transport XMPP stanzas, which are small, well-defined blocks of XML. An overview of XMPP protocol is available at https://xmpp.org/about/technology-overview.html There are various XMPP servers available to use. For more comprehensive lists of server, client implementations as well as XMPP libraries, visit xmpp.org .
