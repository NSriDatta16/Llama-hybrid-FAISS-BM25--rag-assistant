Yep, there's a huge problem: new (and delete ) can be overridden by anyone for any type, and may or may not use malloc as the underlying allocator (really, it probably won't). Meanwhile, ยง20.4.6/4 of the C++03 standard says: The function free() does not attempt to deallocate storage by calling ::operator delete() . Meaning, any new invocation may allocate memory in any fashion, but free() will most likely not deallocate it correctly.
