css for dynamic content

I'm working on adding content to a web-page with javascript. The problem is that the CSS in IE (7) doesn't seem apply to the dynamically added content. Here's an example document.. p.foo { color: #FF4400 ; background-color: #000000 } p.bar { color: #FF0000 ; background-color: #000000 } function add() { var node = document.createElement("p"); node.setAttribute("class", "bar"); node.appendChild(document.createTextNode("New Content")); document.body.appendChild(node); }; bar foo In FF, the newly added 'New Content' paragraph has the style applied to it, but in IE, it doesn't. This seems like something obvious enough that it ought to be easily searchable-for, but some obvious queries gave me nothing. So what's the trick?
