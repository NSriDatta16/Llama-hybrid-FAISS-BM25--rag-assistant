Assuming the only known thing for a combination i,j is whether it is a 1 (iu+e is bigger) or a 0 (otherwise); Suppose you put the observations in a matrix (I,J) (top left element is 1,1 bottom left is I,1) Here is the idea that I have. Unfortunately I cannot prove it mathematically, but it might give you some direction. If you take the biggest possible square submatrix from the top left and calculate the average, it may be a decent estimator of x/u. Furthermore the variance will be higher if the 'changeover' from 0 to 1 does not show a nice pattern and/or if you often see that there is no changeover (example 000110111). However, i do not even dare to suggest an estimator for the variance.
