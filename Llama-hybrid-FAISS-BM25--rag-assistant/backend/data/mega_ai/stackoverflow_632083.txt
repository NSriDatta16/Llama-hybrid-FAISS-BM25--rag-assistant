As far as I know this is not possible with MyISAM. With 5-10 INSERTs per second you should consider InnoDB anyways, unless you're not reading that much. Are you using replication, preferable in a Master-Master Setup? (You should!) If that is the case, you could CREATE INDEX on the standby server, switch roles and do the same, then switch back. Be sure to disable replication temporarily (when using master-master) to avoid replicating the CREATE INDEX to the active node. Depending on whether you use that table primarily to archive Logs or similar, you might aswell look into the Archive Storage engine.
