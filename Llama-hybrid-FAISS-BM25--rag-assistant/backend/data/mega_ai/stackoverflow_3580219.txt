Obscure and encode a URL parameter

I want to encrypt a URL variable so that the user can't see the information when it is passed. I've found several scripts online but none of them work. Most seem to lean toward using base-64. Could someone help me write a short script that would encode or encrypt and then reverse that in the next page? It doesn't have to be super secure, just enough to mask an email address to the average user.
