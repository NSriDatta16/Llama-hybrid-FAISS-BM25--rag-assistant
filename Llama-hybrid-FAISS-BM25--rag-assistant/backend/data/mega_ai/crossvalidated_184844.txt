Any linear combination of the rows will have this property if all row weights add up to one. The most sensible weighting scheme is one that takes into account the number of elements in each row (if there are twice as many Asus as LG elements in the total population, ideally the Asus row will count for twice as much), and the second most sensible is $1/n$ (treating every row the same). For example, if we average each column we get $\frac{74.38+0+0+25}{4}=24.845$ for A and $\frac{25.62+100+100+75}{4}=75.155$ for B, which add up to 100. To prove the first sentence, suppose we know that $a_i+b_i=1 \forall\ i$. We then want to show that: $\sum_i (\alpha_i a_i+\alpha_i b_i)=1$ (the combination of percentages sums to 1) $\sum_i \alpha_i(a_i+b_i)=1$ (using distributive property) $\sum_i \alpha_i=1$ (using our assumption on sums for each $i$)
