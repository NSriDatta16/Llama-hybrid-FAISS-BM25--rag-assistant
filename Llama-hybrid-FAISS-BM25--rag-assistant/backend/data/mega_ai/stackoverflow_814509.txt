Outlook 2007 add-in - What event occurs when an user moves an email from a folder to another one?

I am writing an Outlook 2007 add-in. I would like to know what event occurs when user moves an email from a folder to another one (with drag and drop or with move to folder option). My application represents a spam filter, I have a Spam folder, and I need to know whenever user moves an email form inbox to spam or form spam to inbox (this means for me that the email was wrong classified and I have to retrain it). Thanks
