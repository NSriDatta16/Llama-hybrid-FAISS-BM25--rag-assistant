Although the results are going to be very similar, their interpretations differ. Confidence intervals imply the notion of repeating an experiment many times and being able to capture the true parameter 95% of times. But you cannot say you have a 95% chance of capturing it. Credible intervals (Bayesian), on the other hand, allow you to say that there is a 95% "chance" that the interval captures the true value. Update: A more Bayesian way of putting it would be that you could be 95% confident about your results. This is just because you went from $P(Data|Hypothesis)$ to $P(Hypothesis|Data)$ using Baye's Rule.
