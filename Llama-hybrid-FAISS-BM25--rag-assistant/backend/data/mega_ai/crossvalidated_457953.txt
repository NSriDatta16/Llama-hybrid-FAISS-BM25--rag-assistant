R: Importance of Categorical Variables in Random Forests

I'm applying a random forest algorithm, using the randomForest library in R, on a data set with 3 variables (gre, gpa, rank), one of the variables (rank) is categorical with 4 levels (1, 2, 3, 4), when extracting feature importance I get the "Mean Decrease Gini" of each variable, my question is: Is there a way to get the importance of each level of the rank predictor, the influence of each one of'em on the dependent variable, the significance of each or something similar to these three in R when using a randomForest classifier or any classifier for that matter? The code: library(randomForest) mydata $rank rank) RF output: A matrix: 3 Ã— 1 of type dbl MeanDecreaseGini gre 30.63603 gpa 42.76386 rank 18.85539 Thanks in advance.
