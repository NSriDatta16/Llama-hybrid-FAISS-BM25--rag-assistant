I assume Renewals/Cancellations are your expected output, so it can be considered as a binary classification. From where I stand, all you mentioned ( policies ) in your first paragraph is meaningless because I cannot see how I can use them to build any model. Rather, you better study what the clients who used to renew/cancel respectively look like. And that is the mighty " feature "! For example, you might take into consideration their gender, age, ethnicity, and annual income, etc. That would be more helpful than thinking only about your policy. Or, you can also try a probabilistic solution : think about the probability of the occurrence of cancellation of your company in the past, and the probability of the occurrence of cancellation of other companies given that they execute the same policy. What can you predict?
