You want to create a formula field and add the formula field to the report instead of the sex field. Something like this should work (my syntax may be slightly off) if {MyTable.sex} = 1 then "male" else "female" If you are unfamiliar with formula fields they are just expressions you can use and display in the report. In the 'Field Explorer' side bar in Crystal Reports you can see list of all the Database Fields etc. Just right click on the Formula Fields and add a new one. After you create the formula field you drag it onto your report layout just like any other normal field.
