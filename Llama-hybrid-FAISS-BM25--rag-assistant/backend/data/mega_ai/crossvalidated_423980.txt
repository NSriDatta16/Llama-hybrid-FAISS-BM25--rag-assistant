Regression diagnostics for ordered logistic regression

I am doing a regression with an ordinal dependent variable (answers ranging from very good to very bad) for the first time. The model itself seems to be working fine. I have no idea however which regression diagnostics I have to run to account for the model fit. I searched the internet but most pages just focus on the diagnostics for OLS or logistic regression with a binary DV. It would very helpful if someone could tell me which diagnostics are essential for an ordered logit model and ideally how to conduct and interpret them in Stata.
