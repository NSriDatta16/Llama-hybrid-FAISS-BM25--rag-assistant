Getting lucene to return only unique threads (indexing both threads and posts)

I have a StackOverflow-like system where content is organised into threads, each thread having content of its own (the question body / text), and posts / replies. I'm producing the ability to search this content via Lucene, and if possible I have decided I would like to index individual posts, (it makes the index easier to update, and means I have more control and ability to tweak the results), rather than index entire threads. The problem I have however is that I want the search to display a list of threads, rather than a list of posts. How can I get Lucene to return only unique threads as results, while also searching the content of the posts?
