To disable browser cache for JSP pages, create a Filter which is mapped on an url-pattern of *.jsp and does basically the following in the doFilter() method: HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) response; httpResponse.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"); // HTTP 1.1 httpResponse.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); // HTTP 1.0 httpResponse.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); // Proxies. This way you don't need to copypaste this over all JSP pages and clutter them with scriptlets . To enable browser cache for static components like CSS and JS, put them all in a common folder like /static or /resources and create a Filter which is mapped on an url-pattern of /static/* or /resources/* and does basically the following in the doFilter() method: httpResponse.setDateHeader("Expires", System.currentTimeMillis() + 604800000L); // 1 week in future.
