One trick I have used depending on the size of the data I'm keeping vs. the amount I'm deleting is to: select all the "data to keep" into another table (just for temporary storage) truncate the original table insert all the data from the temp storage table back into the original It works well if the amount you are keeping is smaller than what you are deleting. A similar option if all the database files are on the same disk (data and logs) and the data to be deleted is about half of the data, would be to export the "data to keep" to a file on a separate drive using the bcp command line utility, then truncate and insert the data file with bcp again. I've seen the DBAs take the database offline, backup the logs, turn off the logging and do it that way but that seems like a lot of hassle. :-)
