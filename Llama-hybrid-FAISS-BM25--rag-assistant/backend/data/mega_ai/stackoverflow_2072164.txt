From my Delphi 7 help file: The optional stored, default, and nodefault directives are called storage specifiers. They have no effect on program behavior, but control whether or not to save the values of published properties in form files. The stored directive must be followed by True, False, the name of a Boolean field, or the name of a parameterless method that returns a Boolean value. For example, property Name: TComponentName read FName write SetName stored False; If a property has no stored directive, it is treated as if stored True were specified. It controls whether or not to store a property relating to a component in the .DFM file for the form.
