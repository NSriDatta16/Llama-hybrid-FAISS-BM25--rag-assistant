first, put all of your content in a div element, and in a style sheet, set that element's opacity to 0. Then, with javascript, if the user's browser isn't IE, fade in, other wise just set it's opacity to 1. you could put it in document.ready or document.onload. if(navigator.userAgent.indexOf('MSIE')==-1) //if we are not using IE $('element').fadeIn(500); //fade out else $('element').css('opacity', '1') //set opacity to 0 if we are using IE If you want to base it off fadeIn actually working, instead of being based directly of if the browser is IE, then just replace navigator.userAgent.indexOf('MSIE')==-1 with $.support.opacity ( $.support.opacity is a better idea).
