If you want the buttons to capture events, then layer them above the pane. You say you cannot put the control panel above the pane, so break the buttons out into another view that you can put above the pane. If you want the buttons to appear under other views, then make some completely transparent custom buttons to handle you actions that you can layer on top. I don't know what you mean by the button touch methods are created in the xib file, but in general you cannot effectively pass touch events around. You must organize the view hierarchy so that the views you want to receive events are logically on top. However, nothing says that the views on top have to be opaque or even visible.
