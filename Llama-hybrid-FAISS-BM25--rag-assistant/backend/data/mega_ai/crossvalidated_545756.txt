We can use kernlab in R to get the support vectors with linear kernel: library(kernlab) df Note that the separating hyperplane found is different from the one drawn and the highlighted black points represent 4 support vectors. As expected, points near the decision surface are chosen to be the support vectors. With RBF kernel ( rbfdot ) and keeping other hyper-parameters fixed, the decision surface becomes non-linear and SVM outputs more (7) support vectors, as shown below: Changing (increasing) the regularization hyper-parameter $C$ (keeping other hyper-parameters fixed and using RBF kernel) will result in a different decision boundary and change (decrease) the number of support vectors (back to 4), as shown below. The following animation shows how the decision surface (the orientation of the decision hyperplance along with the margins) and the support vectors change with different value of the hyper-parameter C and kernel. As expected, with soft-margin SVM (for low values of $C$ ), we need more support vectors, to allow more noisy data, when compared to hard-margin SVM, that requires less number of support vectors (with narrower margins).
