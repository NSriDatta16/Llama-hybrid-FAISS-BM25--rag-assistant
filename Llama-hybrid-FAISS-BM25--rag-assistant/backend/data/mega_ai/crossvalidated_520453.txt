PCA on Stock Returns

I am working on a homework problem, but I'm still having some issues connecting the text / theory to R. The question at hand is: Now, as far as code, goes, I we worked an example in class, which I used to get me to where I needed to be, but I am having some issues understanding how to apply R to these to derive a solution. Right now I am just stuck on part (a), but I do some some questions about the other items as well, but we can start here. As for the code to do the PCA, here is what I have: # Perform a PCA using the corrlelation matrix boxplot(stock) R $values eig$ values / sum(eig $values) cumsum(eig$ values / sum(eig$values)) mean(eig $values) #is one since using correlation matrix plot(eig$ values, type = 'b') pcaOut $loadings #compare to eig$ vectors pcaOut $scores (pcaOut$ sdev)^2 #compare to eig $values eig$ values # Using the princomp() function pcaOut $loadings #compare to eig$ vectors pcaOut $scores (pcaOut$ sdev)^2 #compare to eig $values eig$ values Also, I've uploaded the data file here: http://thetruthindata.com/stock.dat From what I can see in the text, for part (a) we just take the variance of the 2nd linear combination, which ends up being a combination of those x values along with variances and covariance of the variables. I'm just trying to connect how to apply that or if I am even on the right track. I would think, in R, there would be an easy way to do this without a ton of coding. Thanks for any help to nudge me in right direction on part (a), when I get that figured out, I'm sure I'll need some nudging on some of the rest too.
