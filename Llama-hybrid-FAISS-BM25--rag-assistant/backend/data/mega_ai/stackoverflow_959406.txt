I've written an application for displaying maps from OpenStreetMap vector data ( http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Kosmos ). I developed my own simple MVP framework which uses Windsor Castle as an IoC container. You can download the source code if you're interested, it's currently BSD-licensed. Right now I'm (slowly) working on a redesign of this framework to be able to generate forms dynamically (instead of using the visual designer). I'm toying with the idea of introducing some kind of a fluent interface for building forms and controls, but I haven't yet come up with an elegant solution for this.
