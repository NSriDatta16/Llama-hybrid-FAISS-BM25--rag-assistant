There's a myriad of approaches you can do here but each really depend on your end goal. You can use a BOW approach and create a large sparse matrix like you've seen before with CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer. You can computer similarity scores between sentences using cosine distances. You can score them using bm25+. You can show average idf score. You can show co-occurance of terms in sentence when compared to values in same target or different target or all targets. You can embed the words into a continious vector space using word2vec, fasttext etc. In the end, it really comes down to what you're overall goal.
