I've never heard of Stata before but the webpage brags that it has " if, while " and " looping and branching ". Wikibooks has this example : local k = 1 file open myfile using toto.txt, read text file read myfile line while r(eof) == 0 { local k = `k' + 1 di "`k' `line'" file read myfile line } file close myfile I don't know what "proper" programming language means but at first glance it definitely appears to be Turing-complete.
