Small or large variances might occur just because the feature ranges are different. For example, while one feature is in range $[0,1]$ , the other might be in range $[0,1000]$ . The latter will most probably higher variance. So, omitting these low deviation features can harm your process seriously from the beginning. If all or your features are in more or less the same range, it might be logical to choose your lower bound for the deviation by looking at their histogram. Before proceeding, I advise you to pick one of the standard dimensionality reduction or feature selection methods, if your aim is to reduce your number of dimensions.
