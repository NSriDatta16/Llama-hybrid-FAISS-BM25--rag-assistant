You should be more specific in your question. If the keyword here is Java Software Tester, than expect questions about: unit testing (assertions, test suits, testSetUp etc), unit testing frameworks (junit, testNG), mocks usage and different mock frameworks(EasyMock, Mockito, jMock), Continuous Integration, Test Driven Development, Behavior Driven Development, working with code repository,code coverage, path coverage, statement coverage, tools for bug tracking (bugzilla/jira)... maybe some about class invariants, design by contract... You can get something practical like, code review, write tests for some class/interface, write something using TDD approach. If the keywords are Java Software Tester than expect questions about: Boundary Values, Equivalence Classes, black-box testing, white-box testing, Test Case, Test Suite, Bug Report, Software Development models (V model, waterfall, DSDM, iterative, agile approach), role of testing in development cycle, role of a tester on development team, when testing is enough, what is quality, definitions and differences between issue, bug, defect, fault, what differences in iseb/istqb/Tmap certifications, what is difference between System/Integration/UserAcceptance/smoke/regression testing, when to automatize and what are pros and cons, tools for test acclimatization (not unit tests), tools for test/bug management (HP QualityCenter/IBM Rational Quality Manager)... As for practical stuff: how would you test installer or wizard, write bug report, re-design/optimize test case/script, (if position connected with test acclimatization) write code snippet in VBscript (or other scripting language). In either case check SO for questions with proper tags and/or google for mentioned topics.
