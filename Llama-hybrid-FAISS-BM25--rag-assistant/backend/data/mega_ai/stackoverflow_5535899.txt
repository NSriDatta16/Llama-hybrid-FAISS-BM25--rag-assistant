Line (2) has undefined behaviour. The compiler is at liberty to place constants in read-only memory (once upon a time in Windows this would have been a "data segment") so writing to it might cause your program to terminate. Or it might not. Having to cast const-ness away when calling a poorly-defined library function (non-const parameter which should be const) is, alas, not unusual. Do it, but hold your nose.
