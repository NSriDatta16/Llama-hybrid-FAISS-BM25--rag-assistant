GLMNET small deviance explained; reuse of selected predictors in other model

I am trying to run glmnet for logistic regression (I have some continuos predictors which I have scaled with scale() and some categorical which I turned to dummy predictors, 27 predictors, 800 observations). I passed the data to: glmnet(x,y, family='binomial', alpha = 1, standardize = FALSE) The primary goal was to use LASSO method for selecting predictors, but the explained deviance by the model was only about 8.3% (everywhere I saw at least 60%). Should I stop here and give it up, or should I proceed to cv.glmnet and choose the model according to cv$lambda.min / cv$lambda.1se ? After the selection I was wondering if passing selected variable to GLM and compute ods ratios would be possible / fair ? Thank you, Matyas (my first post here - please be patient with me)
