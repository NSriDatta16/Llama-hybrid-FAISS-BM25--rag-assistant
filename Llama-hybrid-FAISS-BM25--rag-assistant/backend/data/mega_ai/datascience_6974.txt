If you have the tags of each of the questions that you mined, then supervised methods make sense. You might use the tf-idf representation of a given question, feed it to an SVM or neural net, and use that to predict 0/1 for each tag in your target set. If there are too many possible classes (tags), it may be tricky to balance your data. A simpler approach might be to use the tf-idf vectors to compute the K-Nearest-Neighbors of a question; then you can use the tags of the most similar documents (by whatever distance metric does best) to predict the likelihood that question has each tag. If you don't have the tags for the questions you mined, you should consider unsupervised methods. LDA , for example, could identify topics within the questions and important words within those topics
