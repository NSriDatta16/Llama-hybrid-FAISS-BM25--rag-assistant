The way I do do this in IB is set the View Mode in the document window to Outline View (2nd button). Then I drag the view from the library on top of the scroll view and it will be inserted as a subview of the scrollview. If you get a disclosure triangle next to your scrollview it will have had the new view inserted as a subview.
