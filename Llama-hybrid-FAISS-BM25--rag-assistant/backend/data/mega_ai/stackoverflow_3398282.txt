I don't think it's possible without creating a second (or third) target, and putting config-specific resources in its Copy Bundle Resources step. Alternatively, you could copy all resources in your existing target, and then use a post-build step to selectively delete unrelated resources, but you'll incur some overhead, and it's not exactly an elegant solution.
