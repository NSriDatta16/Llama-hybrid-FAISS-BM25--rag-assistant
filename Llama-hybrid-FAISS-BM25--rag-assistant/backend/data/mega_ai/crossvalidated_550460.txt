Is "controlling for variables" via multiple regression the same as feature importance, SHAP values with regression via xgboost?

There are a few posts going over the fact that "controlling for variables" in traditional stats involves building a regression model and including possible covariates in the model. An examples would be from this post here: How exactly does one “control for other variables”? Would prediction via regression using a more advanced algorithm (eg xgboost) and then checking the PDP/feature importance/SHAP values be comparable? Or do these other methods not give you similar conclusions to looking at coefficients in a regression model?
