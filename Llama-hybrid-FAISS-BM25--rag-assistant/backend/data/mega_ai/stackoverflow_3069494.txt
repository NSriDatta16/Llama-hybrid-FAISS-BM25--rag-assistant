Also, with textmate, do I actually define a project in textmate or do I just work on the files and textmate doesn't create its own .project type file ? You can do both. You can create a new project in TextMate by going to File -> New Project and add your files manually, or you can drag a folder into TextMate and it will create a project from those files (you can add other files later). Note that the second method will not create a .tmproj file, though, so if you want to "keep" that project, you'll have to save it (File -> Save Project).
