Are there any tutorials on Bayesian probability theory or graphical models by example?

I've seen references to learning Bayesian probability theory in R, and I was wondering if there is more like this, perhaps specifically in Python? Geared towards learning Bayesian probability theory, inference, maximum likelihood estimation, graphical models and the sort?
