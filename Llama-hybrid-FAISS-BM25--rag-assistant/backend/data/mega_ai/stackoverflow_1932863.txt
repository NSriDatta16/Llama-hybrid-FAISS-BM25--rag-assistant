Did you have the GIS features in MySQL as well? IIRC, that means that you were using MyISAM and not a transaction-capable storage manager, which means you're really not comparing apples to apples. Also, is your application actually ever going to do this? A completely unqualified SELECT of all the rows? If not, you are better looking at the performance of things that you are actually going to be doing, which probably would involve at least WHERE clauses. (though this of course also cannot be fairly compared to non-crashsafe non-transactional system)
