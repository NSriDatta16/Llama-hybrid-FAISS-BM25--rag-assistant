mod_rewrite is one answer, but for something simple like this, it's like nukeing a building to kill a mosquito in one of the rooms. There's $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'] available to extract extra path bits, e.g. http://example.com/dynamic-images.php/pie-chart/red/average-profits would have $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'] = '/pie-chart/red/average-profits'; which you can then parse with: $query = explode('/', $_SERVER['PATH_INFO']); and you end up with: $query = array( 0 => '', 1 => 'pie-chart', 2 => 'red', 3 => 'average-profits'; ); If you don't want the .php extension exposed in the URL, you can force the web server to treat 'dynamic-images' as a PHP script with an AddHandler directive.
