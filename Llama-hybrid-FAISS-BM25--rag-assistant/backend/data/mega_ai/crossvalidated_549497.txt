Tavrock mentions the Chi-squared test as a solution. I disagree that this would be an appropriate test for a few reasons. First of all, I imagine you are not interested in knowing if differences exist between messages, you're more interested in knowing which message leads to largest click through . This is an altogether different hypothesis than the one the chi-squared is designed to test. Additionally, even if the chi-squared was an appropriate test, the test does not easily offer estimates of click through rate along with their uncertainty. A better (and not much more complex approach) is to use a Bayesian decision making framework, as I do here . This is approach is easily extended to $n$ marketing messages.
