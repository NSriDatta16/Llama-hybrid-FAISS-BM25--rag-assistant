javascript JSON.parse result problem on empty array with localStorage

I initialized a localStorage variable with the following function: if (!localStorage["store"]) { var aaa = new Array(); localStorage["store"] = JSON.stringify(aaa); } It seems to work ok, but when I try use that array in order to add elements with the following code: var one_stat = new Array( s1, s2 , resultat ); var statistics = JSON.parse(localStorage["store"]); statistics.push( one_stat ); localStorage["store"] = JSON.stringify(statistics); I get the following error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [] has no method 'push' I am using Google Chrome 10.0.648.151 on Ubuntu. Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong? Thanks.
