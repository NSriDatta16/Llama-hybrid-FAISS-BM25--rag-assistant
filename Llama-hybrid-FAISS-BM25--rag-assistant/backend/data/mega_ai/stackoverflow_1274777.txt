You can handle the events on the view itself, or your view controller could have a delegate class that changes for different types of question. That delegate would process the different input, and react in a different way to user touches. Here's some code with the idea. // In QuestionViewControllerDelegateProtocol.h @protocol QuestionViewControllerDelegateProtocol // Define the methods you want here - (void)touchesBegan; - (void)touchesEnded; - (void)questionLoaded; @end // In QuestionViewController.h @interface QuestionViewController { id delegate; } @end // In QuestionViewController.m @implementation QuestionViewController - (void)viewDidLoad:(BOOL)animated { [delegate questionLoaded]; } - (void)touchesBegan { // Some processing logic. [delegate touchesBegan]; } @end
