I think if you have MyEclipse, it adds a label to the Project Properties page which contains the total number of source code lines. Might not help you as MyEclipse is not free though. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough in my case so I wrote a source analyzer to gather statistics not gathered by other solutions (for example the metrics mentioned by AlbertoPL).
