Assistance with Some Interesting Syntax in Some Ruby Code I've Found

I'm currently reading Agile Web Development With Rails, 3rd edition. On page 672, I came across this method: def capitalize_words(string) string.gsub(/\b\w/) { $&.upcase } end What is the code in the block doing? I have never seen that syntax. Is it similar to the array.map(&:some_method) syntax?
