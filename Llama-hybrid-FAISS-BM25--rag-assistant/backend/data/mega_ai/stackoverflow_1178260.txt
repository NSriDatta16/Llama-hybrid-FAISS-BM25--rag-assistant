I am taking a guess here, but I think you are asking if it is possible to allow users to drag/drop your Google Maps Markers. You can set the draggable property on the GMarkerOptions object that you pass to your GMarker when you create it. You can handle the events (drag/drop) on the markers to update your data. You can read about it in the Google Maps API Reference .
