Should I try to predict the probability of being 1 or zero based on recall score?

I built a random forest model to classify if a men's NCAA basketball game would go over or under the total. The model was given training data that specified over as 1 and under as 0. I then used a classification report to calculate the precision, recall, f1-score, and support. These were my results: for a model like this when my goal is to accurately predict whether the test data will have an outcome of 1 or 0 should I use recall in my decision for choosing whether to try to predict if the outcome will be a 0 or 1? Also I had my model using predict_proba and using the second value from the array return which would give me the probability of the test data outcome being a 1, but from this classification report it looks like I should be trying to predict the probability of the outcome being 0 as it is more descriptive when it comes to recall. # Example: # less accurate way ynew = model.predict(Xnew) results = ynew[0][1] # predict probability of Xnew being 1 # Example 2: # more accurate way ynew = model.predict(Xnew) results = ynew[0][0] # predict probability of Xnew being 0 Is my assumption correct?
