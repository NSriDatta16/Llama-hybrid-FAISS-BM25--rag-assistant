Strange behaviour with range.toString()

I want to get back the text that I select in an element using the Range object provided by Mozilla's flavour of javascript. So I do this: //assume that I'm only using Firefox, and there is just one selection var range = window.getSelection().getRangeAt(0); var rangeText = range.toString(); This works OK when the html of the selected text doesn't have any newlines In other words, if I have the following html: One. Two. Three. Four. Five. and I select Two. Three. Four. , then everything is fine. On the other hand, if I have One. Two. Three. Four. Five. and I select Two. Three. Four. as before, there are newlines introduced into the result returned from Range.toString(); the newlines are after Two. , Three. , and Four. Obviously, when displayed in the browser, both html fragments are identical. Is there a way I can ensure that the same text is returned without newlines?
