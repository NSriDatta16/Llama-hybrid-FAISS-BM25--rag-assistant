In short I want to relate inner class to the real world Object Orientation. The expression " Real world Object Orientation " does not make much sense since the world is not 100% object oriented. Object Orientation is a simplification , it is a means to create simplified models of real world systems. Putting that aside, you want examples in real life? C'mon, are you kidding me. It's not that hard. Consider your first sentence which already gives you an idea of how it would work in real life: The inner class is always inside the outer class and if we remove outer class then inner class would also be destroyed. Classes are not destroyed. Objects, instances of those classes are. You need to get your definitions right. I'm assuming you understand the concept of classes and objects, right? If not, I suggest you stop now. Second, outer and inner classes do not necessarily mean composition. An instance of an inner class can exist and not be destroyed when the outer class enclosing object instance is destroyed. Real life example of Inner/Outer Classes that DO NOT relate in Composition: A Nissan 240SX car is an instance (a specific car) of that model (the Outer class). It's engine (which specific for that model) is a specific object or instance of the Nissan 240SX engine (the inner class). The car (the object instance of the outer class) gets in an accident and is mostly destroyed, but the engine (the object instance of the inner class) is salvaged (it is not destroyed.) Real Life Example of Inner/Outer Classes that relate in Composition: Heart (or any internal organs) - inner class Body - outer class. If an actual body (an object instance of the outer class), its heart (its object instance of the inner class that happens to relate in composition to the enclosing body) dies as well. Real Life Example of Composition that does involve Inner/Outer Classes: Bank Account - enclosing class Transaction - enclosed class A transaction is simply some money and an action type (debit, credit). It is too simple to warrant special treatment or manufacturing from a bank account. You close (destroy) a bank account, and all transactions within it also get destroyed. Obviously, they do not get destroyed as a bank will keep records of a closed account (and all activity in it), but from the point of view of the owner of the account, the account and its internals get closed/destroyed. What is Composition? Wikipedia Link What is an Inner Class? Wikipedia Link One More Thing: Google is your friend. If you really want to get somewhere as an engineer, you better learn how to do your own research.
