This type of approach is often used,* but it has some dangers. First are the problems inherent in any attempt at automated model selection like that. Second is the inherent omitted-variable bias in Cox models. As with logistic regression , omitting any predictor associated with outcome from a Cox model will tend to bias the magnitudes of coefficients of included predictors down toward zero. Unlike with linear regression, this is the case even if the omitted predictor is uncorrelated with the included predictors. So with the single-predictor analyses there is a risk of missing an important contributor on this account. An approach based on knowledge of the subject matter is generally best. It might be possible to use such knowledge to combine multiple related risk factors into single combined predictors (without looking first at their relationships with outcome). Or you could take advantage of the penalization provided by ridge regression to allow a higher ratio of included predictors to events. The penalization might be omitted from predictors like smoking that you expect to be strongly associated with outcome. These types of issues are explained in Frank Harrell's course notes and book , with illustrative examples. *The single-predictor p-value cutoff for inclusion in that approach to Cox multiple regression is a rule of thumb to get the number of predictors down to a reasonable value. A value of 0.20 is not always the choice.
