Embedding a .app file in a Cocoa application

Is it possible to "embed" an application (like Preview, Pages etc) into a Cocoa application? I would like to allow a user to view a PDF in my app with options to show/hide annotations, change the zoom level between page width and full page etc. Is it possible to embed the Preview app within my Cocoa application? Couldn't find anything in the document or on the Internet which would suggest I could, so not sure. Thanks.
