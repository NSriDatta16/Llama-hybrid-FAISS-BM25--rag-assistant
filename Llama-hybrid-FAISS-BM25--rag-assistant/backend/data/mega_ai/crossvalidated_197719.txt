How to perform crossvalidation using SVM polynomial?

I am using an SVM polynomial kernel ( statistics toolbox ) with order ranging (say) from 3 to 9. When we perform cross validation with rbf function, we intend to determine the sigma and C values. With the best sigma and cost factor value, the trained network is tested on the test set. Do we determine cost function and sigma as well while performing cross-validation using SVM polynomial kernel? The commands that I intend to use are structtr = svmtrain(z1, trainoutput, 'Kernel_Function', 'Polynomial', 'Polyorder', i, 'showplot', false); grouparousallat = svmclassify(structtr, w1, 'showplot', false);
