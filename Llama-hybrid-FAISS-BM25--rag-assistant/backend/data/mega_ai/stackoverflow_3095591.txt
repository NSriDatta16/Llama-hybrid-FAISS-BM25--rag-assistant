This is default and expected behaviour. Apparently the previous server has some proprietary configuration setting for that. None in Tomcat comes to mind. Regardless, scriptlets is a vintage technique and its use is discouraged over a decade. It has been succeeded by taglibs (like JSTL) and Expression Language (EL) in combination with a Servlet as controller. E.g. in Servlet's doGet() : String str = null; request.setAttribute("str", str); request.getRequestDispatcher("page.jsp").forward(request, response); and in page.jsp : The value of str is ${str} EL will by default print nothing if the value equals null while scriptlet expression ( ) by default prints whatever String#valueOf() returns.
