I'm going to take a different tack than the other answers, and argue both sides of the question. First, let's show that voting is a pointless waste of time. The function of an election is to derive a single outcome, called "the will of the electorate", from many samples of the individual wills of individual electors. Presumably that number of electors is large; we're not concerned here with cases of dozens or hundreds of electors. When deciding whether you should vote, there are two possibilities. Either, as you note, there is a strong preference -- say, 51% or better -- in the electorate for one outcome. In such a scenario the probability that you will cast the "deciding" vote is minuscule, and so no matter which side of the issue you are on, you're better off staying home and not entailing all the costs of voting. Now suppose the other possibility: the electorate is so narrowly divided that even a small number of voters choosing to vote or not vote could completely change the outcome. But in this scenario, there is no "will of the electorate" at all! In this scenario you might as well call off the election and flip a coin, saving the expense of the election entirely. It seems like on rational grounds there is no reason to vote. Suppose a large fraction of the electorate reasons this way -- and, why shouldn't they? I live in the 43rd district of Washington State, one of the most "blue" districts in the United States. No matter which candidate I support in the district election, I can tell you right now what the party affiliation of the winner will be in my district, so why should I vote? The reason to vote is to consider the strategic consequences of "a large fraction of the electorate considers it pointless and does not vote" upon small groups of ideologues. This attitude hands power to comparatively small, well-organized blocs who may show up en masse when not expected; if the number of voters is greatly reduced by a large fraction "rationally" deciding to stay home and not vote, then the size of a bloc required to swing an election against the clear will of the majority is greatly reduced. Voting when "not rationally necessary" decreases the probability that an effort to swing the election by a relatively small group will succeed, and thereby increases the probability that the actual will of the majority can be determined.
