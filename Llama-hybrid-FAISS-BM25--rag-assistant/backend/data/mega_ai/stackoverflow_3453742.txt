What is a neat way to vertically decrease opacity in a group of paragraphs of text in HTML

I am writing an application in rails. I have multiple paragraphs of dynamic text which are listed vertically. I am looking at neat way through javascript or CSS to vertically increase opacity of the group of paragraphs so the body of text has the appearance if disappearing as you go down the page. Some text obviously more than i am writing here || Some text obviously more than i am writing here || increase opacity Some text obviously more than i am writing here \/ 1./ Whats a standard method of phasing just one paragraph vertically and horizontally? 2./ How would I phase the group?
