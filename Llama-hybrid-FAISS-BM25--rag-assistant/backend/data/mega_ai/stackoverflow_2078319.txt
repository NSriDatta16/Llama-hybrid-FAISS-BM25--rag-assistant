I have used EC2 for cpu intensive purpose. I have pretty bad experience with small instance of it. But, luckily they provide a high cpu system (5 times the small instance in cpu terms) also at double the cost. Its work pretty fine for me. So, now issue is non-persistent storage of EC2 instances. For hdd data, you can use EC2 blocks which are persistent. For, mysql you can setup a EC2 block as a mysql server ( refer ) or you can use their Amazon's Relational Database Service (which provides auto scaling) And getting started with EC2 is really easy :) You can also look at rackspace's cloud computing service ( http://www.rackspacecloud.com/ ), if you are looking for more options
