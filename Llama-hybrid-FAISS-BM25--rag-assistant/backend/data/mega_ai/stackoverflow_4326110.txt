That can be written fairly easily using one of the email wrapper scripts, such as phpMailer. However, when doing so, pay particular attention to issues that could lead to spam and other abuse of the form. You should spend the time to really lock down the client-side, as well as server-side validation on all input variables. That being said, the best way is to save the HTML of the page in a database, and pull it out into the body of the email. You should also include a text-only version as an alternate body so people without HTML email will be able to read it. Then, when someone submits the form, just validate the data, put together the message with the methods available with the mailer class you choose, send the email, and then redirect to a "thank you" page.
