R PCA: principal (psych package) vs prcomp loadings

I have a couple of questions regarding differences in loading values when using prcomp and principal (from the psych ) package to perform PCA When conducting PCA using prcomp : pca_results I get the following loadings: PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 q3 -0.016809164 0.134292686 -0.1757822345 1.108893e-01 -0.1319508350 q5 0.050866015 -0.161877460 0.0892043331 2.767157e-02 0.1474154691 q8 -0.008870246 -0.015767530 0.0115132365 1.618538e-01 0.2722705733 When using principal from the psych package: pca_fit I get these loading values instead: PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 q3 -0.335 -0.369 0.207 0.211 q5 -0.149 0.403 0.187 -0.235 q8 0.301 -0.435 My first question: why is there a difference in the loading values between the 2 methods? Which is correct? I've also tried prcomp with center and scale set to FALSE but the numbers still don't match My second question: what does the missingness in the principal loadings indicate? Is it some threshold of loading value, below which nothing is shown?
