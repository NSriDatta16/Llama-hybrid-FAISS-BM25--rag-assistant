You probably have to look more closely at what it is your shop does wrong and what they do right. What can you actually change there? What can you change about your own practices that will improve your skills or that of your team? It can be difficult to realize change in an entrenched shop. Try proposing code reviews (on your code first), which could lead to discussion. For tangible items, I'd look at Scott Meyers ' Effective C++, etc. Develop your skillset and you will either help improve others around you or move on to a shop that will. Also, look at the Gang of Four's Design Patterns book.
