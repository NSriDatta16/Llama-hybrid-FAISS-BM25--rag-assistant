Fact and/or generic knowledge storage

How can generic facts be stored in a database such as '3 injured in Kansas fire' or 'Spain wins 2010 Worldcup'? The end result would be to have some table(s) where if multiple entries for people being injured or multiple entries for sports scores - data could be queried/totaled. desired query would be to see how many injuries have occurred in a date range.
