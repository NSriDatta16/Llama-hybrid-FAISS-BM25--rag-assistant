Problem about python writing files

I've got a weird problem with python programming. I used the statement'writelines()' to write a series of lists into a new file.During the process I could see the context in the file icon via preview, however once after the program finished running the output file comes out to be a blank file. In short, my problem is that the program doesn't have any output but a blank file. Here's the code: infile=open('/Users/Jim/Desktop/py/result.txt','r') outfile=open('/Users/Jim/Desktop/py/output.txt','a') line=infile.readline() i=1 while(line): check=str(i)+':' if line.startswith(check): i+=1 block=[infile.readline() for j in range(1,7)] judge=block[1].split() for j in judge: if j=='stem' or j=='differetiation' or j=='differetiating': outfile.write(str(i)+':\n') outfile.writelines(block) #check if the paragraph has the given key words, if true then write the paragraph into the output file. break line=infile.readline() outfile.close() infile.close() Some additional information if helpful: The python version is 2.6.3, and the os is Mac OS 10.6.
