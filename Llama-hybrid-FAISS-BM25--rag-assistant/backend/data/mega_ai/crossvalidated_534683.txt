Is the output anova(test='Chisq') and an anova(test='LRT') when comparing logistic regression fits?

I have to run LRT to compare two logistic regression models. when I run the code below I noticed the output seems identical. In this scenario are these identical tests? If so in what scenario would they be different? input_null
