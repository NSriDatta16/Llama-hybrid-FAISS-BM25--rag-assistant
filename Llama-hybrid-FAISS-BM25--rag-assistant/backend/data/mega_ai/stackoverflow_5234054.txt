You cannot point to an existing site during the team project creation wizard The granularity of team projects can be indeed per project, or it can be on a higher level (organization / department / ...). There will be advocates for the one and for the other option. In my opinion it depends how related the projects are. If they share the same code base, same documentation or release schedule, then use one team project. If it are totally different products / applications, then use multiple team projects. That are just my 2 cents.
