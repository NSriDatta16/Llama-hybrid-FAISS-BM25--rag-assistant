What is a "split-body" RCT?

I am reading the RCT Wikipedia page, in particular the classification by study design . There are described four types of RCT: (i) parallel groups (ii) crossover (iii) cluster (iv) factorial. Then there is written: An analysis of the 616 RCTs indexed in PubMed during December 2006 found that 78% were parallel-group trials, 16% were crossover, 2% were split-body, 2% were cluster, and 2% were factorial What is a "split-body" RCT? It is not described in the paragraph before.
