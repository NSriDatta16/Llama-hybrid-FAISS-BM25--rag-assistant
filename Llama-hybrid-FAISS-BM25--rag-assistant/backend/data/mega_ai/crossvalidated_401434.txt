How to weight values for a weighted average

I have 100 answers regarding production times in minutes of a certain product from 100 manufacturers around the country. I also know if these companies have met any of the 3 quality standards relating to manufacturing this product. I want to create a standard of what are efficient production times but I also want to include all the data. Anyway, I'd like to know how to weight the production times by quality standards met. I have 4 categories, 0=no, 1=1 standard met, etc. One idea I had is just multiplying the inspection time by the standards met to weight the insp. times. So if one manufacturer took 45 minutes to produce the product and met two standards I could multiply it by two, and at the end of doing this to all of them take the average. Does this sound good? If not any ideas?
