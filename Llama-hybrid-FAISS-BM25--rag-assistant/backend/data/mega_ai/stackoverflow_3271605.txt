phpunit does not find tests in directory

i am trying to execute all tests in subfolders of my test directory. This works locally on my computer but not on the integration server. phpunit does not find the test files hudson@slipstream:~/.hudson/jobs/stendhal_website/workspace$ phpunit tests PHPUnit 3.4.5 by Sebastian Bergmann. Time: 0 seconds, Memory: 4.50Mb OK (0 tests, 0 assertions) The test file, however, does exist and is readable: hudson@slipstream:~/.hudson/jobs/stendhal_website/workspace$ find tests -name \*Test.php tests/scripts/pharauroa/common/net/deserializerTest.php hudson@slipstream:~/.hudson/jobs/stendhal_website/workspace$ ls -l tests/scripts/pharauroa/common/net/deserializerTest.php -rw-r--r-- 1 hudson hudson 6957 Jul 17 12:54 tests/scripts/pharauroa/common/net/deserializerTest.php I can start it by explicitly specifying it on the command line of phpunit: hudson@slipstream:~/.hudson/jobs/stendhal_website/workspace$ phpunit tests/scripts/pharauroa/common/net/deserializerTest.php PHPUnit 3.4.5 by Sebastian Bergmann. ..... Time: 0 seconds, Memory: 5.00Mb OK (5 tests, 32 assertions) What I tried so far: Using strace, I can see that phpunit recursively scans the tests directory and even stats the deserializerTest.php file. But it does not open "phpunit tests" works fine on my local computer. Both computers are running Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 and phpunit 3.4.5. The server is running within a chroot. I tried to use phpunit `find tests -name \*.php` but phpunit only pays attention to the first parameter. I know that it is possible to write suite classes but that seems like a maintenance nightmare. It feels like I am missing something obvious.
