Drag an ImageList onto your form and use the Image List functions to move it around: Create a Bitmap object of the size of your control (but not more than 256x256). Copy the image of your control into the Bitmap: using (Graphics gfx = Graphics.FromImage(bmp)) { gfx.CopyFromScreen(...) } Add it to your ImageList. Call ImageList_BeginDrag(). Call DoDragDrop() In your OnDragMove handler, call ImageList_DragMove() to move it around as the mouse moves. When DoDragDrop returns, call ImageList_DragLeave(). I have been calling ImageList_DragEnter() and ImageList_DragLeave(), which seems to convert the coordinates used by ImageList_DragMove() to client coordinates, but my reading of the documentation suggests it is not necessary.
