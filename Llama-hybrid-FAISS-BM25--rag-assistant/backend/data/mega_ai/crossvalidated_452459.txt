Negative correlation between y and X, yet positive coef. in Logit model?

I was playing around with some data on the presidential elections in 2016 and I got a result that doesn't seem to make sense. I am running a Logit model on percentage voted for Trump as dependent and my two independent variables are average minimum wage and rate of unemployment from 2012 to 2015. Here is my code: import statsmodels.api as sm import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv("Data_sets/pres_and_unemp_data.csv", index_col=0) y = df["pct"] X = df[["min_wage", "Rate"]] result = sm.Logit(y, X).fit() print(result.summary2()) print(df.corr()) And this is the output: Optimization terminated successfully.
