Probability of overlap between independent samples of different sizes

Today, I was trying to use probabilities to make an 'everyday' (and not very important) decision... but I found that I'd forgotten how to approach this sort of problem (if I am correct in believing that I ever knew how to deal with a problem like this). Here is the form of the problem I was trying to solve: There are Q objects in a container, each with its own unique color. Agent1 takes a sample G of M unique objects out of the container, and then puts those M objects back into the container. If Agent2 takes a sample V of L unique objects out of the container, then... What is the probability that the larger of the sets G and V will contain the smaller of these sets? What is the probability that the sets G and V will have an overlap of T elements? To give you a rough idea of what I was trying to figure out, I was thinking: "Hmm... There are 10,000 'things' to choose from, and I assume (for simplicity!) that each one has an equal chance of being chosen. I've picked 900 'things'. My friend picked 1500 things... and he picked 890 things in common with me. How likely is it that my friend peeked at my 'picking' history, and copied me?"
