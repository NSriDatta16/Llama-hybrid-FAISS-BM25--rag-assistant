One of the easiest rescale algorithms is nearest-neighbour. Suppose your are rescaling from an image in an array of size x1 y1 to another size x2 y2. The idea is to find the nearest integer offset in original array to each target array position. So your rescale algorithm ends for something like this: const int x1 = 512; const int y1 = 512; const int x2 = 64; const int y2 = 64; unsigned char orig[x1*y1]; /* Original byte array */ unsigned char target[x2*y2] /* Target byte array */ for(int i=0;i This will give a blocky resized image. For better results you can use average or any other fancier polynomial based interpolators.
