Perhaps use correlation analysis to be able to detect a feature in the curve? Compute a target signal similar to the feature that you are searching for, and then use correlation analysis to find the location of the feature. This is a well-known procedure in Digital Signal Processing (DSP). I would highly recommend reading the DSP guide by Steven W. Smith at the first link below. You appear to be interested in a matched filtering problem. If the time series that you are working with is very long, you can split the signal up and run correlation analysis on each segment ( see my comp.dsp post here ).
