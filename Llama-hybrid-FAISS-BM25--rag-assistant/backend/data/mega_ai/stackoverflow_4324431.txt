You can't directly use operator new inside of semantic actions, use phoenix::new_<> instead. Moreover, attributes for rules are specified using the function notation syntax. Therefore, you'll need to change your rule declarations to: qi::rule draw_forward; Here is an additional tip. If you change the start rule to: start = *turtle_commands >> qi::eps; you can avoid the semantic action alltogether. By converting the rule into a (parser) sequence you can leverage the attribute propagation rules for sequences, allowing to directly map the first element of your fusion sequence (the vector_astnode_t turtle_commands ) onto the first element of the parser sequence (the *turtle_commands ). I'm not able to compile your example as it is incomplete, so more problems might be hidden.
