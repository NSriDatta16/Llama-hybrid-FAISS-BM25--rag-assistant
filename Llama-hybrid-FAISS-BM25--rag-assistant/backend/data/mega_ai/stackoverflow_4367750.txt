First thing, it doesn't matter if it's C, C++, or D. Any compilable programming language at the end gives you (mostly) the same assembly object file. Second thing, STL is written in C++, you cannot write C++ library in C or any other language (well, you can but I assume, that we're talking on reasonable solutions). You cannot implement STL containers in C, because the're strongly use templates. GCC generate really nice output in asm for exceptions now. I recommend to read about C++ ABI (if you're interested in it). C++ compiler understands all C++ specific features really nice nowadays. Thanks to really advanced code analysis and optimizations, it's able to produce fast executables (see first paragraph). I hope that I've at least partly answered your question.
