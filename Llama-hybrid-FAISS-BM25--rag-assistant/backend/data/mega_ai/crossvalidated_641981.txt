Intercept term of logistic regression in ADMM algorithm

On page 66, the authors of article of ADMM says that the algorithm can be modified to obtain the intercept term easily in the sparse logistic regression model. Can someone explain this easy modification, please? (We assume that the intercept term is not penalized. So adding a column of ones to the design matrix does not solve the problem.)
