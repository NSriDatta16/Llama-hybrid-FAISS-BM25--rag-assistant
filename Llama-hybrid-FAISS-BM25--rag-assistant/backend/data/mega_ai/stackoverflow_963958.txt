How to set image path for fckeditor?

I am using fckeditor for PHP. I have set an absolute path for image uploading. I can upload images, but I am unable to use images that were uploaded. Can anyone help me find my problem? Here is the code I have changed in my config.php file: // Path to user files relative to the document root. $Config['UserFilesPath'] = '/userfiles/' ; // Fill the following value it you prefer to specify the absolute path for the // user files directory. Useful if you are using a virtual directory, symbolic // link or alias. Examples: 'C:\\MySite\\userfiles\\' or '/root/mysite/userfiles/'. // Attention: The above 'UserFilesPath' must point to the same directory. $Config['UserFilesAbsolutePath'] = '/var/www/host/mysite//userfiles/' ;
