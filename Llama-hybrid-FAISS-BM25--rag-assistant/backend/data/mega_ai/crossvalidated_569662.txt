As an addition to the answer by @gung, let us look at another way: Simulating the null distribution of the $\chi^2$ test statistic, unconditionally , and not as with the Fisher exact test, use the conditional distribution (conditional on the two margins). As an example, I will use the $2\times 3$ table from Fisher's exact test in 3x2 contingency table below: mydat a b c A 2 12 1 B 5 3 1 We must calculate (really estimate) the marginal probabilities from this table, and then use this to estimate the probabilities of the table, under independence. Then we use this in multinomial sampling, with the same sample size. One problem which shows, is that some (in this example more than 10%) of the simulated tables have some zero margins. That makes for a problem in calculating chi-square, since it means that we are dividing by zero. My R functions return then NaN (Not a Number). For the illustrations below, I have decided to simply remove this values, although that is certainly debatable. I get the following simulated null distribution: overlaid in red is the density of the usual approximate chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom. We can use this to calculate a simulated p-value, which turns out as 0.0523 as compared to the usual p-value, as returned by R's chisq.test , which is 0.06293 . The simulation option of that function gives a p-value of 0.04927 . But, the problem of what to do in the case of simulated tables with null margins is interesting. It shows that simulating the null distribution of the chi-squared test statistic, unconditionally, is not unproblematic. The results above is not really unconditional, they are conditional on no null margins. Using the Fisher exact test, pragmatically avoids the issue!
