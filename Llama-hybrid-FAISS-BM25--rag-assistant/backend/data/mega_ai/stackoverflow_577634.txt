How to get the "friendly" OS Version Name?

I am looking for an elegant way to get the OS version like: "Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1" or "Windows Server 2008 Standard Edition" etc. Is there an elegant way of doing that? I am also interested in the processor architecture (like x86 or x64).
