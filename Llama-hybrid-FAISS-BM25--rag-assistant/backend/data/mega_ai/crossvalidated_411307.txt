Calculate risk between classes

I am doing some exercises about logistic regression with SAS and I need to calculate and interpret odds. For calculating the individual probabilities I use those formulas: While later, the Professor, calculates odds for rent and own categories: My question is, how is obtained the odd for rent of 0.3911 and the odd for own of 0.2610 ? I don't understand from which calculations those numbers come from. Moreover, in SAS I have class level information How to interpret it in this context and to use if for estimating odds?
