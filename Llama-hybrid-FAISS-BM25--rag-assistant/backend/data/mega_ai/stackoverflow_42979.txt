In theory, HTML should be as "semantic" as possible - meaning that every element should indicate something about its content. s should enclose the most important headline; s should surround paragraphs; should indicate emphasis, etc. That way the code makes sense when you - or a screen reader, or whatever - look at it. This also helps for devices that don't understand all (or any) of your CSS rules.
