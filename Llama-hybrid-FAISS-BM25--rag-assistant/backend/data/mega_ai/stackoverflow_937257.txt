Yes it should be a zero (NULL) pointer as stl containers will default initialise objects when they aren't explicitly stored (ie accessing a non-existant key in a map as you are doing or resizing a vector to a larger size). C++ Standard, 8.5 paragraph 5 states: To default-initialize an object of type T means: If T is a non-POD class type (clause class), the default constructor for T is called (and the initialization is ill-formed if T has no accessible default constructor) If T is an array type, each element is default-initialized Otherwise, the storage for the object iszero-initialized. You should also note that default initialisation is different to simply ommiting the constructor. When you omit the constructor and simply declare a simple type you will get an indeterminate value. int a; // not default constructed, will have random data int b = int(); // will be initialised to zero
