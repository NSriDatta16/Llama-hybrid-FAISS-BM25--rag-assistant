I would recommend using a css selector for hiding your answers. In order to do so you would have to add a class attribute to your answer. common questions: question number 1 answer number 1 question number 2 answer number 2 etc etc... Then using jquery you could hide all answers using this $('.answer').hide(); So, put together with your other question JQuery if then else using URL parser plugin, there must be a more elegant solution! it would be: var match = jQuery.url.attr('anchor').match(/^question([0-9]+)$/); if (match && match.length > 0) { $('.answer').hide(); $('#answer' + match[1] ).show(); } Or on a single line like this. $('.answer').hide().is('#answer' + match[1]).show();
