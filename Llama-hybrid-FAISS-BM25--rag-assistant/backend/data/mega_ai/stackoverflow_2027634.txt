javascript to find memory available

Let's make it immediately clear: this is not a question about memory leak! I have a page which allows the user to enter some data and a JavaScript to handle this data and produce a result. The JavaScript produces incremental outputs on a DIV, something like this: (function() { var newdiv = document.createElement("div"); newdiv.innerHTML = produceAnswer(); result.appendChild(newdiv); if (done) { return; } else { setTimeout(arguments.callee, 0); } })(); Under certain circumstances the computation will produce so much data that IE8 will fail with this message: not enough storage when dealing with too much data The question is: is there way I can work out how much data is too much data? as I said there is no bug to solve. It's a genuine out of memory because the computation requires to create too many html elements. My idea would be to run a function before executing the computation to work out ahead if the browser will succeed. But to do so, in a generic way, I think I need to find the memory available to my browser. Any suggestion is welcome.
