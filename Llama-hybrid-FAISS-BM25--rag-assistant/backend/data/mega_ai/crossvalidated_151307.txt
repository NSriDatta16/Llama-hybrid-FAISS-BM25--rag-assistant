Principal component analysis / multinomial logistic regression

I'm trying to see how level of scepticism impacts willingness to change diet. To measure sceptism I've used a 7 point likert scale. The study I'm basing my research on used a principal components analysis when analysing the Likert scale results to measure level of sceptism. I've got this far. But then the study uses a multinomial logistic regression to assess how skepticism effects willingness to change. Any idea on how to take the results of the PCA and put them into the MLA? (I'm using SPSS)
