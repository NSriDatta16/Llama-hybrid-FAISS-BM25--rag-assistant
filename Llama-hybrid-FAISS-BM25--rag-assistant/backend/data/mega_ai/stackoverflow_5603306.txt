JGraphX - auto organise of cells and bidirectional edges

I am using JGraphX java library to visualise a graph model and overall it seems quite good. However, I am encountering 2 small problems. 1) Is there any possible way of having the nodes spread out in an automatic way and not defining explicity the location of where they are to be placed? 2) In the case where I have 2 edges (one from A to B, and one from B to A), is there any possible way where the user can select on of them only? Thanks!
