Yes. But you should probably use principal components analysis A similar approach is used in intelligence testing - general intelligence (g) is defined as the first unrotated principal component from a PCA of a bunch of intelligence tests. The higher the loading, the more the test is assumed to represent general intelligence, and this is called its 'g-loading'. There's information on the wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics) You can find more papers with your favorite search engine.
