First, xsi is the prefix conventionally given for the schema instance, so don't change that. Second, the purpose of xsl:type is to designate that a particular element has a particular type from an XML Schema. In the fragment of the schema you showed, "Answer" is the only schema type. "AnswerBool" and "AnswerMsc2DTO" are values that an attribute declared type could have, but that "type" isn't the same as the xsi:type . So in your file, you should use type if the XML file and the schema are both in the same (default) namespace. Hope that helps.
