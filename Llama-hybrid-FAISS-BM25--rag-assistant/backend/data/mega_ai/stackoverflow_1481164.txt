Software like any other entity has a shelf life. If no longer needed then it will (should!) die. Unlike other things it will always (well if media survives) be available forever and as such can be resurrected if needed. It need not stay alive. I saw this many years ago looking at the source code to some termulator. It was a very well thought out and elegant to look at and interesting for a newbie coder to read. However it was obsolete even then. Felt kind of wrong but it was dead! Move on and enjoy doing the stuff you want to. Your productivity will be decided by how much you enjoy what you are doing.
