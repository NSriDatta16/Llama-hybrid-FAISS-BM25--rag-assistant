The short version is that you can't really, at least not in a standard way. The information on the exponential distribution that you mention is in fact time to censoring, which is not such an interesting concept. From a non-parametric perspective, there is nothing you can do as models such as Cox proportional hazards put mass only at event time points (and there are none here). If you assume a parametric model, i.e. time to moving is $Exp(\lambda)$, then the likelihood contribution of an observation at time $t$ would be $$ (\lambda)^\delta \exp(-\lambda t) $$ with $\delta = 1$ if there is an event at $t$ or 0 for censoring. With a data set of $t_1 ... t_N$ censoring events, the likelihood is $$ L = \prod_i \exp(-\lambda t_i) $$ and the log-likelihood $$ l = -\lambda \sum_i t_i $$ and you can see clearly that $\lambda = 0$ is the maximizer for this. Which makes sense. If you had a data set on humans and the length of their lives, and you just had right censored data (only what they lived longer than), you would think that they live forever (or that they die all at any time after the follow-up - but that would not work with an exponential assumption). Your way out of this is to go Bayesian. That is because you have a prior information on the time to moving (as you said, they move at a certain point). For the exponential distribution, a conjugate prior is the gamma distribution for $\lambda$, so assuming $\lambda \sim gamma(\alpha, \beta)$, you would obtain your posterior as $\lambda | data \sim gamma(\alpha, \beta + \sum_it_i)$. The expectation of the posterior would be your Bayesian estimate, which is $\alpha / (\beta + \sum_it_i)$. So you can consider that. However, keep in mind that most likely your distribution is not exponential. That is because the density of the exponential distribution is decreasing, which means that you would expect most events to take place earlier in the follow-up. There are other parametric distribution you could investigate, such as a Weibull distribution or so.
