How to layout a 'grid' of images in the center of the screen

I have a set of 12 images to show in a layout. The number is chosen semi arbitrarily, but boils down to 3 horizontaly and 4 vertically for portrait mode and the other way around for landscape. First implementation was using a gridview. Problem is the height cannot be forced to fit in the screen. For a workaround I can (try to) scale the images ofcourse, but its near impossible to calculate the room available to the gridview: Total screensize is known ofcourse, but you have to 'guess' the size of the notification bar and that doesn't seem to be an elegant sollution. The measured size isn't really to be trusted: I'm not doing a complete restart on orientation change (for speed), but the way the screen is build the complete space isn't available on the spot. In the end the conclusion is that I don't want to calculate the size of the images and then scale them accordingly: I think it's better to say how the views should fit in the screen, right? So the next try is just using a TableLayout. Using "ShrinkColumns="*" the images fitted fine, so the size of the images is now how we want them. But 'extra' room we might have in the height is now evenly divided between the tablerows. This is to be expected, but ugly. The current code seems irrelevant because it doesn’t work, but looks like this in the end: I’ve removed all the padding and other stuff which doesnt seem relevant. (for portait:) … (repeat 3 tablerows) To ‘scale’ the too-large images, the TableLayout has the “shrinkcolumns=”*”” attribute. How can we get the three ImageViews to be aligned in the center of the TableRow and not spread evenly in the width? And the same goes for the vertical columns, how can we keep everything together and not spread across the height of the screen? Basically, the "excess" space should go to the sides as padding/margin, and now it goes in between the Images. Example: The left screen-shot shows too much left/right distance, the right has too much top/bottom
