Outlook addin crashing windows explorer

i am building an outlook addin that utilizes the windows clipboard for temporary storage. When i make a call to Clipboard.Clear() at the end of the process, Windows Explorer crashes and needs to restart. Does anyone know why this may be? It ONLY happens on a 64bit OS, not 32bit..
