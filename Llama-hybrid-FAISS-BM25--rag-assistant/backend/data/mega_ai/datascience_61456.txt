I would use a logistic regression - you're going to need sample's where they did not pick up. Then I would treat the hour as a seasonal dummy regressor (23 hours as dummy variables and let one flow to the intercept). If you do not treat it as a seasonal dummy regressor, you are going to have to perform some sort of transformation, because the relationship isn't going to be linear. Someone previously suggested substituting mid-afternoon, etc as a categorical variable. That is a bad idea because you have the detail and you're losing detail there. That would have a similar effect to utilizing optimal binning to make the relationship linear, but I still don't think that would work. Try the seasonal dummy regressors.
