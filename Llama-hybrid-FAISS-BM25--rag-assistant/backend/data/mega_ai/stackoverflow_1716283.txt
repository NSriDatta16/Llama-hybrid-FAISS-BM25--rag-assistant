I have seen people try to test this with standard unittests as you yourself propose. The tests are slow, and have so far failed to identify a single of the concurrency problems our company struggles with. After many failures, and despite my love for unittests, I have come to accept that errors in concurrency is not one of unittests strengths. I usually encourage analysis and review in favour of unittests for classes where concurrency is a subject. With total overview of the system it is in many cases possible to prove/falsify claims of thread safety. Anyhow I would love for someone to give me something that might point to the opposite, so I watch this question closely.
