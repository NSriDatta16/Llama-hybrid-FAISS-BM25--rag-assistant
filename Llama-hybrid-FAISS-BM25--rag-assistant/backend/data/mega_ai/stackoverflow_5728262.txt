If you suspect serialization issue, you can easily check the content of the loaded data, for example using (var fs = isoStore.OpenFile(StoragePath, System.IO.FileMode.Open)) { StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(fs); string content = sr.ReadToEnd(); // Put a break point here and show content variable in Xml Visualizer. // Can be done from Locals Debug window for example. } But I would start by checking your app logic. Most probably something that was not initialized yet. Should be easy to find in the debugger.
