jQuery UI Draggable 'stop' event called too many times?

I have a feeling I'm either misunderstanding the 'stop' event or not doing it right, but it seems to be called several times while the element is bound to is being dragged. makeAllDragable = function () { $(".test-table").draggable({ start: function (event, ui) { $(this).click(); }, stop: function (event, ui) { foo() } }).click(function () { selectTable($(this)); }); } foo = function () { alert("test"); } In this example foo is called about 30 times, shouldn't is just be when I release the draggable? The jQuery docs don't actually say one where or another though.
