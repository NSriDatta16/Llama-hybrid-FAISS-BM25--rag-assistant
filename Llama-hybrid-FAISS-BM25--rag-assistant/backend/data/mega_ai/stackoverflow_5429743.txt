This is from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff462081(v=VS.92).aspx : Content loaded from Isolated Storage or dynamically by using the NavigateToString(String) method is treated differently than content loaded from the network. Content loaded from Isolated Storage or dynamically by using NavigateToString has no cross-site restrictions, while content loaded from the network has normal cross-site restrictions. For this reason, you should be careful about loading untrusted content from Isolated Storage or dynamically by using NavigateToString. So, answer to your question would be: Yes it does, but not for files loaded in the way you describe.
