Classification: how to handle reviews/long english words in feature set with all other numerical features

I am currently working on an use case where feature set contains numeric values such as amount, as well as a review feature which contains long winded english text. the english text will very well differ between train and test data. eg 'i have seen and its good' , 'nto ok','timepass',etc how do i combine the text feature set with numerical data and feed it to a machine learning model? i will nt be able to use encoding , these text variables are not categorical values . they are varying . import pandas as panda from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer words = ['i hv paid','i dont like','its good','yum yum'] a = panda.DataFrame({'amount':[10,20,30,40],'word':words}) tf = TfidfVectorizer() csr = tf.fit_transform(words) #how do i now use my csr to feed both amount and word to my machine learning model
