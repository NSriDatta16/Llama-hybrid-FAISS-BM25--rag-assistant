How to make the most of a Gaussian mixture assumption in a model?

I have a dataset with 100 columns and approximately 100000 lines. I have a variable to predict that is Y (0,1 so it's a classification problem). I have an other categorical variable with two values 0 and 1. By plotting my variables distributions, I discovered that many of my variables seem to be a mixture of two Gaussian distributions. By comparing it with the categorical value, I found that the two modes exactly fit this categorical value (meaning each distribution of individuals restricted to one of the two categories matches each Gaussian distribution of the mixture). I feel like it is an interesting information about my variables. However I do not know how to capitalize on this. Do I have to create new variables based on the variables + the categorical one ? Do I need to use two models (1 for each value of the categorical variable) to improve the result ? What model should I use that can make the most of my observation as an hypothesis (svm , random forest, logistic reg, etc...) ? Thanks
