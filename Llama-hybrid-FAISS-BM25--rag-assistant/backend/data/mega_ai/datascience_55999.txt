If you use a combination of INDEX and MATCH , you can let the desired look up array vary automatically as you drag the function across your columns, which is an alternative to manually fixing the look up column in VLOOKUP . If you wish to continue with VLOOKUP , you could potentially add column numbers to the top of your data table, and reference these numbers instead of the hard-coded 97.
