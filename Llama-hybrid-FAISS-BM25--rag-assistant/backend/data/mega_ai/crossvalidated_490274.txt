Logistic Regression with dummy variables?

I am working on a problem where response variable is binary and my features are dummy variables. I observed when I include intercept to model all the dummy variables' p-values are equal to 1. When I remove constant p-values seems ok. My question is should not we include intercept when we have dummy variables as our only features ? If it is so, what is the reason for that? Another follow up question is about perfect multi-colinearity, I remember from linear regression, if we do not drop one of our dummy variables we cannot invert the matrix due to multi-colinearity thus we cannot get our coefficients. I know logistic regression coef. found through MLE but I wonder if multi-colinearity still causes different issues in this case?
