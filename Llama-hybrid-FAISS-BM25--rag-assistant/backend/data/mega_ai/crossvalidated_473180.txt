How to get multiple solutions for a given input using neural network?

Let a Neural network is trained. Let multiple number of inputs result same output. We can determine any one input for a particular output using neural network. But, how can we determine all the inputs for a given output. To be precise, Let, x+y=10. So for 10 the inputs are (1,9),(2,8),(3,7) and so on.
