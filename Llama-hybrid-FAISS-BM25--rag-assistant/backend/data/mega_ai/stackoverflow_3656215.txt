Word alignment is not only featured by CPUs On the hardware level, most RAM-Modules have a given Word size in respect to the amount of bits that can be accessed per read/write cycle. On a module I had to interface on an embedded device, addressing was implemented through three parameters: The module was organized in four banks which could be selected prior to the RW operation. each of this banks was essentially a large table 32-bit words, wich could be adressed through a row and column index. In this design, access was only possible per cell , so every read operation returned 4 bytes, and every write operation expected 4 bytes. A memory controller hooked up to this RAM chip could be desigend in two ways: either allowing unrestricted access to the memory chip using several cycles to split/merge unaligned data to/from several cells (with additional logic), or imposing some restrictions on how memory can be accessed with the gain of reduced complexity. As complexity can impede maintainability and performance, most designers chose the latter [ citation needed ]
