To answer to the title of your question: yes, it can make sense to include a factorial variable as fixed and a random effect. Depending on the data structure/ experimental design this may even be necessary to do so to arrive at valid conclusions. For a very readable discussion of the topic see: Barr DJ, Levy R, Scheepers C, Tily HJ. Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal. J Mem Lang 2013;68(3):255â€“78. There is a similar example with an answer by @Ben Bolker, who also recommends to use one variable (organ) as fixed and mixed: Mixed Effects Model with Nesting . I could not quite wrap my head around the answer to your particular experiment, yet. The question is, how many random effects are "enough" to account for all dependencies introduced by your experimental design. Your lmm2 looks fine to me. Intuitively, I would have specified the model with a random slope for treatment within field_pairs and ignore fields alltogether, like: lmm3 = lmer(response ~ treatment + (1+treatment|field_pair), data = df1) summary(lmm3) anova(lmm3, update(lmm3,.~1 + (1+treatment|field_pair)), test = "LRT") # p=.00862 This gives very similar results to your lmm2, but yields a slightly lower AIC in your sample data. I would be glad to hear other opinions on this and whether these approaches are equivalent.
