how to get into game dev(part time)?

I am doing CS undergrad, with the intention of pursuing a masters and maybe later a phd in neural networks, so that is certainly my main area of interest, but I am also good in fine arts and enjoy gaming so I want to start a little bit of 3d artwork and game dev in my free time. Problem is I don't know where to start.can anyone in the field of game dev list step by step how I should progress down this road? thanks ps: not sure if this is something that matters but I have a copy of xna gaming studio so I'd prefer to use that instead of buying something else
