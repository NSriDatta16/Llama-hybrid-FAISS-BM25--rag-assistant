Is it possible to customize magento admin area

We can extend the existing functionality of magento for frontend by copying modules in local area and doing some other required stuff but how I can extend or customize the magento admin area to meet my requirements without touching the core code. For example I want to extend magento indexing functionality. During re-indexing catalog search Magento add the indexed data in catalgosearch_fulltext table and I also want to add the data to the one of the my custom database table, so that later I can look up into this database table when user search for product in my store. Is it possible to customize magento admin area? Please guide me. Thanks
