Applying paired t-test to compare averages

So I did an experiment for 1 month where I investigated the change of pH of 3 different types of milk in the refrigerator and room temperature. I'd now like to compare the results of each type of milk in the fridge with those at room temperature, which leaves me with a pair of results to compare. Therefore, I came up with the paired t-test. However, I do not understand whether I will have to do a t test for the results of each day or whether I can do one single t test for all the results of one group?
