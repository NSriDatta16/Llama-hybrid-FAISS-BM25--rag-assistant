My answer is fairly borderline but I think it's worth putting on the record: HTML Not a particularly powerful language by any means but given the number of people who have more than a passing familiarity with it and would classify themselves as programmers I think it should qualify. A lot of the angst (in this thread even) directed at languages such as PHP has its roots in the limitations of HTML. Consider a few of its low-points: it encourages the mixing of content and presentation, it is verbose and repetative, the spec still has areas of ambiguity, and, tellingly, implementations have traditionally suffered from a lack of conformance to the spec. The grand ecosystem of client and server side languages owe a lot to the fact that straight HTML is a pain. Yes, there are bad quirky languages, but pushing a common language beyond its limits is a greater evil in my book.
