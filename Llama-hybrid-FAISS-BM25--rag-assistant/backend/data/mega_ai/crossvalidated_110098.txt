I have seen such patterns arise if you have some correlation in your data; or a scenario like that. It did not yield any benefits for analysis - usually the pattern was easier to understand, detect, and analyze in the original domain. I don't think clustering will get you anywhere. There is only a single cluster in my opinion, based on your visualizations. You have a bunch of outliers there. You could try removing them, and then check if you can get a better projection. PCA is sensitive to outliers; you can see that the first two components are mostly used to distinguish the outliers; there could be information hidden in the other dimensions.
