If I understand things correctly, you're testing if the mean value of predictor $A$ associated with outcome $1$ differ from the mean value of predictor A associated with outcome $2$. Even if they don't differ, this result says nothing to your research question. What it says is only that in your sample, the average value of the predictor $A$ is'n different among succes and failures of the dependent variable. I'll give an example so you can see why. Imagine that i'm interesting to know if education affects the probability of an employee being manager in a given firm. I collect a random sample of employees, with $200$ employes that are not managers and $70$ which are actually manager. I ran a logistic regression and the effect of education is significant (usual caveats about p-value apply here as well). Now, you may wonder if the sample is balanced, which is, if there is the same variation in education for managers and non-managers. One first test to see this is to test if their means differ. If their means don't differ, than you know that on average on your sample, managers and non-managers have the same level of education. You could check if there is roughly the same variation of educational level among managers and non-managers. But I think that it's pretty clear that the Wilcoxon test (or the Mann-Whitney) has nothing to say about the effect of your predicton on the probability of success (in my example, success means to be a manager).
