Raw bytes probably refers to the storage representation of the key object. Usually you create a key object and then get a form in which to store it (have a look at java.security.Key#getEncoded() . That storage/exchange representation is a byte array without encoding information - therefore "raw bytes". These raw bytes then can be used to instantiate the key object again. Unclear to me is why the program reinstantiates the key object instead of using the one it created earlier. That probably can only be answered by seeing the code of the program.
