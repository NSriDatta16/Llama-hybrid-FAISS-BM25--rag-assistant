I also tried to do the same but didn't succeed. It seems scrollView doesn't handle touchesMoved/touchesBegan, but it handles some other events to understand that user wants to scroll the view. For me the solution was to determine thet shift value and set it explicitly as a scrollView content offset. It looked like this (I don't have the exact source code no, this code may work incorrectly): - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint curr = [touch locationInView: self]; CGPoint offset = [scrollView contentOffset]; [scrollView setContentOffset: CGPointMake(offset.x + (curr.x - prev.x), offset.y) animated:YES]; } - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ prev = [[touches anyObject] previousLocationInView: self]; }
