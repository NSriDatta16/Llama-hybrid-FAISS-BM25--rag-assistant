It depends on the size of the HTML that you are storing and character encoding. Since this post is tagged SQL Server, the current VARCHAR(MAX) is 8000 characters. If it's anymore than that you can use a TEXT type. There are cavaets with TEXT fields because they restrict the ability to use queries with LIKE, problems with UNION, Replication and others. If you need advanced charactersets you can also consider the unicode types NVARCHAR and NTEXT but these take up twice the storage as VARCHAR and TEXT since they use 2 bytes per character instead of 1. If any of this content is input by users, you should be extremely careful about XSS injection attacks which is pretty close to impossible to stop once you start allowing HTML from your users.
