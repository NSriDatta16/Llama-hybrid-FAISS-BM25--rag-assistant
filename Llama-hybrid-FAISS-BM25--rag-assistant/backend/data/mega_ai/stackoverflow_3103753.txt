Cufon Not Working in IE - A CSS Issue

I'm having the oddest problem. I'm building a theme for Wordpress using Cufon. Cufon works perfectly in Chrome and Firefox, but I couldn't get it to render in IE, so, since I'm still in the middle of development, I set the problem aside to deal with later. Sometime yesterday, I was fiddling with other CSS elements in my theme. Later, I opened the theme in IE8 to test alignment, and wallah, the Cufon had started working. I wasn't sure why, as I'd changed quite a bit of CSS, but hey - as long as it works. Then, stupidly, I overwrote my old CSS code, reverting back to before my edits, and the Cufon broke again. Since I don't know what I did to fix it in the first place, I'm in a bind, but now I know it can be done. I've googled and googled, and I can't seem to find any reason why this should be the case. The CSS validates. The HTML validates. The Firefox Error consol shows no errors on page load. And it seems to be a CSS issue, as this was the only file changed. If it makes any difference, I'm building on Wordpress 3.0. I'm embedding Cufon in the header of each page with this: /js/cufon-yui.js"> /js/Yanone_Kaffeesatz_Rg_400.font.js"> Cufon.replace('h2.posttitle'); Cufon.replace('#topnav > ul > li'); Cufon.replace('.rightwidget > h2'); Cufon.replace('.footerrightli > h2'); Cufon.replace('.footerleftli > h2'); Cufon.replace('.footermiddleli > h2'); The development site is here: [link removed] I sure would appreciate some help. Does anyone have any ideas?
