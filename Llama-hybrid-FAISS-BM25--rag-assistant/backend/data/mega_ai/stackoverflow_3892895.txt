Assuming that the ability to rollback the entire persistence is not needed (in which case there is only one answer; commit outside), committing inside the loop keeps the transaction log smaller, but requires more roundtrips to the DB. Committing outside the loop is the exact opposite. Which is faster depends on the average operation count and amount of data to be committed overall. For a routine that persists about 10-20 records, commit outside the loop. For 1m-2m records, I'd commit in batches.
