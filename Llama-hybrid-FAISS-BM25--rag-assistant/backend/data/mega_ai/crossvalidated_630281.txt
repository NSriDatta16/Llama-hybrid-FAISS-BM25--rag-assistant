Is there a way to relate $\operatorname{Var}(\theta)$ with $\operatorname{Var}(\operatorname{logit}(\theta))$?

I am doing the above exercise in Jim ALbert's "Bayesian Computation with R", Chapter 5. I have made a normal approximation of the paramater $\eta$ , which is the logit of $\theta$ . I understand that for the problem (a), I can simply get a 95% credible interval for $\eta$ , and them apply the inverse transformation to get the interval for $\theta$ . But I also want to use the approximated variance for $\eta$ (I got this from the normal approximation). I don't think I can simply apply the inverse transformation here. Is there a way to get the approximated variance for $\theta$ from what I have?
