I've had a similiar question to what you're trying to do. My solution was to use .load, but that is not the most elegant, because jQuery has to parse the content that you don't want inserted in the DOM. My solution is to use either $.ajax or $.post and set a variable to ajax=true, and on the server side, wrap the header and footer in a php if ajax='' (undefined) then echo out the header and footer, else if ajax=true, PHP will not send the header and footer, and you will save bandwidth only sending the DOM elements that you need on the client. Let me know if this can work with your app, if not, I'll find a way to use $.post and parse the response.
