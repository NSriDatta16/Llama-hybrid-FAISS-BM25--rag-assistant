Is there a good online course for working with sklearn MLPClassifier?

I'am implementing an App for which I need a neural network. Because: I want to classify each DOM-text-element of an webpage which conains any curriculum vitae of a person. The neural network should be able to classify each DOM-text-element then if it is e.g. the name of the person, the birthday of the person, the last studies of the person, ... or only noise. I want to use for this issue the sklearn MLPClassifier in python. But I neeed much more knowledge in: a) which data should the feature vector contain (CSS properties, ...)) b) how many data I need c) which parameters needs the MLPClassfier for the best result (or only at least working) Does anybody know a good online course where I cann get a better understanding of these things?
