I would suggest a mixed effects logistic regression, with difference codings for the categorical variable (the a/b/c conditions). Your data though should specify the individual events, coded as 1's and 0's, rather than proportions. E.g., from your example, 1 would be a hit and 0 would be a miss. If you use R, then the model should look something like this (let's say your data is a df with 'throw' as a binomial variable and 'alcohol' as a 3-level categorical variable): library(lme4) library(codingMatrices) contrasts(df$alcohol)
