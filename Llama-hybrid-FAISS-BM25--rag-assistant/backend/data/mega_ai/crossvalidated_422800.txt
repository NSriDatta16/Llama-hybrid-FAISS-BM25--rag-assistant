Incorporate additional information in Stock Forecasting

I am trying to forecast stock of health products. Other than historical stock quantity, I would have some other information, e.g.,: Certain stocks are in compete of each other; Certain stocks are normally buy together; They are different promotion structure for a stock which make it sell faster: buy 10 get 1 free, 10% discount, or free gift (and of course make competitive product sells slower) Certain stock are new and there is no existing record How should I incorporate those information for forecasting? I am free to use any model (e.g., lstm, xgboost, etc.) as long as they are effective.
