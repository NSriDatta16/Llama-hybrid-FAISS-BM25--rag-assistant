There are a number of different approaches you can take. First, there's creating iPhone WebApps . This approach give you a number of different Mobile Safari APIs that expose internal capabilities through the Safari Browser. Second, you can create a native application that contains a UIWebView. Other than this detail, the approach would be the same as the first, exclusively using the APIs for Mobile Safari. Lastly, you can take an approach of using a third-party SDK, like Titanium or PhoneGap . This approach gives you a base set of APIs that you leverage for not only making iPhone webapps, but an app that works on other mobile platforms as well. Good luck!
