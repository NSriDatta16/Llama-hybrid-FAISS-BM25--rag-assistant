This stylesheet: Test Name Result Duration Passed Failed Inconclusive Not in sample Result: Test Name Result Duration Passed Failed Inconclusive TestProject1.Test.LogonInfoTest, TestProject1.Test 2 0 0 NullUserIdInConstructor Passed Not in sample LogonInfoConstructorTest Passed Not in sample Note : Muenchian method for get each className (I used to do that in template/@match but today it seems that I can't!) and the use of a node-set for key() second argument. Edit : I got it! It seems that I didn't know enough about patterns, built-in templates and priority... Edit2 : For the first input document Code coverage instrumentation warning while processing file ClassLibrary1.dll: Warning VSP2013 : Instrumenting this image requires it to run as a 32-bit process. The CLR header flags have been updated to reflect this. You need some minor modifications. With this stylesheet: Test Name Result Duration Passed Failed Inconclusive You get this result: Test Name Result Duration Passed Failed Inconclusive TestProject1.Test.LogonInfoTest, TestProject1.Test 3 0 0 EmptyUserIdInConstructor Passed 00:00:00.0005633 NullUserIdInConstructor Passed 00:00:00.0047344 LogonInfoConstructorTest Passed 00:00:00.0234997 Note : The use of namespace in patterns (Your first input document has a default namespace, but not your second sample). I've found your duration data in your first input. You have to filter text nodes (There was not one in your first input)
