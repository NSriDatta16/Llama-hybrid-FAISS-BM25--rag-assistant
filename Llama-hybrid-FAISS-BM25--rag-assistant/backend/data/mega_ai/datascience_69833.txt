There are many ways to handle missing values. Combinations of the following are often done: Drow rows Drow columns Impute (i.e., replace with a valid value) Keep as missing value (i.e., missing values are encoded as NaN or NULL ) Generally, it is not useful to fill in all missing values with a randomly selected valid value. For example, summary statistics and machine learning models will be distorted if all missing values are replaced with the numerical values of 0 or -999 . Often times missing values are signals to model.
