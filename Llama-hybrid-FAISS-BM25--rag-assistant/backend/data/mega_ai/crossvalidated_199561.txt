Decomposing multiple poisson process

Assume a time series composed by many recurring events coming from many different poisson process each with a different rate. Lets assume for simplicity no overlap between events. Is there any math/statistical tool to decompose the given time series and get the various poisson processes. Ideally like fourier analysis can yield the harmonics composing a periodic signal, the tool should provide a list of poisson processes composing the whole sequence.
