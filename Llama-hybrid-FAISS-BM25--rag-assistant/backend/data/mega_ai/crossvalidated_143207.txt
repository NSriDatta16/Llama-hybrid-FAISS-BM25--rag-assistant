Does Stein's Paradox still hold when using the $l_1$ norm instead of the $l_2$ norm?

Stein's Paradox shows that when three or more parameters are estimated simultaneously, there exist combined estimators more accurate on average (that is, having lower expected mean squared error) than any method that handles the parameters separately. This is a very counterintuitive result. Does the same result hold if instead of using the $l_2$ norm (the expected mean squared error), we use the $l_1$ norm (the expected mean absolute error)?
