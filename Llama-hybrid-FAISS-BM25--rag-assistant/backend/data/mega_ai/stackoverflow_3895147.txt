alt is only valid for images â€” it's alternate text that serves for screen readers and people with images turned off to understand what an image represents. title applies to most (if not all) elements, and can be used to provide tooltips for more information about parts of your pages. I don't think either attribute plays any major roles in SEO. As Joe Hopfgartner says, the actual text of your links is much more significant in terms of semantics, which is why using "click here" as link text is discouraged these days.
