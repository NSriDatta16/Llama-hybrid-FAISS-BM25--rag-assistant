Show that if $x_t$ is a stationary time series then $\Delta x_t$ is also (weakly) stationary

I need to express $E[\Delta x_{t}]$ and $\gamma_{\Delta X}(h)$ in terms of $E[x_{t}]$ and $\gamma_{X}(h)$ . The first part of this is trivial and can easily be shown that $E[\Delta x_{t}] = \mu_{X} - \mu_{X}=0$ . I am stuck on showing $\gamma_{\Delta X}(h)$ is only dependent on $h=s-t$ . Writing out the formula for autocovariance: $\gamma_{\Delta X}(h)=E[(\Delta x_{t} - \mu_{\Delta X})(\Delta x_{t+h} - \mu_{\Delta X})]$ , this simplifies to $\gamma_{\Delta X}(h)=E[\Delta x_{t}\Delta x_{t+h}$ ] as $\mu_{\Delta X}=0$ . It is here though that expanding and multiplying out does not obviously simplify into a function dependent on $\gamma_{X}(h)$ . Appreciate any help on how to approach this. Thanks.
