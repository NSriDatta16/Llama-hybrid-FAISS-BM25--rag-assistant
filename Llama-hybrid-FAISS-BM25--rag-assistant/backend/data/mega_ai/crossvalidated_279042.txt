What you described is a scoring rule: let's call it a linear scoring rule. When compared to other popular scoring rules, one of its disadvantages is that it's not a proper scoring rule, i.e. the best reward is not achieved by the reporting of the *true* probability distribution. You can read more on proper scoring rules at wikipedia for example, and there's also this good reference [1] : Essentially, the linear score encourages overprediction at the modes of an assessor's true predictive density. Having said that, linear scoring rules do find some applications. [1] Gneiting, T., & Raftery, A. E. (2007). Strictly proper scoring rules, prediction, and estimation. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 102(477), 359-378.
