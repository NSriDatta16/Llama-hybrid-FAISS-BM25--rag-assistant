Please have in mind that by requiring an unique PIN (which is uncommon) you will be limiting the max number of allowed users to the the PIN specification. Are you sure you want this ? A not very elegant solution but which works is to use an UNIQUE field, and then loop attempting to insert a random generated PIN until the insert is successful.
