App jettisoned by OS 3.2 when memory usage in instruments is low

Heres the problem. I have an app that is essentially an image gallery, it pulls images down from an xml feed, and archives them locally, then gradually loads 5 images at a time into the scroll view to be displayed. I have had thousands of problems with using [UIImage imageNamed:...] and NSURLRequest/NSData as both cause the app to cache excessive amounts of data. Anyway, I now have the app running at an almost constant 25-30MB, with no sudden spikes, and with only a few kB of data being leaked from memory (due to NSKeyedArchiver and me retaining some values). However the app ALWAYS gets terminated by the OS for (what seems like) no apparent reason. Sorry if I'm being a bit stupid and not spotting something, the crash report does appear to be telling me that tonnes of memory has been paged by the app, however the allocations and leaks instrument is telling a different story... and really I supposed my question is more along the lines of "why is instruments lying to me?"
