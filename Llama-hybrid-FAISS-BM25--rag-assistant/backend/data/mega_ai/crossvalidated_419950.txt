t-test vs Anova

In my course, we are seeing if concentration effects the discrepancy of a mass balance sample. For example, i have 3 concentrations and 2 different processes i want to compare. There are 3 trials for each scenario. If i use a 't-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances' on excel, i find that the means of 2 out of the 3 concentrations are statistically different between processes. However, when i take the average value over the 3 trials and then do a 'Anova: Two-Factor Without Replication' it tells me the data is not dependant on the concentration or the process and that the variation is just due to random error. Could anyone explain the difference to me?
