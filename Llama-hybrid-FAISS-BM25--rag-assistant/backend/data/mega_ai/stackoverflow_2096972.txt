How to refresh a PHP database calendar after using jQuery drag and drop?

I have a calendar built using PHP, with events on it. I'm using jQuery UI to enable drag and drop to move the events around. The .droppable() function has a callback function attached that updates the database with the new information. But the calendar needs to refresh so that it reads from the new database values. Can you force a page refresh with jQuery? Or is there a better way to do this?
