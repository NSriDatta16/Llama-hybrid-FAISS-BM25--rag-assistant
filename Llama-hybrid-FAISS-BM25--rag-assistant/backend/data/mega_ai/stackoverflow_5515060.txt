To get the state, you can use this instruction: String state = Environment.getExternalStorageState(); Then, for example, if you want to check if the SDCARD is mounted : if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(state)) You can find further information in the Android documentation. There is a nice SO post here talking about detecting mounted sd card via USB.. Regards.
