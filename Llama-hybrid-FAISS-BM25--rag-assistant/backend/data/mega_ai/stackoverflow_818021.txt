http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable#option-containment Constrains dragging to within the bounds of the specified element or region. Possible string values: 'parent', 'document', 'window', [x1, y1, x2, y2]. Example: Initialize a draggable with the containment option specified. $('.selector').draggable({ containment: 'parent' }); Or in case the problem is that the draggable can be placed all over the place: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable#option-revert If set to true, the element will return to its start position when dragging stops. Possible string values: 'valid', 'invalid'. If set to invalid, revert will only occur if the draggable has not been dropped on a droppable. For valid, it's the other way around. And finally, I don't see you setting the scope of the draggable ( Edit : But that won't fix your problem, the other 2 things above should) : http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable#option-scope Used to group sets of draggable and droppable items, in addition to droppable's accept option. A draggable with the same scope value as a droppable will be accepted by the droppable. Example: Initialize a draggable with the scope option specified. $('.selector').draggable({ scope: 'tasks' });
