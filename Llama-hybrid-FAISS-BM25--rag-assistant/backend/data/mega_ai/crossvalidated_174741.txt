Can a time series be stationary if the formula for the mean level depends on $t$?

I just started working on time series with the book from Brockwell and Davis. I'm still not that familiar with stationary time series. The book says that a time series is stationary if: 1 $\mathbb{E}[X_t] = \mu$ is independent of $t$. 2 $\operatorname{Cov}(X_{t+h},X_t)$ is independent of $t$ for each $h$. So if I have the following time series: $X_t=a+bt+Z_t$ with {${Z_t}$} ~ $WN(0,\sigma^2)$ Can you simply say that ${X_t}$ is not a stationary time series because: $\mu_{x_t} = \mathbb{E}[a+bt+Z_t]=a+\mathbb{E}[bt + 0]=a+b \mathbb{E}[t]=a+ bt$, and this obviously is dependent on $t$? Edit: Forget to say that $t=1,...,n$ in my time series.
