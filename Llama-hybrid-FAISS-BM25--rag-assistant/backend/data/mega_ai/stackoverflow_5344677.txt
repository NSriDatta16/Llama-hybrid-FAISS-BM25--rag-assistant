In disclosure, I work for Versant in Sales, and to comment on your questions, Versant is a commercial product, but like SQL Server, we have similar pricing, Community Edition is free with limitations on database size, Standard Edition is a small cost per server but limited in the number of threads allowed, and an Enterprise Edition which is expensive, but less than either SQL Server or Oracle if you need scalability and performance. Also, by moving from nHibernate to LINQ you will be able to use that to Versant's database, and in the future if you want to move back to SQL Server, you can do so quite easily with EF or LINQ TO SQL, therefore it mitigates your risk in the database infrastructure. This would be a point for Versant rather than using a KVP NoSQL store with a prorprietary interface. True, much less documentation that Relational, but www.odbms.org does have some great information and reference material. Learning curve if your team is proficient in C# should be quite easy, and from an administration standpoint, Versant is a database, so learning backup and recovery procedures should seem familiar. Our customers, C++, Java or .Net, all say the benefits of Versant are ease of development, performance and ability to support their needs with a lower amount of resources in servers and storage.
