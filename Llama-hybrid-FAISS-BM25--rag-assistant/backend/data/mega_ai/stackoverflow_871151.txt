There are basically two ways of doing this: exceptions and returning the results of business rules validation. Each way has its advantages and disadvantages, but basically: Exceptions: you can return only one failed result at the time exceptions are easy to implement and do not complicate your business logic - simply check the condition and throw a business exception exceptions work only for blocking rules open transactions can be easily rolled back Business rules validation: you can check multiple business rules and return the list of broken ones to the user multiple rules can complicate the flow of your logic, because they tend to mess up the return types from methods they allow more scenarios to be handled, e.g. non-blocking informational rules I think it heavily depends on the application which approach suits better, so there is no simple answer. For a long time I successfully used exceptions for business rules, now I tend to leverage the second approach.
