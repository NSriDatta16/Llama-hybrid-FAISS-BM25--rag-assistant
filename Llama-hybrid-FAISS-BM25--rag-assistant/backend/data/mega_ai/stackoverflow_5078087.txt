I prefer to story things in the registry under the local user, for easy retrieval later and to prevent the casual user from editing it (like they can an edit file) As with the ini file solution, it's only fun for a limited set of values. Reg := TRegistry.Create; try Reg.RootKey := HKEY_CURRENT_USER; if Reg.OpenKey('\Software\Lakkerw\myProgram', True) then Reg.WriteString('Usr_Name',sUser_name); ..... finally Reg.CloseKey; FreeAndNil(Reg); end; EDIT: Just saw you requested it to be in a file. I guess this solution wont work for that then :)
