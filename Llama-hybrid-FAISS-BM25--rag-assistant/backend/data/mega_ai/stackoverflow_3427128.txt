If you want to do it simply and manually, you could do something like this: String mystr = ""; for(int i = 0; i Now mystr contains your list. Note that the comma is only added if we are not acting on the last element in the list (with index personlist.size() - 1). Of course, there are more elegant/efficient methods to accomplish this, but this one is, in my opinion, the clearest.
