Your first approach sounds like a good idea. By using a cronjob, the pulling of the content is separated from your site, so the user doesn't have to wait. If you have access to the page that generates the fragment, you could reduce net traffic by actively sending the new content instead of requesting it every couple of minutes. I'd store the fragment in a database, though, as I believe database-queries are faster than access to the filesystem.
