This issue leads to a lot of misunderstandings because people use Bayesian stats to ask frequentist questions. For example, people want to determine if variant B is better than variant A. They can answer this question with Bayesian stats by determining if the 95% highest density interval of the difference between those two posterior distributions (B-A) is greater than 0 or a region of practical significance around 0. If you use bayesian stats to answer frequentist questions, however, you can still make frequentist errors: type I (false positives; opps - B isn't actually better) and type II (miss; fail to realize that B is truly better). The point of a power analysis is reduce type II errors (e.g. have at least an 80% chance of finding an effect if it exists). A power analysis should also be used when using Bayesian stats to ask frequentist questions like the one above. If you don't use a power analysis, and then you repeatedly peek at your data while collecting it and then stop only once you find a significant difference, then you are going to make more type I (false alarms) errors than you may expect - same as if you had been using frequentist statistics. check out: https://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/11/optional-stopping-in-data-collection-p.html http://varianceexplained.org/r/bayesian-ab-testing/ Of note - Some Bayesian approaches can reduce, but not eliminate, the probability of making a type I error (e.g., an appropriate informative prior).
