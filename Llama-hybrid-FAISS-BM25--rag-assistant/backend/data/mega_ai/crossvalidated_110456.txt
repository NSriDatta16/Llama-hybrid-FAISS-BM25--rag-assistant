This is an interesting but difficult problem known as the generalized coupon collector problem . In the standard coupon collector problem, coupons have one of $n$ distinct types with equal probability, and the question is to know how many coupons you need to collect in order to have all the types. In the generalized version of the problem, the types are not equiprobable. Available results on the coupon collector problem are that the average number of coupons required to collect all the types is $O\left(n\log(n)\right)$ and that the asymptotic distribution as $n \rightarrow \infty$ is a Gumbel . Similar results on the generalized problem are also available, but they are significantly more complex (see this article for the asymptotic distribution for instance). I do not think that there is an answer to your question in its full generality because the curve will be a function of as many parameters as there are distinct values (the parameters being their probabilities). In the case you can make the assumption that the probabilities are approximately equal, the curve of the average process can be computed as follows. Let $S_k$ be the number of samplings you need to go from $k-1$ to $k$ distinct values, and $T_k$ be the total number of samplings to obtain $k$ distinct values. Obviously $T_k = S_1 + \ldots +S_k$. It is easy to see that $S_k$ has a geometric distribution with probability $(n-k+1)/n$, so the average is $E(S_k) = n / (n-k+1)$ and $$E(T_k) = n \left(\frac{1}{n} + \ldots + \frac{1}{n-k+1}\right) \sim n\left(\log(n)-\log(n-k)\right).$$ With a bit of algebra, we come to the following functional form for the curve, where $n$ is the only parameter. $$y = n \left(1 - e^{-x/n}\right).$$ Since you wrote that the curve is far from an exponential, I guess that the distinct values have different probabilities, but in this case the problem is in another league.
