If you're asking whether two versions of jQuery can be embedded into the same document at the same time, the answer is no . Your client would have to upgrade, which should be relatively easy to do - if they're lucky, without any work at all: See @Nick's excellent overview. Alternatively, if you need to use jQuery 1.4 on some pages, and 1.3 on others, you would certainly be able to set up some server-side shenanigans to serve the correct version. (It would probably even be possible using JavaScript.) but to do that, you'd have to give us more info about the setup.
