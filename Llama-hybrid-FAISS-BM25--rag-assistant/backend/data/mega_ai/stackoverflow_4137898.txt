dialog has several events you can set. You can see them here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-close For instance to set an function to run on close: $( ".mediaContainer" ).dialog({ close: function(event, ui) { //do stuff } }); There are a number of events you can use: beforeClose, open, focus, dragStart, resizeStart, resize, resizeStop, and close. Each of these events can trigger a callback function, so you actually have a lot of control.
