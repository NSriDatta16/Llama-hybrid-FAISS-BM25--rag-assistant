Deploying ADAM

I need to have a way to deploy ADAM store to other environments in a couple of different ways. Full backup and restore: take all contents from one environment and restore all in another environment Partial backup and restore: take all contents for a particular OU (Organisation Unit) and restore at the same location in another environment. To expand a bit more, I have OU called "MyCompany" directly under the root and I would like to backup all the contents udner "MyCompany" and restore to the same position on another environment. FROM O=Root,OU=MyCompany on Server 1 TO O=Root,OU=MyCompany on Server 2 Any idea how I can do this? Regards
