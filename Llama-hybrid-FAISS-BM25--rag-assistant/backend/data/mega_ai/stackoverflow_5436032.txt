if one has add auto functionality then he/she has to access the text field but that is not possible in normal ways.. A kind of hack was is there which searches for all the components and then finds the instance of textfield and returns it. here is the code.. private JTextField dis(JFileChooser jf) { boolean hide =false; LinkedList queue = new LinkedList (); queue.add(jf); JTextField jtf=new JTextField(); while(queue.size() != 0) { Component[] c = ((Container) queue.removeFirst()).getComponents(); for(int i = 0; i } and here is the link for class that extends JFileChooser that applies autocomplete http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/holyvincent/FileChooser/VinFC.java Please report if there are bugs in the extended class. Thanks
