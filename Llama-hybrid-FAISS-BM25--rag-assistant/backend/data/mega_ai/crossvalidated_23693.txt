I have had some luck ($N=1$) with the following: Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models . In the paper, the variances are not themselves hierarchical, but it might provide an alternative starting point. There's also some good information about speeding up MCMC convergence using redundant parameterizations, which may prove useful.
