magento shipping

I have recently created a new shipping module in Magento 1.3.2 with the aid of the Magento developers guide. My module works correctly, however I cant seem to work how to get the functionality for it to become apart of the carriers down down list when a shipment is created within the admin area. Once I have my carrier in this drop down list, I am going to need to apply additional functionality so that if my carrier is selected when the shipment order is placed then it does a whole heap of things. So things i need to work out are: How can make my shipment option a carrier in the drop down list What class must I extend to add the functionality or can I simply add it to my shipment model?
