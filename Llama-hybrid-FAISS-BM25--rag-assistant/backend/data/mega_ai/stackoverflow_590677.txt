Implement something that has value for your organisation/clients using jQuery to prove that it works well in your context - even better if it's something that would be difficult to implement, more complex or take longer in the MS AJAX Toolkit. Developers often find practical examples of running code in a context that applies to them more persuasive than general endorsements or lists of who else is using it (every practical technology can come up with a good list of users). And if your developers don't like JavaScript, perhaps you should ask them what they think the AJAX Toolkit is running on the client side. The AJAX Toolkit is a JavaScript library on the client side - just one that's designed to be easily integrated into ASP.NET.
