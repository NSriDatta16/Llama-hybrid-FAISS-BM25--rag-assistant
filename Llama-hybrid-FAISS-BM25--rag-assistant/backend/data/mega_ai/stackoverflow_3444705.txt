First of all, I'd strongly suggest you to upgrade to Atricore M2 which was released last week and available here : http://sourceforge.net/projects/atricore/files/Atricore%20Identity%20Bus/Atricore%20Identity%20Bus%201.0.0%20M2/atricore-idbus-1.0.0-m2.zip/download . This release delivers tons of fixes and many significant enhancements such as native HA and scalability out-of-the-box support. Also, make sure that you're using the final JOSSO 1.8.2 bits - not JOSSO 1.8.2 r1575 - released last week and available from the JOSSO web site ( http://www.josso.org ) . Then, you should deploy the reference identity appliance for realizing a simple SAML-based Federated SSO setting encompassing a JOSSO Service Provider and a SAML2 Identity Provider. Make sure to follow the quick start : http://www.josso.org/confluence/display/IDBUS/Quick+Start Going back to your original question, the URI your seeing is because JOSSO is relying on a SAML2 IdP Entity the authentication request (read: AuthNRequest) which, upon handled, returns the correpsonding SAML Response conveying authentication assertions. The bottom line is that within a FSSO setting, the JOSSO Gateway concern is realized by an Identity Provider hosted in Atricore IDBus. Atricore Identity Bus is playing nice with JOSSO Agents (read: by speaking the "JOSSO" protocol) while bringing the standard-based FSSO capabilities on board, and without forcing you to invest in retrofitting your JOSSO Partner applications to SAML. Hope this sheds some light on your issue and the subject in general. Regards, Gianluca.
