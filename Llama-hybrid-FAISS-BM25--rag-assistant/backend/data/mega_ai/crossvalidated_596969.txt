Loss for a beta distributed variable?

I am trying to find a loss function for a beta distributed variable, other than the log-likelihood. Since the beta distribution belongs to the exponential family , I wonder if it is also possible to define the unit deviance, something like the gamma deviance defined here (I have very limited experience with GLMs). I want to train different machine learning models for a beta distributed variable, and want a loss function that takes into account the shape of the distribution. The log likelihood depends on two parameters, that's why I am trying to find a simplification like that done with the gamma deviance.
