What is the name of this line summary of heatmap

I have asked on SO about some implementation details of my problem. But I have realized that it is hard to ask (and search) if you do not know the name of the graph. Because this community is more about statistics I am asking here - how is the name of the following variant of a data-visualization. I have an experiment, where for every location (1-100) a value of Y variable changes over time. I want to show this with a 2d graph, where X-axis correspond to the locations (1-100) and Y-axis correspond to the average value of Y for this location in the chosen time interval (e.g. for yesterday). EDIT: I am talking about a line that is overlayed the heatmap. Every point in a line is average value of the corresponding column. Maybe, this is to trivial to have a name?
