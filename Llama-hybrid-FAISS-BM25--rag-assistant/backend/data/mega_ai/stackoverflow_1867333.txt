Problem getting XML properly formatted

I use classes (autogenerated from a schema) to generate xml documents. It has worked fine, until now, when I need to use inline HTML elements. I've tried several different methods, but as soon as I use the inline HTML, the " " gets replaced with %lt; etc. Example: test test new row becomes "destroyed" later on when trying to get it as a string for database storage, the value is changed to: test &lt;br /&gt;new row How is it possible to keep the angle brackets intact?
