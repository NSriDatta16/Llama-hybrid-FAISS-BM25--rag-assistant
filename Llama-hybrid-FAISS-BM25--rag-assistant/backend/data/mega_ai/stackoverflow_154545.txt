It's possible that the other zip tools are ignoring extra data which is corrupt - or it's equally possible that there's a bug in #ZipLib. (I found one a while ago - a certain file that wouldn't compress and then decompress cleanly with certain options.) In this particular case, I suggest you post on the #ZipLib forum to get the attention of the developers. If your file doesn't contain any sensitive data and you can get them a short but complete program along with it, I suspect that will help enormously.
