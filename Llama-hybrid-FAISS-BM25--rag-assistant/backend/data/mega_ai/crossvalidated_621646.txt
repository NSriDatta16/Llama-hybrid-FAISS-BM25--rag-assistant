In general, you do not need to scale the variables for a Bayesian model. This may be needed in some, specific, scenarios where you run into numerical issues with the sampling or optimization algorithm that you are using to estimate the parameters. This may be the case when using variational-inference (e.g. ADVI). Also, as you mention yourself, in some cases it may be easier to pick priors if the data is scaled, the same as scaling can lead to easier interpretation of parameters in non-Bayesian models (see e.g. Andrew Galman's blog ). If your parameters are easier to interpret, it would be easier to come up with priors for them.
