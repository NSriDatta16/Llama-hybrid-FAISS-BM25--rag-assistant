Predicting one time series based on another

I have two thermometers A, B which measure the air temperature over 2 months every hour. At a certain point thermometer B breaks but A keeps working. I need to predict the B values according to A's. So I have two time series of which I can deduct trends and periodicity. Now that I have residuals, how should I proceed? Should I cluster every A's temperature value and its relative B values? I would end up having more than one Y for every X. How can I proceed?
