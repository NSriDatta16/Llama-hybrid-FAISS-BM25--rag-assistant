Understanding of design patterns comes with time and experience. Unless you are very talented, in the beginning you'll probably write code that could be structured more efficiently and you wont even notice. Don't worry about that too much. The thing with design patterns is learning to see their benefit. The particular shape of a pattern usually has very definite reasons. Learning to use a pattern is easy once you have figured out the reasons why organizing code that way is beneficial. Ask questions, set up hypotheses, experiment and see if you were right. For reading, I'd suggest Design Patterns Explained and the SourceMaking site Matthieu suggested is also good.
