I was doing this course ' Bayesian Methods for machine learning' on coursera and I got stuck on few conditional statements expansion and manipulation

I have doubt in three conditional expansions : How is P(w,y|x) = P(y|w,x).P(w) ? How is P(w|y,x) = P(y,w|x)/P(y|x) ? How is P(y|w,x).P(w|x) = P(y|x.w).P(w) ? Also,Do suggest me some reference material to understand the same. Also, If possible write the important expansions and trick on how to expand conditional probablities.
