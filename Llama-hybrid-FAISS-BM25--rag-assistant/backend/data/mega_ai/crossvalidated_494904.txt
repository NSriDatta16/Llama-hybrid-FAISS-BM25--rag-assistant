Interpreting a non-significant interaction when only one of the first order effect remains significant

I'm trying to figure out how to interpret these results. In my first regression, I include both of my two independent variables (IV1 and IV2) to predict a Dependent Variable (DV): IV1 is significant IV2 is significant In my second regression, when I add the interaction term: IV1 remains significant IV2 is no longer significant IV1*IV2 is not significant This pattern occurs when the DV is coded as a dummy (in a logistic regression) and when it is a continuous variable (in a linear regression). How do I interpret these results?
