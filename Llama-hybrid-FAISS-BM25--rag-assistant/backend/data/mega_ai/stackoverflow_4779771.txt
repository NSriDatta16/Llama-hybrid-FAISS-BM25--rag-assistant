That's a very interesting question you asked here. I do th efollowing: temp bookmarks in browser just a tab in Firefox left opened for weeks :) subscription to email\rss when possible. When email notification comes I often put it into special folder in my email tree. Different logins, notification types etc are complicating following info in the web :( Other interesting questions: how to organize information storage (notes, saved web pages, forum threads etc) for current usage and as a read-only library, sync it between different PCs and USB disks, how to label (tag) it and search it how to store old mails, conversations, chats,..? store digital photos for future: make hard-copy printouts or just regulary rewrite it from CD to a new one
