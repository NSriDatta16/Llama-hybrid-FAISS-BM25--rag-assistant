I'm stunning at the way c# it's embracing a fundamental set of programming paradigms. We can say that c# alows a rich object oriented programming, a rich component oriented programming, a well integrated functional programing, a complet set of query operations over differents types of data sources (linq), a elegant aproach of cocurrent programming through pLinq and parallel extensions, in the next release (c# 4.0) will have powerfull dynamic capabilities, and it's almost sure that in c# 5.0 will have a solid set of meta-programming features. With just can say that c# it's doing a great job of integrating all this powerfull stuff in just one tool box. That's in my opinion it's the way it must be, because skipping from one programming language to another it's almost always very painfull.
