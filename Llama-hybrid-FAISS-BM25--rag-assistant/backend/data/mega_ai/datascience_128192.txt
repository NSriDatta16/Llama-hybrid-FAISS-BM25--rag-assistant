Could You Suggest Me Some Details of Realizing This LLM?

I mean this hypothetical LLM: https://twitter.com/RokoMijic/status/1663299142431432704 I'm trying to figure out how the neural network (let's abstract from the data) can be realized. I understand that: It's a transformer; It's sequence-to-sequence prediction (with a decoder, not with classification layers). I'd like to ask more experienced ML people for more details of the realization. "Chronologically labelled data" means here concatenation of the events with the dates (like in life2vec)? Am I missing something else that is critical? Thanks a lot in advance!
