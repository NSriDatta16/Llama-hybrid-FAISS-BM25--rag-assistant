Let $X$ denote a discrete random variable that takes on values $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n\}$ , and suppose that $N$ repeated independent trials of the experiment are performed. If $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N$ are the observed values of $X$ on these $N$ trials, then the average observed value of $X$ in these trials is $$\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_N}{N}.$$ But each $x_i \in \{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n\}$ and so instead of adding $N$ numbers to compute the sum in the numerator above, we can count the number of times that $u_j$ occurs in the sum, say $M_j$ times, and rewrite the average as \begin{align}\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_N}{N} &= \frac{M_1u_1 + M_2u_2 + \cdots + M_nu_n}{N}\\ &= \frac{M_1}{N}\cdot u_1 + \frac{M_2}{N}\cdot u_2 + \cdots + \frac{M_n}{N}\cdot u_n. \end{align} Note that $M_1 + M_2 + \cdots + M_n = N$ . Now, $\dfrac{M_j}{N}$ is the observed relative frequency of the event $\{X = u_j\}$ , and if $N$ is large , then we expect that this relative frequency $\dfrac{M_j}{N}$ is approximately $P\{X = u_j\} = p_{X}(u_j)$ . Thus, the average observed value of $X$ on a large number of repeated independent trials is expected to be $$\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_N}{N} \approx u_1\cdot p_{X}(u_1) + u_2\cdot p_{X}(u_2) + \cdots + u_n\cdot p_{X}(u_n).$$ This approximation motivates the definition of the expected value or expectation or average or mean of a discrete random variable as being given by $$E[X] = \sum_i u_i\cdot p_X(u_i).$$ Note that there is no division by $n$ -- the number of values taken on by the discrete random variable -- but there is implicitly a division by $N$ -- the total number of trials -- in how we arrived at the formula for $E[X]$ .
