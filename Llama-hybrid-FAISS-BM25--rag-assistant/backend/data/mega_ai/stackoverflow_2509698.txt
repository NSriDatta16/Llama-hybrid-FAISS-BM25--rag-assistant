I prefer Power Architect , for the same reasons I listed in this question: Accesses source databases via JDBC Connects to multiple source databases concurrently Compares data models & database structures and identifies discrepancies Drag-and-drop source tables & columns into the playpen Remembers the origin of each column Generates source-to-target visual Mapping Reports Forward/reverse engineers PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server & more Saves source data structure snapshots in the project, so you can work remotely All project data is stored in an easy-to-parse XML format OLAP schema modeling: Cubes, Measures, Dimensions, Hierarchies & Levels GPL (version 3) licensed ...and a couple reasons of my own: runs on basically any platform has fairly nice keyboard support for fast model development relatively useful diagram auto-layout
