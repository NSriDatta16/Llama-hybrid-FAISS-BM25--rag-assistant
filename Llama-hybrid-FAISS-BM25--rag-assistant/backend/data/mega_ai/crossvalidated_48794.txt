If you have everything in a database, then Weka is a nice tool for proof-of-concept tests. It's open source, free, contains most mainstream algorithms and it can retrieve data from a database through a JDBC connector. The only drawback is that it's a little old so it's quite horrible to code against, and the interface isn't the most slick. According to the documentation, it has some tools for time series analysis, but I've not tried them myself.
