The Wikipedia entry for the game you are referring to has the answer to your question: the house edge (i.e. the average win percentage for the casino assuming perfect play from the player) is between 2.0 and 2.5%. Note that perfect play does not have the exact same meaning you provide. Perfect play means calling (paying the extra \$10 in your example) whenever he has more than 50% chance of winning given the information available. The casino's advantage comes from the risking \$15 only after he has seen all the cards, unlike the player that must decide whether to risk \$15 knowing only 5 cards.
