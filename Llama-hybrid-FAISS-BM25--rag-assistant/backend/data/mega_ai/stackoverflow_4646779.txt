Embedding googleVis charts into a web site

Reading from the googleVis package vignette : "With the googleVis package users can create easily web pages with interactive charts based on R data frames and display them either via the R.rsp package or within their own sites " . Following the instructions I was able to see the sample charts, using the plot method for gvis objects. This method by default creates a rsp-file in the rsp/myAnalysis folder of the googleVis package, using the type and chart id information of the object and displays the output using the local web server of the R.rsp package (port 8074 by default). Could anybody help me (or provide some link) on the procedure someone has to follow in order to embed such charts into an existing web site (e.g. a joomla site)?
