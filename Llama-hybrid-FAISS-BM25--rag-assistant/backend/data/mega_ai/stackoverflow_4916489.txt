While they both deal with creating Tickets, the Agent / Ticket selling vs. the Customer / Ticket purchasing seem different enough to me that they should be separated. Eventually they could further diverge since they are being used so differently from the beginning. It is possible to have shared controller functionality either with modules or by inheriting from a common parent controller: module TicketsControllersCommom # common helper methods end class TicketsController I might treat the agent parts as a sort of admin section, with the customer parts being the default: /events/xx/tickets # collection /events/xx/tickets/xx # member # etc. /events/xx/agent/tickets # collection /events/xx/agent/tickets/xx # member # etc. Or, if you have a lot of admin-type stuff, like if the agents manage the events as well, you can namespace a whole section: /agent/events/xx/tickets /agent/events/xx/edit # etc.
