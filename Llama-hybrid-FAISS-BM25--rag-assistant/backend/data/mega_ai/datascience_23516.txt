Need help understanding the structure of this convoluted neural network

I'm trying to grasp the structure of this convoluted neural network. ( Source ) I understand the first layer is a 6x6 conv with stride 2 followed by 3x3 max pool and then 6 5x5 convs and another 3x3 max pool. After this, however, outputs from a fully connected layer of 64 neurons are "tiled over the special dimensions of the response map of pool2". I don't understand what this means. The output of pool2 should be 64 (because of 64 filters) 18x18 arrays. In the first 18x18 array do I add output1 to each of the 18*18=324 values, and in the second array add output2 to each of the 324 values, etc.? TLDR What do I do with the 64 outputs (each is a 18x18 array) and the 64 outputs from the fully connected layer?
