Normalization comes from the mathematical concept of being "normal." Another word would be "perpendicular." Imagine a regular two-axis coordinate system. Moving up just changes the y coordinate, moving to the side just changes the x coordinate. So every movement can be broken down into a sideways and an up-down movement. These two are independent of each other. Normalization in database essentially means the same thing: If you change a piece of data, this is supposed to change just one single piece of information in a database. Imagine a database of E-Mails: If you store the ID and the name of the recipient in the Mails table, but the Users table also associates the name to the ID, that means if you change a user name, you don't only have to change it in the users table, but also in every single message that this user is involved with. So, the axis "message" and the axis "user" are not "perpendicular" or "normal." If on the other hand, the Mails table only has the user ID, any change to the user name will automatically apply to all the messages, because on retrieval of a message, all user information is gathered from the Users table (by means of a join).
