Do I need to have a separate Visual Studio 2010 project for services, classes, website and Silverlight app?

I am starting a new Silverlight 3 project in Visual Studio 2010. My plan is to have a project for each of these: The Silverlight application The hosting web application The WCF service This last one will also contain a typed dataset (that will serve as my data logic layer) and a few classes to do my business logic. The WCF service methods will return typed data to Silverlight. I am just wondering if there is any compelling reason to split the BLL components out of the WCF service project. Any other comments about organizing the project are welcome, too, of course. One thing I will not entertain is using some ORM like N-Hibernate. The entire solution needs to be constructed with the more-than-capable tools that come with Visual Studio. Thank you!
