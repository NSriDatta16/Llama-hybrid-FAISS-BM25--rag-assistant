I would recommend storing as files and storing their locations in the database. Storage the files in a database requires more resources and makes backing up/restoring databases slower. Do you really want to have to transfer lots of videos every time you do a database dump? File systems work very well for dishing out files, and you can back them up/sync them very easily.
