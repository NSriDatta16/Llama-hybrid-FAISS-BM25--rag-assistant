Assume you have a UIView scene with a background image and many vehicles , you may define each new vehicle as a UIButton (UIImageView will probably work too): UIButton *button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom]; [button addTarget:self action:@selector(imageTouch:withEvent:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchDown]; [button addTarget:self action:@selector(imageMoved:withEvent:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchDragInside]; [button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"vehicle.png"] forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [self.view addSubview:button]; Then you may move the vehicle wherever you want, by responding to the UIControlEventTouchDragInside event, e.g.: - (IBAction) imageMoved:(id) sender withEvent:(UIEvent *) event { CGPoint point = [[[event allTouches] anyObject] locationInView:self.view]; UIControl *control = sender; control.center = point; } It's a lot easier for individual vehicle to handle its own drags, comparing to manage the scene as a whole.
