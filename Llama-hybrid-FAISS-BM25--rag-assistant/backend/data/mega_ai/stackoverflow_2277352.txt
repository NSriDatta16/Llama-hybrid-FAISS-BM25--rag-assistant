Split a string at uppercase letters

What is the pythonic way to split a string before the occurrences of a given set of characters? For example, I want to split 'TheLongAndWindingRoad' at any occurrence of an uppercase letter (possibly except the first), and obtain ['The', 'Long', 'And', 'Winding', 'Road'] . Edit: It should also split single occurrences, i.e. from 'ABC' I'd like to obtain ['A', 'B', 'C'] .
