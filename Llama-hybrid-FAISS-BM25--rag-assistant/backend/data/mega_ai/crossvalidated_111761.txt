In random forest algorithms, variable importance is not a measure of effect size. It is a measure of the contribution of a variable to out-of-bag predictive performance. In random forest, a variable can be important due to the way it interacts with other variables, and to the way it separates the data on its own. Nothing prevents a variable with a small linear effect size as estimated in a logistic regression model from having high importance in a random forest fit. Indeed, nothing prevents the inclusion or exclusion of a variable with a small effect size from having a large effect on predictive accuracy even within the framework of logistic regression, especially if there are strong confounding or mediation effects of that variable on other predictors, and including those confounding or mediation effects leads to better predictions.
