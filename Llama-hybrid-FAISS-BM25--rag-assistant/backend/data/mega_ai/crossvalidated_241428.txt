Get real analysis, but not in the way I see people do it. When we interview math undergrads they don't seem to master the tools of real analysis, simple things like taking integrals are out of reach for most of them. I still don't understand why. So, my advice: pay attention to applications first and foremost. Also get ODE and PDE course, and functional analysis and differential geometry. Linear algebra and tensors, of course, too. All with focus on applications.
