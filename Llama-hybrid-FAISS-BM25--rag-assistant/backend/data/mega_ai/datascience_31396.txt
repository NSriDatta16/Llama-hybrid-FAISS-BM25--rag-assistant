Build a predictive model for number of hockey goals in a season for an individual player

I'm looking to build a predictive model for hockey players individual statistics. My goal is to predict how many points a player can be expected to have at the end of the season. To do so, I thought I could base myself on the progression of the player's statistics over the year. I currently have 10 years worth of data and, for example, a player could have played in 5 of those 10 years. In this case, I'm able to see if this particular player is on an increasing or decreasing curve regarding his statistics. So, to resume, for some thousands of players the data goes like this: Player #1 Season 2005-2006, Points : X, Game played : y, ... Season 2006-2007, Points : X, Game played: Y, ... Season 2007-2008, Points : X, Game played: Y, ... ... Player #2 ... My main problem is that I don't know what kind of data this is so I can't find more information on how to build my model. In my title I've written "multiple small multivariate time series" for a lack of better name. I've obviously looked into multivariate time series to fit them in an RNN architecture, but it doesn't seem to fit because of the multiple time series that aren't really related. I've found this question which kind of relates but there were no answer and the related comments didn't help me. All in all, I'm trying to find some guidance as to what kind of model I could use to work with my data. I'd also like to know if there's a name for this kind of data, so I can inform myself better.
