Are you looking for actual SQL for this or some Magento code? The actual SQL is going to get messy, and probably won't ever look the way you want it to. Since there's no "pivot" in MySQL, you can basically ignore eav_attribute in the actual query. You'll be looking at it to find the attribute IDs you want. Here's a trivial example of how to select this data: select c.*, fn.value firstname from customer_entity c join customer_entity_varchar fn on c.entity_id = fn.entity_id and fn.attribute_id = 5 ; Keep adding those join clauses for every attribute, and you'll have your query. Basically, EAV is not optimized for this kind of access. If you give a little more detail about what you are trying to do (or whether PHP code in Magento will work for your purposes), we may be able to help you further. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
