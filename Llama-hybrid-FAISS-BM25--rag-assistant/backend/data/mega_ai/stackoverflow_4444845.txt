An often overlooked solution is Agent++ API , which to me looks pretty nice and is under the Apache license. As far as I understand, you can modify that agent to answer to your own MIBs. That said, doing a subagent isn't such a bad choice. You start the standard unpatched snmpd (from net-snmp ). Then you connect to it with your subagent, which only adds those OIDs you want it to add. The net-snmp kit for coding AgentX (as the protocol is called) sub-agents is not dead simple to use, but not very hard either. There is also a Perl module for sub-agent development: https://metacpan.org/pod/NetSNMP::agent
