OK, I worked out a hack that does the trick: (setq auto-fill-mode -1) (setq-default fill-column 99999) (setq fill-column 99999) If I can't turn off auto-fill mode, at least I can make it harmless by setting it to fill only in column 99999. I'll be annoyed if I type a paragraph with more than 99999 characters, but if that happens I'll have bigger things to worry about...
