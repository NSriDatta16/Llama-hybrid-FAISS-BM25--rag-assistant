The reason why I first fire the data change event is that I want to update a JLabel with a text that contains data from the row I'm about to delete (probably there is a more elegant way). This functionality should not be part of the TableModel. The button that invokes the delete logic should save the information you require before invoking the remove row method. Then the removeRow() code should remove the row from your rowData before firing the table rows deleted event. but it seems it happens most of the times after I edit a row, there's a column sorting active and then delete a row You need to convert the row view to the row model. I think the code should be something like: int modelRow = tableConvertRowIndexToModel( selectedRow ); rowData.remove(modelRow); fireTableRowsDeleted(modelRow, modelRow);
