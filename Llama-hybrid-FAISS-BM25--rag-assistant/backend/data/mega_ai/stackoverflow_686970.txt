Why would AccessDataSource return different results to query in Access?

I have a query to return random distinct rows from an Access database. Here is the query: SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT m.MemberID, m.Title, m.FullName, m.Address, m.Phone, m.EmailAddress, m.WebsiteAddress FROM Members AS m INNER JOIN MembersForType AS t ON m.MemberID = t.MemberID WHERE (Category = 'MemberType1' OR Category = 'MemberType2')) as Members ORDER BY RND(members.MemberID) DESC When I run this in Access it returns the rows in different order every time, as per the random sort order. When I run it through my web app however the rows return in the same order every time. Here is how I call it in my code-behind: private void BindData() { using (AccessDataSource ds = new AccessDataSource("~/App_Data/mydb.mdb", GetSQLStatement())) { ds.DataSourceMode = SqlDataSourceMode.DataReader; ds.CacheDuration = 0; ds.CacheExpirationPolicy = DataSourceCacheExpiry.Absolute; ds.EnableCaching = false; listing.DataSource = ds.Select(new DataSourceSelectArguments()); listing.DataBind(); if (listing.Items.Count == 0) noResults.Visible = true; else noResults.Visible = false; } } I added in all that stuff about caching because I thought maybe the query was being cached but the result was the same. I put a breakpoint in the code to make sure the query was the same as above and it was. Any ideas? This is driving me nuts.
