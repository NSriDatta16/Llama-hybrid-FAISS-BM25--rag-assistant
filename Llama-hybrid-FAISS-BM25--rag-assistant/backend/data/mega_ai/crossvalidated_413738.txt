Although very intuitive and was preferred commonly (me, too), the only problem you may face with MAPE is not just the case where $y=0$ . Especically when the predicted series is positive, e.g. CLTV, when $\hat{y} , (an underestimate ), the percentage error cannot be greater than $1$ . In overestimates, $\hat{y}>2y$ guarantees a MAPE with larger than $1$ . So, it implicitly favours for underestimates . To deal with such issues, sometimes we can resort to SMAPE (which was proposed by Makridakis , or by Armstrong with the name adjusted MAPE ), in which we take the average (sometimes sum) of $y$ and $\hat{y}$ for the denominator.
