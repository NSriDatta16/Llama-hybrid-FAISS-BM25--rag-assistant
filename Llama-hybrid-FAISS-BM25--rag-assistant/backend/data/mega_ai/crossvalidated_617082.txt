I also searched long for an answer to this question but managed to convince myself that this is similar to the StyleGAN model. In StyleGAN, we also sample from a Gaussian distribution (just as we do in DDPM, $x_T$ ). Then, when we are passing the model through the network, we add some noise to induce some fine details such as the details of human hair. I don't have a rigorous explanation but it seemed me slightly similar. Hope I can convince you as well :)
