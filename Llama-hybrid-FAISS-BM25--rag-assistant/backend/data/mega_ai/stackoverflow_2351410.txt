I've used the Spring LDAP module to interact with directories. It works very well, same as all Spring code. You would use whatever relational database technology you wish to write to the database. If you're already using Spring, this won't be difficult. In this case you'd create a connection to an LDAP to read the data and another to the database to write it. But there's a question here that's worth asking: Why do you feel like you need to duplicate the data? The DRY principle would discourage you from doing so. Wouldn't it be better to have all the information in one place or the other?
