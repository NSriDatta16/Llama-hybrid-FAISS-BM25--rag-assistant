How to handle string features in a neural network

I am new to ANNs. How to handle features whicvh consist of strings? E.g. if I have group featire which are different groups conatining differnt capital Leters and numbers. Now I have the train data set containing all such important features. My first guess is just to replace stings with numbers. But you have different uncorrelated groups of strings like the category or the manufacturer.
