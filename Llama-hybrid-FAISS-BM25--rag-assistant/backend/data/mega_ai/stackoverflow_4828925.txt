I also reconstructed your answer in Visual Studio 2010 in a blank WPF 3.5 project. The project behaved as expected, i.e. the Window_Loaded threw the exception, and it was caught by the button click event. So I'm not sure why yours isn't working, maybe try posting your App.xml.cs and any other code you haven't shown here? In the meantime, I thought I would point out a few things: WPF does indeed handle "uncaught" exceptions a little differently from WinForms. Try looking at this for a starter: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.application.dispatcherunhandledexception.aspx It looks as if there isn't an exact equivalent in WPF for the SetUnhandledExceptionMode method (See http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/wpf/thread/955c75f8-9cd9-4158-bed9-544bd7946413 ). Try their advice about registering a handler and see if that helps you? I would recommend stepping through your code - set a breakpoint in the Window_Loaded, and see what happens - pay careful attention to the call stack. Good luck!
