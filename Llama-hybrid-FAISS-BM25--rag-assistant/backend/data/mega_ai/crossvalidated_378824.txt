Applying PCA - First two components explain low variance but have high data separation when plotting

Applying PCA on a set of documents gives strange results in terms of the variance explained by the PCs vs the data separation I'm having when plotting the first two principle components. Details : Number of documents = 200 (100 Movie Reviews & 100 Restaurant Reviews) Number of features: 5000 words All docs have been processed and normalized (e.g., stop word removal, stemming, lemmatization, etc). Logic : vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer() X = vectorizer.fit_transform(processed_corpus) pca = PCA() principle_components = pca.fit_transform(X) # Variance explained by the first two components print(pca.explained_variance_[:2]) Variance of PC1 = 0.04216743 Variance of PC2 = 0.01481811 As noted the explained variance of the first two PCs is very small. However, when I plot the first two principal components of each sample (document) it shows a very good separation between samples that belong to two different classes. I'm not sure if there is anything wrong with the logic I'm using?
