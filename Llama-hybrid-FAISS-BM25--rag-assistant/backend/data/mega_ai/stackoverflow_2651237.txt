Distributed Cache with Serialized File as DataStore in Oracle Coherence

Weired but I am investigating the Oracle Coherence as a substitue for distribute cache. My primarr problem is that we dont have distribituted cache as such as of now in our app. Thats my major concern. And thats what I want to implement. So, lets say if I take up a machine and start a new (3rd) reading process, it will be able to connect to the cache and listen to the cache and will have a full set of cache triplicated (as of now its duplicated) Now thats waste from a common person stanpoint too. The size of the cache is 2 GB and without going distibuted its limiting us. Thats bring me to Coheremce. But now, we dont have database as persistent store too. we have the archival processes as our persistent store. (90 days worth of data) Ok now multiply that with soem where around 2 GB * 90 (thats the bare minimum we want to keep). Preliminary/Intermediate analysis of Coherence as a solution. And a (supposedly) brilliant thought crossed my mind. Why not have this as persistant storage with my distributed cache. Does Oracle Coherence support that. I will get rid of archiving infrastructure too (i hate daemon archiving processes). For some starnge reasons, I dont wanna go to the DB to replace those flat files. What say?, can Coherence be my savior? Any other stable alternate too. (Coherence is imposed on me by big guys, FYI)
