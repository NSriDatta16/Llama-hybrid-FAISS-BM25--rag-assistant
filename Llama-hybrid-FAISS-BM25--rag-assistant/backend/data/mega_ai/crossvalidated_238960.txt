Let the state space of the Markov Chain be $S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. Now draw the state transition diagram. (a). From the figure, we observe that $\{4\}$, and $\{6\}$ form non-closed communicating classes. State $2$ does not communicate even with itself and such a state is called a non-return state. Hence, the states 2 , 4 and 6 are transient . (b)&(c). The class $\{1,3,5\}$ is a closed-communicating class. Hence, states 1 , 3 and 5 are recurrent states. (c). There is only one closed-communicating class, $\{1,3,5\}$. (d). As the chain is not an irreducible Markov Chain, it is not an ergodic chain.
