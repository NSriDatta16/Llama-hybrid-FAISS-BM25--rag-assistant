What is wrong with my neural network

I have been trying to code a neural network for the last couple of days. I have come pretty far, but i am super stuck right now and am looking for some help to make progress. I have the feeling my network isn't learning like it is supposed to. Or not learning at all idk. I programmed everything from the ground up including the matrix class for multiplication and addition. The most " impressive " thing (not really that impressive) that i managed to do is to recognize numbers, but only if i don't use any hidden layers (input -> output). If i add an hidden layer the network recognizes everything just like the last trained number ( last trained number = 0, so from there on everything is a 0). My best guess is that my Backpropagation is broken somehow (not the first step but the others) but i cant figure out how: ( thought for a long time that i am somehow working with the wrong matrices or got some kind of other index fuckup, but in that case i shouldnt be able to multiply the vectors and matrices, because of their different size. // calculate error for l in 0..target.len(){ target[l] = res.res[l] - target[l]; } // create Matrix from Error let mut delta = Matrix::new_v(target); let layer = self.layer.len(); let mut z : Vec > = Vec::with_capacity(layer); // Calculate all the values before activation function for x in 0..layer{ let y = layer-1 -1*x; let lw = &self.layer[y].w; let lb = &self.layer[y].b; let lam1 = &res.nodevalues[&res.nodevalues.len()-2-1*x].clone(); z.push(&(lw * &lam1) + lb); } for l in 0..layer{ let y = self.layer.len()-1 -1*l; let talm1 = &res.nodevalues[&res.nodevalues.len()-2-1*l].clone().transpose(); // transposed Layeractivationvalues transpose z[l] = z[l].clone().map(Self::derivactivfunc); // use relu derivation if l == 0{ delta = delta.hadamard(&z[l]); // first round } else{ delta = (&self.layer[y+1].w.transpose() * &delta).hadamard(&z[l]); // propagate the error backwards } delta = delta.mulnum(rate*-1.0); // multiply the learning rate self.layer[y].b = &self.layer[y].b + &delta; // change biases self.layer[y].w = &self.layer[y].w + &(&delta*&talm1); // change weights } return self; Im quite confident, that transpose() and hadamard() are correct. One last thing i am not so sure about is the normalization of my output values before i put them into the softmax function. pub fn normalize( mut vec: Vec ) -> Vec { let mut max = vec[0].abs(); for i in 1..vec.len(){ if vec[i].abs() > max{ max = vec[i].abs(); } } max = max / 2.0; for i in 0..vec.len(){ vec[i] = vec[i]/max; } return vec; } For good measure: // activationfunction for values pub fn activfunc( mut v: Mval) -> Mval{ if v Mval{ if v I feel like i got a pretty good understanding practical understanding on what every step is supposed to do, but every time i change something either nothing changes or everything and it feels like i am just shooting in the dark. I would appreciate some suggestions a lot =) Ty guys One thing i would be especially interested in is a way to check that my back propagation is working.
