I checked the devise github page to see what they were up to. That project is moving pretty fast and as it happens they have support for facebook connect amongst other things. Check out the section on OAuth2. They use github as an example but it would be the same thing for facebook and they mention differences. I think this is the way to go, third party gems for devise don't move as fast as devise or rails do. Cheers. Oops here's the link http://github.com/plataformatec/devise Edit Of course I did very little coding here mostly went with the default, so here goes: Create a new app and add these gems to the gemfile. gem 'devise', :git => 'git://github.com/plataformatec/devise.git' gem 'oauth2', :git => 'git://github.com/intridea/oauth2.git' Run bundle install, then these commands gets you going with a basic User authentication model. rails generate devise:install rails generate devise User In config/initializers/devise.rb uncomment/modify these. Look at the last paragraph as to where you get app_key and secret from facebook. config.oauth :facebook, 'app_key', 'secret', :site => 'https://graph.facebook.com', :authorize_path => '/oauth/authorize', :access_token_path => '/oauth/access_token' This should be your user model. class User data["name"], :email => data["email"], :password => Devise.friendly_token) end end end Devise uses a root :to => "something#here" so I created a home controller with a index action and used that to root the application. But nevermind that. I put that in layout/application.html.erb so that I had basic sign_n sign_out routes. Devise pretty much takes care of everything else for us. What you do need to do though is get your app_key and secret from facebook (used in devise.rb config file). This link should get you going. http://developers.facebook.com/setup
