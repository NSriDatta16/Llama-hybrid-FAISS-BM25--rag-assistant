Key Differences I think that first of you have to look at the authors of both software tools. Apromore was designed and developed at the University of Melbourne, whereas ProM was born at the Technical University of Eindhoven (TUe). TUe was till recently the university where Prof. Wil van der Aalst, the so called father of process mining, had his chair. Second of, the architecture of the two applications differs. Whereas Apromore is a self-contained tool, with all the algorithms coming pre-packaged with it, ProM is more of a skeleton of an app, with a package manager attached, so you can install whatever package the academia or other authors have newly come up with. Recommendations Depending on your use-case I would personally recommend for you to try out both. Furthermore, I would encourage you to also try other tools such as Disco from Fluxicon (a start-up composed of two of van der Aalst's former students), to get a better feel for what works for you. Strictly for analysis and process mining in action I think the latter is a better tool than both. In contrast the former two tools are more appropriate if you are interested to learn hands-on the different algorithms with their advantages and their limitations. Lastly, if you are a tinkerer I could imagine that a process mining software library for python, such as PM4Py , would be appropriate for you.
