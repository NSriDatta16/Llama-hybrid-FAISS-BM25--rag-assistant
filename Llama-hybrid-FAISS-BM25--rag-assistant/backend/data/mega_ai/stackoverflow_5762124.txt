MootoolsFancy Upload

i have just come across what i think i need for my front end multi uploader script in joomla. Mootools fancy upload looks great! but i am having trouble when i uncomment the script that uploads the images inside the uploads folder? All i have done is uncommented the default script inside the test file and created a folder called uploads which i set to 757 and also tried 777 But for some reason the uploader now returns some strange error about md 5 hash stuff? eastern_beach_jetty.jpgAn error occured: Warning: md5_file(/tmp/phpUjHol4) [function.md5-file]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/user/www.mydomain.com.au/test/server/script.php on line 133 {"status":"1","name":"eastern_beach_jetty.jpg","hash":false} The fancy uploader website from where i got the script is here http://digitarald.de/project/fancyupload/ Any help on this would be so greatly apprecited, thank you.
