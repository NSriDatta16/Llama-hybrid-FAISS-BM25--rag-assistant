Quasi-likelihood can't be generated by any valid probability distribution

I am learning about quasi-Poisson and i'm stuck at the concept of quasi-likelihood function. In wikipedia, it is said that: The term quasi-likelihood function was introduced by Robert Wedderburn in 1974 to describe a function that has similar properties to the log-likelihood function but is not the log-likelihood corresponding to any actual probability distribution My question is that: if we estimate a variable $Y$ which depends on the coefficients $\beta$ by maximizing the quasi-likelihood function (for example, quasi-Poisson), is it valid ? I mean $Y$ must follow "some unknown" distribution, but the quasi-likelihood, instead, does not correspond to "any" distribution. So why using a function that correspond to "nothing" to estimate a random variable with a valid probability distribution ? Thank you very much!
