You observe if an event occurred or not, but the length of the observation interval varies. If you model the events as a Poisson process, but you only observe if there are zero or more events, but not the actual number, this can be modelled as a binary binomial regression, but not a logistic one. Use the complementary log-log link function, in R that would be something like glm(Y ~ 1 + offset(log(exposure)), family=binomial(link="cloglog")) Let the intensity (also called hazard) of the Poisson process be $\lambda$ . Then the probability of zero events in time interval $t_i$ is $e^{-\lambda t_i}$ , so the (binomial) probability of 1 or more events is $p_i = 1-e^{-\lambda t_i}$ . The complementary log-log link function is $$ \eta_i =\log( -\log(1-p_i)) = \log(\lambda)+\log(t_i) $$ so when you model the link scale as a linear model, as usual with glm's, you have to use log(exposure) as an offset, and the estimated intercept is an estimate of $\log\lambda$ . This is also discussed and explained at Modelling a binary outcome when census interval varies .
