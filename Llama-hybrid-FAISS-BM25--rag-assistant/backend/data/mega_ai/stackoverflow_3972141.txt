Android: UnknownHostException when sending HTTP POST

What I'd like to do is sending a HTTP POST request to a REST webservice. However it seems as if my applicaion cannot connect to the host. The application throws the following exception when sending the request: 10-19 18:54:05.335: VERBOSE/SD(280): java.net.UnknownHostException: http://www.myhost.com 10-19 18:54:05.335: VERBOSE/SD(280): at java.net.InetAddress.lookupHostByName(InetAddress.java:513) 10-19 18:54:05.335: VERBOSE/SD(280): at java.net.InetAddress.getAllByNameImpl(InetAddress.java:280) 10-19 18:54:05.335: VERBOSE/SD(280): at java.net.InetAddress.getByName(InetAddress.java:310) The host definitely exists and the URL provided is correct. Also I'm able calling the URL using the browser of the Android emulator. The application contains the following in the AndroidManifest.xml: Has anybody ever experienced something similar? Greetings, Robert
