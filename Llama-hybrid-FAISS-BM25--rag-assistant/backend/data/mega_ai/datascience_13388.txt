Regarding First Question . In the above formula, if I'm not wrong, x is a matrix of elements. So what the formula wants from you, is to sum all dot products of every line with it's transpose. This will give you scalar. x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) res = x.dot(x.transpose()) # res = 30 So my sugestion would be to change that line of code to: for i in range(row): sigma += x[i].transpose().dot(x[i]) sigma = sigma/row Second Question Because you reduced the dimensionality, the x_new matrix will not be the same. Third Question When to use the PCA is a thing of domain problem. The point of dimensionality reduction is, to get new data set, which will not be as hard to process, but it will loose some information. So if you are your "result"/"time to process" is good, I don't think you should use it.
