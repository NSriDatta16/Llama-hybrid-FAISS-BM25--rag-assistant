For anyone still encountering this problem, see: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=53232 Specifically, here's Rembert Oldenboom's response: Issue still exists with mysql 5.5.8 on brand new on mbp i7 2.8. With the comments of others the fix was easy: Edit /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server Search for "Set some defaults" about 4 lines down, replace the line basedir=. with basedir=/usr/local/mysql Then search for "Set pid file if not given" about 3 lines down, replace the line mysqld_pid_file_path=$datadir/`hostname`.pid with mysqld_pid_file_path=$datadir/`/bin/hostname`.pid Now the prefPane will work.
