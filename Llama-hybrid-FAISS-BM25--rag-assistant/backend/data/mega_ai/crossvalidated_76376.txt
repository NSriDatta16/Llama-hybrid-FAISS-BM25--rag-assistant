How is Hyndman's explanation of proper Time Series Cross Validation different from Leave-One-Out?

Hyndman's great explanation of proper time series CV is at the bottom of the page in the following link: http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/crossvalidation/ Leave-One-Out illustration in the following link: https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGXO6.png In the 'leave one out' illustration if the dataset in the illustration was time series data and was sorted from past to present from left to right, wouldn't it be identical to Hyndman's explanation on Time Series CV? If not, how so?
