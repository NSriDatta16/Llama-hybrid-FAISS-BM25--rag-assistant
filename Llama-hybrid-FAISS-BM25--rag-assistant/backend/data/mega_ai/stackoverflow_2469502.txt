Try the Chinese language version of GoogleMaps ditu.google.cn . It is better than the China coverage in the English Google Maps (at least it was a couple of years ago when I last looked into it). Be aware that the Chinese government restricts foreign use of GIS data, so there may not be a good geocoding solution available if you are based outside China.
