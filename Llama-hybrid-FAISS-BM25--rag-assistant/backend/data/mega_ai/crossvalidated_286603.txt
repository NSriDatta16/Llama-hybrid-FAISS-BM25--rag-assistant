Understanding direction of greatest variance in PCA

In the picture below, why is u the direction of greatest variance? Aren't the data points further away from v than from u ? Variance is the sum over the squared distances of each data point from the mean, right? It would just seem to me that if I measured and summed the distances of the data points to v , it would be greater than the sum of the distances of each data point to u .
