Actually I found that this is very easy in VBA. I didn't want to add another field to my Query so I did this: Forms!MyForm!AvgTextBox = Avg([mytable.values2Baveraged]) Forms!MyForm!CountTextBox = Count([mytable.values2Bcounted]) This calculates the function on the entire column. This worked perfectly just in case anyone cared.
