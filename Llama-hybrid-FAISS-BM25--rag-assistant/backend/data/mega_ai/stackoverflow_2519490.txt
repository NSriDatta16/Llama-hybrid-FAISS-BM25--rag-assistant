Separating Strings from a CSV File in SSIS 2008

I have data which resembles the following: "D.STEIN","DS","01","ALTRES","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","APCASH","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","APINH","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","APINV","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","APMISC","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","APPCHK","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","APWLNK","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","ARCOM","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","ARINV","TTTTTTFFTT" I need to break out the final string into separate columns for import into a SQL Table, one letter into each field. Therefore, "TTTTTTFFTT" will be broken out into 10 separate fields each with a single bit value. I've used a Flat File Source Editor to load the data. How do I accomplish the split?
