Recording and storing high-res hand drawing

Are there any advanced solutions for capturing a hand drawing (from a tablet, touch screen or iPad like device) on a web site in JavaScript, and storing it on server side? Essentially, this would be a simple mouse drawing canvas with the specialty that its resolution (i.e. the number of mouse movements it catches per second) needs to be very high, otherwise round lines in the drawing will become "polygonal" when moving the pen / mouse fast: (if this weren't the case, the inputDraw solution suggested by @Gregory would be 100% perfect.) It would also have to have a high level of graphical quality, i.e. antialias the penstroke . Nothing fancy here but a MS Paint style, 1x1 Pixel stroke won't cut it. I find this a very interesting thing in general, seeing as Tablet PCs are becoming at least a bit more common. (Not that they get the attention I feel they deserve). Any suggestions are highly appreciated. I would prefer an Open Source solution, but I am also open to proprietary solutions like ActiveX controls or Java Applets. FF4, Chrome support is a must; Opera, IE8/9 support is desired. Please note that most "canvas" libraries around, and most answers to other questions similar to mine, refer to programmatically drawing onto a canvas. This is not what I am looking for. I am looking for something that records the actual pen or mouse movements of the user drawing on a certain area. Starting a bounty out of curiosity whether anything has changed during the time since this question was asked.
