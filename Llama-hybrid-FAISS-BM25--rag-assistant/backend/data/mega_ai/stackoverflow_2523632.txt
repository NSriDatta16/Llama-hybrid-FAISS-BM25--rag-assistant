The best and most professional way is to provide a web interface for translation agencies. This way you can outsource the work anywhere you please. Also think of embedding the UI into your development process. You add new textual resources to your application, they are automatically published in this UI. Agencies perform translation and mark this particular item as translated. The build picks up the already translated resources and substitutes stubs or default texts with those translations. If a string is reported as being incorrectly translated, you mark it to send for repeated translation again. This is easily done when this is conceived from the beginning of the development. It's not exactly a feature you can easily add later, but it is of course possible. For this to work, you need to store every translatable piece of text somewhere special. Either you keep them in a database, store in some XML file, you need two things: Integrate those resources into your development process. For instance, when you compile a project, the resources are picked up from that storage and put into their proper places in the code, markup or whatever you do. Provide external access to that storage. Add/delete rights only to yourself, add/modify translations for existing items for external users.
