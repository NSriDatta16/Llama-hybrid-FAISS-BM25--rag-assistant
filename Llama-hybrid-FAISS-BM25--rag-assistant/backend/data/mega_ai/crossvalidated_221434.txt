EDIT: As Pavel noted I misunderstood the code. In this case batch size refers to time series data. Thanks. I have an idea what might be going on. If I understood correctly you are making a set of batches of eight samples. In Your case each concurrent sample is 2-dimensional (ie. x and y or input[1] and input[2] ). You pupulate the tensor inputs with batchSize number of samples. I think you might have misunderstood the function of a batch, which is to reduce random errors (ie data outliers) by averaging the result of a forward and backprop thorugh the batch. Your neural network still has only two inputs (since add( nn.LSTM(2, hiddenSize, rho) ). Hence you give it only a single point and ask it to predict which function it belongs to, which is an impossible task. What you'd want to do instead is have the first layer have a matrix of 2 x n inputs where n is the number of points you want to input to your network.
