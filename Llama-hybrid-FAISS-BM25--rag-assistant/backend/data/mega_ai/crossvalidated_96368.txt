As Far as I know, the Total Probability theorem (The integral formula of the Total Probability as well) is used in Artillery fire, to estimate the incapacitation of personnel from fragmentation ammunition or/and from the shock wave of the explosion (usually in nuclear explosions). http://gklimi.wix.com/physicsmathapp/studies See Study: Estimation of casualties from Fragmentation Ammunitions and Estimation of the Destructive Power of Meteorites and Meteors. I do not remember any use of Bayes Theorem in exterior ballistics. Of course the Bayes Theorem is used in artillery fire.
