detect if the scrollbars of a form are visible in an mdi child

I cannot detect if the scrollbars of a form are visible. Googleing the Internet shows that the code below should work. Everybody uses it: function VertScrollBarVisible(WindowHandle: THandle): Boolean; begin Result:= (GetWindowlong(WindowHandle, GWL_STYLE) AND WS_VSCROLL) <> 0 end; I call it like this: procedure TFrmBaser.Button1Click(Sender: TObject); begin if VertScrollBarVisible(MainForm.Handle) then Caption:= 'visible'; end; It returns False all the time, even is the scrollbars are visible. They are made visible by some MDI child forms that I drag a bit out of screen. Delphi 7, Win XP SP3, Themes on
