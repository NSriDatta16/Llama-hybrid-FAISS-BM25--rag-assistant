Due to regression toward the mean, it would (for example) be expected to occur fairly readily if the means of $x$ and $y$ were positive (with $x$ and $y$ positively correlated), and the total least squares line went sufficiently close to 0 (where "sufficiently close" depends on how strong the relationship is as well as the scales* and the location of the mean point - the weaker the relationship the further the intercept on the TLS line could stray from 0 without causing either least-squares intercept to go negative) Here's an example I constructed following exactly that recipe: The green line is obtained from principal component analysis. The red line is the least squares line for the regression of y on x, while the blue line is for the regression of x on y. Regression toward the mean pulls the red line clockwise and the blue line anti-clockwise from the green one, which means the y-intercept for the red line will be above the green one and that for the blue line will be below the green one. The green line will fall to one side of the origin; you just need the origin to be relatively close to it so that the regression line that's on the same side of it as the origin is will lay the opposite side of the origin point, in which case it will have its least--squares-line intercept being positive. * on reflection, it may have been better to frame it in terms of a regression based on PCA of the correlation matrix (PCA on standardized variates), but I'll leave it as is for now.
