Interop Word - Delete Page from Document

What is the easiest and most efficient way to delete a specific page from a Document object using the Word Interop Libraries? I have noticed there is a Pages property that extends/implements IEnumerable. Can one simply remove the elements in the array and the pages will be removed from the Document? I have also seen the Ranges and Section examples, but the don't look very elegant to use. Thanks.
