Most browsers do not allow this. Filed picked will be submitted with the form, but will not be available to javascript. This is to prevent javascript from having access to local files. Your best solution is to use AJAX to upload the file, then retrieve it from the server and display it. This solution makes it so the initial view takes longer, but if the user then decides it is the file they want, you can avoid sending it to the server again and just move it from a temporary storage area to a permanent one.
