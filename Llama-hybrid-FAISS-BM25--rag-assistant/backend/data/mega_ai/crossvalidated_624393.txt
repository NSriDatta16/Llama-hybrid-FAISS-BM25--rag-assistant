Fitting a simple model first, then training a neural network on the error

Can someone tell me what the name is for the following process? I have some data with inputs $x_i$ and outputs $y_i$ , and I fit a simple model (e.g. linear regression) to them. Then, I compute the residual errors, and refine the model by training a neural net to predict them. We could generalize this idea by jointly optimizing the parameters of the simple model and the neural network at the same time. Is this considered "ensemble stacking"? Or maybe it's just a particular kind of loss function you can attach to an existing neural network? Any suggestions are helpful, thank you!
