How can I perform a comparison of poisson and linear modelling using one dataset?

my y is average length of stay in months however the number of months in dataset is up to 60 so I can treat it as continuous but my main objective is to identify when can i determine it's better to treat is discrete or when is better to treat it as continuous. Thank you
