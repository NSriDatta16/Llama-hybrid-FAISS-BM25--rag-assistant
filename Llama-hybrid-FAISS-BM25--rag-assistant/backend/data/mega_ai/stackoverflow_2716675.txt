No there is not. Memory which is separately allocated must be separately freed. The only way you could free it as once is if you allocated it at once is a giant block. You would then have to do a bit of pointer math to assign every row the correct index into the array but it's not terribly difficult. This approach does have a few downsides though Extra pointer math Requires one giant contiguous block of memory vs. N smaller blocks of memory. Can be an issue in low memory or high fragmentation environments. Extra work for no real stated gain.
