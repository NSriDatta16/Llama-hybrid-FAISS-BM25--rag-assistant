Isn't it just a simple division of the averages? AvgTeam1WinP / AvgTeam2WinP ? It should yield the odds that team1 will win against team2 . If I consider the following: If player1 would play against player2 in "1-man" teams, you would agree that the odds that player1 will win against player2 would be the probability that player1 would win against random divided by the probability that player2 would win at random (this of course only holds in the case that you considered the win % to be accurate, like in their asymptotical limit), simply: OddsP1VsP2 = WinProbabilityP1 / WinProbabilityP2 If you would argue that there is no interaction effect of some players being terrible and thus influence the score more negatively than expected*, or, some players being really good influencing the score more positively than expected**, then it seems logical that you can just take the average probability for each player in each team. * If the combination of 60%,60%,60%,60% is considered better than a team of like 70%,70%,70%,30%, where one bad player would result in worse odds for the team even though the averages are the same. Without additional hypotheses, that particular question is not possible to be addressed. ** Similarly, if 50,50,50,90 is not considered to be equal to 60,60,60,60, then the same applies.
