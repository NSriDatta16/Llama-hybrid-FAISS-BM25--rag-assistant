Ok I found it, you have a rule that does this: a.active { position:relative; } which is giving your active buttons relative positioning. Adding static positioning to li.lp-ask-butn-sm a:hover, li.lp-ask-butn-sm a:focus, li.lp-ask-butn-sm a:active in brant.css helps li.lp-ask-butn-sm a:hover, li.lp-ask-butn-sm a:focus, li.lp-ask-butn-sm a:active { position:static; } However, I'm curious as to what about relative positioning is causing it to shift downwards. Update: according to firebug, the link, and the strong are still in the right position, however it is being rendered lower. This is perplexing. At any rate, the solution I posted slightly about this paragraph solves the problem.
