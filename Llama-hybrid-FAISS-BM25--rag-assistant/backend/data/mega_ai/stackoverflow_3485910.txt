Practically all of the PC/desktop/laptop users have JS enabled. Your current major concern should be the mobile market. This is growing very fast. More than often JS is (by default!) disabled to improve browsing performance. This is however slowly but surely getting a better coverage. Then there are screenreaders and textbased browsers and of course searchbots. Practically none of them supports/uses JS. With regard to searchbots, this can however change in the future. All with all, you should try to use JS only for progressive enhancements. The website should be designed the way that it provides and maintains the same functionality with JS disabled. The best way to achieve this would be building the website without any line of JS code and when you got all the minimum required functionality to function, then add JS for the enhancements like ajax, eye-candiness, user experience and so on. Noted should be that this may of course depend on the target audience of the website in question. Is it a news site? Social networking site? Intranet site? Discussion forum? Etcetera. Stackoverflow for example is unusable on my Blackberry with JS disabled. I can't even login. It is however gracefully displaying a warning bar in top.
