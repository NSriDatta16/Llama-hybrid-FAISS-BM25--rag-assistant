Wow, that is a large offscreen canvas. The storage just for the buffer is about 36MB. I'd be tempted to use smaller offscreen tiles, e.g. 1024x124 and draw the visible ones on your main canvas. To save memory you could only initially create the visible tiles and then generate other ones as they become visible. (And you could dispose of, or even better recycle ones that are no longer visible). I don't believe the answer suggesting that you use putImageData will give better performance, as the experience of the questioner here indicates: why-is-putimagedata-so-slow
