While the Startup folder certainly works, you might encounter problems depending on your configuration when your application requires other items (applications, drivers, hardware, ..) to be started and up and running first. I have developed for devices with a CF storage card where the CF card needed a couple of seconds after bootup to mount and be available, so one can not autostart an application sitting on that CF card immediately after a reset, thus the Startup folder solution failed. In that case you might want to look into the Launchxx entries in the registry that allow you more control about the starting order: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa915408.aspx
