To check the presence or absence of heteroskedasticity you should use not only one test. There are many other tests (e.g. White test, F test etc.) and also use plots to check the gls assumption (e.g. “fitted-values” plot etc.). The accurate and comprehensive analysis contains multiple number of procedures. If at least one test or plot shows that there is the presence of heteroskedasticity, then you should reject the null hypothesis. Particularly, regarding R, you should check the documentation or other sources. E.g.: https://www.statology.org/breusch-pagan-test-r/
