I think the converter is right. A real backslash in text in RTF should be escaped (eg. to \\ ). What you have been given is, I believe, not valid RTF at all. Whist you could try fixing it up by doing a regex replace over the input to double-up any backslashes that were not part of valid control words , this seems very fragile and will go wrong if someone adds a sequence to the text that is a valid control word. The only way to be safe would be to fix whatever is producing the RTF to escape backslashes properly.
