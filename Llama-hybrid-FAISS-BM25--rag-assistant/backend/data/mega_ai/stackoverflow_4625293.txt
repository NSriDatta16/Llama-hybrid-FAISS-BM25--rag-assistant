Do the least surprising thing and return an empty feed - the structure remains the same as with any other RSS feed, but there are no item elements. Bogus feed results that are actually not results are more trouble than they're worth, stemming from the fact that you would be presenting metadata ("n results") as a row of data ("content of result #x"): "you have 1 new item: 'ha ha just kidding, no new items for you'" is confusing both for users and user agents. As for "but users will think it's broken if they don't get any results": if they don't get any meaningful results, they'll think it's broken either way , but getting a "there is 1 message: there is no message" will probably confuse them more. Moreover, it will confuse the user agents (RSS reader programs): most of them keep the old items locally and keep them (unless the user requests to delete the items), so you'd see a list of "item 1,item 2,there are currently no items, item 3, item 4, item 5, item 6, there are currently no items, item 7". Edit: before you take the user to the RSS feed, you could show some sort of preview - e.g. "here's the link to your feed, which currently contains n results". (Of course some users won't read it and complain anyway, but there's only so much we can do about that)
