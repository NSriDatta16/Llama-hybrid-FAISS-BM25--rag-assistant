I'd expect that a sufficiently large convnet could compute any function of the input pixels. Here's an informal "proof": A convolutional layer can pass through all the information in the previous layer, e.g. by using the identity function. Once the information from the original image has been propagated through the convolutional layers to a set of fully-connected layers, we're left with a generic multilayer perceptron, and we can use existing proofs to take us the rest of the way. The convergence guarantees are probably quite weak, for the same reason that they are difficult in the case of other neural networks. I don't see why they should be any weaker than the general case, though.
