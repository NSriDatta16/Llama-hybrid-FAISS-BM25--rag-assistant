Difference between with and without “weight” option of the same data on logistic regression in R

I still keep checking from my previous question here . The next, I tried the case of proportion(=yes/yes+no), using previous best answer. Yes, I got it. But, I couldn’t understand the case without “weight=n”. When estimating as the proportion without “weight=n”, I can’t understand how to estimate deviance(or log-likelihood). please give me some advice. x with “weight = n” modelcp |z|) #(Intercept) -2.0608 1.3486 -1.528 0.126 #x 0.5152 0.3147 1.637 0.102 # Null deviance: 4.2576 on 3 degrees of freedom #Residual deviance: 1.2762 on 2 degrees of freedom deviance(modelcp) #[1] 1.276154 -2*logLik(modelcp) #'log Lik.' 9.096343 (df=2) #-----Using modified method of best answer on my previous question-----# beta without “weight=n” modelcpout |z|) #(Intercept) -2.0608 3.0155 -0.683 0.494 #x 0.5152 0.7038 0.732 0.464 # Null deviance: 0.85152 on 3 degrees of freedom #Residual deviance: 0.25523 on 2 degrees of freedom deviance(modelcpout) #[1] 0.2552307 -2*logLik(modelcpout) #'log Lik.' 3.094208 (df=2) my previous question : Difference between binary and count data of same data on logistic regression in R
