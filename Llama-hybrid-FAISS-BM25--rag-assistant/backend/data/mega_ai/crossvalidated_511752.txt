Expected value of rolling variance/standard deviation of an AR(1) process

Consider a random variable following an AR(1) model: $$x_t = \mu+\rho x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$ Assumme that $\epsilon_t$ follows $N(0,\sigma^2_\epsilon)$ . Now consider the rolling variance and/or standard deviation of this process based on a rolling window of n periods: $$x_n^{var}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{k=0}^n(x_k-\bar{x}_n)^2$$ Where $\bar{x_t}$ also is the rolling average on window of n periods. I am interested in the expected value of $x_t^{var}$ . This is what I have so far. First, use that $x_t$ can be written based on $x_{t-n}$ : $$x_t = \mu \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \rho^i + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \rho^i \epsilon_{t-i} + \rho^n x_{t-n}$$ Then inserting this into $\bar{x}_t$ yields: $$\bar{x}_n=1/n\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(\rho^{n-i}x_{t-n}+\mu\sum_{j=0}^{n-i-1}\rho^j+\sum_{j=0}^{n-i-1}\rho^{j}\epsilon_{t-i-j})$$ $$=1/n(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_{t_n}\rho^{n-i}+ \mu\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{j=0}^{n-i-1}\rho^{j}+\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{j=0}^{n-i-1}\rho^j\epsilon_{t-i-j})$$ Notice, this can also be stated as: $$\bar{x}_n=x_{t-n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\rho^i+\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(\mu(n-i)\rho^i+\epsilon_{t-i}\sum_{j=0}^i\rho^j)$$ Here is, what I have done so far: Find an expression for the inner of the summand of $x^{var}_t$ : $$(x_k-\bar{x}_n)^2 = [x_{t-n}(\rho^k-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\rho^i)+\mu(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\rho^k-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\mu(n-i)\rho^i)+\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\epsilon_{t-k+i+1}\rho^{i}-\sum_{i=1}^{n}\epsilon_{t-i}\sum_{j=0}^i\rho^j]^2$$ Tried to reduce the above Inserted into the summand of $x_{n}^{var}$ Taken expectation However, I have made errors, as I get unreasonable values, e.g. negative variance... :D. Could someone help derive: $$E[x_{n}^{var}]$$ All help is appreciated
