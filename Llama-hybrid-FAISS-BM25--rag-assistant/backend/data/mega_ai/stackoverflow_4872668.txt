Dragging graphics objects on top of bitmaps

I am attempting to drag a shape around a picturebox on the mousemove event but am struggling to get it to move smoothly. The picture box has an image loaded as the background and I would like the graphics object to drag a circle on top of the image when the mouse is clicked and dragged. I have it working by creating a clone of the original image each time the mouse moves and reloading the picture box but it seems like their must be a better way to achieve this. Without reloading the original bitmap each time any graphics added remain on the image creating a trail which is more like a paint application. How do I clear previous drawings without reloading the entire image each time? Any help appreciated. private void picCanvas_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (_drag) { picCanvas.Image = (Bitmap)_original.Clone(); Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage((Bitmap)picCanvas.Image); g.DrawEllipse(_whitePen, e.X, e.Y, 10, 10); picCanvas.Invalidate(); } } private void picCanvas_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { _drag = true; } private void picCanvas_MouseUp(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { _drag = false; }
