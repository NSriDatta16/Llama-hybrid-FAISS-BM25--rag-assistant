Finding average for an array of elements one at a time

I have an array of numbers which are prices of a stock as given below: double[] xyz=new double{ 10.1, 20.34, 35.46, 78.34, 98.67, 43.73 ........} Now, I want to find the average of stock based on time: 1st min = Average(10.1) = 10.1 2nd min = Average(10.1 + 20.34) = 15.22 3rd min = Average(10.1 + 20.34 + 35.46) = 21.96 One way of doing this is to loop minutes times(1,2,3,4...) and find the average. But, as my list is very huge, this can become a performance issue. Is there any other way of finding average each time? Thanks a lot. Mahesh
