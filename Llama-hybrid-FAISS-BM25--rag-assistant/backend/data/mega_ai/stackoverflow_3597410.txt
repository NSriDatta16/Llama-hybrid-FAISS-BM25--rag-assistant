Windows Phone 7: Difficulty with app opening/closing events on emulator

I'm experiencing odd behavior in the wp7 emulator. I have a dead simple app that's mostly directly from the template generated by VS 2010. From App.xaml : Tombstoning code from App.xaml.cs : private void LoadSettings() { IsolatedStorageSettings settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; ICollection getSpots; if (settings.TryGetValue >("spots", out getSpots)) { Spots = getSpots; } if (Spots == null) { Spots = new List (); } } private void SaveSettings() { IsolatedStorageSettings settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; settings["spots"] = Spots; } // Code to execute when the application is launching (eg, from Start) // This code will not execute when the application is reactivated private void Application_Launching(object sender, LaunchingEventArgs e) { LoadSettings(); } // Code to execute when the application is activated (brought to foreground) // This code will not execute when the application is first launched private void Application_Activated(object sender, ActivatedEventArgs e) { LoadSettings(); } // Code to execute when the application is deactivated (sent to background) // This code will not execute when the application is closing private void Application_Deactivated(object sender, DeactivatedEventArgs e) { SaveSettings(); } // Code to execute when the application is closing (eg, user hit Back) // This code will not execute when the application is deactivated private void Application_Closing(object sender, ClosingEventArgs e) { SaveSettings(); } Seems straightforward enough. I set breakpoints in all these methods. When I hit F5 to deploy the app, the event handlers that are hit are: Application_Launching() Application_Deactivated() Oddly, these are hit, even though the emulator doesn't show the app opening or closing. In the emulator, I then open the app, play around, close it, then re-open it. I use both the "back" and "start" buttons to close it. Despite this, I am unable to get any event handlers to be hit again. What am I doing wrong here?
