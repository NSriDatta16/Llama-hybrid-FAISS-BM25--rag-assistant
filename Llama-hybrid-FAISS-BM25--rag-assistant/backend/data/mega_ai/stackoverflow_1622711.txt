Using JQuery on JavaScript variables

$.getJSON('ajax_popup.php', function(data) { var popupDiv = decodeURIComponent(data.data); $('body').append( popupDiv ); }); This piece of code returns element that has other XHTML elements inside. It is returned in JSON format with JQuery. The returned XHTML from data.data is stored into JavaScript variable by first decoding UTF-8 encoded data. The DIV element is a custom popup window. The above code works, BUT I want to make it draggable using JQuery UI's .draggable() method, but I don't know where to use it and how to make it work in this case. I've tried: popupDiv.draggable(); But it didn't work. And: $('body').append( popupDiv ).draggable(); But it made the body element draggable :D
