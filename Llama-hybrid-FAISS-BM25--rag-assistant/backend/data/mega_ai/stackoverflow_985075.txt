You still have errors in your code: you ignore the results of the first search. you call FindFirstFile and handle if it fails. But if it succeeds you do not process already fetched file_data and overwrite it with FindNextFile. You don't close the search handle. Use FindClose for that. From your existing code it seems that fHandle is global - it shouldn't. It would break your recursion. Also I think that you can resolve all the issues in your code by paying more attention to MSDN sample provided in FindFirstFile documentation.
