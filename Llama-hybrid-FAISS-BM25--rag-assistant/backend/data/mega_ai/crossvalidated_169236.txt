You could use a z-score approach. I am assuming that the raw score would look more or less like a normal distribution, once you chop off the users who are always active. Here is what I would do: Delete the top 5% of the users who are always active (It may or may not be 5%; you need to check the distribution to see what percent of the users are always active.) Calculate the mean score for the day Calculate the standard deviation of the score Then get the Z score The Z score would tell you how active the user relative to the mean user on a given day. This way you do not have to worry about the benchmark. Benchmark here is the score of the average user on a given day and this will change on a daily basis. So does your Z score. So you only have to compare the Z scores.
