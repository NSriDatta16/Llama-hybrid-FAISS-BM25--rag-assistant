Catching drag events on a view

I can get button presses etc in Iphone. Is there away to catch drag events? Or do i need to make something custom to handle this? Are there any complications if you have a mainview and inside the main view you have 2 subviews. So basically 3 view on the sceen at once. Can all drag events go to the mainview? Many Thanks, Code
