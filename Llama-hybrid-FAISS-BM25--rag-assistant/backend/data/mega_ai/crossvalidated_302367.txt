You cannot give good guarantees for the runtime. The number of iterations can be very large. So I doubt it qualifies as being "realtime capable". You could try to do some approximations, for example limit the number of iterations. Also pay attention to the much better algorithms for kmeans than the textbook Lloyd's algorithm, which is pretty wasteful. But usually, clustering can be quite unreliable. So I'd be concerned about reliability whenever using it in an automated system.
