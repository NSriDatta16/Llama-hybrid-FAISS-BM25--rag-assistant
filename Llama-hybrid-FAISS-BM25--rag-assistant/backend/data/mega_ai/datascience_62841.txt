If you want to train a model with simulated timeseries data, you first need to obtain the characterstics/properties of your underlying data (your "sample"). Means you have to check /make assumptions about the mean and variance. Remember you use the returns/relative change -- NOT the actual LEVEL INPUT in time series! Why? Cause level time series has "memory" effect - this means you will get correlations even if you are comparing 2 time series that are drawn from two independent and random distributions. This "mistake" is often called in statistics "spurious regression". Check for more details/examples. However as mentioned before you can use: (G)ARCH /ARMA -- Python implementation here Maybe check first if your data follows such a process or: Simulate data using Monte Carlo Simulation -- Python implementation here
