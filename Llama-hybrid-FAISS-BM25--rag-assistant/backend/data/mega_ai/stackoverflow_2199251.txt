What's the point of "typedef sometype sometype"?

Lately I've run into the following construction in the code: typedef sometype sometype; Pay attention please that "sometype" stands for absolutely the same type without any additions like "struct" etc. I wonder what it can be useful for? UPD: This works only for user defined types. UPD2: The actual code was in a template context like this: template struct E { typedef T T; ... }
