Putting the poor DB design aside, if no users are reporting slow response times then you don't currently have a performance problem. If you do have a performance problem: 1) Check for fragmentation ( dbcc showcontig ) 2) Check the hardware specs, RAID/drive/file placement. Check the SQL server error logs. If hardware seems underspecified or poorly designed, run Performance counters (see PAL tool) 3) Gather trace data during a normal query work load and identify expensive queries (see this SO answer: How Can I Log and Find the Most Expensive Queries? )
