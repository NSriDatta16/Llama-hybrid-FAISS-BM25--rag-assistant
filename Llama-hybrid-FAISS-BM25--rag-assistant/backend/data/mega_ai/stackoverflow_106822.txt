In order: No, it's usually best to include them in a seperate project; unless you want to be able to run diagnostics at runtime. The ideal is 100% code coverage, which means every line of code in every routine in every class. I go with ClassnameTest, ClassnameTest.MethodNameTestnumber Everything. I'd say yes, as integration tests don't need to be run if unit tests fail. Simple properties that just set and get a field don't need to be tested.
