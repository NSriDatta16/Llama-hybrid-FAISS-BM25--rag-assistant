Why is power analysis with logistic regression so liberal compared to chi squared?

I'm conducting a power analysis to derive the required sample size for a study - basically compared exposed / non-exposed with 30-day mortality as outcome. I'll check for crude mortality rates with chi-square, but also use logistic regression with probable confounders. When I run a power analysis - power 0.8, significance level 0.05, effect size 0.15 and estimated 10 confounders I get that I'd need only n=117 which seem quite small. comparing with chi-square - it suggest that I'd need 350. I'm using R and pwr : pwr.f2.test(u=10, v=NULL, f2=0.15, sig.level=0.05, power=0.8) pwr.chisq.test(w=0.15, N=NULL, df=1 , sig.level=0.05, power=0.8 ) Is this predictable or am I misusing this?
