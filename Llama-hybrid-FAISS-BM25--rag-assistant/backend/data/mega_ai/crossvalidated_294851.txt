Any time you have the true/generative model having some sort of curvature in your predictor space (e.g. $x_i^2$ or interactions of the form $x_i\times x_j$) you cannot capture/approximate this behavior with a single split in a single decision tree. Allowing for multiple splits on the same feature allows the decision tree to approximate the curvatures inherent in the feature space. In machine learning learning the basis of the feature space is often referred to as the kernel method .
