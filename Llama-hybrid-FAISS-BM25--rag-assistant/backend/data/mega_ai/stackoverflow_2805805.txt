Time series in Python up to microseconds

I would like to handle time series in Python. It has been suggested to me that I use scikit.timeseries but I need to handle up to microseconds and this last, as far as I know, handles up to milliseconds. Do you know any other library able to do that? At some point I need to merge 2 time series sampled at different times, and I would like to avoid rewriting such features or any new classes from scratch whenever it is possible.
