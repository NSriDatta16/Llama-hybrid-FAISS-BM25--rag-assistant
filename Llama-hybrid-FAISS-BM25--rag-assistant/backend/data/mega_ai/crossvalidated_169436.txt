How LDA, a classification technique, also serves as dimensionality reduction technique like PCA

In this article , the author links linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to principal component analysis (PCA). With my limited knowledge, I am not able to follow how LDA can be somewhat similar to PCA. I have always thought that LDA was a form of classification algorithm, similar to logistic regression. I will appreciate some help in understanding how LDA is similar to PCA, i.e how is it a dimensionality reduction technique.
