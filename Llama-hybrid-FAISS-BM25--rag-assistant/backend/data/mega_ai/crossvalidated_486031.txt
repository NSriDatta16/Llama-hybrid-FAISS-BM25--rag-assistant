How can an ROC AUC and its 95%CI be estimated from repeated crossvalidation?

I'm using repeated 100 times 10-fold cross-validation to provide internal validation of a logistic regression model. What is the best way to obtain the ROC AUC and it's 95% CI from this data. If I calculate the ROC AUC of each repetition (100 groups) and then calculate the median, 95% CI from this the variance will be much lower than if I calculate it from each fold (1000 groups). The histogram of the folds from a sample dataset in R (etitanic) looks much more normally distributed for the folds than the repeats. Thank you for your advice.
