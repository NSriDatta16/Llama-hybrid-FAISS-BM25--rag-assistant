I've voted up some answers above, but note also that the Lisp class of languages actually in some ways encourage the programmer to effectively make a new language feature whenever needed, creating a new dialect of lisp. You can argue the toss about what the difference is between creating a new function of your own and creating a new language feature, but that is the claim of Lispers.
