Market share based on comparison of competitors' average sales

I want to determine the amount of food stamp fraud a retailer perpetrated based on food stamp sales in other stores. The retailer had both legitimate food stamps sales, and illegitimate sales. The illegitimate sales consisted of food stamps used to buy ineligible items or whee food stamps were illegally redeemed for cash. I know the total amount of food stamps sales, but that figure reflects the total of all legitimate and illegitimate sales. Can an average of food stamp sales from other stores be compared to the retailer in a way that is statistically accurate? If so how big must that sample of other stores be? Thanks, John
