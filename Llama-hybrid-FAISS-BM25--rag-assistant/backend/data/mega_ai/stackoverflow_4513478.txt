An FK should only also be a PK if the two tables have a one-to-one relationship and the second table was added because the first was too wide and these were items not always needed in most queries. It will not work at all if you have a one-to-many relationship or a many-to-many relationship. FKs are much more often not also the PK. If I havea person table and a related address table, If I make the PK and the FK the same thing, then I can only store one address, but most address tables allow for mulitple addresses for the same person or organization. IN that case you would have and AddressID as the PK and a person_id as the FK to the person table. This is the most common PK/FK scenario.
