Calculate bootstrapped confidence intervals for c-statistics in a logistic regression using DescTools::Cstat

A reviewer requested that we provide uncertainty measure of our c-statistics, and I guess 95% confidence interval is a good answer. I checked the manual of DescTools::Cstat() , and it says: Confidence intervals for this measure can be calculated by bootstrap. However, I can't find any example of calculating bootstrapped CI for c-statistics online. Can anybody provide an example of doing that in R. Here is a replicable example of conducting logistic regression in R: d = mtcars d$y = ifelse(mtcars$mpg >= 20, 1, 0) fit = glm(y ~ gear + carb, data = d, family = "binomial") DescTools::Cstat(fit) # [1] 0.9430894 Thank you!
