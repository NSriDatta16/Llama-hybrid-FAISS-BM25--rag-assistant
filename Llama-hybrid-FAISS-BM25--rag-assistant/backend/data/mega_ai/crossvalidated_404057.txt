Setting an upper limit on an estimate

I have used MCMC to estimate the value of a parameter $\theta$ from some data. I have thousands of samples from the (marginal) posterior distribution. The distribution of $\theta$ is roughly Normally distributed around zero. I can calculate the mean/median/standard deviations/quantiles/etc., no problem. What I am wondering is: how to calculate an upper bound on $|\theta|$ ? (Perhaps for a given confidence level?)
