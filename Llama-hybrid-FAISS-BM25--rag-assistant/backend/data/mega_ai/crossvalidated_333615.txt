physical significance of latent variables in machine learning

Just curious to know the meaning contained in the latent variables used in the machine learning applications ? Basically, I am confused if latent variables present the same essence as the model parameters ? In Parameters vs latent variables , @alberto suggested that parameters are fixed while latent variables are essentially random variables that are not observed directly. My point is that even a parameter is a random variable (its just that we do not know the value of this parameter). Surely, we know the distribution that it is coming from and using this distribution as a prior information, we try to estimate the value that fits the training data well. Am I going well with this concept ?
