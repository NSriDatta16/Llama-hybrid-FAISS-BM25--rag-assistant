You don't need a Web Service to send emails. If you really want to use a web service, I would think you would actually create the web service on a server that will listen for message from the client. You could setup the windows form application with a WCF client and setup a WCF server to receive messages, but I think this is overkill. I personally would use the log4net framework and configure an SmtpAppender to send emails when you log an error. It's really elegant when you get the hang of it.
