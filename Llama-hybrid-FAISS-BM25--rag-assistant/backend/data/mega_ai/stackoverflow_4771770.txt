rewriting an iOS app to work on both iOS and Mac-- how to organize controller code?

I have an iOS app that I am rewriting to work on both Mac and iOS. I have my views working reasonably well, but everything is static at the moment. What do I typically do with my view controller code? In the iOS-only app, it is typically a bunch of stuff that says things like "if the user touches here, do that." I've found the hitTest: method. So I'm pretty sure I can write everything so it works. I guess my question is more organizational. Ideally, I would want to set things up so that the code that is currently in UIViewController subclasses would work on both platforms.
