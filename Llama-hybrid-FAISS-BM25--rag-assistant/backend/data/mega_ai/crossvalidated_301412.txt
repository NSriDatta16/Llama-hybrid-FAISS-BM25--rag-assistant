How to apply SVM model to new data using libsvm in MATLAB?

Suppose that I have trained and tested an SVM classifier with the following code: load('Model and Optimized SVM Parameters1.mat'); TrainData = double(model.Train(:,1:end-1)); TargetTrain = double(model.Train(:,end)); TestData = double(model.Test(:,1:end-1)); TargetTest = double(model.Test(:,end)); option = ['-h 0 -s 0 -t 2 -q -c ',num2str(20.6062),' -g ',num2str(0.2331)] ; MODEL = svmtrain ( TargetTrain , TrainData , option ) ; [OutputTest , ClassificationAccuracy , dec_values] = svmpredict ( TargetTest , TestData , MODEL ) ; Now I have a dataset X as the same format as TrainData or TestData which has no label and I want to classify the entries of X with the classifier that is described in MODEL . Something like: OutputLabel = svmpredict ( X, MODEL ) ; but seems that svmpredict always takes the desired label as an argument ( here ) How should I use the classifier described in MODEL for classifying a dataset (for example an Image ) while I have no label for the data?
