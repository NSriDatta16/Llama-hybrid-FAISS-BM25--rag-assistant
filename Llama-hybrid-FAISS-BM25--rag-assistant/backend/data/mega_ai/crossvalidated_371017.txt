There are many possibilities here. I think using an exponential distribution with a tunable average would be a good solution. If you are into theoretical explanations, here is why I think it would be: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_entropy_probability_distribution#Positive_and_specified_mean:_the_exponential_distribution Here is how it works in practise. Your function would be $$ f(x) = C e^{-x/\mu} $$ where $C$ is the normalisation, so that the sum over all possible values of x is 1. Your level is the $\mu$ parameter in the function, which tunes the function from uniform to L-shaped. Let's look at some examples with 4 choices. For $\mu = 0.1$ , you would get the following probabilities: [0.99, 4.5e-05, 2.06e-09, 9.35e-14] which are very concentrated on the first value. For $\mu = 100$ , you would get almost the uniform case: [0.253, 0.251, 0.248, 0.246]
