What fraction of a parent’s genes exist in total across n offspring?

This problem has perplexed me for a long time, and I would love to learn how to solve it. Each parent contributes, on average, half of the genetic material of each child. If a parent has $n$ children, what percentage of the parent’s genes exist in total across all $n$ offspring? How can one generalize the solution to #1, to make it applicable to more distant relationships like uncles & aunts, grandparents, and cousins, where the fraction of shared genes is smaller? For the purposes of these questions, disregard the complexities of chromosomes, meiosis, and fertilization, and just assume that genes are chosen from each parent independently and at random.
