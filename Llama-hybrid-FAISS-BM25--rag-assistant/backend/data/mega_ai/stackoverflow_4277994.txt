Short version: you won't be able to, nor should you. Long version: It may be possible, if you do some user-agent sniffing, to identify whether or not the user's browser supports HTML5 or not. But this would take a fair amount of effort to get right. The better solution is to use something like Modernizr (http://www.modernizr.com/) to do your feature detection on the client-side.
