Now first to ask is what is the right syntax to declare a date column. From the SQLite Data Types documentation : 1.2 Date and Time Datatype SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times. Instead, the built-in Date And Time Functions of SQLite are capable of storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values: TEXT as ISO8601 strings ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS"). REAL as Julian day numbers, the number of days since noon in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C. according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar. INTEGER as Unix Time, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. Applications can chose to store dates and times in any of these formats and freely convert between formats using the built-in date and time functions. Take your pick. I'd go for TEXT or INTEGER. The INTEGER will be faster. If you need to store dates past 1970 (e.g. birthdates, etc), then I'd go for TEXT. If you just need to store creationtime/modificationtime, etc for now and the future, then go for INTEGER. The second i want to know is how to insert date in it after that. Use PreparedStatement#setString() or #setLong() respectively. And the third thing i want to know is how to select dates between, for example to select all rows which contain date between 01/05/2010 and 05/06/2010. Use the standard SQL BETWEEN clause for this. You first need to convert the date accordingly using the built-in date and time functions .
