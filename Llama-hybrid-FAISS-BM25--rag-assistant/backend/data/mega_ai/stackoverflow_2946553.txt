Padding List Items?

I have a list where i basically need a hierarchy of items. Any children of an item would be padded slightly, as to easily distinguish their parent item. How could this be achieved? Note that i could, if needed, make each parent show no children, and then when the parent is clicked, a new list containing all of it's children is loaded. This however requires more clicking to display information than i would prefer. Also, the items themselves will contain graphics and whatnot (to show a drag'n'drop button, etc), so it would be best if it visually appeared as if the item itself had a margin, rather than the contents of the item being padded. Thanks to any replies!
