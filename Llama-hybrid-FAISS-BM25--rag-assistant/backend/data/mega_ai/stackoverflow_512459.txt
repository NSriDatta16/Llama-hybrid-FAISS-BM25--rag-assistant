Check in early and often, just like voting. One caveat on that is it makes a little bit of a difference how your integration process works. If you have continuous integration, you don't want to check things back into the trunk unless you've run unit tests and feel confident it'll work. The way to reconcile these two things is to create a branch for your workspace, check in often on the branch, and merge back when you've made and tested changes. The annoyances of making big merges over many changes will encourage you to break them down into small steps. Which is a Good Thing.
