Is true, iPhone SDK 3.0 and up, don't pass touches to -touchesBegan: and - touchesEnded: ** UIScrollview **subclass methods anymore. You can use the touchesShouldBegin and touchesShouldCancelInContentView methods that is not the same. If you really want to get this touches, have one hack that allow this. In your subclass of UIScrollView override the hitTest method like this: - (UIView *)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UIView *result = nil; for (UIView *child in self.subviews) if ([child pointInside:point withEvent:event]) if ((result = [child hitTest:point withEvent:event]) != nil) break; return result; } This will pass to you subclass this touches, however you can't cancel the touches to UIScrollView super class.
