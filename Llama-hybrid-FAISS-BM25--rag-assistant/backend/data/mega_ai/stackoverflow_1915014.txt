NetConnection.connect( null ) is used to play progressive video and has nothing to do with whether the (video)file's hosted locally or remotely. If you would want to play streaming video, you'd pass in the host url of the streaming service. And yes, if you use a relative URL the port is dropped. I suppose some kind of 'translation' from relative to absolute is done, using the location of the embedding html file, which wouldn't be containing the port number, I think? Have you tried passing the absolute url (with port number) as the 'base' parameter to the .swf?
