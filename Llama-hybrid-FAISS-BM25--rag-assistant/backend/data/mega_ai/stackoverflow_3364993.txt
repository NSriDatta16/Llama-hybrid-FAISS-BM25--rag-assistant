Could be some wrong dependencies added in my pom.xml ? It could be. You should certainly have a JTDS dependency declared there, if you don't already. As for the missing classes, are you expecting the net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver to be in your JAR? If so, you're mistaken, this should be in the JTDS JAR which you obtain separately. In any case, you can take the test step out of the equation. Start with a clean directory, and just run mvn compile . Then have a look at the target/classes directory to see which classes have been compiled there. If classes are missing at this step, then they're not being found by Maven. Are they in the src/main/java folder (or target/generated-sources for generated classes)? Does your pom override the default pattern matching for the compile phase? You haven't really given much information, so I can't say more than to go through the process one step at a time, looking at the result each step of the way. Often one focuses on the wrong area initially, and a simple attention shift can be all that is needed to find a problem that is clear in retrospect.
