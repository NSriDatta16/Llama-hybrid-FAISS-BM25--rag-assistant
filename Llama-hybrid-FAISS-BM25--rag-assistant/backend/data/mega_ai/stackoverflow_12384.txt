If you are using a maintenance plan you'd probably be better off use the check database integrity task. If you really want to run you own maintenance written in t-sql then run it using a step in a job, not in a maintenance plan and the code above will work ok. Like Stu said the GO statement is client directive not a sql keyword and only seems to be respected by isql, wsql, osql, etc, clients and the sql agent. I think it works in DTS packages. Obviously, not in DTSX, though.
