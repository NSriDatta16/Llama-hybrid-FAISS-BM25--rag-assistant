Is there any way to set a cookie and just use it purely as a bucket for storing some data and never send that data to the server? No. You'll need to look into a plugin that provides dedicated offline storage facility, or use the HTML5 storage API and tell everyone to upgrade their browsers If you decide to go the plugin route, as far as I am aware you have 3 options: Google Gears Flash - it has an offline storage facility - you could write a small flash app to store things using this facility, then interop with it from javascript. Silverlight also has offline storage - as with flash you could write a small app to do the storage, then interop with it from javascript. I'd probably look into using flash first, as everyone already has it. Development would likely be a lot easier if you were to use silverlight. It's not as widely installed, but it is spreading pretty rapidly. Last I heard* something like 30% of browsers had it installed which is pretty impressive. Google gears would unfortunately be a distant third. People are going to be installing flash and silverlight for other reasons, but nobody has gears. *This is an entirely unsubstantiated quote, but does seem to fit with what I've seen on various people's computers, etc.
