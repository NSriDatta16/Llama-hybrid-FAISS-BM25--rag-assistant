I tried it out 5-6 weeks ago and it seemed solid but didn't have all of TortoiseSVN's features, and the interface had some inconsistencies. It has a timeline which was very useful organization of the history. I see they've reached version 1.0 in the last week and the changes seem to cover all the things that I thought were missing. It will be worthwhile to check it out.
