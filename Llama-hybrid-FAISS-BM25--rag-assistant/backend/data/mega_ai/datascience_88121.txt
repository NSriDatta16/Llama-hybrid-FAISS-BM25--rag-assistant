Impute missing values in feature column on the basis of Target column

I am working on a toy project for insurance claim prediction. In the input data for one of the feature (numeric data type) half of the values are missing. My target variable is binary which indicates if a claim was filed or not. To begin with, I imputed missing values with Mean value of feature column and then with Median value. My classification models (Logistic Regression and SVC) gave almost the same prediction metrics (accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score) for these two imputations strategies. The third strategy that I tried involved imputing the missing values with the Mean value of each of the two categories of the target variable. dataframe['Feature'] = dataframe['Feature'].fillna(dataframe.groupby('Target Feature')['Feature'].transform('mean')) After this step, the prediction metrics of my models increased considerably (5-6%). Now I am wondering if this step is correct or if the model is overfitting the data. Below are the metrics details: Strategy: Replace Missing Values with Mean Value Model: Logistic Regression Accuracy:88.47% Precision:86.87% Recall:88.47% F1 Score:87.67% Model: Support Vector Classifier Accuracy:90.66% Precision:91.46% Recall:88.94% F1 Score:90.18% Strategy: Replace Missing Values with Mean Value of the target feature categories Model: Logistic Regression Accuracy:96.44% Precision:95.06% Recall:97.69% F1 Score:96.36% Model: Support Vector Classifier Accuracy:96.88% Precision:97.20% Recall:96.31% F1 Score:96.75%
