NHibernate: Select entire entity plus aggregate columns

I want to return an entire entity, along with some aggregate columns. In SQL I would use an inner select, something like this: SELECT TOP 10 f.*, inner_query.[average xxx] FROM ( SELECT f.Id, AVG(fb.xxx) AS [average xxx] FROM foobar fb INNER JOIN foo f ON f.FoobarId = fb.Id ) AS inner_query INNER JOIN foo f ON f.Id = inner_query.Id Is this possible with CreateCriteria?
