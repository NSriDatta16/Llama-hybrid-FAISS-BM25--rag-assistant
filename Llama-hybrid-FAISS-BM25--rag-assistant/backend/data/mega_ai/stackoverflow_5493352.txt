I use Django with Couchdb in production. We have Django under Apache, but using Couchdb doesn't affect what Django runs under. In Django, you would just use a library to talk to Couchdb. Couch uses http as the protocol the library uses to talk to the db. By default, Couch listens only on localhost. Couchapp can serve up pages, but I find the way Django does it to be more elegant. It seems to only be appropriate for mostly static pages and sites.
