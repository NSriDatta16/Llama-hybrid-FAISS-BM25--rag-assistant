Tiling in Google Tile Server (x, y and z parameter)

I am working on Google Tile Server. I have written one WCF Service (C#) which fetches tile from Google server using http URL :- http://mt1.google.com/vt/lyrs=m@129&hl=en&x=1&y=0&z=1&s=Galileo As you know, Google Tile requires three variable parameters x, y and z in it's URL to provide a tile. Other co-ordinates can be seen here . I am very much successful in fetching the Google Tile (Map) one by one (means putting different values of x, y and z). Now coming to real world scenario, I tried developing one WinForm (C#) application to display those tiles. I am able to display one-one tiles. But my problem is.. How to provide complete set of maps (different tiles stitched together)? I know, I can provide multiple calls to Google Tile Server with different parameters but I needed to know what could be the appropriate value of x, y & z in different conditions and continuous relation to that Is there any calculation, formula or mapping which links screen coordinate to Google Tile Server coordinates (means x, y & z values)? I have to provide smooth zooming and panning on dragging and double click .. same as Google provides. My basic concern is relation between Google's x, y, z and my screen coordinates. Any help (or samples) will be highly appreciated.
