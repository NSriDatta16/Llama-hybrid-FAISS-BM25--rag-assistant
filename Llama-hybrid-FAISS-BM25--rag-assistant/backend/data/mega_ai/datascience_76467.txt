Should augmentation also be performed on the validation set when the dataset is imbalanced?

I am training a CNN on images (2 classes) and I have an imbalanced dataset (1:7 ratio). I am trying to tackle this by performing offline image augmentation. Should I perform augmentation also on the validation set or is it ok if the validation set remains imbalanced?
