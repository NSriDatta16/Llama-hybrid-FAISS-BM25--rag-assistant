How to normalize gps coordinates for deep learning

I am working on a project where I have to build a deep-learning model that classifies the kind of stop a vehicle at. My dataset consists of some vehicle related data such as vehicle Id, type of vehicle and so on, and GPS related data like longitude and latitude of the vehicle along the route, standard deviation and duration. As an initial step, I'm trying to build a model that takes all the input I have for the moment without any feature engineering. I have read that the model will converge faster if I feed normalized data to it. However, I've seen some models that are not using the normalized data (such as the famous house price prediction model). So my question is, How should I normalize coordinates!?
