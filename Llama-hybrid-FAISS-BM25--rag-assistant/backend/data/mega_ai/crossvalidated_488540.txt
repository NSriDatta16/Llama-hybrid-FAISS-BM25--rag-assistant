Interpreting dichotomous independent variable in two-way fixed effects models

Good evening, Apologies if the question has been answered, but I did search through the archive and did not find something similar to my question. I am curious if I am interpreting a categorical variable. In my data, I have two categorical variables that varies between 0 and 1 in each panel and indicates "1" when there's a trade agreement from the exporter or importer in place between two countries in some years and "0" when there is not in other years. | year | ExpAg | ImpAg | pair | Value26 | |------|---------|---------|------|----------| | 1995 | 0 | 0 | 1734 | 0 | | 1996 | 0 | 0 | 1734 | 0 | | 1997 | 0 | 0 | 1734 | 0 | | 1998 | 0 | 0 | 1734 | 0 | | 1999 | 0 | 0 | 1734 | 2.011 | | 2000 | 1 | 0 | 1734 | 0 | | 2001 | 1 | 0 | 1734 | 1.058 | | 2002 | 1 | 0 | 1734 | 0 | | 2003 | 1 | 0 | 1734 | 0 | | 2004 | 1 | 0 | 1734 | 0 | | 2005 | 1 | 0 | 1734 | 0 | | 2006 | 1 | 0 | 1734 | 0 | | 2007 | 1 | 0 | 1734 | 0 | | 2008 | 1 | 0 | 1734 | 0 | | 2009 | 1 | 1 | 1734 | 0 | | 2010 | 1 | 1 | 1734 | 0 | | 2011 | 1 | 1 | 1734 | 0 | | 2012 | 1 | 1 | 1734 | 156.2506 | | 2013 | 1 | 1 | 1734 | 365.49 | | 2014 | 1 | 1 | 1734 | 330.2503 | | 2015 | 1 | 1 | 1734 | 66.946 | | 2016 | 1 | 1 | 1734 | 326.022 | | 2017 | 1 | 1 | 1734 | 0 | | 2018 | 1 | 1 | 1734 | 238.726 | I am curious as to how I interpret the coefficients in a two-way fixed effects model. I was taught that in time series cross-sectional data, the interpretation of the coefficients is that when X varies across time by one unit, Y increases or decreases" some value of the coefficient. How would I interpret the categorical variable since it might have 4 or 5 years as 0, then change to 1 for the remainder of the years of the panel? Do I ignore the "across time" aspect?
