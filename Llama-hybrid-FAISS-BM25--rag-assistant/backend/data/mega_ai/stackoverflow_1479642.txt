How do you organize your servers for web development?

I am setting up some servers for website development. I want it to be organized in a fairly standard way. How do you organize your servers for development of relatively small websites, each with a little bit of unique code? Some details I am concerned about include (but not limited to): What distinct servers exist with respect to the development process? What is their purpose? Where is your master source repository? Where is development work done? Where is testing done?
