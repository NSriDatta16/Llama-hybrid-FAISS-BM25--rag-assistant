Weights in IPSW (inverse propensity score weighting) too high?

I used a logistic regression on a variable indicating whether a person of an address-dataset took part in a survey (1), or not (0). I extracted the probabilities of each person to participate and calculated the inverse-probability (hence the name of the weighting method - inverse propensity score weighting). What irritates me, is, that my smallest survey-weight is 1.901. I expected the smallest survey weight to at least be below "1". I hope somebody can help me and either find out where i made a mistake, or assure me, that iÂ´m on the right track. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you! #Calculate logistic regression glm2
