Do you know how many bytes per second you are recieving, the average time between packets compares, and the maximum time between packets? If not, can you add code to calculate it? You need to be averaging 8000 samples/second * 2 bytes/sample = 16,000 bytes per second in order to keep the stream filled. A gap of more than 2048 bytes / (16000 bytes/second) = 128 milliseconds between incoming packets will cause your stream to run dry and the audio to stutter. One way to prevent it is to increase the buffer size (PLAYER_CAPACITY). A larger buffer will be more able to handle variation in the incoming packet size and rate. The cost of the extra stability is a larger delay in starting playback while you wait for the buffer to initially fill.
