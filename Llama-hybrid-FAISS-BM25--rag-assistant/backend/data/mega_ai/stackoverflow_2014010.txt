Step 1 - find the demo applets supplied by Sun. http://java.sun.com/applets/jdk/ Step 2 - read those demo applets. At least three. Preferably all of them. One you've read several applets, you should see a little more clearly how to organize programs. You can then ask questions with a lot more focus pointing to specific applet examples and your specific programming problem.
