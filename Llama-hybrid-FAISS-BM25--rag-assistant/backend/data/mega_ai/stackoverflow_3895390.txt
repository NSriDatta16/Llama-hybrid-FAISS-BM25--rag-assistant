Will it be more cost efficient to use DSP/FPGA, instead of x86, to add simple watermark on JPEG/GIF/... files?

My current project is to add simple logo and some sentences on the given graphic files. Each file is less than 500k on average. I am going to put the service online. So it should be able to handle 50requests per second. Our current budget is limited. Any suggestion?
