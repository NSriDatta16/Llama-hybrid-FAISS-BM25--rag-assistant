The best way to avoid such a mess when you were given a chance to restart is: Use the Spring Framework throughout. Pay attention to high-cohesion, low coupling: make sure there are no circular dependencies between package (com.myapp.packageA depends on com.myapp.packageB which depends on com.myapp.packageA). There are some great free tools like Architecture Rules that can verify that for you automatically. With these two rules you'll already be forced to follow sound good design principles. Otherwise, design needs constant attention. The point of any design effort is to reduce uncertainty, so you basically have to know why you're designing in the first place.
