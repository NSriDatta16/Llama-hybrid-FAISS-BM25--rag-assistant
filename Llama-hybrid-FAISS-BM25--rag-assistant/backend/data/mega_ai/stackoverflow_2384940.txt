My WebCore project has a bit of middleware that logs the entire WSGI environment (thus Beaker sessions, headers, etc.) for the incoming request, headers for outbound responses, as well as performance information to a MongoDB database. Average overhead is around 4ms. The module has been removed from the core package, but hasnâ€™t yet been integrated into its own. The current version as of this answer is available in the Git history: http://github.com/GothAlice/WebCore/blob/cd1d6dcbd081323869968c51a78eceb1a32007d8/web/extras/cprofile.py
