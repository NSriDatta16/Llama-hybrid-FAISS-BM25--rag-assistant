You can definitely retrieve the HTML content of the page using RCurl and parse them using RXML as suggested by Btibert3. The only issue you might face is that Google won't allow you to do queries in a "robotic" way. After something like 200 queries in Google in a short period of time, it won't return results anymore. Maybe that's different with Google Scholar, but I doubt so...
