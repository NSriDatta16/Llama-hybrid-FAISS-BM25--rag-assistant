I am not really sure, if I got your right...... Just to have a specification, you have: income of the poor, given in "normal" (not percentage) values for 6 years average income, given in "normal" (not percentage) values for 6 years so with this, you have calculated: y = average annual growth of income of the poor x = average annual growth of income So y and x are univariate? Like y x value 1 value 1 value 2 value 2 Did you use the geometric or arithmetic mean? I would suggest using the geometric, look at a simple example for this (consider this to be e.g. income values): 40000, 42000, 45000 and 47000 This gives the percentage values: 0.05, 0.07143, 0.0444 the geometric mean is: $(1.05 * 1.07142857 * 1.04444)^{(1/3)}= 1.0552257$ This is a factor, whereas 0.0552257 is percent i.e. each year, the income increases by 5.52257 percent on average: 40000*1.0552257=42209.028 42209.028*1.0552257=44540.05112 44540.05112*1.0552257=46999.8 (difference due to unprecisely rounding) So this is not percentage point? Or what did you mean? Percentage point is: If the annual growth rate of 5% increased to 7%, this is an increase of 2 percentage point or an increase by 40 percent ! So you have now the geometric annual growth rate of the income in percent (let's say you use the percent value and not the factor value) and the geometric annual growth rate of the income of the poor, right? If you use the values as following: y x 5.5 4.5 6.5 5.5 and so on and not y x 0.055 0.045 and so on Now, you do the regression of y,x and you have a regression coeff of e.g. 0.7. This means, if you increase x by one unit the variable y will increase by 0.7 on average. So if the annual growth rate of the income is increased by one unit, e.g. from 5 to 6, the y variable will increase by 0.7. So if the annual growth rate of the income is increased from 5% to 6%, the y variable will increase by 0.7% (on average). Did you mean this? Depending on log on one side or taking log-log on both side, the interpretation changes. This basically depends on the dependence of your data. If you take the x as log values, this gives not a linear dependence anymore, but a logarithmic dependence. You have to do model identification to see, what would be appropriate. Plot y and x in a scatter plot, is it a linear dependency or logarithmic? In case of the interpretation look at this thread: In linear regression, when is it appropriate to use the log of an independent variable instead of the actual values? , especially the second answer with 17 thumps up.
