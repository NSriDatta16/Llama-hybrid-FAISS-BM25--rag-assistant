With any new technology there is a substantial learning curve at first, and some have a higher learning curve then others. I think you will see as you gain more experience that these things become substantially easier. C# has a lot of power with the .Net architecture to leverage from, but a lot of it takes time to really appreciate. C# is also changing and growing to allow for new coding styles (newer versions incorporate a lot of influences from functional programming) that keep it both in vogue and powerful. Stick with it and keep learning.
