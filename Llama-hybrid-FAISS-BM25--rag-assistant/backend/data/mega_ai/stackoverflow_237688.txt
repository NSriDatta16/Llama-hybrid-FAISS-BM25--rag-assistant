Some thoughts: Do your best to validate user input immediately. Check for errors or exceptions as early and as often as possible. It's easier to trace and fix a problem just after it occurs, before it generates "ricochet" effects. Whenever possible, describe how to correct the problem in your error message. The user isn't interested in what went wrong, only how to continue working: BAD: Floating-point exception in vogon.c, line 42 BETTER: Please enter a dollar amount greater than 0. If you can't suggest a correction for the problem, tell the user what to do (or not to do) before calling tech support, such as: "Click Help->About to find the version/license number," or "Please leave this error message on the screen." Talk to your support staff. Ask about common problems and pet peeves. Have them answer this question! If you have a web site with a support section, provide a hyperlink or URL in the error message. Indicate whether the error is due to a temporary or permanent condition, so the user will know whether to try again. Put your cell phone number in every error message, and identify yourself as the developer. Ok, the last item probably isn't practical, but wouldn't it encourage better coding practices?
