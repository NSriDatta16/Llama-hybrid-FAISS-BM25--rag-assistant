If you want to use RNNs, just modify the architecture a bit: plug the time series into a few layers of LSTMs or whatever you'd like to use, and then concatenate the resulting hidden states and the discrete features you have into a softmax layer that produces predictions. So, your computational graph would look like this: Alternatively, there is no rule saying you can't include those constant features as input to the RNN.
