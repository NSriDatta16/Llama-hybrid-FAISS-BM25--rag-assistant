ruby noob: are hashes speedy and optimal for storage or should I make a tuple?

This is a pretty simple problem im working on in Ruby, but im a total noob so I want to learn the most correct solution. I have a list of data with a name and a value. I need to remember all those (obvious answer: hash). But, i also need to remember the order of this data. SO it looks like: x=1 y=2 z=3 I was thinking about making an array of 1 element hashes: [0 => {'x' => 1}, 1 => {'y' => 2}, 2 => {'z' => 3}] Are hashes the best choice in this situation? Is there some reason they would be slow, or not optimal?
