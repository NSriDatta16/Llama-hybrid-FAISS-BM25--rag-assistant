Strange outcomes in binary logistic regression in SPSS

I did a binary logistic regression with SPSS 23 and I found some strange outcomes. This is for NOACprev until No_Prev_treatment, the last 6 variables. First of all they have very high outcomes for B, the S.E. is extremely high, the Wald is 0 and there is no 95% C.I. Does anyone know what has gone wrong?
