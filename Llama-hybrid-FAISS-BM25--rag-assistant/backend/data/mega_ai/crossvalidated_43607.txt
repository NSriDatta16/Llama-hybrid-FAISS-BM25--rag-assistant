In a word yes. In a Bayesian framework, a good feature (or feature set) $X$ is one where $P(Y | X )$ depends significantly on the specific value of $X$ observed; which can be reasonably interpreted as the variables being correlated. One way to quantify this is in terms of the relative entropy between the distributions.
