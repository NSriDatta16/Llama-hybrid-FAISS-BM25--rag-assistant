SAP Portal vs an ASP.NET Portal ... proof of concept?

We have an SAP portal, which is not user friendly from clients point of view, we as ASP.NET developers suggest to use ASP.NET as a presentation layer for SAP backend system instead of SAP portal. We already integrated successfully to SAP backend for data insert and retrieval. So, we need to show ASP.NET power to SAP Team! How an ASP.NET portal will be much better than SAP portal. We though of AJAX functionality, look & feel of UI, and application mobility (cross browser). So, what are the pros and cons of an ASP.NET portal compared to SAP portal? What are the issues SAP portal has, ASP.NET doesn't? Briefly, how to convince decision makers of ASP.NET over SAP from UI/Performance points of view?
