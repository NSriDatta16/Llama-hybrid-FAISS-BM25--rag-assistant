I was in a similar boat, having been a Math/CS double major but needing to learn a lot of Bayesian probability for work. What I'd recommend: Practical ability to do and understand integrals An understanding of numerical methods for approximating integrals (sampling, Monte Carlo method) Knowing the R programming language is very useful - most texts I've come across do the examples in R. General understanding of model evaluation - you would certainly get this in stats, but you can get it in other fields (psychology, biology, machine learning) as well. There are lots of general modeling "tricks" that I didn't see studying pure math that would have been nice to know before jumping into Bayesian probability, such as regularization and parameter selection. Since you are a math major, you probably will see real analysis anyway, but I did not really find it that helpful for this. I did not find my background in measure theory helpful either. It very well might be that the class offered at your school is built with the assumed stats background - in which case, I recommend getting a book about Bayesian statistics/probability (I found this one useful) and working through it yourself.
