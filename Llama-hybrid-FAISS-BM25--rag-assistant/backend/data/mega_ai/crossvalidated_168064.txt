Why do Convolutional Neural Networks not use a Support Vector Machine to classify?

In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art for object recognition in computer vision. Typically, a CNN consists of several convolutional layers, followed by two fully-connected layers. An intuition behind this is that the convolutional layers learn a better representation of the input data, and the fully connected layers then learn to classify this representation based into a set of labels. However, before CNNs started to dominate, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were the state-of-the-art. So it seems sensible to say that an SVM is still a stronger classifier than a two-layer fully-connected neural network. Therefore, I am wondering why state-of-the-art CNNs tend to use the fully connected layers for classification rather than an SVM? In this way, you would have the best of both worlds: a strong feature representation, and a strong classifier, rather than a strong feature representation but only a weak classifier... Any ideas?
