Principal component analysis in R

I am curerntly running PCA for returns series of 50 stocks for 524 observation. I have completed following steps like I have computed covariance matrix, got the loading for each of them and also respective scores for all 50 stocks. There are 20 component explaining 80% variation. When we get final scores for example pc1 = -0.20*v1-0.50*v2.....-0.60*v50 in this case we will multiply this weight to return series of this variable. If yes, then what would be final output? Is it fine to have all values negative in your first PC1? if someone can help me with R example to preceed further from Q1 it would really a great help. When my output says there are 20 component explaining 80% variation that means I need to derive pc1+pc2....+pc20 and the resultant value would be my final value is that correct ? Thanks
