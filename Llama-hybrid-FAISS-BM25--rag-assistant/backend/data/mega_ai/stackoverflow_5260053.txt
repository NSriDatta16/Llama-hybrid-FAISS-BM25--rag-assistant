FlowDocument sourced from external resource

I am trying to externalise some of the wording within my WPF application, however I would like to be able to use some degree of formatting as well. My initial thought was to use a string resource which represented a FlowDocument or Paragraph such as: Some display text under content management In the UI I have been trying to bind this using a IValueConverter: In the converter: StringReader sr = new StringReader(value.ToString()); XamlReader xamlReader = XamlReader.Create(sr); return (FlowDocument)xamlReader.Parse(); but it keeps throwing an exception on the return statement. Is it even possible to do this via a binding? And where am I going wrong in the XamlReader? EDIT XamlParseException 'Cannot create unknown type 'FlowDocument'.' Line number '1' and line position '2'.
