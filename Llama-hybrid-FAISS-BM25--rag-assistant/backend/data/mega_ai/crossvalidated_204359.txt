Method to justify claim that two samples come from the same distribution

I know of ways to test "whether" two data sets come from the same distribution, in the sense that I can treat the hypothesis that they are from the same distribution as the null hypothesis. However, I want evidence that the hypothesis of sameness is correct. For example, if I get a small p-value from a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, that means that I can reject the hypothesis that the two data sets come from the same distribution, because it's very improbable that I would get this data if they were. However, as I understand the logic of null hypothesis testing, if my p-value is not small, this does (EDIT: not) justify the claim that the data comes from the same distribution. If I'm misunderstanding p-values and null hypothesis testing, feel free to answer with an explanation. I'm also open to Bayesian methods. There are a large number of stats.SE questions that are similar to mine, stated using "whether", "if", "compare", and the like, which makes it difficult to search for an answer to my question. So far, all of the answers I've found treat the hypothesis of sameness as the null, except for this one which doesn't have full answers. A pointer to good existing answers would be fine! (My data is generated by two computer simulations that use methods that are clearly different in one small way--we wrote them--but that under some settings, produce distributions that look very similar. I am trying to show that under those settings, for all practical purposes we can treat the distributions as the same. I'm getting p-values around 0.225 from a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.)
