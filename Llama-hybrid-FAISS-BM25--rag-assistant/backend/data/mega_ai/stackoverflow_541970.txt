How do I intercept a NotImplementedException in a WPF application?

How do I intercept a NotImplementedException in a WPF application? I'll occasionally throw a NotImplementedException while testing my in-progress WPF application: Private Sub ButtonDoSomething_Click(...) Handles ButtonDoSomething.Click Throw New NotImplementedException( _ "ButtonDoSomething_Click() not implemented.") End Sub But, I'd rather these not crash the program. I could replace all such exception throws with: MessageBox.Show("ButtonDoSomething_Click() not implemented.", _ "Not Implemented", MessageBoxButton.OK, MessageBoxImage.Information) But that seems inellegant somehow and wouldn't work if the NotImplementedException was buried away from the interface. How can I capture all such exceptions and display a message box?
