It's probably useful to have a basic understanding of the fourier transform, the graph laplacian, and at least some introductory knowledge about spectral analysis (the study of the eigenvalues of the graph laplacian). You don't really need to know any graph theory beyond the basics. Then I would start with Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering , as it's one of the first papers on graph convolutions and explains pretty clearly what's going on This may be personal taste, but I tend to stay away from survey papers when trying to understand a new topic, because they often try to reformulate and present every previous work into a single unified framework -- which rarely ends well and results in some pretty obtuse notation.
