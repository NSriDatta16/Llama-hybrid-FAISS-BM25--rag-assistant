I think you'd have to remove the entire categorical variable. Imagine a logistic regression in which you're trying to predict if a person has a disease or not. Country of birth might have a major impact on that, so you include it in your model. If the specific USAmerican origin didn't have any impact on AIC and you dropped it, how would you calculate $\hat{y}$ for an American? R uses reference contrasts for factors by default, so I think they'd just be calculated at the reference level (say, Botswana), if at all. That's probably not going to end well... A better option would be to sort out sensible encodings of country of birth beforehand - collapsing into region, continent, etc. and finding which of those is most suitable for your model. Of course, there are many ways to misuse stepwise variable selection, so make sure that you're doing it properly. There's plenty about that on this site, though; searching for "stepwise" brings up some good results. This is particularly pertinent , with lots of good advice in the answers.
