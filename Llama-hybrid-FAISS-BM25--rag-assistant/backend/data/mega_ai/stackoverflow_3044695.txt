As Gordon says your question makes no sense - the XML fragment is still "well-formed" (but its far from complete) so it is in the right format. Do you mean you want to preserve the format it was submitted in? In which case output it using ... tags. OTOH there are standard tools out there which wil format XML according to specific standards - e.g. geshi C.
