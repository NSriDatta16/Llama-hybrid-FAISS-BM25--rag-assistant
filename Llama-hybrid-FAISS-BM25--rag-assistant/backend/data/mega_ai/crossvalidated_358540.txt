Do encoders/decoders preserve composition?

Let's assume that we have an encoder E and a decoder D implemented for instance as a Convolutional Encoder-Decoder, namely ED . Let's take two inputs X and Y , and some composition operator o operating on X and Y . The operation o consists in blending two images X and Y into a new image X o Y by averaging each two pixels from X and Y . Here, the images are RGB images with 28x28 pixels, represented by tensors of the form [28, 28, 3]. If we pass X o Y as input to (the encoder-side) ED , can (the decoder-side of) ED yield an output ED(X) o ED(Y) such that ED(X) o ED(Y) = ED(X o Y) ? Is this always true or do we have to train the networks in a way that ensures such composition property? I am not sure how to put it, but I am trying to reason about the composition law f(x o y)=f(x) o f(y) in terms of the encoder-decoder architecture. Thanks
