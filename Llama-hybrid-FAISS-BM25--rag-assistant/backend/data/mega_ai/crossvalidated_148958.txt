Time series analysis incorporating Intervention Detection can estimate these missing values. Essentially the "0" value at a particular point in time is treated as an exception and the size of the exception is the estimated coefficient associated with that point in time. You can search for Intervention Detection OR AUTOMATIC Intervention Detection using a browser. If the number of missing values is "large" relative to normal data points then you might have to iteratively pursue this.
