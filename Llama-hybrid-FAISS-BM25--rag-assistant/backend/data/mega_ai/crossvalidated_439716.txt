Questions about pmf of multinomial distribution with indicator variables

I was reading through the textbook of Introduction to Machine Learning, it introduces $z^{t} = (z_{1}^{t},...,z_{k}^{t})$ , where $z_{i}$ is an indicator variable, each with probability $\pi_{i}$ , then the textbook gives the expression for the pmf for z: $p(z) = \prod_{i}^{k}\pi_{i}^{z_{i}^{t}}$ . I would like to know the detailed derivation of this formula, my concern is that according to this formula below, there should be another term in front of the product term.
