You should try the web browser Fake . Its tagline is: Mac OS X Web Automation and Testing Made Simple . You can see it as a combo of Safari and Automator in one app. Extract from its site: Power Users will love Fake for automating tedious web tasks like filling out lengthy forms and capturing screenshots. The workflow library is really powerful, and the killer feature for me is the Command-Click and Drag to connect to an element from your webpage without having to specify its id.
