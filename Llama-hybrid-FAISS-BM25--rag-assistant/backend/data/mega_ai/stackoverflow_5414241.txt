Any Python bindings to Tor?

Many people have shown how to use Tor in Python like this: proxy_support = urllib2.ProxyHandler({"http" : "127.0.0.1:8118"}) opener = urllib2.build_opener(proxy_support) opener.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/5.0')] print opener.open(url).read() However, I'm hunting for a python bindings to Tor, that to be integrated into my App. I mean, users will not need to download and install and configure Tor again. That would be very useful, help please. Thanks.
