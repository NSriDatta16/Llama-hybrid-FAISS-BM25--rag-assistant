This book hasn't been mentioned yet, as it's relatively new (2018): A Student's Guide to Bayesian Statistics by Ben Lambert In his videos, Lambert explains concepts in a very intuitive manner. This book does the same, explaining why the math works, using plenty of examples, and including problems to work at the end of each chapter. He incorporates videos into the book, noting in the margin when a particular video complements the given concept being explained. It's somewhat in the same vein as Statistical Rethinking, but I found both the book and his videos to be more to the point, while still explaining the concepts well. I'd suggest watching a few videos to get a feel for his style. Ben Lambert's YouTube channel
