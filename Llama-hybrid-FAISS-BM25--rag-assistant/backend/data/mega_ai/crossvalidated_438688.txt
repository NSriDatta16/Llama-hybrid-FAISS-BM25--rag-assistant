What is functional data?

Let's say I run a separate regression on different cross-sections at each point in time t. I would then have a time series for each regression coefficient over different periods in time. Would this data be considered functional data? Can I use k-means clustering on it? If not, does anyone have any other suggestions on how I can look at structural changes time series data with panel data? Also open to ML techniques.
