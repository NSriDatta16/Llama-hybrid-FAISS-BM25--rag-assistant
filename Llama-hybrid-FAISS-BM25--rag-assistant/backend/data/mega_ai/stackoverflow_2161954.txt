overriding a magento block in multiple modules (and how to ignore the other ones)

In Magento you can override a block (or helper, or model, etc.) from one module in another one (most common from Magento Adminhtml module). Now I have the problem that I want to override a block that was already overriden by some other extension. Is there any way to tell magento to ignore the tag in some other module configuration similary to the tag in layout updates? Here is the configuration of the other extension: Symmetrics_DeliveryTime_Block_Adminhtml_Catalog_Product_Grid Here the configuration of my extension: Namespace_MyModule_Block_Adminhtml_Catalog_Product_Grid I integrated the functionality of the block from Symmetrics_DeliveryTime into my own block and now I want magento to ignore the block overriding from that module. Is there any magento way to do that or is the only way to comment out the configuration (which is what I have done for now) including all the hassle while updating that module later?
