Carl has given a thorough answer that nicely explains the mathematical differences between Tikhonov regularization vs. ridge regression. Inspired by the historical discussion here , I thought it might be useful to add a short example demonstrating how the more general Tikhonov framework can be useful. First a brief note on context. Ridge regression arose in statistics, and while regularization is now widespread in statistics & machine learning, Tikhonov's approach was originally motivated by inverse problems arising in model-based data assimilation (particularly in geophysics ). The simplified example below is in this category (more complex versions are used for paleoclimate reconstructions ). Imagine we want to reconstruct temperatures $u[x,t=0]$ in the past, based on present-day measurements $u[x,t=T]$. In our simplified model we will assume that temperature evolves according to the heat equation $$ u_t = u_{xx} $$ in 1D with periodic boundary conditions $$ u[x+L,t] = u[x,t] $$ A simple (explicit) finite difference approach leads to the discrete model $$ \frac{\Delta\mathbf{u}}{\Delta{t}} = \frac{\mathbf{Lu}}{\Delta{x^2}} \implies \mathbf{u}_{t+1} = \mathbf{Au}_t $$ Mathematically, the evolution matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, so we have $$\mathbf{u}_t = \mathbf{A^{-1}u}_{t+1} $$ However numerically , difficulties will arise if the time interval $T$ is too long. Tikhonov regularization can solve this problem by solving \begin{align} \mathbf{Au}_t &\approx \mathbf{u}_{t+1} \\ \omega\mathbf{Lu}_t &\approx \mathbf{0} \end{align} which adds a small penalty $\omega^2\ll{1}$ on roughness $u_{xx}$. Below is a comparison of the results: We can see that the original temperature $u_0$ has a smooth profile, which is smoothed still further by diffusion to give $u_\mathsf{fwd}$. Direct inversion fails to recover $u_0$, and the solution $u_\mathsf{inv}$ shows strong "checkerboarding" artifacts. However the Tikhonov solution $u_\mathsf{reg}$ is able to recover $u_0$ with quite good accuracy. Note that in this example, ridge regression would always push our solution towards an "ice age" (i.e. uniform zero temperatures). Tikhonov regression allows us a more flexible physically -based prior constraint: Here our penalty essentially says the reconstruction $\mathbf{u}$ should be only slowly evolving, i.e. $u_t\approx{0}$. Matlab code for the example is below (can be run online here ). % Tikhonov Regularization Example: Inverse Heat Equation n=15; t=2e1; w=1e-2; % grid size, # time steps, regularization L=toeplitz(sparse([-2,1,zeros(1,n-3),1]/2)); % laplacian (periodic BCs) A=(speye(n)+L)^t; % forward operator (diffusion) x=(0:n-1)'; u0=sin(2*pi*x/n); % initial condition (periodic & smooth) ufwd=A*u0; % forward model uinv=A\ufwd; % inverse model ureg=[A;w*L]\[ufwd;zeros(n,1)]; % regularized inverse plot(x,u0,'k.-',x,ufwd,'k:',x,uinv,'r.:',x,ureg,'ro'); set(legend('u_0','u_{fwd}','u_{inv}','u_{reg}'),'box','off');
