Apache mod_cache: Vary cache based on cookie values

Currently, I am using mod_cache to cache the page details of a web application. I have the cache Vary based on User-Agent and Accept-Language, since there are different payloads for those situations. Vary: User-Agent, Accept-Language We have plans to have region-specific information on each page, but this is where we are trying to determine our caching strategy. We have a cookie that persists to indicate the region we geolocated for, but obviously the cache does not vary based on this cookie. It is possible to vary based on the value for certain cookies or headers in general? (Note I say certain cookies, as we wouldn't want the session identifier to collide with this) - something like a regex match to this: location=(.+?);
