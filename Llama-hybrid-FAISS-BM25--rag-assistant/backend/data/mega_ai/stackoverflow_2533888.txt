That really depends. I'll give you 2 examples where one overcome the other: Timestamp is better than DATETIME when you want to store users session in the database and the session creation time (in Timestamp format) is used for fast row retrieval (with index). E.g. table may look like this: [session_create_time AS Timestamp][IP_address AS 32bit Int][etc...] Having an index on the first two columns can really speed up your queries. If you had a DATETIME value type for the session_create_time field, then it could be taken much more time. Take into account that session queries are executed each time a user request a page , so efficiency is crucial. DATETIME is better than Timestamp when you want to store a user's date of birth or some historic events that require flexible time range.
