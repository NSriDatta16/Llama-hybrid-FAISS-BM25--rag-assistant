Magento - Changes to Edit Account Information screen do not get reflected

I have my custom theme, in which I would like to make changes to the Edit Account Information Screen. I have tried to modify this file: customer/form/edit.phtml No change that I make to this file gets reflected. I even removed all customer/form/edit.phtml files from the base and my custom theme. Even then, the screen renders. This is the relevant code in my customer.xml file: Customer Account Edit Form Edit Account Info left.permanent.callout What am I missing?
