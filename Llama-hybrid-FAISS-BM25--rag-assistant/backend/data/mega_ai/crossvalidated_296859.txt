I think what you are looking for is an autoregressive latent trait model. These are latent growth models with additional autoregression parameters (such as you would see in a time series model or a cross-lagged model). They were introduced in a paper and a book by Curran and Bollen: http://curran.web.unc.edu/files/2015/03/BollenCurran2004.pdf is the paper. You need to lose the first measurement from the latent growth model, so you probably need at least 4 time points to start with (meaning your latent growth model has three points, and is limited to linear).
