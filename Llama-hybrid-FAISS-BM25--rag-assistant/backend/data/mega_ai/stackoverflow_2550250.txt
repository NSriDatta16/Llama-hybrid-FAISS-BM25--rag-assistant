Expanding on codeka's answer and my comment . . . try this (i'm assuming your target p has id my_p ): (function() { var p = $('#my_p'); var o_string = p.text(); p.html(' ' + o_string.split('').join(' ') + ' '); $('span', p).each(function(i) { $(this).data('MyIndex', i); }).click(function() { var char_index = $(this).data('MyIndex'); if (char_index >= 5) { alert('You clicked after character 5! Before: "' + o_string.substring(0, char_index) + '", After (inclusive): "' + o_string.substring(char_index) + '"'); } }); })(); What that does is: 1. Find the paragraph where you need per-character clicking knowledge, 2. Split the text in that paragraph into a number of one-character spans, 3. Inform each of those one-character spans of its position in the string, and 4. Assign a click() handler to each span, which spits out the information about the span (including your example of char index >= 5, and printing the before and after parts of the string). Of course you might want to put that in $(document).ready(...) instead of an anonymous function; I didn't know if maybe you had a precondition for activating this detection though.
