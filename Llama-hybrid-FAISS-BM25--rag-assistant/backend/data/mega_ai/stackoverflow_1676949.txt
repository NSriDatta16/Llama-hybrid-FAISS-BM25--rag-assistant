Making HTML Table sortable and selectable

I have a very specific requirement for a Prototype based JS / HTML script (or something that doesn't interfere with Prototype) that can add the following functionality to a normal, multi-column HTML table: Re-order rows using drag and drop and send changes to a Javascript handler function ( not a "sortable table" function to order by fields, but a manual re-ordering of individual rows) The re-ordering feature can be disabled/enabled using a Javascript command, when it is turned off, the rows can not be moved Select one or multiple rows using Ctrl and shift keys + click, send current selection to JS handler function on each change Maybe somebody knows something like this and can save me a lot of time searching through the Interwebs or programming it myself. If I find anything, I'll post it here.
