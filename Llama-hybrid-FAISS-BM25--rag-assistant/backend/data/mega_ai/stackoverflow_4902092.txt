I shall reiterate what Gilbert answered. He was correct, but I don't think the original author understood the idea. As an example: create table test ( mycolumn timestamp ) insert into test values (current timestamp) select * from test select days(current timestamp)-days(mycolumn) from test The current timestamp is a special register that DB2 has available. Days is a default function that will return the number of days component of the given timestamp counting from January 1, year 1.
