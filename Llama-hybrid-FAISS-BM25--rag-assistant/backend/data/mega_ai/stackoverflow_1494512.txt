A ROWID won't change unless: you move the table (ALTER TABLE t MOVE), from one tablespace to another for example the row switches from one partition to another (partitioned table with ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT) you update the primary key of an INDEX ORGANIZED table. When a row moves from one block to another in a standard (HEAP) table, because it grows so large it can't fit into its original block for example, it will be migrated. Oracle will leave a pointer to the new block and move the row. The row will keep its original ROWID. ROWIDs can be relied upon, they are used in replication to refresh materialized views for example.
