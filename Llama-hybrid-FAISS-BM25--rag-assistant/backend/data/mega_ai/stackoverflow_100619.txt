I worked on a planner application which loosely follows the iCalendar standard (to record events). You may want to read RFC 2445 or this schema published by Apple Inc. icalendar schema to see if they are relevant to the problem. My database schema (recurring/whole-day event was not considered at the time) event (event_id, # primary key dtstart, dtend, summary, categories, class, priority, summary, transp, created, calendar_id, # foreign key status, organizer_id, # foreign key comment, last_modified, location, uid); the foreign key calendar_id in the previous table refers this calendar(calendar_id, # primary key name); while organizer_id refers this (with other properties like common name etc. missing) organizer(organizer_id, # primary key name); Another documentation that you may find more readable is located here hope this helps
