Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks with Python

I'm working on a task for an assignment for school. The course doesn't have a textbook and instead uses the tutorial on DataCamp. I've struggled severely using DataCamp to learn (been through it multiple times) and instead have found that written tutorials help me learn much better and quicker (at least with machine learning models). I usually use Medium but haven't found anything useful on there, so far. I was curious if there's a tutorial that might help me with the following task. You will build a neural network designed to learn word usage and context using NLP techniques. You will provide visualizations and a report, as well as build your network in an interactive development environment.
