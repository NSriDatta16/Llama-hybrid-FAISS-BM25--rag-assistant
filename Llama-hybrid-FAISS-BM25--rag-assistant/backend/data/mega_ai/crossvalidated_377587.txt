Can I average z-scores for basic insights?

everyone. I'm new to this so perhaps my question will sound elementary but hopefully you can help. I have a data set that contains student test scores across several learning areas (English, Biology etc). My goal is to (somehow) quantify who has 'improved' the most across the year with simple software (probably excel) and in as simple a manner as possible. As an example of what Iâ€™d like to do... Imagine that I sit 3 exams (English, Maths and History) in the first half of the year and get 50% for English, 65% for math and 80% for History. Then I sit exams for those same 3 subjects at the end of the year and get different results... Now, if you did the same thing and sat all of your exams (though you might do different subject) is there some way to determine who improved the most between us over the course of the year? The data that I have access to comes from tests performed twice per year (half-yearly and end-of-year tests). I originally considered calculating the z-scores for each individual's half-yearly and end-of-year test results and then finding the mean for each of these z-score groups. My question is, can I then calculate something like the percentage increase in each individual's average z-score across the first and second testing period to determine who has 'improved' the most, or is this unsound? I also considered something like percentile rank but because the scale is not evenly distributed am I right in assuming that this would inflate the results of those in the meaty part of the bell curve? That is, a relatively minor improvement by someone who is performing close to the average can result in a large movement in rank... Any ideas as to what I could use or how I could improve my idea?
