How do I return memcached string based on respond_to type?

I have a group of categories and I access these categorizes via javascript several times during the average course of use for my application via JSON. So in my control currently I have a @categories = Category.all respond_to do |format| format.html # index.html.erb format.json along with the appropriate index.json.erb file that formats what I need as far as JSON. Now I want to add some memcached functionality to this so in the index.json.erb file I have added block around my output My question is how do I get my controller to call this cache key when responding to a JSON request and act normally, pulling from the database, on other calls? Thanks
