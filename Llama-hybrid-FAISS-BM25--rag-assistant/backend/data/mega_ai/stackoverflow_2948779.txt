If you had to redo a site that has around 150 tables and 250,000+ visitors/day in any web platform, what would your choice be and why? Some points The team has experienced developers The old application is written in unrefactored PHP. It's unusable. Much of the database is not normalized, and there are columns in the wrong spots. Many new features and the database can't support them now. Desired goals: Excellent and fast testing (grails is bad for this) Good seperation of concerns (domain, controllers, views) with ability to not duplicate anything Concise code & Elegant design - no code bloat Flexible - we don't want to run into a leaky abstraction problem Coding and testing are fast - it shouldn't take 1 hour to write a controller test, or we shouldn't have to spend more than 1 minute or so writing a reusable tag, for example. Scala is on our minds, but we are having a hard time seeing how that can work as the tooling is not mature yet. We actually don't like Grails. A lot of us are used to Java/Spring/Hibernate, but are sick of the low-level nature of it and want something more expressive.
