How can I perform statistical analysis, (PCA sPLS-DA) etc on a dataset which has many missing values?

I have a dataset of mass spec analysis which was sent to me in 200 excel files. Importing into R, I get a dataframe that looks like this: | Unique Sample ID | Chemical Name | Concentration | | -------- | -------------- | -------------- | | 001| Chemical 1| 50| | 001 | Chemical 2| 100| | 002 | Chemical 1| 100| | 002| Chemical 2| 50| | 002 | Chemical 3| 100| Sample 1 is missing any entry for chemical 3. Can I analyze this data by PCA, as there are no NA values, or what can I do to improve this dataset for statistical analysis? I'm really lost. Thanks! *edit - Values not included are below the limit of detection so were not exported from the MS to the excel files
