jQuery UI Sortable and Google gadgets

I have seen a couple similar questions, but nothing that specifically covers my problem. I am trying to place several Google gadgets in a set of sortable divs. When I drag one of these divs and drop it in a new location, the whole page is refreshing and showing me only the content of that gadget's iframe. I have seen from the other SO questions that Firefox contains a bug in which iframe content is refreshed if it is moved in the DOM tree. That behavior isn't ideal, but I'd gladly take it over what I'm experiencing now. Firefox and Chrome both give me this problem. IE and Opera properly sort the gadgets. Does anybody have some insight as to how I can work around this?
