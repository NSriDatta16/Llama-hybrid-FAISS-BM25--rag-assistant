Ideally, you need a font which has its own bold variant. Bold faces are often synthesized by user agents for faces that lack actual bold faces. See: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-weight-the-font-weight-property One such monospaced font is DejaVu Sans Mono . This font has normal, bold and italic variants which render characters at the same width. It is legible at a font size of 10px. alt text http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/8166/dejavub.png
