You need to think about what reliable means. Also you need to decide if you need the packets in order or if out of order is ok. If out of order is ok you need to come up with an ACK, re-transmit, and timeout scheme. Also you need to decide if you are going to handle packet fragmentation. If you can get away with it yo might want to limit the size of a packet to prevent fragmentation.
