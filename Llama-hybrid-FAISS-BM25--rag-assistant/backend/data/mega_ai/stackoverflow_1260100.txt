I am glad you discovered the comments in my blog post. I think they are the tip of the iceberg to discovering how to achieve what you're looking for. You need to keep in mind that the reason dragging to an NSTextField works when it has focus, is that the NSTextField has itself been temporarily obscured by a richer, more powerful view (an NSTextView ), which is called the "Field Editor." Check out this section of Apple's documentation on the field editor: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/TextEditing/Tasks/FieldEditor.html To achieve what you're striving for, I think you might need to intercept the standard provision of the field editor for your NSTextField s, by implementing the window delegate method: windowWillReturnFieldEditor:toObject: This gives you the opportunity to either tweak the configuration on the NSTextView , or provide a completely new field editor object. In the worst case scenario, you could provide your own NSTextView subclass as the field editor, which was designed to reject all drags.
