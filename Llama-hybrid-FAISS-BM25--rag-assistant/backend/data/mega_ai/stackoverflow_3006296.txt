Yes, that's true. JDBC drivers won't work there, as long as GAE datastore is not based on RDBMS (it's rather some kind of NoSQL big-table storage). If you want to work with GAE storage via ActiveRecord ORM (Hibernate-like), you may be interested in JPA or JDO - the both are supported. Alternatively, you can directly use low-level API. For more information you may refer to Datastore Java API Overview .
