How to truncate milliseconds off of a .NET DateTime

I'm trying to compare a time stamp from an incoming request to a database stored value. SQL Server of course keeps some precision of milliseconds on the time, and when read into a .NET DateTime, it includes those milliseconds. The incoming request to the system, however, does not offer that precision, so I need to simply drop the milliseconds. I feel like I'm missing something obvious, but I haven't found an elegant way to do it (C#).
