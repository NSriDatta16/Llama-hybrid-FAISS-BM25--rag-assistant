Robert provided a better way to do it, but the problem with your code is that you are calling .Value and that will running in the context of SQL Server, so there is no .Value operation that can be translated to SQL. You'd have to call .ToList().First().Value, or assign to DateTime?. Since you can't call .First().ToList() ... since First() returns a single DateTime? then you're better off just assigning to DateTime?, because you don't want to return the entire list from SQL.
