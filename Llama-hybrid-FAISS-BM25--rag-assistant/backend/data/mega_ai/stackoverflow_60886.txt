You can help reduce fragmentation by reducing the amount you allocate deallocate. e.g. say for a web server running a server side script, it may create a string to output the page to. Instead of allocating and deallocating these strings for every page request, just maintain a pool of them, so your only allocating when you need more, but your not deallocating (meaning after a while you get the situation you not allocating anymore either, because you have enough) You can use _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks(); to dump memory leaks to the debug window when running a debug build, however I believe this is specific to the Visual C compiler. (it's in crtdbg.h)
