Classification with tall fat data

I need to train a linear classifier on my laptop with hundreds of thousands of data points and about ten thousand features. What are my options? What is the state of the art for this type of problem? It seems like stochastic gradient descent is promising direction, and my sense is that this is state of the art: "Pegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM" Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Yoram Singer, Nathan Srebro, Andrew Cotter." Mathematical Programming, Series B, 127(1):3-30, year: 2007 . " Is this the consensus? Should I be looking in some other direction?
