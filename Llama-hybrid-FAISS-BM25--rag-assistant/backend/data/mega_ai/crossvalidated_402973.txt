I would not approach this problem this way. Rather, I'd use the whole data set and then predict the disease using the variables you have. One variable could be your opinion on whether they are in the 'over diagnosed' group and you could then use logistic regression. But be careful that your opinion is not based on results. In fact, if you've already seen the results, then I wouldn't do this at all. I am not accusing you of anything, but there's a reason for blinding.
