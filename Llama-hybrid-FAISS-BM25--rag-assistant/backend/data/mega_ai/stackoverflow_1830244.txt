Jrista pointed in the right direction with his answer, but the actual reason of this behavior turned out to be rather different: The "% Time in GC" counter is not a realtime counter . Instead, it shows the last value measured when the last GC happened . When you close your web application with App_Offline.htm , the GC will run and take a certain percentage. After that, the CLR is totally inactive (the purpose os App_Offline), so no further garbage collections will happen and the percentage remains the same. Hence the straight line, even when ASP.NET CLR activity is zero. Here's a description of this counter, which I copied here for reference (and to remind myself to read the explanation of a counter before asking silly questions). % Time in GC is the percentage of elapsed time that was spent in performing a garbage collection (GC) since the last GC cycle. This counter is usually an indicator of the work done by the Garbage Collector on behalf of the application to collect and compact memory. This counter is updated only at the end of every GC and the counter value reflects the last observed value; its not an average.
