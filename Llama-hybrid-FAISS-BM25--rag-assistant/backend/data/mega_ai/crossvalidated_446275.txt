The dataset description was vague, so it's a guess - but I suspect there is a bit of a Base Rate Fallacy/Survivorship Bias at play. It's easier to have less money in your account, and therefore there are more people with little or no money than people with a lot of money. On the other extreme, people with private swimming pools full of cash don't go applying for credit - they don't need to. Therefore, the classifier mostly sees a subset of those people who either need more money than your average applicant (and so, if they default, you lose more) or burn through the money they do have faster (and therefore have a higher risk of defaulting). There might be some more sociological factors at play, too - you're not seeing all the people who would have had a high-value checking account - if they had one at all, but they chose not to for some reason. I don't feel qualified to speculate on the exact factors at play in 90s-era Germany, though.
