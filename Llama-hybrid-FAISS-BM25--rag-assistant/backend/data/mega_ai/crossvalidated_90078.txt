Standard deviation of a dataset comprised of triplicates (industrial stack sampling data)

I have 4 triplicate data values. each consist of 3 values, for example, this could be 1: Concentration: 45 78 66 These data have a mean of 63 and a st.dev. of 16.7 Now I have 4 similar triplicates, from multiple tests, for example: test: a b c d 45 56 34 67 78 23 67 34 66 23 56 23 avg 63 34 52.3 41.3 I need the standard deviation of the overall distribution from the 4 triplicates. What is the method to do this? I could average the 4 concentrations, and determine the pooled variance, but would this not be the estimate of the standard deviation if another triplicate test was conducted and the result was the average value? I could determine the standard deviation of the 4 values, but this ignores the fact that these values consist of a triplicate set of data. I need to know what the proper method of determining the standard deviation is.
