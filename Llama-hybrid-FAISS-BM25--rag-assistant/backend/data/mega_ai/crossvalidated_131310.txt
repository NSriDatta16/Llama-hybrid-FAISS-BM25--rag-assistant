increase the speed of random forest conditional importance from the party R package

I have a dataset with numerical and categorical variables and a binary output variable. I want to use the conditional importance in random Forest This is my code cont = cforest_unbiased(ntree=1000, mtry=1) cf = cforest(asthma3~., data=xTrain, controls = cont) conditional_importance = varimp(object = cf,conditional = T, threshold=threshold, nperm=1)#this is the line that is too slow Even with small dataset like > dim(x) [1] 3058 7 The code take a lot of time. I have been waiting for the answer for more than 4 days. How can I speed up this computation? Am I doing anything wrong?
