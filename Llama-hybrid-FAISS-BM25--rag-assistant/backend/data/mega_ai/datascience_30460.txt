Group prediction

I have following sort of data coming every day: (0)(3,4,5)(6,9,1)(5,35,12,232) (1)(5,1,4)(6,2)(12,54,12,43)(8,23,65) (2)(6,7,2)(34,3) (3)(4323,23,12,4543) (4)(987,32,324,23,224,12,213,21)(1,2) (5)(3242,23,23434,34,324,322)(4,342,423,4)(3,1,30) (6)(1,2,3,4,5)(6,7)(8,9,10) (0)(1,2) (1)(54,12)(45,21,5,19)(9,8,6,41)(432,1,431,2) In each sequence, the first number indicates the day of a week (0-6). All other numbers indicate user IDs. The meaning of the first sequence is: On Sunday (0), following users met as 3 different groups: (3,4,5), (6,9,1), (5,35,12,232) What is the best method for predicting user groups for next day? Can I use RNN? Any specific method that I should look into? Any classical problems closely related to this?
