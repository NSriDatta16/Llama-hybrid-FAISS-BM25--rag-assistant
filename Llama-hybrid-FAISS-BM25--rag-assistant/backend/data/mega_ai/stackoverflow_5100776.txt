For Pig r0.8.0 the answer is as simple as giving your output path an extension of ".gz" (or ".bz" should you prefer bzip). The last line of your code should be amended to read: STORE UserCount INTO '/tmp/usercount.gz' USING PigStorage(','); Per your example, your output file would then be found as /tmp/usercount.gz/part-r-00000.gz For more information, see: https://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.8.1/piglatin_ref2.html#PigStorage
