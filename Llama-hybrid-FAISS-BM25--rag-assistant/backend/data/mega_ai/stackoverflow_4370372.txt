expand/collapse jquery menu (can't find right selector)

Using an unordered list for my menu .. I've got the selection for the click working, but I can't figure out the selection for only the specific list. The way I have it now, it expands/collapses all the lists with the specific class, but I only want to have it on the class I've clicked in.. Here is the jQuery $(document).ready(function() { $(".login-holder > ul > #loginTitle").click(function() { $(".account-links:parent").slideToggle("medium"); }); }); Here is the HTML Welcome, User Options ( x => x.List(), "Events Near Me" )%> ( x => x.List(), "My Events" )%> ( x => x.Edit(), "My Profile" )%> ( x => x.List(), "Clubs Near Me" )%> ( x => x.List(), "My Clubs" )%> ( x => x.ChangePassword(), "Change My Password" )%> ( x => x.List(), "My Dependants" ) %> Organizer Details --> --> ( x => x.Organizer(), "Organizer Details" )%> ( x => x.Edit( default(int?) ), "Post An Event" )%> ( x => x.List(), "Events Created By Me" ) %> ( x => x.Edit( default( int? ) ), "Create A Club" )%> ( x => x.List( ), "Clubs Created By Me" )%> -->
