Python does not have a switch-case statement. You could of course use if/elif-blocks instead to test a variable and call the relevant function depending on the variables value. But I think you could implement a more elegant solution using Pythons built-in dictionaries. The arguments are held in a list and/or dictionary and passed directly to the called function. Something along the line of: def function1(arg1, arg2): print "I'm function1" def function2(arg1, arg2, arg3): print "I'm function2" functions = {"key1": function1, "key2": function2} switch_var = "key2" args = [1, 2, 3] kwargs = {} functions[switch_var](*args, **kwargs)
