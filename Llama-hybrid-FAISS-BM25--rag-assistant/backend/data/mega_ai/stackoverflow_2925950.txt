I'm guessing your problem is actually a bug in your code. From the Boost documentation for thread : Thread Constructor with arguments template thread(F f,A1 a1,A2 a2,...); Preconditions: F and each A n must by copyable or movable. Effects: As if thread(boost::bind(f,a1,a2,...)). Consequently, f and each a n are copied into internal storage for access by the new thread. So, I think the thread is modifying its own copy of doer, and not the object whose runnable state you're checking.
