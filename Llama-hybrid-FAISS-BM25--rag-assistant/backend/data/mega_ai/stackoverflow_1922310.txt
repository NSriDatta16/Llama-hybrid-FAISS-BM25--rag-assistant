That's more like a code organization / code structure question than a problem. You can fetch your input data "by hand" or use Active Record CI library to do that ( https://www.codeigniter.com/userguide2/database/active_record.html#insert ) If CI has ORM implemented, the job should be even easier than this. Just create a controller and check the input data on it (or inside the model) and create a model to apply the necessary cleanups, data verification and proper data assign to one or mode tables and you're set. edit : more elegant than the example you've showed would be with ORM, but I'm not sure CI has that implemented yet.
