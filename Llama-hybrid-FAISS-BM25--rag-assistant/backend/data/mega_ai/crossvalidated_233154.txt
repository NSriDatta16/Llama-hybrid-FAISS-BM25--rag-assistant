In a nutshell, you're right and he's wrong. The tragedy of data analysis is that a lot of people do it, but only a minority of people do it well, partly due to a weak education in data analysis and partly due to apathy. Turn a critical eye to most any published research article that doesn't have a statistician or a machine-learning expert on the author list and you'll quickly spot such elementary mistakes as interpreting $p$-values as the probability that the null hypothesis is true. I think the only thing to do, when confronted with this kind of situation, is to carefully explain what's wrong about the wrongheaded practice, with an example or two.
