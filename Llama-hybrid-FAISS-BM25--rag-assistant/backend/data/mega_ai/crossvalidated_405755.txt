Ranked-categorical variables in Artificial Neural Networks?

As far as I understand, input variables in Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) must be continuous, right? (And there are a number of methods to convert categorical to continuous variables described in the literature.) However, I wonder if ranked-categorical variables (e.g., with classes 1, 2, and 3, where is 1 = low, 2 = average, 3 = high) should also be transformed into continuous variables before they can be included into an ANN?
