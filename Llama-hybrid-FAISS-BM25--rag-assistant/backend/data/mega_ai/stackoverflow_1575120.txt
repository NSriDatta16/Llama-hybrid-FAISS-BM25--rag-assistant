Looks like you're trying to create an index? I think Learning Perl has information on finding the frequency of words in a text file, so that's not a particularly hard problem. But do you really want to know that "the" or "a" is the most common word? If you're looking for some kind of topical index, the words you actually care about are probably down the list a bit, intermixed with more words you don't care about. You could start by getting rid of "stop words" at the front of the list to filter your results a bit, but nothing would beat associating keywords that actually reflect the topic of the paragraphs, and that requires context. Anyway, I could be off base, but there you go. ;)
