Harvesting a .csproj with heat.exe in Visual Studio 2008 and WiX(v3)

I found that Wix v3 uses a tool (heat.exe) to "harvest" information into WiX fragments. Either I am looking in the wrong location, or this is thinly documented. What is the best way to auto-generate a WiX fragment (likely using heat.exe) for a complex folder structure that contains media files: Of varying types (ico/png/xaml/etc) That may change regularly (names/locations/adds/removes) That are classified as "Content" and included in a .csproj such that they can be built into an installer via WiX and would withstand upgrades and patches with decorum? Background Information I found heat.exe, which seems to solve the autogenerate WiX fragment requirement In getting the "dir" harvester working, I noticed the "project" harvester (commandline help) Media is already in C# project file, and so noted that "-pog:Content" might do very well Cursory search found out of date documentation that didn't mention "project" harvester Realized entire project installer could probably done with "project" harvester, but was unsure how well this was supported, and what the pitfalls were. Saw the generation of "PUT-GUID-HERE" and realized that autogeneration of guids would likely have upgrade/patch implications. Realized that there must be people who use these tools for similar purposes and could probably point me in the right direction. It was (fairly) pointed out that v3 is not yet "done" (thus the scarceness of documentation and tutorials). The sense that I get now is that it is non-trivial to automate this in my build scripts, and the tools are growing right now to ease this.
