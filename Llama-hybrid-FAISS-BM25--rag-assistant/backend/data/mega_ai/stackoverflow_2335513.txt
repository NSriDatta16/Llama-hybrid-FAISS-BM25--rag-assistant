You should design your storage format around how you expect to use the data. If you need to know the difference between the first name(s) and last name(s), then have columns for each. Likewise, if you (or your business) cares about suffix/prefix/middle names/etc... enough to want to use them in a specific manner (e.g. spamming all customers who are Doctors), then have columns for each. But if all your need it for is to identify them in a report, or in a email salutation, then consider an easier approach of: First_names, Last_Names, and leave it at that. Ask yourself what realistic benefit your organisation would get out of storing each component of a persons name separately. Look at government forms and see how much information about a persons name they feel the need to capture.
