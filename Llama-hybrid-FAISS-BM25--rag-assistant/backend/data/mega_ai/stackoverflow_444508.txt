I would also recommend using Moose. However as an "alternative" take a look at Sub::Contract . To quote the author.... Sub::Contract offers a pragmatic way to implement parts of the programming by contract paradigm in Perl. Sub::Contract is not a design-by-contract framework. Sub::Contract aims at making it very easy to constrain subroutines input arguments and return values in order to emulate strong typing at runtime.
