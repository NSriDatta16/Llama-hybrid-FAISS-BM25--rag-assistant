As per my understanding, you can perform time series analysis even on short time period observations. You can use ARIMA model which is available in both Python and R for modelling time-series and predicting future data. So, to answer your questions, Ans.1 : Yes, time-series analysis is suitable for this data as well. Ans.2 : I'll answer this question from Python perspective. ARIMA model is available in python, but there no in-built function to decide best fit ARIMA model (Which is available in R). So, you need to plot graphs from your data. You'll need to plot auto-correlation plots like ACF (Auto Correlation Function) and PACF (Partial ACF), which shows the correlation between observations of a time series separated by k time units (lags). Means after how much time the pattern is repeated. So, based on ACF and PACF plots, you can decide parameters(p,d and q) of ARIMA model (From PACF plot decide q and from ACF plot decide q). I find this post very helpful to learn about ARIMA. Sorry, I don't have any idea about last question.
