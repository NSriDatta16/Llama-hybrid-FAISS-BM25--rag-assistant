Yeah, there are Algorithms such as DBSCAN or HDBSCAN could be suitable for this task. My approach would be like this I would first gonna vectorize the words in the corpus, so that they can be represented as numerical data. Then I am gonna use word embedding model such as Word2Vec or GloVe. They are quite simple to use. Once I get the numerical vectors for each word, I am gonna apply the clustering algorithm to the data to identify clusters of words that are related to each other. The clustering method would need to be re-run as new words are introduced to the corpus to take into account the fresh information and modify the clusters as necessary.
