Which constructor should I use for the StringBuilder class?

I'm building a large string from a list of items. Each item will generate a string which is approximately 200 characters long (plus or minus 100%). Will I get a (noticeable) performance benefit from using Dim sb = New StringBuilder(averageCharacterCount * items.Count) instead of Dim sb = New StringBuilder() even if the specified capacity is just a guess?
