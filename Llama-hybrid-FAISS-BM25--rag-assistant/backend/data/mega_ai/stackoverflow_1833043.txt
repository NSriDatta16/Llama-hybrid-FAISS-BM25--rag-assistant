That's what I see from the additional details you provided. 1) It's NOT a test automation job. QTP here is used only as GUI interaction tool. So may be you should consider first tool like AutoIt . It's free, by the way, and also has record/playback capabilities you needed from QTP. 2) Steps 27-41 are routine operations. Step 42 ("The matched pair differences should be zero") is a question, that requires investigation, especially if pair differences ARE NOT zero. How were you going to automate that using record/playback? Thank you, Albert Gareev
