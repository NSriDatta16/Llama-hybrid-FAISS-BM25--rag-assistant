There's nothing inherently OOP about the way doxygen works. It's just able to extract more information about OO code because it has more information in it (e.g., inheritance graphs). We use doxygen for plain C code and it works just as well, minus the information that plain C doesn't provide when compared to C++. Just use doxygen's grouping (@addtogroup et al) features to organize the generated documentation and you're good to do.
