What are alternatives to regret minimization in online learning settings?

Regret is a common criteria to optimize in online learning. I'm wondering if anyone knows of other alternative criteria to optimize that have been proposed or explored in an online learning problem. References and links to papers, blogs, etc. are encouraged.
