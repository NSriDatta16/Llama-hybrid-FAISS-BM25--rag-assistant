From my SAS 9.4 documentation: "The VARCLUS procedure divides a set of numeric variables into disjoint or hierarchical clusters. Associated with each cluster is a linear combination of the variables in the cluster. This linear combination can be either the first principal component (the default) or the centroid component (if you specify the CENTROID option). The first principal component is a weighted average of the variables that explains as much variance as possible. See Chapter 79: The PRINCOMP Procedure, for further details. Centroid components are unweighted averages of either the standardized variables (the default) or the raw variables (if you specify the COVARIANCE option). PROC VARCLUS tries to maximize the variance that is explained by the cluster components, summed over all the clusters. The cluster components are oblique, not orthogonal, even when the cluster components are first principal components. In an ordinary principal component analysis, all components are computed from the same variables, and the first principal component is orthogonal to the second principal component and to every other principal component. In PROC VARCLUS, each cluster component is computed from a set of variables that is different from all the other cluster components. The first principal component of one cluster might be correlated with the first principal component of another cluster. Hence, the PROC VARCLUS algorithm is a type of oblique component analysis"
