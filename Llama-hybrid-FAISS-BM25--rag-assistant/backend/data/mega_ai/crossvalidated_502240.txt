There is an output for every node, referred as hidden state in vanilla RNN (LSTM nodes has 2 outputs). In certain cases you only care about the output of the last node so you just avoid previous ones. But each hidden state is still used: Hidden states of the nodes transfered to subsequent nodes thus they are used to construct hidden state (output) of the last node in the sequence.
