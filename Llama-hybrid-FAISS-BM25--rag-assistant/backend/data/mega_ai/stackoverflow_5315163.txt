404 on direct access of page but not after visiting other page

I get message "The requested URL /schaak-demo was not found on this server" when trying to go to http://enkelzijdig.nl/schaak-demo . Does not matter how many times i try. Same goes for the link with www. When i go to http://enkelzijdig.nl/demo/ first, and then to the link from the first paragraph, it works like a charm. Every time after that it works like a charm. After deleting cookies it still works. After closing the browser and starting up again it still works. How come? My .htaccess looks like this ### demo RewriteCond $1 !css/ RewriteCond $1 !sites/ RewriteCond $1 !skins/ RewriteCond $1 !config/ RewriteRule demo/(.*) /demo/php/$1 [L] In my configfile i get the website-URL, and i do it like this: function set_path_to_client_website(){ $servername = parse_url($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']); $serveruri = parse_url($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']); $_SESSION['host'] = $servername['path']; //if string between first and second slash ends with demofolder then add this part of the string to the session[host]. $pos = strpos(strtolower($serveruri['path']), strtolower(substr(get_demo_folder(),1,-1))); if ($pos > -1){ $_SESSION['host'] = $servername['path'] . substr(strtolower($serveruri['path']), 0, $pos + strlen(get_demo_folder()) -1); } else{ $_SESSION['host'] = $servername['path'] . '/'; } return $_SESSION['host']; } Is this enough info? I am lost. Any hint is appreciated. Thank you. Kim Alders
