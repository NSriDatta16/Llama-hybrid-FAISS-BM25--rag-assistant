Is there a visual style reason behind all this? In other words when you have something like the following, is it visually rendering in a way that you do not find ideal? Some paragraph text. First list item Second list item Third list item Another paragraph. If the problem is too much margin after the P and before the UL, then you can try an adjacent sibling selector like this to compensate: p + ul { margin-top: -1em; }
