You will need to set up a timer you fire to increase your volume every 1/10s say. You could either count these timer events or you culd store an [NSDate date] in your touchesBegan and then inspect that as your other events occur - touches moved that stays inside your rect or the timer. The latter is a more flexible approach and not a significant overhead.
