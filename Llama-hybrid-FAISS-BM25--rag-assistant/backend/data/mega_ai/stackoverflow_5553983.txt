Are there any utilities to list all components of a WinForm?

Our previous developer used a plugin (Infragistics) in order to create the UI components (buttons, tabs, docks, labels, etc.) but it requires all of it's DLLs to be included. I'm looking to convert this to a basic WinForm with "stock" UI components without using the Infragistics (smaller install? almost no DLLs). I was wondering if there is a tool/plugin that will list the Name property (possibly more) of all the components/elements in a given WinForm? C# MVS2008
