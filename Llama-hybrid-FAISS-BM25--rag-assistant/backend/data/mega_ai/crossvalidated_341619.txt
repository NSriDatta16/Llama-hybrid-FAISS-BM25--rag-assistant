Why is it valid to use CV to set parameters and hyperparameters but not seeds?

This is a specification or continuation of my prior question: Is it 'fair' to set a seed in a random forest regression to yield the highest accuracy? Its valid to use cross-validation to set parameters. And we can use SKL's GridSearch method, which uses k-fold cross-validation to train hyperparameters. But consensus seems to be that it's not valid to use cross-validation to find the best-performing random_state = seed . Why?
