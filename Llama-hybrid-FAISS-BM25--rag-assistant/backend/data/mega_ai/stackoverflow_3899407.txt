Why is it legal to store a derived type within a base class reference?

Suppose we have declared these two classes: public class Animal { //..... } public class Dog : Animal { //..... } Well, my question is: why below line of code is valid? Animal animal = new Dog(); EDIT: In e-book, "Professional C# 2008", there is a paragraph that says: It's always safe to store a derived type within a base class reference.
