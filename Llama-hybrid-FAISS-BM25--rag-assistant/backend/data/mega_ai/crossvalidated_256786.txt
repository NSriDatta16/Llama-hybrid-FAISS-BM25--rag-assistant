I'm not meaning to use models close to the data collecting process but rather doing continuous Bayesian monitoring of posterior probabilities, which require no penalty for multiplicity. Instead of computing an arbitrary target sample size I'd prefer to compute a maximum possible sample size (for budget approval) and otherwise to stop "when we get the answer" as usually done to good effect in physics. I'll say more about that in my blog http://fharrell.com some day before long.
