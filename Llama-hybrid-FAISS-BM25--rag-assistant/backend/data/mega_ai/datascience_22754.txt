Assuming the output size of your model is an integer (i.e. $\in\mathbb Z ^{[0,100]}$) a vector $\in \mathbb R^{100}$ should definitely be the output to your ANN. This is the most common approach to creating output classification for neural networks. The values of this output vector could be all over the place depending on how your weights are initialized/trained so in order to interpret the output as a probability of belonging to one of the given 100 classes (and sum to 1 as you say) you need to feed the output through a soft max function . You can then take the output of this to get your size class prediction and train using the cross entropy. If your output is continuous the easiest approach is just to have one output size, train on MSE, and get your answer by rounding between 0 and 100.
