Creating pointer to Vector of boost::thread pointers

I am attempting to make a vector of pointers to boost thread objects. This vector then is a member of a class that is created on the heap from a pointer when the class constructor is called. It looks something like this. #ifndef NETWORKSYSTEM_H #define NETWORKSYSTEM_H #include "Network.h" #include "Misc.h" #include "Enumerators.h" #include #include #include #include #include class NetworkSystem { private: Status NetworkStatus; boost::filesystem3::path *ProjectPath; std::string ProjectName; //vector for pointers to networks std::vector *M_Network; //Threading Components boost::thread *MainThread; std::vector *WorkerThreads; void MainThreadFunction(); void WorkerThreadFunction(); public: NetworkSystem(); ~NetworkSystem(); int SetWorkerThreads(int P_WorkerThreads, bool Wait); int TotalNetworks(); int WorkerThreads(); int PauseAtNetworksCompletion(bool Wait); int PauseAtGenerationsCompletion(bool Wait); }; #endif // class constructor NetworkSystem::NetworkSystem() { ProjectPath = new boost::filesystem3::path(); M_Network = new std::vector ; WorkerThreads = new std::vector ; NetworkStatus = NO_PROJECT_OPEN; MainThread = new boost::thread(&NetworkSystem::MainThreadFunction, this); }; Visual C++ 2010 gives me errors with the boost::thread pointer vector. It underlines WorkerThreads in the constructor and says that "expression must be a modifiable lvalue". I have no problems when doing the same thing with the M_Network vector. If you believe this approach to organizing my worker threads into a vector of pointers so I can initialize and manage them individually is bad, then I suppose I COULD use a thread group, but would like to get this method to work. Any help? Thanks.
