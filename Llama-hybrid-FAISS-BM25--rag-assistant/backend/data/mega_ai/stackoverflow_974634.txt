I do not believe it's possible or so easy. When you put a folder under SVN on the client a specific folder structure is created to keep track of what files are locked, changed and so on. Trying to update a server SVN folder without first checking out files or editing files without checking them out (like you want to do) is a BAD idea. A scheduled job that collect your htdocs folder in a zip file, version it via filename and then upload it to some remote storage could be a easier and faster way to manage this.
