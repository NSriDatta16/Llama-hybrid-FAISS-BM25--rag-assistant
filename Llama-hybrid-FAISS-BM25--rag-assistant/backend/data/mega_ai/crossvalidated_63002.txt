Why don't you directly do a PCA on the full set and see where it takes you? PCA is computationally very fast, and you will be able to quickly to determine how many variables seem to be important for the first few components. I have been successful with that number of variables (albeit on a smaller sample size). Alternatively, you can try an approach like regularized PCA or sparse PCA. If you are using R, take a look at the packages "elasticnet" and "mixOmics".
