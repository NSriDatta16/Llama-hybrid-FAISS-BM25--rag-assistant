How do I check if session cookies are enabled in Classic ASP?

What's an elegant way in Classic ASP to check if session cookies are enabled in a user's browser using server side code (because javascript might be disabled as well). I have a solution of my own but it looks ugly as hell. @James - that doesn't differentiate between setting a session cookie and a general purpose cookie though (IE lets you differentiate between First Party, Session Cookies and Third Party, but I see with Firefox they only differentiate between First Party and Third Party)? I'm setting a session value in a login page then doing a Response.Redirect kinda thing and checking to see if the session value is still valid.
