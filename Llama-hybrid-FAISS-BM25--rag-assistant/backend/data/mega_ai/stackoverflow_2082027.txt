I get a warning sign in bottom right object palette window corner saying that window is out of screen bounds. Why is this so? Because the window falls at least partially outside the screen bounds. Any remedy? Put it completely within the screen bounds. Select the window and use the Content Size & Position section of the Size (âŒ˜3) inspector to move it. Simply dragging the window by its title bar will not help, since that position is only for display in IB; it doesn't affect the window that will appear in your app, which is what the warning is about. You need to use the Size inspector.
