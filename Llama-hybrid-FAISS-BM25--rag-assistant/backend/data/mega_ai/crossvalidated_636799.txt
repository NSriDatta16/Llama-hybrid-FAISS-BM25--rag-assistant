Testing binary outcomes with linear regression - R^2 false positives?

There are many reasons not to test binary outcomes with a linear regression (as opposed to a logistic regression). If one did though, is there any scenario in which the F-test for the coefficient of determination ( $R^2$ ) would yield a false-positive? That is, could the F-test be significant when in fact none of the variables in the model would be significant if one tested the model with a logistic regression? For example, if one ran the first model instead of the second: library(palmerpenguins) data(package = 'palmerpenguins') dat = penguins model_linear = lm(as.numeric(sex) ~ ., data = dat) model_log = glm(sex ~ ., data = dat,family = "binomial")
