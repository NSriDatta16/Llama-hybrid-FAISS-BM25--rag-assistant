View contents of my documents directory

I need to verify the correct function of an application I am working with, and can see that the files are being written properly to the users documents directory in the simulator. I need to verify airplane mode, so either I need to be able to see into the documents directory on the phone or put the simulator in airplane mode. I thought that there was a way to view the contents of the phone in the Organizer, but have had no luck. Does anyone have an idea on the above? Thanks!
