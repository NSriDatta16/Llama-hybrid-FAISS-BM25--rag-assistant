How do I remove the seasonality of a time series?

I want to know which is the procedure to remove the seasonality (anual cycle, monthly cycle, daily cycle) of a time serie. I plotted the Autocorrelogram of my time series and I extracted from there the seasonality (in my case, anual cycle), but I don't know how to remove it.
