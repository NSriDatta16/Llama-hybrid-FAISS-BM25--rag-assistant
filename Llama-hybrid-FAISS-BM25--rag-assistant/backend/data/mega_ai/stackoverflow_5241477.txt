Could not add configurable product in Magent community version, shows fatal error?

I'm new to magento and learning things .. First i installed the latest magento 1.5.1.0 and it throws too many error while configuring. As it a very new version and released recently, i installed magento 1.4.2.0 Its also often throwing some fatal errors , i dont know why its happening and almost all errors are related to products. One thing i try to add is a configurable product.. It throws Fatal error: Call to a member function getTable() on a non-object in /app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Mysql4/Collection/Abstract.php on line 454 Do anyone know how to rectify this? I tried to find answers in magento forum but failed.. :(
