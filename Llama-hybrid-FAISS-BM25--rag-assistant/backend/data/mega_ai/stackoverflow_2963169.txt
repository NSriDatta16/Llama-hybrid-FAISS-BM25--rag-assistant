There is a more efficient way, and seems to be using documentFragments if possible. Check it out: http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-documentfragments/ . Also this way should be less error prone and more maintainable than starting to mix up huge strings literals and setting them as innerHTML of some other DOM objects.
