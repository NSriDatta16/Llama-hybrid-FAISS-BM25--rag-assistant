$\bar X$ is a random variable but the denominator customarily would be $N$ rather than $N-1$ . The asymptotics works either way. The second equation would follow by the linearity of the expectation as has already been mentioned. Again the formula customarily would have $N$ in the denominator. The $X_i$ represents a sequence of random variables. It may be easier to think about the special case when they are independent and identically distributed. Do not consider them as the actual sample values. $E(X_i)$ is the population mean $\mu$ . The second equation shows that the sample mean has the same expected value as the individual observations. That does not mean that a realization of the sample mean is always $\mu$ . Rather if you repeatedly generate samples and compute the sample mean, each time the arithmetic average of all these realizations will be close to $\mu$ and converge to $\mu$ as the number of repetitions gets large.
