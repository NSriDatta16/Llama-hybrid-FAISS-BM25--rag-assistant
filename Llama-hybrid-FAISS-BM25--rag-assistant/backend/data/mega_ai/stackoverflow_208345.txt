NoClassDefFoundError when trying to use JMockit Coverage

I am trying to use JMockit's code coverage abilities. Using the JVM parameter -javaagent:jmockit.jar=coverage=.*MyClass.java:html:: I am able to run my tests (jmockit.jar and coverage.jar are on the classpath), unfortunately my log file says: Loaded external tool: mockit.coverage.CodeCoverage=.*MyClass.java:html:: Loaded external tool: mockit.integration.junit3.JUnitTestCaseDecorator Loaded external tool: mockit.integration.junit4.JUnit4ClassRunnerDecorator Exception in thread "Thread-0" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError at mockit.coverage.CodeCoverage$OutputFileGenerator.run(CodeCoverage.java:56) ...and no coverage file is generated. Has anyone gotten JMockit Coverage to work? If so, any thoughts as to what is causing this error? Thanks... Answer : I needed to add coverage to the bootstrap entries rather than only the user entries (in the Eclipse run configuration) Actual Answer The actual answer is that I was running the test with JUnit 3, but the coverage needs JUnit 4. That fixed things, and I didn't have to add any bootstrap entries.
