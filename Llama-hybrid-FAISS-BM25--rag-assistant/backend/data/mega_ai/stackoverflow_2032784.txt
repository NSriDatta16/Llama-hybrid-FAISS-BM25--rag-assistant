application exits prematurely with OpenMp with the error code : Fatal User Error 1002: Not all work-sharing constructs executed by all threads

I added openMp code to some serial code in a simulator applicaton, when I run a program that uses this application the program exits unexpectedly with the output "The thread 'Win32 Thread' (0x1828) has exited with code 1 (0x1)", this happens in the parallel region where I added the OpenMp code, here's a code sample: #pragma omp parallel for private (curr_proc_info, current_writer, method_h) shared (exceptionOccured) schedule(dynamic, 1) for (i = 0 ; i semantics(); } catch( const sc_report& ex ) { ::std::cout The scheduling was static before I made it dynamic, after I added dynamic with a chunk size of 1 the application proceeded a little further before it exited, can this be an indication of what is happening inside the parallel region? thanks
