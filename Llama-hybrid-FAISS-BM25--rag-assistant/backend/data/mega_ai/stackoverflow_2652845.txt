You could use get_object_vars() on one of the stdClass object, iterate through those, and add them to the other: function extend($obj, $obj2) { $vars = get_object_vars($obj2); foreach ($vars as $var => $value) { $obj->$var = $value; } return $obj; } Not sure if you'd deem that more elegant, mind you. Edit: If you're not stingy about actually storing them in the same place, take a look at this answer to a very similar question .
