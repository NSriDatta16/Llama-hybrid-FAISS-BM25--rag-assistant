I generally use the time() function for this. It shows wall clock time, but that's really what I care about in the end. One gotcha with performance testing is the operating system may cache file system related operations. So the second (and later) runs can be much faster than the first run. You generally need to test may operations and average the result to get a good feel for the results of any changes you make. There are so many variables this can help you filter out the noise.
