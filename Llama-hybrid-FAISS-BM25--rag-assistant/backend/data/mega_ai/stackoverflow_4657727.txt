YES ! A page is the most basic element of storage in SQL Server. Of the 8192 bytes on a page, approx. 8060 are available to you as a user. If you can manage to fit your data rows onto the page nicely, they'll take up a lot less storage. If your data row e.g. is 4100 bytes long, only a single row will be stored on a page (and the rest of the page - 3960 bytes - is wasted space). The important point is: those pages aren't just relevant on disk, but also in SQL Server main memory --> you want to try to avoid large areas of space that cannot hold any useful information on a page. If you can manage to reduce your row to take up 4000 bytes, then suddenly you can store two rows on a page, and thus significantly reduce the overhead of wasted space (down to 60 bytes per page).
