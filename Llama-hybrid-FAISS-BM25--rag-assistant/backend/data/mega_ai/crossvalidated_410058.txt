The mean value you will obtain by averaging clipped individual observations is similar to truncated mean. Yet, truncated mean is obtained by symmetrical trimming (same percentage removed from both upper and lower tails). In contrast, gradient clipping is asymmetrical and accordingly yields skewed individual observations. According to Wikipedia ( link ): ... unless the underlying distribution is symmetric, the truncated mean of a sample is unlikely to produce an unbiased estimator for either the mean or the median. Then, your mean gradient estimate will be biased if clipping is applied on each individual prior to averaging.
