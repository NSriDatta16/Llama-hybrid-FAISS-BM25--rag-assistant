Thank You stef and apalala for your help. I wasn't able to actualize your solution, but it did help me visualize an inelegant solution that I was able to make work. I wanted to post my solution here in case someone with as little coding acumen as me may find it useful. What I did was check the list of combinations that I had for every possible combination and if a combination was present I extended a new list of coordinates with the corresponding numbers. I think this is what the solution above would yield in a much more effective way. My purposes only included 120 possible combination, so while tedious, this method was workable. combo = (list (combinations (abcdefghijlmnop, 2)) cords = [] if ('a','b') in combo: cords.append ((0,1)) else:quit I then repeated those last three lines for (a,c) (a,d) and so forth.
