Getting different RMSEs from one PCA model

I'm getting different RMSE values from a same PCA regression model, but I can't seem to figure out why. Here's my code, using the data set Hitters from R package ISLR . hitters From the image, I eyeball a RMSE of about 290 at 7 principal components. But when I calculated the RMSE manually, I didn't get anything near 290. pca.pred Is there anything wrong with my code or my understanding of RMSE for PCA?
