I'll assume that each iPad had a priori the same chance of having mulfunctions (i.e. you tested them on comparable amount of apps and time). If my assumption does not hold, then you simply cannot make inference: maybe all iPads are buggy, but only the first three were actually used and properly tested (and the rest maybe never left their original manufacturer packaging)? Anyway, the data has Poisson distribution, and it seems that you want to predict if the number of failures has anything to do with some predictor. The Poisson regression exactly answers this question. Please mind, that you will need to supply an independent variable that tries to predict the failures. If you want to calculate some sort of significance, please be aware, that the data set is too small for safe out-of-the-box usage of any classical statistical tools. You should at least do bootstraping/permutation testing of statistical significance of fitted regression parameters. Or even better, do Bayesian extension analysis (i.e. Bayesian Poisson regression) which has completely different view on how to draw conclusion from empirical data, and which is proven to work also on extremely small data sets.
