Logistic regression and marginal effect

I'm doing a logistic regression and I'm using a model where all included variables are dummy variables (0 or 1). Let's say we have a model with four independent variables and let the constant represent the reference category. Question: How do we calculate the marginal effect of one of the independent variables if the other independent variables also are dummy variables?
