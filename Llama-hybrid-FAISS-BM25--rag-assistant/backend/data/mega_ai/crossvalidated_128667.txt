Fitting logistic function in R, response unconstrained to 0 < Y < 1

I want to fit a logistic function of the form $$f(t) = \frac{C}{1+ab^{-t}}$$to some data that I have, using R . There is some uncertainty to $f(t)$, and its magnitude is assumed to be constant. There is no uncertainty in $t$. Answers to the question Logistic regression for bounds different from 0 and 1 mention that it's possible, but don't specify how. I am interested in estimating $C$, $a$ and $b$ and also $R^2$.
