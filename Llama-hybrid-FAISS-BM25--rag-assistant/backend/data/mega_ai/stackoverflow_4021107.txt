The only way to not send an unencrypted value which can be used to log in is to use SSL. If the hash gets sent to the server, the hash itself can be sniffed and used to log in. Do it server side. +1 to what ruslik said about the salt. It prevents dictionary/rainbow attacks. A rainbow table for an average password + several bytes of random binary data would be astronomically huge.
