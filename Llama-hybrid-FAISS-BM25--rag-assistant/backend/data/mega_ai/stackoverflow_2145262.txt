It's advised to create a 3rd so called mapping table between the two linked table with two foreign key ID columns. Project ID Tag ID ----------- ----------- 3 1 3 2 3 3 7 5 7 7 Using these, the two foreign keys acts as an index too. So it will speed up dramatically the lookup compared to a FIND_IN_SET method. You are minimizing the file size, as the TEXT data type holds empty spaces for unused bits, while the numeric storage is the best, and uses minimal local storage. Anyway if you want to keep your original way you go this: SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE FIND_IN_SET(5,MultiVals) >0 this will make sure the values are matched by using comma-s so a value of 5 will match just "5" and not "15"
