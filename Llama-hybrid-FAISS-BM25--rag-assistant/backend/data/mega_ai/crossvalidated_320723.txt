Other people have answered your question, let me explain a bit more the philosophy behind the different justfications for logit models. The utility model used in economics is based on the grand idea to link general preference orderings over outcomes with the ordering of real numbers. Less abstractly, what economists have tried to do is to show when any preference over some possible outcomes can be represented by functions that give a "maximum choice", and when this is not possible. This fits very natural with logistic regression when there are only two choices, 0 and 1, and also very well with multinomial models where there are more choices. Given distributional assumptions, the logistic regression therefore "arises" naturally out of a microfounded and very general model of human behavior. This is nice for economists, because many results they are after abstractly require the existence of such preferences to make sense more than just heuristically. The same is true for other social sciences that rely on choice, but their focus is often different. One can posit a discrete choice model either as a utility model, or a latent variable model. The latent variable model (where $y=1$ if some $y*>t$) is also basically a choice model, only that it does not specify why this decision rule comes about. Sometimes we are not interested in modeling this why. For example, we may simply not care, because some otherwise stable but complicated mechanism is behind it. It may also be the case that there is no actual entity making a decision, it is in a sense a purely statistical affair. It would then be rather contrived to think about some hypothetic preference orderings by some non-entity. So to answer your question: The utility model is not necessary at all. It depends on your research question. Is there an entity making a decision? If so, are you trying to learn something about this decisionmaking? If yes, then all approaches will sooner or later lead to a utility model, simply because you need to find stable or logical "preferences" in your research. In other applications, utility is not necessary at all (especially outside of social sciences this may be the case, say a mechanical model) and it would be unnecessary and even harmful to argue with the utility model.
