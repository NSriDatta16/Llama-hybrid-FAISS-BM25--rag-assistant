A touch is a rather imprecise gesture, so getting all the pixels that one encompasses is not really possible. However, you can get the rough 'center' of a touch, and extrapolate an area around that for a group of 'touched pixels'. No need to use a low level SDK, just override -touchesBegan:withEvent: on UIView.
