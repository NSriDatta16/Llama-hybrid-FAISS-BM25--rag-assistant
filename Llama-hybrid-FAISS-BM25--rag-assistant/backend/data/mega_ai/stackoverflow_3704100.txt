Thanks for the email mattcodes, thought I'd jump onto SO to reply to you. Unfortunately, I don't think the Simple Sales Tracking API will enable the .js file either. The API itself has good coverage and access to data. Often what's available through an API can be quite limited. Anyways, have a look at the API details page. Any questions or feedback, just drop us another note. http://www.simplesalestracking.com/api.aspx If you're using .net, there's a dll api wrapper library ready to go. Also a c# sample application.
