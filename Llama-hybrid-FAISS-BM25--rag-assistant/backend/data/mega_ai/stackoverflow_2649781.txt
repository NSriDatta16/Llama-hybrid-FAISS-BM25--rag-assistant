Graphviz DOT arrange Nodes in circles, layout too "compact"

I'm halfway there please see the edit OK here's my problem, I'm generating a graph of a python module, including all the files with their functions/methods/classes. I want to arrange it so, that nodes gather in circles around their parent nodes, currently everything is on one gargantuan horizontal row, which makes the thing >50k pixels wide and also let's the svg converter fail(only renders about the half of the graph). I went through the docs but couldn't find anything that seems to do the trick. So the question is: Is there a simple way to do this or do I have to layout the whole thing by myself? :/ EDIT: Thanks to Andrews comment I've got the right layout, the only problem now is that it's a bit to "compact"... so the question now is, how to fix this?
