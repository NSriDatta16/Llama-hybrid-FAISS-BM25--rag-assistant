There's no substitute for diving into the code. Try to find a driver or subsystem that you're interested in and poke around with it. With tools like VMware Workstation it's super easy to make whatever changes you want, snapshot the VM, and run your modified kernel. If the kernel panics on boot, who cares? Just jump back to the snapshot and fix the problem. For books, I strongly recommend Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love. It's a wonderfully written book -- lots of information, organized sanely, and humorous... not dry reading at all.
