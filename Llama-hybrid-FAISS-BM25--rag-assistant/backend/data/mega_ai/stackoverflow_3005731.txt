You can use GWT by itself and support it on your own server. I'm not too familiar with google app engine, but from the website, it says: "Risk free trial period Not only is creating an App Engine application easy, it's free! You can create an account and publish an application that people can use right away at no charge, and with no obligation. An efficient application on a free account can use up to 1GB of storage and up to 5 million page views a month. When you are ready for more, you can enable billing, set a maximum daily budget, and allocate your budget for each resource according to your needs." It sounds like it is free for as along as you stay below the above quotas.
