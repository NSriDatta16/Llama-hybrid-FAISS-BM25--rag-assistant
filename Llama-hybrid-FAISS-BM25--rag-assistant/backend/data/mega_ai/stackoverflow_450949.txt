Time-block user agents that make so-many requests per minute. Eg if you've got somebody requesting a page exactly every 5 seconds for 10 minutes, they're probably not a user... But it could be tricky to get this right. If they trigger an alert, redirect every request to a static page with as little DB-IO as possible with a message letting them know they'll be allowed back on in X minutes. It's important to add that you should probably only apply this on requests for pages and ignore all the requests for media (js, images, etc).
