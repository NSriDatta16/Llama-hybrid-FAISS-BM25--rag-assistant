Estimate of the variance

If we have a set of samples $x_1 ,\dots, x_N$ and we denote with $\bar x = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i x_i$ their average, then the sample variance is defined as $s^2=\frac{1}{N-1} \sum(x_i - \bar x)^2$ (see [1], for example). I have found that someone says that the sample estimate of the variance is $s^2=\frac{1}{N^2}\sum_i \sum_{i'} (x_i - x_{i'})^2 $ (see formula (14.27) of [2]) "Sample variance" and "sample estimate of the variance" should be the same thing, right? However, I don't find how the 1st formula equates the 2nd. Has anyone any idea? Thanks! [1] https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/66 [2] Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Friedman, J.
