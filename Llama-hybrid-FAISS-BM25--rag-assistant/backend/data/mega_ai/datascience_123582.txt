There are three main reasons for using cosine and sine functions in the transformer encoding formula: Periodicity: They have repetitive patterns, which is useful for attention mechanism in a trackable manner. Constrained values: It bound the values between -1 and +1. In the actual attention matrix, words far away will exhibit lesser values. Easy to extrapolate for long sequences and easy to compute.
