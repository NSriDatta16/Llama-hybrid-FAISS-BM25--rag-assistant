Mostly I organize my projects as follows: Solution.Core Solution.Configuration Solution.Services Solution.Presentation Solution.Web More information about this kind of structure could be found at Arc wiki All service interfaces and domain entities goes to Core project. Services project contains implementation of Application Services . Contollers and View Models are in Presentation project. If my controller needs a service I reference it's interface in Controller's constructor and wire it to real implementation via IoC/DI container. Workflows won't contain only business logic, so I encapsulate business logic as small services/commands and call them from workflows. That leaves workflows to Services project. WCF services implementations should be in Services project and interfaces in Core . This way it should look like Controller > Service > Workflow > Uses other services to get a result. For WCF services it's needed to configure endpoint and it should look Service > Workflow > Uses other services to get a result.
