Are you able to create an SQL string and then execute it? The string would look like this: SELECT * FROM yourtable WHERE (name='country' AND value='Canada') AND (name='province' AND value!='Alberta') AND (name='first_name' AND value LIKE '%jim%) EDIT: I see. Multiple records. So try joining them. This is not correct SQL syntax but should look similar: SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM yourtable WHERE (name='country' AND value='Canada')) JOIN on visitor_input_id (SELECT * FROM yourtable WHERE (name='province' AND value!='Alberta')) JOIN on visitor_input_id (SELECT * FROM yourtable WHERE (name='first_name' AND value LIKE '%jim%))
