Include a 'time' variable in an interrupted time series regression analysis?

I have a time series where a specific event occurs. I want to see if there is a significant difference in the mean pre- and post- event. The time series is first adjusted for seasonality, and then run as follows: Adjusted Values = B0 + B1*Pre/PostFlag + B2*OtherFactors I am arguing that you MUST have another regressor that accounts for the fact that the observations in the regression are still a series - that is, there is order to them, even though trend and seasonality is removed. Otherwise it doesn't account for the fact that this is a time series, and our observations are in a particular order. Like this: Adjusted Values = B0 + B1*Time + B2*Pre/PostFlag + B3*OtherFactors How do I convince my friend that the latter is correct?
