I have been trying to find a more elegant solution myself. One convulted way is to add a custom field to the Sprint Backlog Item type called "CurrentSprintEndDate", and update it thru a custom event handler that will change this field when the item's iteration path field changes. The you could write similar queries as you were doing above agains that field such as "CurrentSprintEndDate > @Today". But that is a lot fo work for something that would seemingly be simple.
