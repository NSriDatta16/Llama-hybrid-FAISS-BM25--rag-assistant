You could use IsolatedStorage to store data for you application. I do not think that you can download and run applications from Isolated Storage though. You could create a Virtual Drive and mount it using the tools available in Windows 7 and then use Windows permissions and other OS tricks to make it only accessible to you. I'm not sure about making it invisible to all users, but it could be inaccessible to anyone other than you. If you aren't running Windows 7, I think there are other ways to achieve the same effect.
