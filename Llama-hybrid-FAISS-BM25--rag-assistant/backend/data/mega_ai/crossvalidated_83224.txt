Regarding switch from pure mathematics to machine learning: opinions and information

I'm a first year postdoc in pure mathematics (geometry/topology with strong background in analysis) with undergraduate statistics and probability background (with also measure theoretic probability). I also have some programming knowledge in ForTran, C and Matlab, but I never used them in my pure mathematics career in my graduate school. In my next job, I'm considering doing a postdoc in machine learning. The reason behind this switch is: I'm satisfied with my pure knowledge so far and have been wanting to see some real-life applications of mathematics, and also keep my options open in both industry and academia. My questions are: 1) How hard is the switch going to be? I guess I've all the required mathematics background, but will it be hard to pick up the necessary computer science skills, even if I work in more theory-oriented problems? 2) Is there a website/email-list where I can get notifications on jobs in machine learning? I'm looking for jobs in Europe mostly. Thanks and much appreciation :)
