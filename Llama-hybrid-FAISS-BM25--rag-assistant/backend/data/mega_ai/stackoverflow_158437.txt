Just as an FYI, there's a big difference to "dragging controls" around, and doing what Explorer does, which is Drag and Drop, specifically with files. That's what you'll want to look up, how to do drag and drop from a WPF app to something else. You'll need something that creates a Data Object (IDataObject) or whatever they call that in WPF world, and then you need to call DoDragDrop (again, or whatever is analogous to this in WPF) to start the dragging. Doing what explorer does is also possible, put I suspect you need ot make some lower level calls to accomplish this. Take a look at http://www.codeproject.com/KB/wtl/wtl4mfc10.aspx to see the stuff you need ot look for. WPF may in fact wrap all this up, but if it doesn't these are some of the things you need to look into, especially IDragSourceHelper.
