Order of Predictors in R Neuralnet formula

I am having trouble understanding why the order of predictors in the formula of the nn function of R neuralnet package changes the resulting network. Here is a reproducible example with 2 inputs, and a categorical output. Initialization of the data set.seed(1) density=runif(100,0,1) residual.sugar=runif(100,0,1) quality=round(runif(100,0,1)) Constructing the data frame mydata=data.frame(density, residual.sugar, quality) First neural network. Notice the order of predictors - density first then residual sugar set.seed(3) nn Second neural network. Notice that I changed the order of predictors - now residual sugar comes first followed by density set.seed(3) nn I expect the 2 runs of the nn function to produce networks that are equivalent to each other, in other words I expect that although the weights and biases would swap on the network - the error and the number of steps that it takes for the network to converge should be identical. However, as you will see when you run the above code the 2 networks are drastically different. Why?
