I'd highly advise you not to use your code in a live environment, ever. Instead, use Client-URL . For example, you can do it like this: $ch = curl_init(); // the website curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'http://www.example.com/path/to/webpage'); // this line sets up curl so the website contents will be returned curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); // the user agent, for example firefox curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 GTB5'); $html = curl_exec($ch); If you absolutely need to execute the code afterwards, then you can perform a lot of checking and eval() it, but only if you have to. A better approach would be some kind of dictionary.
