I was having the same exact issue, but my code was slightly different. I managed to figure out that jquery will remember the position of the sortable, so if you move it or change it (with toggle or sorting the parent element), then it will forget its position. The solution is to refresh the sortable every time its position is changed. In my case, I attached the following code to the parent sortable's update event and my toggle: $('.sortable-item').sortable('refresh'); UPDATE: I forked the Jsfiddle into a new one: http://jsfiddle.net/zf26q/ Notice the additions: $('.draggedcontent').sortable('refresh'); update: function(event, ui){ $('.draggedcontent').sortable('refresh'); } I can't replicate the problem. Let me know if that solves your issue.
