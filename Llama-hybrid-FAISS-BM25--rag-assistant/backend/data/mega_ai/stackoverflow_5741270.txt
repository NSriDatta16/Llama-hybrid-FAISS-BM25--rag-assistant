A simple kludge to get rid of this problem would be simply to enclose the query in: if (userName =! "user") { //code here } else { //open dialog about invalid username } Although i'm sure there's a more elegant solution. Input Data sanitizing should be done anyways, and if you're already checking for invalids, maybe just add "user" into the list of rejecteds?
