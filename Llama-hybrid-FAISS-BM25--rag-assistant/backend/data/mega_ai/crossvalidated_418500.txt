feature selection and random forest

I did some research in WEKA. and try to predict something using five different machine learning algorithms. the accuracy was around 85. after doing feature selection, the accuracy increase a little, but only the accuracy of the random forest algorithm decrease from 86 to 81. do someone know or can think why is that happen?
