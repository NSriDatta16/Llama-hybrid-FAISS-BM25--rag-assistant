Rules are a way of expressing additional things that can be inferred from your dataset. Some inferences can be gleaned from the ontology model itself, but others may not be expressible in the ontology language (usually OWL) and require a more functional representation. You should note that SWRL never quite became a standard and its usage is beginning to be discouraged. See the question latest best support for SWRL at answers.semanticweb.com Edit: You should consider instead using SPIN. To quote this thread : now that SPIN is a W3C submission, it has reached the same standard status as SWRL. Furthermore, SPIN has key advantages to SWRL: It uses SPARQL - a standard supported by every RDF store Unlike SWRL, SPIN is an active effort. SWRL has been made obsolete by RIF while SPIN is complementary to RIF RIF is an in-progress W3C effort, which once standardized would deprecate SWRL. SPIN is a W3C Team Submission , an inference engine called TopSpin exists within Top Braid Composer . The answers.semanticweb.com community may be of more help.
