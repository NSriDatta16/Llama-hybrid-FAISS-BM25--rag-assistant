Is changing the number of an enum a breaking change?

Consider the following code: public enum SomeCode { NIF = 0 ,NIE = 1 ,CIF = 2 ,PAS = 3 ,NIN = 4 ,SSN = 5 ,OTH = 5 ,UKN = 6 } Would changing OTH = 5 to OTH = 7 be a breaking change? Edit: I never store the int value, only ever the text representation of the enum. It may be used in other DLLs, but will use the same storage.
