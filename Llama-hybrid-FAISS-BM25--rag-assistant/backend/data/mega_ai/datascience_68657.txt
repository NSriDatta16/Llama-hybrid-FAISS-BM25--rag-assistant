I will definitely try one more approach in this case, which is explained below. Will use simple CNN architecture, followed by fully connected layers. Say, now I have fully connected layer(FL) of size 100. Using this FL apply another liner regression model(followed by activation layer...). Structure of linear regression would be: y = w1i.FL(Ni)+ w2i.f1+ w3i.f2...and so on. Ni = ith Neuron f1, f2.. are the non image feature. w1i, w2i, w3i.. are the weights What I'm trying to achieve is, using the output of each FL neuron, I will create a linear regression model, where other features would be your non-image data. Here my assumption is during training, it will boost the weights of neurons based upon the non-image data as well.
