C# Microsoft.Reporting.Winforms RDLC - how to add detail sections in body?

I am rendering a Winforms.LocalReport and would like to know if it is possible, and how to add Detail/Sections to the body of the report like in MS Access Report and Crystal Reports. Organising into details will help manage page breaks and also general designing easier when adding new / removing existing fields. I have 300 over fields not including subreports. OR, has this feature been superceded by some other better feature? Appreciate any advice thanks!
