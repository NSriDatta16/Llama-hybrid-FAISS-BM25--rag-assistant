Numbered paragraphs with reportlab

I'm trying to use reportlab , but I'm finding the user guide not clear enough.. (maybe it's just me) I have the following code for item in content: text = item.name p = Paragraph(text,style,'*') and it renders exactly as expected. But what if I want numbering instead of bullets ? The user guide is really vague about this situation...
