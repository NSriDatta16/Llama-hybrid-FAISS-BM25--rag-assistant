I don't think that the .Net framework provides what you want. First of all, not all languages have alphabets in the western sense of the word. Second, even if you limit your coverage to those languages that have alphabets, iterating through the contents of a code page won't work because many code pages cover several languages (eg, CP 1252 covers the main western european languages). Third, some of the more recently supported languages on Windows don't have code pages. I don't think there is a solution outside of having a priori knowledge of the alphabets of the languages you're interested in. Perhaps if you explained what you are trying to achieve, a better solution could be suggested.
