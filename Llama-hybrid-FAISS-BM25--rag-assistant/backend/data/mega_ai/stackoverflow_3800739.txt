I am guessing you are using the SQL timestamp type in your table and you are expecting it to be a DateTime. Timestamp isn't really meant for holding Date/Time information. From MSDN (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa260631(SQL.80).aspx): timestamp is a data type that exposes automatically generated binary numbers, which are guaranteed to be unique within a database. timestamp is used typically as a mechanism for version-stamping table rows. The storage size is 8 bytes.storage size is 8 bytes. Change your column "Create_Timestamp" to DateTime and you should be fine.
