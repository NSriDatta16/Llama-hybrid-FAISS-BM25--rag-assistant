There is a trivial answer -- there is no parameter estimation in machine learning! We don't assume that our models are equivalent to some hidden background models; we treat both reality and the model as black boxes and we try to shake the model box (train in official terminology) so that its output will be similar to that of the reality box. The concept of not only likelihood but the whole model selection based on the training data is replaced by optimizing the accuracy (whatever defined; in principle the goodness in desired use) on the unseen data; this allows to optimize both precision and recall in a coupled manner. This leads to the concept of an ability to generalize, which is achieved in different ways depending on the learner type. The answer to the question two depends highly on definitions; still I think that the nonparametric statistics is something that connects the two.
