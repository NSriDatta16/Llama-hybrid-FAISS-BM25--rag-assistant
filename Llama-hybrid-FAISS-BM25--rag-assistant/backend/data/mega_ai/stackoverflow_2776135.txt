Last Observation Carried Forward In a data frame?

I wish to implement a "Last Observation Carried Forward" for a data set I am working on which has missing values at the end of it. Here is a simple code to do it (question after it): LOCF Now this works great for simple vectors. But if I where to try and use it on a data frame: a It will turn my data frame into a character matrix. Can you think of a way to do LOCF on a data.frame, without turning it into a matrix? (I could use loops and such to correct the mess, but would love for a more elegant solution)
