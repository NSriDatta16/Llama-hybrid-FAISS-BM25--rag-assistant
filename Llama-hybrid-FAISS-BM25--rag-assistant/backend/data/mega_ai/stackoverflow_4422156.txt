The query you posted should work (although I would strongly recommend that you use the JOIN keyword rather than the comma syntax). I suspect that your problem is that your tables have not been created correctly. Use the following commands to debug the problem - and pay particular attention to the data types: SHOW CREATE TABLE table1; SHOW CREATE TABLE table2; You might also want to check that the row you expect in the result set really does exist in both tables: SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE app_id = '12003'; SELECT * FROM table2 WHERE app_id = '12003';
