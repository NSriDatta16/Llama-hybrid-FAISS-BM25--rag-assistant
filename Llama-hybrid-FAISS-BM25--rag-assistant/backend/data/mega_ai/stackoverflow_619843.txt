The Perl module WWW::Mechanize does exactly that. Your example would look something like this: use WWW::Mechanize; my $agent = WWW::Mechanize->new; $agent->get("http://apphost/report"); my $response = $agent->submit_form( with_fields => { field_1_name => 123, field_2_name => "hello", }, ); There is also a Python port, and I guess similar libraries exist for many other languages.
