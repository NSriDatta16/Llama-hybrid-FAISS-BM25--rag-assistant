Writing a web application gui. Which technology should I use?

I would like to write a somewhat complex web gui application. It will be used to edit certain content by displaying panels and allowing the user to drag items to edit the content. The explanation is somewhat abstract, but the point is that i'm looking for a modern gui writing technology, the more standard it is the better odds of me finding information and samples to using it. I've been using JavaFaces to write some simple web pages and have taken a look at RichFaces for purposes of writing the app described above. I would love to hear recommendation of similar technologies (For example - What was used to write this website?) Thank you!!! Update : Thanks for the answers so far, Since I was asked for more clarification I'll try to explain the use of the app: It will be used to edit a complex script. There will be one panel with the actions of the scripts (The phases) and the other panel will show the content of the currently selected action. To each action type there will be a different set of attributes to modify. You will be able to reorder actions by dragging them to a new location (Kinda like powerpoint slides organizer or flickr photo organizer) and also copy them that way. The content of the action attribute panel will be able to display various types of content such as html text and buttons and all kinds of stuff. Hope that helps. Thanks Again! Update2 : After reading this StackOverflow Thread I'm leaning towards RichFaces for it's vast support and standardization.
