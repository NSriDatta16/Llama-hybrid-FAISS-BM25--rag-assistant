The average treatment effect can be expressed in logits, as an odds ratio, as relative risk, or as risk difference. Many people prefer risk difference, as in: "The treatment increased positive outcomes by 5 percentage points." The function I use to convert between OR and risk difference (called "lift" in marketing and advertising contexts) is: or_to_lift Where or is an odds ratio and c is the baseline (i.e., control) proportion. So, if there was an odds ratio of 1.3 and a control treatment incidence of .5, I would say that the lift (a.k.a., risk difference) was .065 or 6.5 percentage points. All of these represent the average treatment effect, though, when it is collapsed across all subgroups in the sample (i.e., you don't include any interactions).
