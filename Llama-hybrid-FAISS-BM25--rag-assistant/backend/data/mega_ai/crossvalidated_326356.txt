I have puzzled over this question but never came with a satisfying solution. One property that is of possible use is that, if a density writes $$f(x)=\frac{g(x)-\omega h(x)}{1-\omega}\qquad \omega>0$$ where $g$ is a density such that $g(x)\ge \omega h(x)$ , simulating from $g$ and rejecting these simulations with probability $\omega h(x)/g(x)$ delivers simulations from $f$ . In the current case, $g$ is the normalised version of the positive weight components $$g(x)=\sum_{\alpha_i>0} \alpha_i f_i(x) \big/ \sum_{\alpha_i>0} \alpha_i$$ and $\omega h$ is the remainder $$h(x)=\sum_{\alpha_i This is indeed found in the simulation bible of Devroye, Non-uniform random variate generation , Section II.7.4, but follows from a simple accept-reject reasoning. A first computational drawback of this approach is that, despite simulating first from a chosen component $f_i$ , the sums in both $g$ and $h$ must be computed for the rejection step. If the sums are infinite with no closed form version, this makes the accept-reject method impossible to implement . A second difficulty is that, since both sums of weights are of the same order $$\sum_{\alpha_i>0}\alpha_i = 1 - \sum_{\alpha_i the rejection rate $$1-\varrho^\text{accept}=\sum_{\alpha_i has no upper limit. Actually if the series associated with the $\alpha_i$ 's is not absolutely converging, the acceptance probability is zero! And the method cannot be implemented in this situation. In the case of a mixture representation, if $f$ can be written as $$f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \alpha_i \frac{g_i(x)-\omega_i h(x_i)}{1-\omega_i}\qquad \omega_i>0$$ the component can be chosen first and then the method applied to the component. But this may be delicate to implement, identifying pairs $(g_i,h_i)$ that fit $g_i(x)-\omega_i h(x_i)>0$ from the possibly infinite sum being not necessarily feasible. I think a more efficient resolution could come from the series representation itself. Devroye, Non-uniform random variate generation , Section IV.5, contains a large range of series methods. As for instance the following algorithm for an alternate series representation of the target $$f(x)=\kappa h(x)\{1-a_1(x)+a_2(x)-\cdots\}$$ when the $a_i(x)$ 's converge to zero with $n$ and $h$ is a density: The problem has been considered recently in the context of debiasing biased estimators for MCMC, as for instance in the Glynn-Rhee approach . And the Russian roulette estimator (with a connection with the Bernoulli factory problem). And the unbiased MCMC methodology . But there is no escape from the sign issue... Which makes its use challenging when estimating densities as in pseudo-marginal methods. Upon further thinking, my conclusion is that there is no generic method to produce an actual simulation from this series [rather than mixture which turns out to be a misnomer], without imposing further > structure to the elements of the series, like the one in the above algorithm from Devroye's bible . Indeed, since most (?) densities allow for a series expansion of the kind above, this would otherwise imply the existence of a sort of universal simulation machine...
