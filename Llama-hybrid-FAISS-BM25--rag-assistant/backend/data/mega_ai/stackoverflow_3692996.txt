How to find the average of multiple columns in a file using python

Hi I have a file that consists of too many columns to open in excel. Each column has 10 rows of numerical values 0-2 and has a row saying the title of the column. I would like the output to be the name of the column and the average value of the 10 rows. The file is too large to open in excel 2000 so I have to try using python. Any tips on an easy way to do this. Here is a sample of the first 3 columns: Trial1 Trial2 Trial3 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 2 2 1 1 1 I want python to output as a test file Trial 1 Trial 2 Trial 3 1 2 1 (whatever the averages are)
