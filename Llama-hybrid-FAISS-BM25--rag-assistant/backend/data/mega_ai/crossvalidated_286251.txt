How can i sample from posterior distribution which contains integration using MCMC?

I want to find sample from posterior distribution but it is complex, so i want to sample the posterior using MCMC. The posterior distribution contains integration (because the reliability function is not in closed form). My question is,How can i sample from this posterior. The full conditional posterior is not well known,so i canot to use Gibbs sampling.I will use Metropolis-Hastings algorithm but what i can do with the integration in posterior distribution. I want to use R programm.
