How to monitorJVM and Applications using SNMP

I understand that JVMs can be managed using SNMP and JVMs come with support for JVM-MANAGEMENT-MIB. Is there a way to program/extend the SNMP AGENT functionality which is associated with a JVM? Is there a way to add support for any other proprietary/standard MIBs to the SNMP Agent on JVM, so that I can allow my applications running on the JVM to be monitered by external management applications with out making use of a third-party SNMP Agent library?
