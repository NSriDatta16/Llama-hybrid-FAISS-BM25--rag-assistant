Due to the branching of a random forest, you have many discontinuities. More so, you have flat regions within each leaf. That means even if you can calculate the gradients, they will be zero everywhere except at the borders of partitions--where it is undefined. That makes it somewhat impossible to use them as a top layer for deep nets and training with gradient-based techniques.
