Using Random Forest vote scores as a matching variable?

I am working on a project where we need to identify good counterfactuals / matches for a binary treatment, which is regressed against a binary outcome. The "treatment" that we seek to study is quite fuzzy, and there is no certain way to decide on specific matching variables without inviting to significant critique. In this, I am thinking about using a Random Forest algorithm to produce voting scores for each individual and year in the dataset, based on a barrage of information available on them for each year, and then select the counterfactual to each treated individual based on other individuals that have an equal voting score for the end outcome (interpreted as probability of yielding the same end-outcome). In this process, I now have the following two question: Does it make sense to use voting scores as a basis for selecting counterfactuals? (i.e., in similarity to using a conventional PSM or CEM) Are there any literatures that contain examples of this? I have searched Google Scholar far and wide, but the only things that I have found are on image processing. Edit: All vote scores are also transformed using Platt scaling Sincerely Johan
