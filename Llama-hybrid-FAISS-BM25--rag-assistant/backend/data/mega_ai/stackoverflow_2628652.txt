Is there anyway to turn off the url "cliking" sound in IE using html, javascript, or flash?

I have a flash application written in action script 2, and at one point it makes multiple back-to-back JavaScript requests using getUrl(). They have to be done as separate requests because IE had a limit on the length of a single request, and fails silently if that limit is passed. When ever this happens, if the user has their sound turned on there is a barrage of "click click click".
