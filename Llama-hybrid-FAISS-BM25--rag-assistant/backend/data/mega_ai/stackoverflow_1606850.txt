According to tcp.org its possible for SQL Server 2005 to get 1,379 transactions per second. Here is a link to a system that's done it. (There are SQL Server based systems on that site that have far more transactions... the one I linked was just the first I one I looked at). Of course, as Kragen mentioned, whether you can achieve these results is impossible for anyone here to say.
