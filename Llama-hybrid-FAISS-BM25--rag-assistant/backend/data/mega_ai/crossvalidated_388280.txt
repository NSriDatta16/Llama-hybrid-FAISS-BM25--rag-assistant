What does it mean to "interpret the sigmoid $\sigma(\theta^Tx)$ as a probability"?

In Goodfellow's Deep learning text, it is written Is this way of defining a probability $p(y=1| x;\theta)$ even legal? Recall the definition of a probability given a random variable where $p_X$ is the probability mass function. Is the logistic function $\sigma$ considered to be a probability mass function? If so, what plausible process is responsible for generating this probability mass function? (i.e., a process similar to how geometric or Bernoulli pmf are defined)
