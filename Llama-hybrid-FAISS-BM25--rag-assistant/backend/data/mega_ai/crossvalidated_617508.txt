I'm not sure there's a "best way" for this. All your results will have to be taken with a big pinch of salt, given that you are basically guessing the exposure time, and you don't know if your estimates are biased. Some options are: Use your own knowledge of how the exposure times were guessed, to choose the best one and go with that. This is the simplest option, but does not account for any uncertainty in the exposure. Use inverse variance weights in regression. For each point, find the variance of the exposure estimates, and use the inverse of the variance as a "weight" for each observation. This assumes that on average, any estimate of exposure rate is unbiased. A bit more complicated. Run the regression multiple times, once for each estimation method for exposure time. Critically examine the results (not just p-values; check for sense against your expert knowledge). If they are consistent, and that's some support for your hypothesis. Apply your method of estimating exposure time, to Rate B (for which you do have exact exposure times). Use that to quantify how "good" your exposure estimates are via regression or some other form of analysis. Then, based upon those findings, pick one of the above methods to estimate the relationship between exposure and occurrences. Note on implications of guessing exposure times: If they are randomly centered around zero, it's just adding noise to the estimate. So no bias, but you're less likely to pick up an effect. If exposure is over-estimated, then your estimate of Rate A will be too low. If exposure is under-estimated, then your estimate of Rate A will be too high.
