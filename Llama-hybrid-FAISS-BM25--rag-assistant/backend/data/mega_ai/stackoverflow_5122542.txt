Adding extra fields to django-registration form

I have a model called "Organization" that I've setup as a User profile and I would like to have the fields from the "Organization" model show up on the registration page. How do I go about doing this with django-registration. # models.py class Organization(models.Model): user = models.ForeignKey(User, unique=True) logo = models.ImageField(upload_to='organizations') name = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, unique=True) # more fields below etc. # settings.py AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'volunteering.organization'
