Since you are already aware of the Web service and socket approach, I'll mention some other options. If you like simplicity, check out XML-RPC . This is what SOAP was before large standards committees and corporate interests began to control the specification. You can find implementations of XML-RPC for just about every major programming language out there. Hessian is an interesting binary protocol that has many fans and supports just about every major language as well. Protocol Buffers is popular within Google. The official version from Google does not support C#. However, the two highest rep users of SO do provide ports of protobuf for the .Net space. I will probably be ridiculed for this, but also take a look at CORBA. It's not in vogue these days, but has many substantial technical creds, especially if one end of the communication is C++. IMHO, it's WS-* with OO support and no angle brackets required. For interop, I think it still should have a seat at the table. When engaged in C++ development, I found OmniOrb to be quite effective and efficient. Take a look at this SO Question for some pointers concerning using CORBA in .Net.
