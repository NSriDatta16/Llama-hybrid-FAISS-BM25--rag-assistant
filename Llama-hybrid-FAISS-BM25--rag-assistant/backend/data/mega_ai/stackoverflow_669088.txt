Embedding View files as resource inside Binary

I am trying to create a .Net Library with few Controllers, and i want to reuse them in Multiple web projects. I'm half way through, But problem i'm getting is , Whenever i add the library to the new web project , i need to copy all corresponding view files separately to the new project. Whenever i update the library, i need to repeat the steps again. Is there any way , i can embed View files inside dll as resource , and pass it to "View()" function as an embedded resource. What i want to achieve is , I want to put controller and corresponding views inside single dll file, so that i can easily distribute/manage the library as a single dll file ( Oneway i already found , is creating custom view class with IView Interface and Render the output directly by writing to HTML Output Writer, But i prefer to use the View file.)
