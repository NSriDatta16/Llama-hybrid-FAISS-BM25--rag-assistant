Rails: display @cars as a comma-separated list

Based on this query: @cars = Car.where("manufacturer_id IN ?", @mfts.select("id")).limit(30).select("id") How can I display the cars' IDs in the view like this (or do I need to rewrite my query)? 3,2,5,12,15,24,34,63,64,65,66,85 Thanks a lot - I've looked for this but couldn't find the right question/answer. One solution is to do: #view , I don't know if there's a better way to go about it - this obviously leaves a stray comma at the end of the list (which isn't a dealbreaker). Any more elegant solutions?
