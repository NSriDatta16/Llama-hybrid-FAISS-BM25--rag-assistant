Http protocol content-length

I am working on a simple download application. While making a request for the following file both firefox and my application doesn't get the content-length field. But if i make the request using wget server does send the content-length field. I did change wgets user agent string to test and it still got the content-length field. Any ideas why this is happening? wget request ---request begin--- GET /dc-13/video/2005_Defcon_V2-P_Zimmerman-Unveiling_My_Next_Big_Project.mp4 HTTP/1.0 User-Agent: test Accept: */* Host: media.defcon.org Connection: Keep-Alive ---request end--- HTTP request sent, awaiting response... ---response begin--- HTTP/1.0 200 OK Server: lighttpd Date: Sun, 05 Apr 2009 04:40:08 GMT Last-Modified: Tue, 23 May 2006 22:18:19 GMT Content-Type: video/mp4 Content-Length: 104223909 Connection: keep-alive firefox request GET /dc-13/video/2005_Defcon_V2-P_Zimmerman-Unveiling_My_Next_Big_Project.mp4 HTTP/1.1 Host: media.defcon.org User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032608 Firefox/3.0.8 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Referer: http://www.defcon.org/html/links/defcon-media-archives.html Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache HTTP/1.x 200 OK Server: lighttpd Date: Sun, 05 Apr 2009 05:20:12 GMT Last-Modified: Tue, 23 May 2006 22:18:19 GMT Content-Type: video/mp4 Transfer-Encoding: chunked Update: Is there a header that I can send that will tell Lighthttpd not to use chunked encoding.My original problem is that I am using urlConnection to grab the file in my java application which automatically sends HTTP 1.1 request. I would like to know the size of the file so i can update my percentage.
