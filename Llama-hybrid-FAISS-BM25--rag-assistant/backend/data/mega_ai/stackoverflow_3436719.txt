Is there a way to discern an iPhone 3G/S visitor to an iPhone 4 visitor?

I want to load higher resolution pictures for iPhone 4 users, but the only way I know of detecting users is by a user-agent. But I'm under the impression that the user-agent of MobileSafari on any iOS4 phone is the same across the board. What could I do to detect an iPhone 4?
