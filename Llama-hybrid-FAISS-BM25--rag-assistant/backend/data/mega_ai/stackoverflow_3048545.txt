CakePHP Routing Problem

I suffered a CakePHP Route Problem. I can only access the root " / " and it shows the CakePHP default welcome home page. Later I try to write my controller (icons_controller.php) and views (views/icons/index.ctp), it has problem. I typed in http://localhost:8080/myapp/icons/ It always says " Not Found The requested URL /myapp/icons/ was not found on this server. " In my routers.php file it has: Router::connect('/', array('controller' => 'pages', 'action' => 'display', 'home')); Router::connect('/pages/*', array('controller' => 'pages', 'action' => 'display')); I create a controller in the icons_controller.php file like: set('icons', $this->Icon->find('all')); } } ?> And it should simple open the file with only a paragraph tag text (in /views/icons/index.ctp) My Icons But I cannot open the index.ctp by using localhost:8080/myapp/icons/ . So later I tried to modify my routers.php file like this, it works fine with the url http://localhost:8080/myapp/ : Router::connect('/', array('controller' => 'icons', 'action' => 'index')); Router::connect('/pages/*', array('controller' => 'pages', 'action' => 'display')); It is fine and success display the "My Icons" text. Wondering why only works under "/", with anything else doesn't work.
