Python ( Wikipedia page ) is a general purpose programming language designed for ease of use. It is a commonly used platform for machine learning. Two very popular threads concerned with using Python for statistics and machine learning are: Python as a statistics workbench Machine Learning using Python Be aware that Python-based questions are frequently migrated between Cross Validated (CV) and Stack Overflow (SO). CV fields questions with statistical / machine learning content, and SO fields questions of programming and implementation. Python questions can be on topic here when they are centrally about statistics / ML while involving Python either as a critical part of the question or expected answer. However, questions that are just about how to use Python / why it works a certain way, etc., are off topic here. Many such questions can be on topic on SO if they have a reproducible example . We maintain a list of Python resources available on the internet in our Internet Support for Statistics Software meta.CV thread. There is an extensive wiki for Python on SO here .
