rails model using class hierarchy from an external gem?

I'm working on a project where the data model is : implemented in a separate gem does not use ActiveRecord, nor any relational database storage ( actually it relies on couchdb ) makes usage of namespaces makes intensive usage of class inheritance To simplify the schema, let's say we have the following root class : module Marketplace module Food class Fruit â€¦ end end end And a couple of specialized classes : module Marketplace module Food class Peach end I'd like Rails to display (and manage) all the Fruits whatever is their nature, without modifying the model witch works perfectly out of Rails. The issue is that ActionView seems to use a certain number of conventions for defining paths and urls that will be based on the real class names. So if I present an Apple, in a table with show/delete actions, rails will look for a methods named marketplace_food_apple_path and similar which of course don't exist. Is there a way to indicate the ActionView::Base structure(s) that an Apple is a Fruit ? I'd expect this 'base cast' to be 'trivial' for a framework based on Ruby but it seems that this simple example of object oriented model does not work with Rails ? How do you manage 'complex object' data models in rails ? Or it is simply out of scope of Rails ? Thanks for any pointers !
