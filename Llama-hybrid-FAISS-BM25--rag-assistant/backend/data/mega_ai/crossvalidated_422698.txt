In an observational study where matching is properly conducted, should we expect the $ATE$ to be equal to the $ATT$?

In a randomized study, I know that the $ATE=ATT=ATC$ , where $ATE$ is the average treatment effect, $ATT$ is the average treatment effect on the treated, and $ATC$ is the average treatment effect on the control. In an observational study this is usually not the case. If we have a matching procedure is that is properly conducted on a set of covariates $X$ such that unconfoundedness holds, i.e., where $$ (Y(1), Y(0)) \perp Z \mid X $$ where $(Y(1), Y(0))$ are the potential outcomes, $Z$ the treatment, and the $\perp$ symbol meaning independence, should we expect the $ATE$ to be equal to the $ATT$ ? In such a scenario, would the $ATC$ , then be then $0$ ? Or are there other factors at play?
