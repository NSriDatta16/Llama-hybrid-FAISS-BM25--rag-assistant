Embed Sequence API in Tensorflow

My current tensorflow version is 2.1 and I'm using low level(core) tensorflow api's. Please provide a substitute of "tf.contrib.layers.embed_sequence" . I have explored a lot, but could not find any relevant api. Also tf2.3 API "tf.keras.layers.Embedding" can be used for sequential model only and not with core API's.
