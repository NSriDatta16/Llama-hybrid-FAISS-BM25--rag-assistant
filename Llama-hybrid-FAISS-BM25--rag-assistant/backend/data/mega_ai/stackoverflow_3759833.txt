I believe the problem in your case may be with the deliveryMethod attribute in the web.config; you may have to verify with your host, but that method will dump a file for the e-mail on the web server silently, expecting a mail transfer agent to pick up the files and send them later. The network element likely isn't being used at all, since you have the PickupDirectoryFromIis value, I think.
