Is the Neyman-Pearson paradigm for hypothesis testing adequate in the social sciences, and if not, is calculating a priori power still adequate?

I'm reading about Fisherian vs. Neyman-Pearson paradigms relative to hypothesis/significance testing. (NB: I'm new to this and self-studying it, so I'd be glad to be corrected if I misinterpret concepts or misuse words.) In this article (pdf file), the author argues that the Neyman-Pearson paradigm is less adequate in the social sciences than the Fisherian paradigm, because the population is changing constantly -so you can't conduct exact replications of a study, but exact replications are an assumption of Neyman-Pearson. Assuming the author is right (I don't know if he is), then does it still make sense to compute sample sizes if we are in another paradigm (Fisherian, Bayesian, or others I may not know)? Let's say I'm interested in detecting some minimal effect size of interest in the sample I collect (if this effect exists in the "temporary" population of interest), what are my options outside Neyman-Pearson? (given that exact replications on the long run in the real world are impossible).
