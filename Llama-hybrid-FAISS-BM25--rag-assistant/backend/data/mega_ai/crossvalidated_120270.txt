How do I detrend time series?

How do I detrend time series? Is it ok to just take first difference and run a Dickey Fuller test, and if it is stationary we are good? I also found online that I can detrend the time series by doing this in Stata: reg lncredit time predict u_lncredit, residuals twoway line u_lncredit time dfuller u_lncredit, drift regress lags(0) What is the best approach to detrend time series?
