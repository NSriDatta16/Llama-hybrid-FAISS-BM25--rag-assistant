Seeing this post and the answers given, I thought I would explain what's going on here. This is not a bug, but is actually the intended behavior of inline-block. The best way to illustrate why this is the correct behavior is with smileys in a paragraph: Hi, really glad to hear from you yesterday . Images are, by default, displayed as inline-block (IE: a block element which obeys the inline flow - much like a single character of text). In this case you would want the two smileys to butt up next to each other, but you would still want a space between 'yesterday' and the first smiley. Hope this explains it, and also explains why inline-block has taken so long to be fully supported; There aren't actually many use-cases for using it as intended. To answer your question, your best bet would be to do this: ul { height: some set height /* OR */ overflow-y: auto; } ul li { float: left; }
