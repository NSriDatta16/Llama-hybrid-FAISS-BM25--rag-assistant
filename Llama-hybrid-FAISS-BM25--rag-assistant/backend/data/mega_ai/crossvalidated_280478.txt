For R: " survival " (clogit) for multinomial logit (MNL) model. " mlogit " for a wide range of models (MNL, nested logit, heteroscedastic logit, mixed logit (MXL) also known as random parameters logit, ...). In the same spirit you should take a look at " Rchoice " (file:///C:/Users/kruci/Downloads/v74i10.pdf). " bayesm " for bayesian version of MNL/MXL - However if you are interested in bayesian approach I would strongly recommand the great " RSGHB " package. " gmnl " for the generalised MNL model. " flexmix " for latent class logit (LCL) model. More generally it is important to keep in mind that choice models are a special case of multilevel (or hierarchical) models (you have choices nested within participants themselves nested within higher units: supermarkets, countries, etc.) - So everything that can be used for multilevel modelling (e.g., the great " lme4 " package) and that can also accommodate the discrete nature of the choice variable would do the job. For example, you could use "lme4" if the choices are binary (Do you want this product? Yes/No) or made between 2 options (Which product do you want? A/B). With Stata, you have many commands useful for choice modelling: clogit for MNL mixlogit for MXL clogithet for heteroscedastic MNL lclogit for latent class logit gmnl for generalised MNL Many of these commands have been developped/refined by Arne HOLE (Great job!) http://www.stata.com/meeting/uk13/abstracts/materials/uk13_hole.pdf Choice modellers also use other software: nlogit (developped by W. Greene) biogeme (Thanks to M. Bierlaire) - Great tool but can only be used for choices modelling I've heard about LatentGOLD but not sure ... For those who want to use MATLAB, You got to take a look at: Miko≈Çaj Czajkowski webiste ( http://czaj.org/research/estimation-packages/dce ) Kenneth TRAIN website ( https://eml.berkeley.edu/~train/software.html ) - Actually most of the choice functions come from Kenneth TRAIN's work Finally, for those who are willing to invest a significant amount of time in the coding of choice models, Chandra BHAT website is amazing ( http://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/bhat/FULL_CODES.htm ) Many thanks to all these great researchers (Train, Bhat, Bierlaire, Hole, Croissant, Czajkowski, etc) who made this possible!
