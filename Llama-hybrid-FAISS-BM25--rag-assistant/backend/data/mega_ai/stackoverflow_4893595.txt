Why remove it? In my opinion using StyleCop is a good thing. Your only problem seems to be that your team member didn't set up StyleCop properly. From your description, I guess that he wanted to set up StyleCop with MSBuild integration: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sourceanalysis/archive/2008/05/24/source-analysis-msbuild-integration.aspx He apparently just left out the last paragraph "Team Development": copy the StyleCop files into your project and check them into source control, so you don't need to install StyleCop on every single developer machine. (see my link for a more detailed description ) If you do this, StyleCop should work on every machine, no matter if it's installed or not. We are using StyleCop in this way as well, and I think it's the easiest way to use it. I just had to insert two lines into each .csproj file and check a few files into source control once...and StyleCop just works, on every compile, on every machine (no matter if it's on a developer machine or the build server).
