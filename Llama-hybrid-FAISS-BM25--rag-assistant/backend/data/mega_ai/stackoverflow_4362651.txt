Getting PHP to process .jnlp files

I'm trying to generate Java Web Start files using PHP. Right now I'm just sending a Content-Type header, which works for me, but some users are having problems. I think using the correct file extension would make it work; is there a way to execute PHP code in other file types, or alternatively redirect a .jnlp URL (with query string) to a PHP script? I tried using various AddType/AddHandler directives in an .htaccess, but none of them have any effect; is there another way?
