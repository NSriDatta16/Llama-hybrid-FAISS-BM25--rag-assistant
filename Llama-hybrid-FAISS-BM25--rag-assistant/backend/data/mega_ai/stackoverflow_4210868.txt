GLubyte vs GLshort for Indices

Looking through documentation for vertex arrays in OpenGL, two of the most common memory types used for indices I found were GLubyte (GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE) and GLshort (GL_SHORT). I was wondering if there was any actual difference between using the two for indices Thanks, Dragonwrenn
