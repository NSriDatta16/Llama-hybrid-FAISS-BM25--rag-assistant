I think you need the whole code to understand this fragment. It looks like "word", "i" and "Rule" are input variables, the rest are pure output variables. "i" is the current index within "word", i.e. TryRule only looks at "word" starting at "word[i]". In "s1" the functions returns the left side of the rule that was applied. In "s2" the right side of that rule. In "n" the function returns the position within "word" where the rule applies. No idea what "varRep" is.
