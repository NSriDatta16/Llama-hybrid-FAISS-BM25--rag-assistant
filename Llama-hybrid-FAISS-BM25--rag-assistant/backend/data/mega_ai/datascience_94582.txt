Do generative model produce varying outputs for same input

I am new to data sciences. I believe the generative model generate responses on-the-fly for a valid user input. Is it correct to assume that such models would generate different responses for the same question? For e.g: if we trained the model on say medical data. Now if user 1 asked "what is fever" and user 2 asked the same question, could be that user 1 and 2 will receive different answers? if this is so then how to circumvent this problem? thanks in advance
