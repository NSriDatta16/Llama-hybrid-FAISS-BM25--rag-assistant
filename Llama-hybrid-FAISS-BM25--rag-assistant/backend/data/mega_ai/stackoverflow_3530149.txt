Change origin of canvas

I have to create a canvas that contains object with position in binding with latitude and longitude. My canvas support element's drag and zooming but until now I have used always standard coordinate (from 0,0) Now I have GPS coords and all objects overlap each other because GPS coord is for example between 45°11'00'N and 45°11'60N... so is basically 1px of distance if I can't solve this conversion... also canvas starts from 0,0 and I have always 45 pixel of white space I can retrive minimum left and top values and recalc the size but how can center all the objects in the canvas?
