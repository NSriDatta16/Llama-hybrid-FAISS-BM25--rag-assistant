I suspect that the problem you're encountering is because the code you've written doesn't wait for the postback to occur. So what happens is.... |---> The page finishes loading, triggering your DocumentCompleted method |---> You set the selectedIndex on DropDown1 |---> You raise the onChange event for DropDown1 | |---> The page starts posting-back (1) |---> You (attempt to) set the selectedIndex on DropDown2 |---> You raise the onChange event for DropDown2 | |---> The page starts posting-back (2) | ... ... ... |---> The page finishes re-loading from from postback (2) Basically, what you need to do is wait after triggering the postback for the page to re-load. The inelegant, brittle and almost certain to break/not work way of doing this is to trigger a Timer , or similar, so that after a period of time (as long as the postback takes to occur) you can then continue on setting the selectedIndex for DropDown2. The better option would be to do something like this: |---> The page finishes loading, triggering your DocumentCompleted method |---> You attach a new EventHandler to DocumentCompleted that contains the | code for changing the selectedIndex on DropDown2 and REMOVE this | eventhandler |---> You set the selectedIndex on DropDown1 |---> You raise the onChange event for DropDown1 |---> Your code in the DocumentCompleted handler finishes executing |---> // This is the DocumentCompleted handler that you assign above |---> You set the selectedIndex on DropDown2 |---> You raise the onChange event for DropDown2 |---> Your code in the DocumentCompleted handler finishes executing There are more elegant ways of doing this, but this is probably the simplest to explain.
