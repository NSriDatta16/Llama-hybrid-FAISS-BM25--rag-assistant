Binary logistic regression model shows unrealistic OR and 95% CI

I've just done a multivariate regression analysis, using a p-value from bivariate regression analyses of I have a total sample of 628 patients, and the crosstabs shows just right. The bivariate regression analyses also seems normal. However, when I try to converge all the eligible variables, the output seems to unrealistic Here are some additional information on the model: While it seems that most of the cases were excluded in the analysis, I think this is not the case... The other analyses I performed also showed that a considerable number of observations were observed, but the models still converged well and aligns with the cross-tabulations. ^These are the summary of the model. I also tried changing the method from ENTER to FORWARD: LR , but the model failed to converge. Does anyone know what problems may cause the above phenomenon? I have previously tried performing multivariate regression analyses with less sample sizes and more variables, but they all went well. This is the first time I've encountered such a problem. Thank you very much in advance.
