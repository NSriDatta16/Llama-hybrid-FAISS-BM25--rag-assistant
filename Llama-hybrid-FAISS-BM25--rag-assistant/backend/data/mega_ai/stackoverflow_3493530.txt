I would imagine the following: Users give you their basic account information when they connect with your application. For all other data, you must obtain explicit consent from the user who provided the data to us before using it for any purpose other than displaying it back to the user on your application. A user’s friends’ data can only be used in the context of the user’s experience on your application. Covers the specific usage of sites like StackOverflow. E-mail address, name, etc. of the user probably falls under "basic account information". The data storage policies are probably more intended for data from friends, or Facebook specific data like wall posts, pictures, etc.
