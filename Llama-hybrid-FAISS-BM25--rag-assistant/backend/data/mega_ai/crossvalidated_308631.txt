Strange zero estimate from quantile regression (quantreg.rq)

I'm using this package to do a simple quantile regression. I have a dataset with 70 observations, a non-normal outcome called "post_tx_los" (length of hospital stay following organ transplant), and a continuous variable called PMI which is a muscle measurement. I'm getting some weird results for this analysis - for some reason, the model estimate comes out at exactly 0 with a pvalue of 1.0 - summary(rq(post_tx_los~PMI,data=heart_muscle),se='nid') Call: rq(formula = post_tx_los ~ PMI, data = heart_muscle) tau: [1] 0.5 Coefficients: Value Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 16.00000 5.99368 2.66948 0.00949 PMI 0.00000 0.78378 0.00000 1.00000 It was suggested to me to try running it again after removing a few observations. When I removed one it was the same, but after removing two everything looks much different (and sensical): summary(rq(post_tx_los~PMI,data=heart_muscle68),se='nid') Call: rq(formula = post_tx_los ~ PMI, data = heart_muscle68) tau: [1] 0.5 Coefficients: Value Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 10.00527 6.60840 1.51402 0.13479 PMI 0.96677 0.94047 1.02796 0.30772 Looking at the two observations that were removed in the second analysis, nothing particularly strange stood out about them. The LOS variable has mean 23.3, median 16.0, range 1-107. The PMI variable has mean 5.8, median 5.5, range 1.5-11.8. For those two observations, the LOS values were (8,33) and the PMI values were (7.6, 3.7). Do you have any insight onto why I might be getting this estimate of exactly zero in my first analysis? It doesn't really make sense after noting how dramatically it changes when simply removing two observations. I did also run these models in SAS (PROC QUANTREG) and got similar results. added images: edit: BTW here is Roger Koenker's (he wrote the package) response: "rq is trying to find a basic solution to fit exactly p points (2 in your case) if LOS is in days, and you have several observation pairs with the same LOS and different PMI then it is possible to get an exact fit to two of such pairs and get zero as the estimated coefficient. Discrete response is rather problematic for QR inference since it really relies on the response having a conditional density. The usual treatment for such problems is to dither() the data to perturb the response. After all people donâ€™t really stay 3 days, they stay 3.13 days or something like that. See ?dither in the quantreg package for further details."
