Line completion with custom commands

my Python program can be launched with a range of different options (or subcommands) like: $ myProgram doSomething $ myProgram doSomethingElse $ myProgram nowDoSomethingDifferent I want it to use auto-completion with so that if i type "myProgram d" it returns "myProgram doSomething" and if i type "myProgram n" it renders "myProgram nowDoSomethingDifferent". This is similar to the average use of the module rlcompleter , but it does not pick possible completion options from the filesystem (or from history) but from a custom set of strings (that correspond to the available options for my program) Any idea on how to implement this? I'm aware of the variable PYTHONSTARTUP (that should point to a file I don't know how to write). As a working example, django-admin (from the django package) has the same exact feature i'm looking for
