Don't rely on old data and "magic" to predict ("diagnose") anything. Get fresh data. Much of the success we've been seeing from machine learning is because these companies have collected a massive amount of (fresh) data well-suited for their purpose. So by any means, get new labeled data. In particular in medicine, which has a lot of false results due to data reuse.
