Markov processes are not only very general ways to analyze longitudinal data with statistical models, they also lend themselves to machine learning. They work because by modeling transition probabilities conditional on previous states the records are conditionally independent and may be treated as coming from different independent subjects. One can use discrete or continuous time processes, discrete being simpler. The main work comes from post-estimation processing to convert transition probabilities into unconditional (on previous state) state occupancy probabilities AKA current status probabilities.
