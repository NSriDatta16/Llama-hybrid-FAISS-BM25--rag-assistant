Paper proving neural networks with more data are better in NLP than traditional methods

I'm looking for a paper that does some comparisons between neural networks (deep learning) and traditional methods in order to prove that DL usually performs better with enough data. I know this is "known" fact but I'm struggling to find a good paper doing some research in this area. Thanks!
