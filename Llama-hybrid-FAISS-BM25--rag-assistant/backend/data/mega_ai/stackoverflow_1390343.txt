You are asking two questions: How do you perform a test of statistical significance that the mean time of function A is greater than the mean time of function B ? If you want a certain confidence in your answer, how many samples should you take? The most common answer to the first question is that you either want to compute a confidence interval or perform a t-test . It's not different than any other scientific experiment with random variation. To compute the 95% confidence interval of the mean response time for function A simply take the mean and add 1.96 times the standard error to either side. The standard error is the square root of the variance divided by N. That is, 95% CI = mean +/- 1.96 * sqrt(sigma2/N)) where sigma2 is the variance of speed for function A and N is the number of runs you used to calculate mean and variance. Your second question relates to statistical power analysis and the design of experiments. You describe a sequential setup where you are asking whether to continue sampling. The design of sequential experiments is actually a very tricky problem in statistics, since in general you are not allowed to calculate confidence intervals or p-values and then draw additional samples conditional on not reaching your desired significance. If you wish to do this, it would be wiser to set up a Bayesian model and calculate your posterior probability that speed A is greater than speed B. This, however, is massive overkill. In a computing environment it is generally pretty trivial to achieve a very small confidence interval both because drawing large N is easy and because the variance is generally small -- one function obviously wins. Given that Wikipedia and most online sources are still horrible when it comes to statistics, I recommend buying Introductory Statistics with R . You will learn both the statistics and the tools to apply what you learn.
