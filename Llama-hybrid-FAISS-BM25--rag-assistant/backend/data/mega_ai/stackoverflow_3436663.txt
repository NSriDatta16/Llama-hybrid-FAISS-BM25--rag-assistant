You don't have to parse a file line by line -- you can read in the entire file at once, if it's small, or you can parse it paragraph by paragraph, using whatever separator you like. The two magic things you need to do this are 1. set the "line separator" variable, $/ (see perldoc perlvar ), to be something else than a newline, and 2. enable multi-line regular expression matching with the /s modifier (see perldoc perlre ). Alternatively, you should use an HTML parser, which is what you would have to do if you are attempting to find things like nested tags.
