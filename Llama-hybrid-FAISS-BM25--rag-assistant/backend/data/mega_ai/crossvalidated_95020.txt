Here is the definition of a confidence interval, from B. S. Everitt's Dictionary of Statistics : "A range of values, calculated from the sample observations, that are believed, with a certain probability, to contain the true parameter value. A 95% CI, for example, implies that were the estimation process repeated again and again, then 95% of the calculated intervals would be expected to contain the true parameter value. Note that the stated probability level refers to properties of the interval and not to the parameter itself, which is not considered a random variable" A very common misconception is to confuse the meaning of a confidence interval with that of a credible interval , AKA "Bayesian confidence interval", which does make statements similar to those in the questions. I have heard that confidence intervals are often similar to credible intervals that were derived from an uninformative prior, but that was told to me anecdotally (albeit by a guy I respect a lot), and I don't have details or a cite.
