Each time you read some property of Python object, method __getattribute__ is called, so you can overload it and completely control access to object's attributes. Nevertheless, for your task a bit different function - __getattr__ - may be used. In contrast to __getattribute__ it is called only if normal lookup for an attribute failed, i.e. at the same time, as prototype lookup in JavaScript starts. Here's usage: ... def __getattr__(self, name): if hasattr(prototype, name) return getattr(prototype, name) else: raise AttributeError Also pay attention to this question, since it has some notes on old and new style objects.
