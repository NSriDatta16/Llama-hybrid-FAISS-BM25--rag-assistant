There are many ways to do forecasting, each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The science of determining the accuracy of a forecast often consists of trying to minimize error. All forecasting comes down to using the past as a predictor of the future, adjusting it by some amount. E.g. tomorrow the temperature will be the same as today, plus or minus some amount. How you decide the +/- is what varies. Here are a range of techniques you might want to review: Moving Averages (simple, single, double) Exponential Smoothing Decomposition(Trend + Seasonality + Cyclicals + Irregualrities) Linear Regression Multiple Regression Box-Jenkis (a.k.a. ARIMA, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) Sorry, for the vague answer but forecasting is complex stuff. What you describe about feeding your predictions back into the model to produce future predictions is standard stuff. I don't know if "fuzzy logic" gets you anything in particular. As any forecasting instructor will tell you, sometimes you just squint and look at the data. Context is everything.
