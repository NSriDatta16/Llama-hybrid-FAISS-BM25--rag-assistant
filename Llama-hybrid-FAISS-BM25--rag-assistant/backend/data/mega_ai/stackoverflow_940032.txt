As BOL specifies CLEANTABLE only free's up pages from variable length columns. Your databse is probably fragmented, which occurs normally during database operation. It looks like SQL Server considers a fragmented page as being in use and does not display it as space available (btw sp_spaceused calls this unallocated space) You can see how fragmented your tables are with DBCC SHOWCONTIG. By re-building all the indexes in your database, you will get rid of fragmentation, which is pretty much what happens when you copy this data somewhere else.
