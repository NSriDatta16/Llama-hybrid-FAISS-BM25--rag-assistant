If you run the executable svm_train.exe which comes with libSVM installation itself, you can find that it generates a model file as output, XXX.model . If you inspect this model with an editor, you can find there the rho values and the list of the support vectors. Looks like in the C++/C code, there is not support to extract this information from the object.
