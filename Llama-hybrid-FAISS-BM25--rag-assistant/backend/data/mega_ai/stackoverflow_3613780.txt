I do not know if there is an elegant way of doing this with a query, but a "hackish" type of way to do it would be to use a mysql_query() and see if you get a result for that table or an error. function checkCreateTempPermission($table) { $res = mysql_query("CREATE `$table` "); // modify this to be your temporary table code. if ($res === false) { if (strstr(mysql_error(), "command denied to user")) { return false; }else { // some other error happened not sure how you want to handle it so left blank. } }else { return true; } } I have not tested this at all , more or less a theory of how it could be done. Alternatively, you can write a script that runs this SQL: Show grants for myuser; And then loop through that testing if they have access for that table. This would take a bit more work, but at least would not error out. Hope that helps to get you started.
