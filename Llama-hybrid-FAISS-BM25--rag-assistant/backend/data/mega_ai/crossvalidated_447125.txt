Let me join with an explanation which, to me at least, seems even easier: First, observe that the paths $B$ and $C$ can be joined into a single path $X$ , with the passage time equal to the mean times of $B$ and $C$ , i.e. $10$ minutes. This is due to the fact that these paths have the same probability. If they didn't, we'd need to take a weighted average. The probability of taking the path $X$ is the sum of probabilities of taking either the path $B$ or $C$ : $P(X) = P(B) + P(C) = 2/3$ . Now, there are the following ways of getting to the woods: $$\begin{array}{lrr} i & \text{path}_i & P(i) & T(i)\\ \hline 0 & A & 1/3 & 7\\ 1 & XA & 2/3 \cdot 1/3 & 10 + 7 \\ 2 & XXA & (2/3)^2 \cdot 1/3 & 20 + 7 \\ 3 & XXXA & (2/3)^3 \cdot 1/3 & 30 + 7 \\ & ... & \\ i & (i \cdot X)A & (2/3)^i \cdot 1/3 & 10\cdot i + 7 \end{array}$$ and the expected time is: $$\begin{array}{lcl} E(T) & = & \sum_{i=0}^\infty P(i)T(i) \\ & = & 1/3 \cdot \sum_{i=0}^\infty \left( 10 \cdot i + 7 \right) \cdot(2/3)^i \\ & = & 10/3 \cdot \sum_{i=0}^\infty i \cdot(2/3)^i + 7/3 \cdot \sum_{i=0}^\infty (2/3)^i\\ & = & 10/3 \cdot 6 + 7/3 \cdot 3 \\ & = & 27 \\ \end{array}$$
