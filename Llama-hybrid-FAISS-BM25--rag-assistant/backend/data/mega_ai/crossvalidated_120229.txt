Maximal coss-correlation formula

I'm reading "Comparing SVM and Convolutional Networks for Epileptic Seizure Prediction from Intracranial EEG" by Yann Lecun et al, and in the paper they present the following formula for maximal cross-correlation: How is C_i(0) and C_j(0) computed? Link to original paper is here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/mirowski-mlsp-08.pdf
