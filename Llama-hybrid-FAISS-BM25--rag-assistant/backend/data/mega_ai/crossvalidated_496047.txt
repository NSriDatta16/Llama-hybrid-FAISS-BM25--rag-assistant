The main difference is in the splitting rule used to pick the predictor cutpoints at the tree branches. For branch points in a random forest with a standard regression, you could find a cutpoint to minimize the residual sum of squares. For a survival model you use a splitting rule related to survival and compatible with censored survival times, for example choosing a outpoint to maximize the log-rank test statistic . Page 8 of the paper you linked outlines 4 such splitting rules for survival forests.
