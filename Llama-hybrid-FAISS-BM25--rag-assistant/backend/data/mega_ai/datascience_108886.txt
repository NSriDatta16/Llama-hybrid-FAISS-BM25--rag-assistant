Why do companies such as facebook share pretrained models for commercial use?

I'm curious about the motivation behind such a generous approach, I've used XLM-Roberta recently and I was impressed by its capabilities. That got me thinking, smaller companies wouldn't be able to train such models themselves, isn't it counterintuitive to allow them to use that tool?
