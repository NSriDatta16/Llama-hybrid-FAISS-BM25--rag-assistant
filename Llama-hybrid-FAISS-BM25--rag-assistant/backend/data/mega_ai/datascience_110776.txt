Do I need to encode numerical variables like "year"?

I have a simple time-series dataset. it has a date-time feature column. user,amount,date,job chris, 9500, 05/19/2022, clean chris, 14600, 05/12/2021, clean chris, 67900, 03/27/2021, cooking chris, 495900, 04/25/2021, fixing Using Pandas, I split this column into multiple features like year, month, day . ## Convert Date Coloumn into Date Time type data["date"] = pd.to_datetime(data["date"], errors="coerce") ## Order by User and Date data = data.sort_values(by=["user", "date"]) ## Split Date into Year, Month, Day data["year"] = data["date"].dt.year data["month"] = data["date"].dt.month data["day"] = data["date"].dt.day I applied feature_engine's CyclicalTransformer on month, day features leaving year feature alone. data = CyclicalTransformer(variables=["month", "day"], drop_original=True).fit_transform(data) Now, I'm unsure what to do with year feature. I was thinking of applying MinMaxScaler on it, but I wonder whether I could leave it as it is since it is numerical already.
