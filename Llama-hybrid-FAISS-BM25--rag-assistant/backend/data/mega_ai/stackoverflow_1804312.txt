MAven is more a repository manager than a CI/Build setup. If you're looking for continuous integration servers, here are the ones I know of: CruiseControl.Net ( http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET ) Good enough, free, but can be a resource hog and configuration is sometimes maddening. Hudson ( http://hudson-ci.org/ ) has some pretty good .Net specific tasks. As a open source/free automatic build setup I tend to favor it over CruiseControl.Net. It needs Java to run, but it runs fine on Windows. The web dashboard is nice (albeit with that strange fetish for blue instead of green) and project configuration is a breeze (compared to CCNet...) TeamCity (JetBrains) ( http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/ ) is really good, offers a lot of interesting features (private remote builds before committing, distributed build agents, etc.) and nice VS.Net integration. You have to pay for a license but it's free for small teams. All of these support the most popular SCM (CVS, SVN) Hudson and TeamCity support Mercurial and Git. I'd go for Hudson or TeamCity.
