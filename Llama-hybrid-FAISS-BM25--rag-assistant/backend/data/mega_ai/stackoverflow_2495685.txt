Initializing lists in a constructor

I need to create a class that also initializes two event lists to new empty lists. I'm not sure if that is what is being asked of me, but I know how to create a list and how to create a constructor. I created 2 lists, and now I should create the constructor. Here is one of my lists: List organize = new List (); How do I initialize the two event lists in the constructor to new lists?
