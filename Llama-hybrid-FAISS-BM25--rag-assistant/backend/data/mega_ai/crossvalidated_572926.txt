Phase and amplitude in a periodic process

I am currently working out of Time Series Analysis and its Applications (R. H. Shumway & D. S. Stoffer 2ed) and am stuck of something that is said. The books says that if we have some periodic process: $$x_t=Acos(2\pi wt + \phi)$$ where $A$ and $\phi$ vary randomly, we can write this as: $$x_t=U_1cos(2\pi wt) + U_2sin(2\pi wt)$$ where $$U_1=Acos\phi \enspace \enspace U_2=-Asin(\phi)$$ This I understand, as it is using a trig identity. However, the book continues and says that if we assume $U_1$ and $U_2$ are normally distributed, then we have: $$A=\sqrt{U_1^2+U_2^2}$$ $$\phi = tan^{-1}(-U_2/U_1)$$ I understand how we can arrive at these mathematically, as they are fairly straightforward calculations, but what I don't understand is why $U_1$ and $U_2$ are required to be normally distributed. I feel like the normal distribution being closed under linear operations may have something to do with it, but this would just lead to $A$ and $\phi$ being normally distributed, which isn't the point.
