Magento duplicate class rewrite

I'm using two different Magento modules, say First_Module and Second_Module which override the same class. I would like to combine their functionality. My assumption was that I could extend the duplicate class from First_Module from the same class in Second_Module which in turn extends the original class. I would guess that to do this, First_Module should depend on Second_Module , so I added to the module's config Second_Module . I would expect now the configuration loader to load Second_Module first and that its no longer valid tag for the duplicate class would be overridden by the same statement in the config of First_Module . But this doesn't seem to be the case. The first rewrite seems to be used. Am I doing/understanding something wrong or is this just how it works? Maybe I should just remove the rewrite from the second module from the config (which I rather not do to keep it as original as possible). Thanks in advance.
