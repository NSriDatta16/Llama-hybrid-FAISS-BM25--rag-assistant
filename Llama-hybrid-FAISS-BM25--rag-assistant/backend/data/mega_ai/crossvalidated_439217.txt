Representativeness of sample, distribution of age from sample compared to national sample

Please forgive my entry-level question. I have been slamming my head on the table for well over 3 hours now as I cannot seem to figure this one out. I have a sample of n=450, population is about 17m. For my thesis I am writing something about how my sample is representative for the entire population. For this, I seek to say something about the age distribution. But how can I compare these two? I know the exact counts of every age in my sample, as well as in my population. So the excel I have made has in the first column the ages (1y/o to 99 y/o), the second column the counts from my sample, the third column are the counts from the nation. I have tried ANOVA's, crosstabls and a whole range of other analysis. Independent-sample T-test seem the most logical to me but i am not sure how to configure the two categories. Averages report not the average age, but rather the average count, so I think my reasoning is off somewhere. I am rather stuck as you might have noticed and hope someone here can offer some help! Thank you, and with kind regards from holland!
