As pcampbell hinted, you probably need to write your own Html helper to do this. However, it doesn't have to be too hard - if you notice you need one, for example for an element, you could simply do this: public static class Html4Extensions public string Html4TextBox(this HtmlHelper helper, string name) { return helper.TextBox(name).Replace("/>", ">"); } } And then you do the same for every overload you need.
