As already discussed in the answer by Anon Ymous , the discussion on whether or not using the strict inequality is not pertinent from a measure theoretic point of view : the definition of a $\mathcal U$$(0,1)$ distribution is one of a probability measure against the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb R$ that gives any open interval within $[0,1]$ a probability proportional to its length: $$\mathbb{P}_\theta[U\in(a,b)]\propto b-a$$ This distribution being absolutely continuous wrt the Lebesgue measure, it enjoys a density $\frac{\text{d}\mathbb{P}_\theta}{\text{d}\lambda}$ that is constant almost everywhere on $[0,\theta]$ . Hence $$f_\theta(x)=\frac{1}{\theta}\mathbb I_{(0,\theta)}(x)\quad\text{and}\quad f_\theta(x)=\frac{1}{\theta}\mathbb I_{[0,\theta]}(x)$$ are two equivalent versions of the density of the same distribution. In such instances, the MLE will exist for some versions and not for others, which requires the selection of a smooth version of the density and hence of the likelihood function that allows for a solution. This is obviously a drawback of the MLE approach. (A similar difficulty arises with the Bayesian MAP which further depends on the definition of the dominating measure over the parameter space.)
