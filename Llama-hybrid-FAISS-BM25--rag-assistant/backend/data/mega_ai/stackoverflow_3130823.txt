What you're trying to do can work, but it's highly discouraged in Web development. Putting the permissions problems aside (which are very serious), you can never assume that your images will be available in the absolute path you provided on drive C:. What you should do, is create a folder inside your website directory and use it to store the images, and use relative links instead of absolute links. Even if you manage to make absolute links work now, prepare yourself for sever headaches in the future when running your application in different configurations.
