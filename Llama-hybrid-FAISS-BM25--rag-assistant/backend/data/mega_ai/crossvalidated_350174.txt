Reading limited weekly data as time series in R

I have weekly sales data for 3 months(Oct - Dec) of 2015 and I want to estimate the weekly sales of 2016 for the next three months using ARIMA model in R. When I tried converting this into time series in R using - training_data How could I preserve the dates and the corresponding data I had earlier when converting to time series?
