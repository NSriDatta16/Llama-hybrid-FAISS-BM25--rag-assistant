Multi-output Random Forest in R

I'm building a model in R to predict the total number of rushing touchdowns, passing touchdowns, defensive touchdowns, extra points, and field goals in an NFL game given several features. Basically instead of trying to predict the actual score, I want to gather the components that make up the final score (vegas odds, rushing yards, passing yards, turnovers, etc. - everything except the total score itself). I'm familiar with random forests and other methods of prediction, but I'm a bit lost in building a model that has 5 desired outputs. I know one option would be to run TotalScore ~ . and then try to divvy up the TotalScore in to its counterparts, but I'm trying to simulate real NFL games so I want the outcomes to be pulled from actual NFL results. And I don't (think I'd) want to predict these 5 variables individually because they aren't independent. This might not even be a "prediction" problem, I more so just want accurate "real score distributions" to use in a larger game-simulation model. It's been a while since I built a model in randomForest or glm , is what I'm trying to do possible and if so could you point me in the right direction to learn more? Edit: Another way of thinking of this is for the algorithm to use majority voting to pick the "best" most likely final score based on common characteristics of the predictors. Then in that 1 final game score, I could unpack all the specific scoring information. Any best practices for this?
