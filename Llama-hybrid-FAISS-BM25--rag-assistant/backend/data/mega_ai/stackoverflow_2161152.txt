Sweave for python

I've recently started using Sweave * for creating reports of analyses run with R, and am now looking to do the same with my python scripts. I've found references to embedding python in Sweave docs, but that seems like a bit of a hack. Has anyone worked out a better solution, or is there an equivalent for python I'm not aware of? * Sweave is a tool that allows to embed the R code for complete data analyses in latex documents
