Is there any relationship between residuals in regression and residuals in time series?

I learned before the definition of residuals in regression is Residual = Observed value - Predicted value e = y - ŷ Now I 'm dealing with residuals in time series and it's defined like this: et=yt−^yt They look similar except in time series it has an extra notation of time t. However, there are big differences when looking at those plotted pictures. The top is a residual picture from regression analysis and at the bottom (the 3rd picture) is from time series plots. I do apologize if it's a stupid question. Can anybody explain me their differences like you give a lecture to a small kid? Thank you!
