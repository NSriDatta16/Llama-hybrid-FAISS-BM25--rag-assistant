Are mixed model results valid when several missing replicates?

I want to know if it is correct to take as valid the results of a mixed model (lme) test for a triple factor experiment with several missing replicates in only one level factor situation. My objective is to test the effect of grazing exclosure over a soil property in a silvopastoral system (along different seasons and tree cover situations). I am mainly interested in the existence of Exclosure effects; the estimates are secondary for me. The 3 factors of my proposed experiment are (with 3 replications): Grazing (2 levels): Exclosure / continuous (main interest factor) Tree_cover (2 levels): Below trees / Between trees Season (2 levels): Summer / Winter The problem is that I've lost some samples during my summer trip, conserving only one replicate (of 3) for Exclosure situation in Summer time.

Despite this problem I tried to fit a mixed model (lme) with heteroskedasticity along the "Tree cover" factor (observed in residuals and levene test). The mixed model (lme) is: response ~ Grazing * Tree_cover * Season model Anova test gives me a not significant (but very close to be) Grazing:Tree_cover interaction: car::Anova(model) Analysis of Deviance Table (Type II tests) Response: soil_property Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq) Grazing 2.6069 1 0.106399 Season 0.2685 1 0.604328 Tree_cover 2.4448 1 0.117914 Grazing:Season 0.3711 1 0.542394 Grazing:Tree_cover 3.7907 1 0.051537 .

My doubt arose when I saw the graph of the adjusted mixed model (lme), which assigned greater dispersion to the situation where I lost repetitions, giving me the impression that the model considers this problem (as it can be seen in the next figure, red arrows points out the wider error bars under missing data situations). How does lme package manage this kind of problems? It seems that somehow it considers missing data... I revised Pinhero & Bates (2000) book, but did not found anything about this issue ... PD: I am aware that this issue have some problems and it seems me to be forcing it to have results. I just want to receive some advice about it whether to decide to discard the experiment or to report this results ...
