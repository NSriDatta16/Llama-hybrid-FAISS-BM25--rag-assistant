I've been using NCover with NUnit under VS2008 for a few days. I've found it so easy to find and fill gaps in my test coverage, I've giggled aloud when NCover pops up. One tip: if your tests are in the same file as the code they're testing, don't bother running NCover unless all of your tests pass. Otherwise, it'll flag all the failing test methods' trailing braces as uncovered. Though, perhaps that's just a hint that I should be putting my tests in a different fileâ€¦
