Well one thing to notice is that each page element has a lang attribute that is modified based on the Accept-Language http header provided by the browser. The XSLT uses this attribute to select localized resources. The template is also organized in such a way that many common page elements, like headers and flash objects, are defined in a common "includes.xsl" file. Since all of the localization and html rendering is done by the client, this probably saves a fair amount of server CPU time. Also, given that many elements are defined in a global "includes" file, this can be requested once by the browser and cached, saving bandwidth and reducing the overall time to download each page.
