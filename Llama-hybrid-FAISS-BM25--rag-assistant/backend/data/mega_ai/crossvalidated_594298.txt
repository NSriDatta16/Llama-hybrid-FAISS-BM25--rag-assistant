Discrepancy between model selection based on REML score vs explained deviance in GAMs

Will be grateful for insights into the issue below! I have two explanatory GAMs below (in this example implemented with mgcv), where the effects of x1 and x2 are of interest. x1 is air temperature, x2 is the humidex (a composite of air temperature and humidity), time represents the number of the day in a 14-year time series, z is a (possible) confounder (namely rain fall) and y_count represents daily number of deaths. For sake of completeness (but not relevant for the question, I think), the models include distributed lag (set up as a 7-column matrix, as in the code by Simon Wood in the gamair package ). The models are as follows: m1 m2 Note that n for m1 = 2178 and n for m2 = 3256. The reason for the difference in sample size is that each model is only run for the hotter season in each year, as defined by the x1 and x2 variables, i.e. the hotter season for x1 is different from that for x2, although there is considerable overlap between them. Partial output from summary() for m1: Approximate significance of smooth terms: edf Ref.df Chi.sq p-value s(time) 5.715 79 32.076 2.83e-06 *** te(x1,lag) 1.642 45 2.493 0.176 te(z,lag) 4.937 44 27.771 7.00e-06 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 R-sq.(adj) = 0.0258 Deviance explained = 2.91% -REML = 3615 Scale est. = 1 n = 2178 And for m2: Approximate significance of smooth terms: edf Ref.df Chi.sq p-value s(time) 30.82300 199 199.916 As can be seen, the p-value for x2 is closer to significance than for x1. The deviance explained favours model m2. However, the (negative) REML score for x2 is higher than for x1, therefore favouring model m1 (I think?). I have two questions: Is it (in principle, and ignoring deviance and REML scores for a moment) valid to favour m2 based on lower p-value of x2? How come REML and explained deviance seem to favour different models, and which one is more appropriate in this case?
