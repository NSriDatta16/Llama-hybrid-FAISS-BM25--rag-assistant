How do I cluster/group people together given their durations for an given event?

I am new to machine learning and do have a very large dataset for a set of 100 people over a period of 1 year. and the goal is to find out who are buddys based on their lunch times. I have the following dataset: Person StartTime EndTime Duration(dif for start and end times) Person1 Time11 Time12 diff1 Person2 Time21 Time22 diff2 Person3 Time31 Time22 diff3 Person4 Time41 Time32 diff4 Now I would like to cluster/group people together based on their times ( with +/- 5 minutes time difference, meaning if start time and end time of person 1 is 12:00 - 1:00 PM and person 2 is 11:55 - 1:05 they fall under the same group relative to Person 1)
