I'm pretty sure that inodes are allocated statically when you create the volume (using mfs.ext3 in this case). For whatever reason, mkfs.ext3 decided to reserve 13 Million inodes and now you can't create any more files. See this 2001 discussion of inodes The Wikipedia ext3 page has a footnote explaining this more concisely: wiki link Also, inodes are allocated per file (not block), which is why there are only 13M inodes - mkfs.ext3 must have been configured with an average file size of 8 KB which would account for the issue you're seeing.
