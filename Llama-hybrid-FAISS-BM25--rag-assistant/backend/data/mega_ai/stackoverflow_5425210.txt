Shortcut to Apply a Formula to an Entire Column in Excel

If I select a cell containing a formula, I know I can drag the little box in the right-hand corner downwards to apply the formula to more cells of the column. Unfortunately, I need to do this for 300,000 rows! Is there a shortcut, similar to CTRL + SPACE , that will apply a formula to the entire column, or to a selected part of the column?
