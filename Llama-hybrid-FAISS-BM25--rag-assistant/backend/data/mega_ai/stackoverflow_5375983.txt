Allthough the answer is already answered/accepted I can't resist to add my 2 cents: Sums and averages normally are displayed at the bottom of a list. You can use the SUBTOTAL() function to calculate sum and average and specify to include or exclude "hidden" values, i.e. values suppressed by a filter. So the solution could be: create a formula =SUBTOTAL(101,A2:A6) for the average create a formula =SUBTOTAL(109,A2:A6) for the sum create an autofilter on the Gender column Now, when you filter for "F", "M" or all, the correct sum and average will always be computed. Hope that helps - Good luck
