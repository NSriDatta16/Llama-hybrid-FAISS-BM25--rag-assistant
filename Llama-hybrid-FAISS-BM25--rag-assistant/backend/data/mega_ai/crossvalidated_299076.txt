I am currently reading about AHP. Saaty, the creator of AHP, promotes the scale 1-9 as the best. Other studies like this from Franek and Kresta in 2014 analyze other options but they still conclude that the 1-9 scale is a "favorable" option. I would try with that scale. Nevertheless it is known that the AHP method loose effectiveness if more than 9 criteria are pairwise compared. I would suggest to organize your criteria as a hierarchy to make the whole process easier and more consistent. Preferently don't compare more than 5 criteria at the same time. Apparently you already have a normalized scale to measure the criteria. Applying AHP should be a piece of cake. EDIT: If the Likert scale is an ordinal scale it doesn't support relevant math operations like + and * of AHP. You will need to measure differently (using a ratio scale) if you expect to obtain general scores for your alternatives.
