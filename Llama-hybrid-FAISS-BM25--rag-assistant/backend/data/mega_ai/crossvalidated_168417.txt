Multiclass classification - Optimizing for recall in subset of classes

As part of a wider analysis, I'm seeking a method to reliably recall the outer margins (~10% each) of a data set. I don't mind if precision is lower as a result. I've separated the data into 3 ordinal classes, and am looking for a method to maximize the recall of the top and bottom classes (The middle can be shrunk as much as needed). Are there any classification algorithms that accommodate this? I'm new to the data science scene, so it's likely I'm just searching using the wrong keywords, but nothing is coming up for me. Paper solutions are fine, but if anyone knows of a related Python (or R) library that would be ideal.
