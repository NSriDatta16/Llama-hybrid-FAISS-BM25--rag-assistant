The reason for using a linear mixed model is to account for the correlations in the repeated measurements of weight within each larvae . The model now says that weight changes linearly with instar time and that different treatment groups act additively. Assuming that treatment is a factor, the model says that you have five parallel lines for the weight over time, one for each treatment. In the random-effects part, you have included random intercepts. This says that correlations between the different weight measurements for each larva are the same. That is, the correlation between measurements 1 and 2, is the same as the correlation between 1 and 3, and the correlation between 2 and 3. Whether this is a "reasonable" model is difficult for us to say. You need subject-matter knowledge to claim that (you can probably tell if these are reasonable assumptions). Nonetheless, you can extend the model and test whether these assumptions are supported by the data. For example, by including the interaction term between time and treatment, you can relax the assumption of parallel lines for weight. And by including a random slope, you can relax the assumption of constant correlation over time. Though you should be careful making your model too complex because the size of your dataset is small.
