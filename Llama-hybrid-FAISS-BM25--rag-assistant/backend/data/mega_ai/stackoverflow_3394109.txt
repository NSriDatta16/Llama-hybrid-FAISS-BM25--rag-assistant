Firebird SQL: Finding bottlenecks / performance analysis

I am using Firbird 2.5 for some applications. What I miss is a performance analyses tool, e.g. for Visual Studio, which shows what methods / queries have been executed over time. I am thinking of a tool like Apple's Instruments: http://img683.imageshack.us/img683/1115/instrumentswindow.jpg Is there anything like this? Thanks, Norbert
