A module developed by a partner caused our application to take a very long time to load. On closer examination, the module was looking for a config file at app startup. This by itself was not too objectionable, but the way in which it was doing it was outrageously bad: For every file in the app directory, it opened the file and tried to parse it as XML. If a file threw an exception (because it wasn't XML), it caught the exception, squelched it, and tried the next file! When the partner tested this module, they only had 3 files in the app directory. The bonehead config file search didn't have a noticeable effect on the test app startup. When we added it to our application, there were 100's of files in the app directory, and the app froze for nearly a minute at startup. To add salt to the wound, the name of the config file the module was searching for was predetermined and constant. There was no need for a file search of any kind. Genius has its limits. Stupidity is unbounded.
