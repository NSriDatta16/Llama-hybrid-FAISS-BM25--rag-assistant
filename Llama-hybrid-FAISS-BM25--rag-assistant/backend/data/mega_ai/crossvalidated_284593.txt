Based on the last paragraph, there is no repeated measurement. You mentioned one way ANOVA, I assumed your data is suitable for linear model. Then you can put both concentration and time into model as covariates. If you treat them as categorical variables, it is two way ANOVA. If one of them as continuous and another as categorical, it is ANCOVA. You can also treat both of them as continuous. You can also add the interaction term into the model. All of this model may be more powerful than separated one way ANOVA.
