Why is it bad to dichotomize categorical variables in regression?

Say we have a research question of: "Does a specific cancer type increase the risk of seizure?" We then have 10 cancer types and a seizure 0/1 (no/yes) dependent variable. One way we could answer our question would be to dichotomize the cancer types variable into ten 0/1 variables for each cancer type and then run a logistic regression on each type to see if one has a higher risk than the others. But this is apparently a bad idea. Can anyone tell me why I must have a baseline in a category? I understand that it is to compare the results with, but to me it also seems that I am answering the research question by simply regressing against a cancer type since it keeps the rest of my data baseline and looks at whether or not people in my data set with a specific cancer type have a higher risk of seizure.
