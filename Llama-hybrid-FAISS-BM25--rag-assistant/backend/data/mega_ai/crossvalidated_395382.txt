What happens to the initial hidden state in an RNN layer?

I thought I knew how RNNs work, however, when I tried to actually implement it myself, I faced some issues. For one, how do we deal with the initial hidden state? At the very beginning we just create a vector of zeros with some length which is then used to create the next hidden state and this goes on until we traverse all time steps. Now this is for one iteration, What does happen in the next iterations? When we get new inputs, should we still be feeding the same vector of zeros to the network? this doesn't seem right! since in the back-propagation stage, it seems we don't update the h0 ! I'm confused here. If we always feed the same zero vector, it just nullifies all the previous updates we have done on all hidden states so far! so what is it that needs to be done to the initial state?
