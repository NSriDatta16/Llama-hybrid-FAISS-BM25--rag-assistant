Magento still displays VAT / TAX on checkout even though disabled via admin

I have Magento set up to not display VAT on checkout, but it is still adding at the total. It doesn't add it up to the total - which IS correct. For example if I have an item that costs £5 - with 20% VAT it is £6 and this is set to show in the catalogue prices - which it does. Now on checkout this item would display as £6, then £1 VAT and then shows the total, which is £6..? Has anyone else seen this?
