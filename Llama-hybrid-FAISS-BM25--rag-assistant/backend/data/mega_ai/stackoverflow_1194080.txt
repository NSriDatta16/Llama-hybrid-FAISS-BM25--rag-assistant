Altering tables with Windows Azure

I'm using the following method to create tables in Windows Azure. This code is executed only once when the application is first initialized TableStorage.CreateTablesFromModel(typeof(customDataServiceContext), account); If I have updates (ex. new columns) that I want to make to the table, how do I go about making those updates without losing the existing data?
