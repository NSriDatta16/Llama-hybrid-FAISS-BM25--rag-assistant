How to measure the importance of two features combined with random forest

Random forest offers a simple way to measure the importance of each variable. But is there a way to measure the combined importance of two variables in the model? For example, a model seeks to predict whether a student could be admitted by college. The independent variable is the examination score, IQ score, and height. Random forest model gives a feature importance for each of the three variables separately , but what if Iâ€™m interested in the combined importance of examination score and IQ score combined ?
