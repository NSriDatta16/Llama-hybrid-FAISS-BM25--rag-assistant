Wishart and Inverse Wishart Distributions The Wishart and inverse Wishart distributions are arguably the most popular distributions for modeling random positive definite matrices. Moreover, if a random variable has a Gaussian distribution, then its sample covariance is drawn from a Wishart distribution. The relative entropy between Wishart distributions may be a useful way to measure the dissimilarity between collections of covariance matrices or Gram (inner product) matrices. A new Bayesian entropy estimator is proposed using an inverted Wishart distribution and a data-dependent prior that handles the small-sample case. Inverse Wishart Differential Entropy and Relative Entropy The above link explains the derivation of the entropy of Inverse-Wishart distribution
