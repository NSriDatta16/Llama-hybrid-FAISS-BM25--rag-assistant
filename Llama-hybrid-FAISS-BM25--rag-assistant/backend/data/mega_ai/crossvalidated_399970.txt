How to compute a combined likelihood involving multiple datasets?

I have a parametric model that generates $N$ time series, and my goal is to try to find a model where the $N$ predicted time series match $N$ observed time series relatively well. My physics-based model has some free parameters, so I want to use MCMC to explore parameter space. Doing this requires computing a likelihood. This would be straightforward in the simpler case of having just 1 time series to worry about: $\mathcal{L}\sim\exp(-\chi^2/2)$ ) where $\chi^2=\sum_i\frac{(y_{i,pred}-y_{i,obs})^2}{\sigma_i^2}$ just represents how well a single given predicted time series matches the observed time series. But how would I generalize this to my case where I have $N$ predicted and observed time series, and I want to compute some kind of overall combined likelihood? Making the assumption that the individual time series are all independent of each other, can I just compute the individual likelihood for each time series and then multiply all of them together: $\mathcal{L}_1\times\mathcal{L}_2\times\ldots\times\mathcal{L}_N$ ?
