Interpretation of significant predictors in logistic regression

I am approaching an exercise about data analysis, but I have some doubts about interpreting my results. I have $p$ predictors, some categorical, others continuous (let's call them $X_1$ , $X_2$ , $\dots$ , $X_p$ ) and one response variable $Y$ , which is dichotomous. I applied logistic regression and found that among $p$ predictors, $m$ predictors are significant, with $m . On the other hand, performing a Pearson's Chi-squared test between $Y$ and a categorical predictor among the $m$ significant predictors in the regression analysis, I find that there is no association between the two variables. I was wondering how this fact can be correctly interpreted. I hope I was clear enough, thanks in advance for any suggestions.
