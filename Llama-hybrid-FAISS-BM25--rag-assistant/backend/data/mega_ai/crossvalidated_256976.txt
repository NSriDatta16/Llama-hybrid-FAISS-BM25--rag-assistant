Does Mixed Effects Apply to This Analysis?

I ran a GLS random effects regression on some NBA data in Stata, and I was told that it was wrong because I didn't use mixed effects model. This may every well be the case, but I was quite confused by the explanation. Here is what I did using Stata: Dependent variable is team win's and independent variables is different types of opponent shooting data. Paneled data using xtset to account for the different NBA seasons Ran robust xtreg for both fixed and random effects Hausman test had a high chi^2, so I stayed with the GLS random effects regression. If this is incorrect, please let me know so I can fixed this. I may have forgotten to add the i.season into the xtreg. I always thought that the mixed effects model was for logistic regressions when my dependent variable was categorical. I was told that I did not take into account this team grouping structure within your analysis, but the Group Variable was the teams.
