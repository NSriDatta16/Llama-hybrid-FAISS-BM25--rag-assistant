This is probably not a good idea. While it will make some queries simpler/faster, it is extra work on every insert. Not to mention the new programming requirement of keeping this updated. You seem to realize that this is not worth it in your last paragraph when you acknowledge 'Orders will take place a lot more' This single-row table solution is not very extensible either. Every category needs its own COLUMN, something that requires altering a table. I think your best solution is simply writing a query to find these stats when needed. At most a view. Either of these can be made to include a join with your categories table, making it far more extensible for the addition (or removal) of categories. Even if you decide that keeping this metadata is worthwhile (which it most likely is not), there are better ways to do it than this table.
