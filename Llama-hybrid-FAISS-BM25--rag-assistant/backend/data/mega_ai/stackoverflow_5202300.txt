It depends on what is in the resource fork. The use of resource forks has been discouraged, but there are few holdouts including alias files, custom icons (on files) and some legacy font files. You can verify if a file has a resource fork in the Terminal using "ls -l@". The resource forks are also exposed in the extended attribute APIs through the "com.apple.ResourceFork" attribute. If you want to just remove thumbnails, you could do that from the Finder's GetInfo panel. The extended attribute APIs, like removexattr(2), will let you programmatically remove the Resource Fork. If you're curious what's inside a resource fork you can use: "hexdump -C myfile/..namedfork/rsrc" Hope this helps -Don
