Django storring file. Detect new file

I'm trying to subclass ImageField . Basically my MyImageField have to save two pictures in storage when uploading one picture. First it's original picture with name blablabla.jpg and second is the actually thumbnail whith name blablabla_thumb.jpg . but in databse i'll have only one field with path to oroginal picture. To get picture thumbnale i'll create method of MyImageField which call tumb when i do model.MyImageFiled.thumb it returns me path to file with prefix thumb . Question is how to detect if FileField is new file or just model is saving without changing file. I need it to decide if i need to make new thumbnail (cropping,converting and stuff) or not. So if user just put MyFileField in his model and than he makes change to name or description in model it not make file thumb again. Only way I see here is to save date created and compare. If different make thumb, otherwise don't.
