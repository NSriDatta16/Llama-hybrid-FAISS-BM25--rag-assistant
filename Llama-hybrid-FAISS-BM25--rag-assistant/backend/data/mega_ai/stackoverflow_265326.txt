Replied again 'coz I'm interested. My methods works (with my queries) because they have been pre-defined with the params' datatypes preset to the correct type:) I'm not sure how you are expecting the query to know or derive the datatype of the param given that you are not even selecting the field that it operates against. So I think your query setup and user input method will need more attention. I've just looked up how I did this a while ago. I do not use a parameterised query - I just get the "parameter values" from the user and put them directly into the SQL. So your sql would then read: SELECT s.hEmployee, e.sLastName FROM PR_Paystub s INNER JOIN PR_Employee e ON e.hKey = s.hEmployee WHERE s.dtPaydate > '01/01/2008' therefore no parameter type knowledge is necessary. Does not stop your users entering garbage but that goes back to input control :)
