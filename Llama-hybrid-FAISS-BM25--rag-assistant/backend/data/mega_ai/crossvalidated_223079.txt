I wouldn't treat any of your examples (time with 1-hour resolution, geographic location, or RGB color) as categorical. To do so would be to throw away what we know about how the values are related to each other: for example, noon on January 1st is closer to 1:00 PM on January 1st than it is to noon on January 2nd. So do treat them quantitatively, but rather than labeling the values arbitrarily, use a system of coordinates that make sense for the data type. Locations can be represented as latitude and longitude, time can be represented as the number of hours since the beginning of the year, and color can be represented as red, green, and blue components, each 0 to 255. There are many options as to how to coordinatize a given datatype; how you should choose depends on the data you have and the problem you want to solve. You can find detailed treatments of how to represent time and space in books on time series and spatial data analysis, respectively.
