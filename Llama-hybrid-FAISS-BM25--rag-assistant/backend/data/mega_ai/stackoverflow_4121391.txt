SQlite3 commands aren't displaying tables from rails tutorial application

This is probably something simple I'm missing. I'm working through the pragmatic bookshelf ruby on rails exercises in the AWDWR 4th edition. Everything was going well and then I ran into the portion where you enter into the sqlite 3 command line tools to make sure it's capturing the order information. When I try to run the select statement for orders, I get: sqlite> select * from orders; SQL error: no such table: orders Then I tried listing all the tables: sqlite> .tables sqlite> I get to the sqlite command line per the instructions in the book: sqlite3 -line Is there something simple I'm missing here? Thanks.
