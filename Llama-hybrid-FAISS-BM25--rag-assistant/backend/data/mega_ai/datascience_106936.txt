Estimate timeline for a ML Project

I am a novice data scientist and have been asked to provide an estimate for a data science project in our organization. From the problem stmt description, i am able to understand that it is a traditional binary classification problem. However, am new to the domain, dataset etc (and I don't have access to full dataset yet). Through my work, I will also have to interact with business users throughout to clarify my questions regarding data, domain etc. How can I propose a timeline to my supervisor without any experience in this space. Is there any guidelines that I can follow to come up with a reasonable timeline?
