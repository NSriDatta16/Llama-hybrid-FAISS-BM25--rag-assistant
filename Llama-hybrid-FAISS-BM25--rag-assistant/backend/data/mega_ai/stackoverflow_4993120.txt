To the best of my knowledge, there exists no standard method to measure network bandwidth per-application. The most you can get with standard means is essentially what netstat and perfmon show. The only way to calculate per-application metrics is to write an NDIS filter driver, or use an existing filter driver such as WinPcap. But both ways you'll have to install a driver on every target machine.
