Repeated measures logistic regression

I have a dataset that features a binary outcome, a binary predictor, and an unordered factor with 7 levels, and 120 subjects. Each of the 120 subjects were asked a binary question on seven issues, hence the 7-level unordered factor. Therefore, I have a total of 840 observations. Each of the 840 observations has a binary predictor, and a binary outcome. I want to regress the binary outcome, on the binary predictor of course. The outcome is slightly complicated. I will use mac vs. PCs as an example. People are asked, "Do you think macs are better or do you think PCs are better?" That is recorded as a 1, for preferring macs, and 0 for preferring PCs. Then they are asked "Is your opinion based on objective truth, or subjective opinion?" In other words, do you think it is objective (1) or subjective (0). Then the last question is "In 20 years, will people think macs are better or will people think PCs are better?" Again, 1 will be coded for macs. A new variable is then created. The variable is 1 if their current opinion matches what they think the future opinion will be. Previous pilot studies found that people tend to believe their stance on issues is what the future will be (...I know, a pretty intuitive finding...people tend to think they are right). The outcome is that variable, whether their current opinion agrees with what they think the future will be. So the point is to see if how people view things as subjective vs. objective, predicts whether they think their vision of the future is in line with their beliefs. The mac vs PC is only an example of an issue. In reality, there are seven issues, ranging from gun control, to abortion, etc., and each of those seven issue ranges in "objectivity" given by how the participants answered the objectivity question. Participant ID : 120 Factors Objectivity : Binary predictor of 0s and 1s Outcome : Binary outcome of 0s and 1s Issue : 7-factor level variable So I tried something like this: # Dummy coding for all participants contrasts(data$Participant) This gives a bunch of warnings. I essentially want to see if my predictor predicts the outcome, based on the seven issue, while adding a random effect for the participant ID.
