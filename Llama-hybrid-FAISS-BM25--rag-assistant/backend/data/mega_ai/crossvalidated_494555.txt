Saleh has a good answer. If you require several to many values to be in a bag, the CART should replace them with their mean. In the bagging that random forests do, because it is a mean of subsampled means and several of the trees will not have the sample in them, the mean is a robust estimate and is less moved by outliers. You can look at distance between predicted value and actual value, and outliers will tend to have higher distance. You can "turn up this dial" by making your bootstrapped columns and rows be a smaller percentage of the whole, but don't overdo it. Depending on your RF tool, you can trim your trees before adding them to the ensemble. If you trim/prune the trees before adding them to the ensemble, they can be more robust and thus give a bit of a stronger signal for outliers. Note: this is for a random forest not an isolation forest. The isolation forest that Saleh mentioned is looking to have one or very few leaves per tip. It then looks at the number of splits to get to each leaf, and those that take much fewer are likely farther from the rest in a general sense. Pruning wouldn't necessarily do much good for it.
