Nested methods vs "piped" methods, which is better?

Since uni, I've programming in Java for 3 years, although I am not fully dedicated to this language, I have spent quite some time in it, nevertheless. I understand both ways, just curious which style do you prefer. Please focus at the main method - that's the section I concern the most. public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(getAgent().getAgentName()); } private static Agent getAgent() { return new Agent(); } } class Agent { private String getAgentName() { return "John Smith"; } } I am pretty happy with nested method calls such like the following public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(getAgentName(getAgent())); } private static String getAgentName(Agent agent) { return agent.getName(); } private static Agent getAgent() { return new Agent(); } } class Agent { public String getName() { return "John Smith"; } } They have identical output I saw "John Smith" twice. I wonder, if one way of doing this has better performance or other advantages over the other. Personally I prefer the latter, since for nested methods I can certainly tell which starts first, and which is after. The above code is but a sample, The code that I am working with now is much more complicated, a bit like a maze... So switching between the two styles often blows my head in no time.
