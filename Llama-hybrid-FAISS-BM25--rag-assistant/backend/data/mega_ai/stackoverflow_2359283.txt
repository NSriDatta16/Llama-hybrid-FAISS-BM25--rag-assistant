I would guess that SP is looking at the user-agent string and doing additional loading if certain parts are present. The other thing to check is to see if JS is being sent down (for the web-client version) and if there are more round-trips with IE than with the other clients. If I remember correctly (been a while) for IE identifying agents SP will send additional client side javascript to handle interactions with forms and accessing things like office and performing version control. I am not sure if that's still true or not. Its worth using fiddler to compare two or three runs between your webclient, IE and say Firefox to see the differences. You can also copy your user agent string from IE and use it in your webclient and alternate browser runs to see if the behavior is purely from the user agent string.
