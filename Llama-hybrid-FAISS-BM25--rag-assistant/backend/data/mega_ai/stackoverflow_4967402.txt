Just use the tpl , that's what it's for: columns: [ { header: 'Agent', tpl: ' ' } ] Instead of you might want to create an element with background image. Or you might want to do choose the image conditionally. Read the documentation for Ext.XTemplate - it's all there. But for background color you might be better off using GridPanel instead - there you can easily set styles for a cell (using renderer) or even row (using getRowClass). ListView is a bit limited in that regard.
