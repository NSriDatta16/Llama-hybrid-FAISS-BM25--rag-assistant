Best practice to share DAL between ASP.NET and Silverlight 2

I have an ASP.NET 3.5 e-commerce site that has an admin section. I want to swap out the ASP.NET-based admin section and rewrite it in Silverlight 2. Silverlight requires async calls, so I can't just call my existing DAL from a new SL2 app. What is the best practice for doing something like this? Should I create a WCF service and call my existing DAL through that, or should I port everything to WCF, or should I just add async calls into my existing, non-WCF DAL. Looking for advice on the best way to do something like this. EDIT: So what I'm reading is that the best way to do this is to leverage my existing DAL and create a simple WCF service that references that DAL and wraps the calls. The WCF service does nothing more than act as a middleman to get to my DAL, but expose it to Silverlight. What if you're starting from scratch? Should you build out your DAL as a WCF service to begin with and use that service from a WPF client, ASP.NET client, Silverlight client, any other consumer, etc.
