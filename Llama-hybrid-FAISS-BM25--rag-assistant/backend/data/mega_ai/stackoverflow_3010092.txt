There's a lot to be said about letting the infinite army of monkeys (like all of us) maintain code that really grabs their attention, and then leveraging that in your own work instead of completely re-inventing the wheel. If you DO decide to create your own MVC framework, I'd encourage you to integrate specialist projects (e.g. an ORM-layer, or templating engine, etc.) that are being developed by people who TRULY LOVE those projects because the result will probably be stronger pieces within your whole, which will ultimately make your framework more successful. If you look at the MVC's that have been mentioned here (e.g. Zope, Cake, etc.) they all started around roughly the same time when there were no MVC's for PHP, and you see that they all have their own strengths and weaknesses because the developers who created them don't have an equal passion for all facets of their framework. I say, we're standing on the shoulders of giants anyways, we might as well admit it, incorporate their work into ours, and be honest with ourselves and the world. -C
