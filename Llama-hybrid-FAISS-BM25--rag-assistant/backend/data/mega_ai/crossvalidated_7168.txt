It's hard to know exactly what you're looking for based on your post. Maybe you can edit it to clarify a little. I will say that to really understand statistics well, then you'll need to learn some math. For fairly broad, low-level, introductory concepts, both Gonick and Smith, A Cartoon Guide to Statistics , and D. Huff, How to Lie with Statistics are light, easy reads that present a lot of the core ideas. Another book directed at a more "popular" audience that I think every person should read is J. A. Paulos' Innumeracy . It is not about probability or statistics, per se, and has more elementary probability than statistics, but it's framed in a way that I think most people can easily relate to. If you have some calculus background and want to understand (introductory, frequentist) theoretical statistics, find a copy of Mood, Graybill and Boes, Introduction to the Theory of Statistics , 3rd. ed. It's old, but in my opinion, still better than any of the more "modern" treatments. But, it's a book for which you'll have to be comfortable with mathematical notation. For a "modern" view of applied statistics and the interface between it and machine learning, along with good examples, and good intuition, then Hastie et al., Elements of Statistical Learning , is the most popular choice. Many people also tend to like Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies , which is a solid book, though I'm apparently not quite as big of a fan as others tend to be. Again, in both cases, you'll need to at least be comfortable with some calculus, linear algebra, and standard math notation.
