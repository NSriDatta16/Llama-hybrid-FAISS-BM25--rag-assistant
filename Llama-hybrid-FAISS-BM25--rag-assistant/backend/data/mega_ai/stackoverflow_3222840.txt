How to show application version in VS.NET Deployment Project?

I have set up a Deployment Project for my application. The problem is that I want to show application version (eg. MyApplication 1.2.3.1) during installation so the user can see the version before installing. The only way I can think of is to modify the WelcomeText in Welcome dialog. Is there an easier or more elegant way to achieve this?
