In the case where there are multiple observations from one subject (e.g., multiple visits from the same patient), then the 'patient id' is a 'grouping' variable. Care must be taken during model evaluation so that visits from the same patient do not appear in both the training and testing data, because these are correlated and will lead to inflation of classifier accuracy . The cross-validation sklearn documentation has cross-validation iterators for grouped data. See GroupKFold , LeaveOneGroupOut , and LeavePGroupsOut . Even better, try Recurrent Neural Networks or Hidden Markov Models .
