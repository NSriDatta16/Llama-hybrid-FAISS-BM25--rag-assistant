Is nested possible?

in a content page of an asp.net web page, i would like to include the "paypal" button "Pay Now". So, i've a master page, and a content page. In my content page i copy-paste paypal code. In particular i use a "modalpopupextender" to permit my user to buy the object. The problem is... it not work. So my hypotheses are: I'm not sure, but i think i can't use a nested If not the first, maybe i can't use a into a modal popup ? someone can suggest me an "elegant" solutions to solve this ? Thank you ... EDIT: in particular, what i'm trying to do is to permit to sell from a website. I've a master page, and a content page. Obviously in master page i've the classical "form action" . Then i'm gone to paypal and got this code: " Annuncio Premium Premium 1 â‚¬1,00 So i've pasted it into my content page ... as it... without changing. In particular i've pasted it, into a panel, that will show whith a "modalpopupextender". It works. But what it not work is when i click the paypal "Buy Now" button. My web page don't redirect to paypal, modalpopup disappears and nothing happens.
