UML was all the rage a decade ago. It defines a bewildering number of diagram types, one of which is the "Activity diagram". It is a standard for drawing diagrams that show the things you want to show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram for an example and links. I would definitely prefer code or pseudo-code over a diagram though. I think most people who are used to reading code would.
