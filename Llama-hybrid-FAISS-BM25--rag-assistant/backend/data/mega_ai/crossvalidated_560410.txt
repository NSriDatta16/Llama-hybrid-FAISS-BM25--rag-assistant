I'd more be more likely to use ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) or SARIMA (Seasonally ARIMA) models in Python using from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA or statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose. The ARIMA model uses the p,d, q functionality for looking at the autoregressive, d the number of differences required to make the time series stationery (essential for ARIMA/SARIMA analysis) and q is the moving average factor. If performing SARIMA then P,D,Q are also used and x is the frequency of the pattern. In python you can use auto_arima from the pmd package
