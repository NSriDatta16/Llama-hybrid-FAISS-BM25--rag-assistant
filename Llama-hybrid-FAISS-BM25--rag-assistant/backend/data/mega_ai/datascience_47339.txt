How to select between models when AUC scores are similar?

I use two machine learning algorithms for binary classification and I get this result : Algo 1 : AUC- Train : 0.75 AUC- Test: 0.65 big Train / overfitting Algo 2 : AUC- Train : 0.72 AUC- Test: 0.65 small train / small overfitting Which one is better?
