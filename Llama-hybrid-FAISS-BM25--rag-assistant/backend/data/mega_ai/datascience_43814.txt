Let $e$ be the all-one column vector of length $n$ . Let $X\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ be the original matrix. and $X'$ be the transformed matrix, that is we have $X'=XR^T+ev^T$ . Let's first compute the transformed mean assuming the mean of $X$ is $0$ . $$\frac{e^TX'}{n}=\frac{e^TXR'}{n}+\frac{e^Tev^T}{n}=v^T$$ To compute the singular vectors of the original matrix, theoretically, we can compute the eigenvalues of $$X^TX=UDU^T$$ And we can extract $W$ from $U$ . To compute the PCA for the transformed data We have $$(X'-ev^T)^T(X'-ev^T)=(XR^T)^T(XR^T)=R^TX^TXR^T=RUDU^TR^T$$ Now, we can extract $W'$ from $RU$ . That is $$W'=RW.$$
