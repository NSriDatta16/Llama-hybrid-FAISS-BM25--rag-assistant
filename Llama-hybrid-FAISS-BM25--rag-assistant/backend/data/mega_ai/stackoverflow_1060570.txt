Why is non-breaking space not a whitespace character in Java?

While searching for a proper way to trim non-breaking space from parsed HTML, I've first stumbled on Java's spartan definition of String.trim() which is at least properly documented. I wanted to avoid explicitly listing characters eligible for trimming, so I assumed that using Unicode backed methods on the Character class would do the job for me. That's when I discovered that Character.isWhitespace(char) explicitly excludes non-breaking spaces: It is a Unicode space character ( SPACE_SEPARATOR , LINE_SEPARATOR , or PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR ) but is not also a non-breaking space ( '\u00A0' , '\u2007' , '\u202F' ). Why is that? The implementation of corresponding .NET equivalent is less discriminating.
