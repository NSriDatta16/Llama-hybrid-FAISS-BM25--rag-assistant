That very much depends on your server setup. The amount of memory available to the MySQL server being the main concern, then the type of storage the table is configured for. You do not specify what type of indexes are in use, is key a UNIQUE index, or something with duplicates? I would guess at UNIQUE , given the usage - this would remain fast for a very considerable time period. If you keep in mind that the efficiency is approximately o(log n) for searching a unique index, and that the search itself on such an index is relatively trivial, then the index would have to be out of main memory and on some pretty slow media to make much of a difference.
