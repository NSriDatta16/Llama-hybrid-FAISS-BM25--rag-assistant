Cross-validated average: metrics mean or ensembling probabilities?

Let's say I have 5 models cross-validated via leave-one-out strategy. I have the predictions and scores of each model. Now, it's time to calculate the average for the set of 5 models - am I supposed to: add up the 5 losses and divide them by 5? Or average their probabilities for each prediction and use the average probability to calculate new metrics like an ensemble/ forest?
