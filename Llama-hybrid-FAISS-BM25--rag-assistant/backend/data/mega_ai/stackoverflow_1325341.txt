Reverse many-to-many Dictionary >

Actually my previous question got me thinking and I realized that reversing a Dictionary is not trivial. What is the most elegant and readable way to do it? Same scenario student Many to Many with Classes original Dicitonary > where the key is studentId and the Value is a List that contains classId and want to revert to Dictionary > Thanks Update: Actually I just tested Luke and Bruno's solutions and they return the right amount of classed whoever they all have the same student, will update as i go along.
