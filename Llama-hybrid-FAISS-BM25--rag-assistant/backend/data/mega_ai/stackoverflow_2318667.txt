Simple question: In numpy how do you make a multidimensional array of arrays?

Right, perhaps I should be using the normal Python lists for this, but here goes: I want a 9 by 4 multidimensional array/matrix (whatever really) that I want to store arrays in. These arrays will be 1-dimensional and of length 4096. So, I want to be able to go something like column = 0 #column to insert into row = 7 #row to insert into storageMatrix[column,row][0] = NEW_VALUE storageMatrix[column,row][4092] = NEW_VALUE_2 etc.. I appreciate I could be doing something a bit silly/unnecessary here, but it will make it ALOT easier for me to have it structured like this in my code (as there's alot of these, and alot of analysis to be done later). Thanks!
