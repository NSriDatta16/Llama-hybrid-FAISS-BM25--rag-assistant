choppy scrolling in IE7

I've built a website for someone, but according to him, scrolling is very very choppy on the website in IE7 on his computer. On my computer I don't have any problems with scrolling (in any browser), i've already tried some things, but according to him scrolling still is very choppy. So I was wondering if someone has some suggestions for me? I think the main problem is the full width background image, but i'm not entirely sure. The website is: www.casalagodilugano.nl The website is in dutch, but for this question that doesn't have to matter edit: Tx for the helpful answers. In the end, it was indeed the background image which caused problems in IE7. By accident I found a way to work around this problem: I set the image as the background image, centered the image, and using css3 I made sure the was stretched the way it should.
