realloc is ok ... but keep reading :) realloc will not move parts of the memory; it may move the whole block. So you need to copy the data before changing the allocated size. To move the data, memmove (not memcpy ) is a good option: it works for memory areas that belong to the same object. Pay attention to not go over your array limits, though; like you do in your code. for (i = pos; i The arr[i] = arr[i + 1]; will try to access one past the allowed size. You need for (i = pos + 1; i There is somewhat of an overhead when calling realloc . If your structs are not large and/or they live only for a short while, consider keeping both an element count and allocated count and only realloc to enlarge (when (element_count + 1) > (allocated_count) ). If the struct is large, also consider a different data structure (linked list perhaps).
