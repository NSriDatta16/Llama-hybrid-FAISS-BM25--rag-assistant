What does it mean when the test error is nondecreasing as model complexity increases?

In machine learning, I know that there is a bias-variance tradeoff. As model complexity increases, bias decreases, so the test MSE decreases. However, after some threshold, the model begins to overfit, so the model's variance increases, leading to an increase in the test MSE. Overall, the test MSE curve has a U shape. In my case, my test MSE is increasing monotonically as the model complexity increases. What could this indicate?
