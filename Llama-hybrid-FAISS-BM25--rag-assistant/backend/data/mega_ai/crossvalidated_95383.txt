Prediction method where predictors and response variable are binary

I have a group of binary tasks performed by multiple subjects. Every task can be either performed right or wrong (i.e.,1/0). My goal is to predict the accuracy of future task given the performance on previous tasks. As tasks considered to be independent, I thought that it makes sense to average the accuracy by making predictions for every task given the rest. Could you please advise me what is a suitable regression or any predictive model for this kind of data Additionally, I am interested in cross validation between variables: Lets say I have 10 variables. I'm interested in averaged accuracy of prediction when first 9 variables are predictors and the last one is the response variable, then variables 1-8,10 are predictors and 9th is the response variable, and so on such that every variable calculated once as a response variable. Thank you for your help
