Why should or shouldn't I store a Dataset, Datatable, etc as a session variable in an ASP.NET page?

I am working on a web application that is consuming a Dataset returned by a web service. As the application is running I store that Dataset as a session variable to be used over and over again as the user navigates to the different pages that will edit the tables within the dataset. The idea was the user will only have to wait for the data once when the application loads then the application would use the session variable until the user saves the changes they made, when that happens it would pass the edited tables to the service to update the database. Is there problems with this design and the storage of the Dataset and Datatables as a session variable? Pros and Cons let me know.
