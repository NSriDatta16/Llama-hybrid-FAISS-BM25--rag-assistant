You can try this wr.reset_index().plot(x='index', y=['a', 'b'], figsize=(10,5), grid=True) The reset_index() will change the index back to column The x = 'index' will use the date index as the x axis The y=['a','b'] will plot both columns as two time series figsize just tell the plot how big to be grid=True will add a grid on the plot You will need to give some extra 'love' to your styling to make it look exactly as your example.
