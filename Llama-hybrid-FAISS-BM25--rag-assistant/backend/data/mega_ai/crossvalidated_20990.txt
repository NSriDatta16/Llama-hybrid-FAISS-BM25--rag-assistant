As whuber says, there's nothing magical about negative scores. Oftentimes a negative score can simply mean that the score was below some baseline (perhaps the average), rather than being worthless (or worth less than nothing). In some contexts, it makes sense to simply rank participants. Some prefer to pay disproportionally for the top few spots. Most poker tournaments do this, for instance. However, even in the context of poker tournaments, there is no universal rule. Some pay the majority of the prize to 1st place while others have a flatter structure that is more uniformly distributed among top participants. Then of course there's also the Ricky Bobby philosphy ("If you ain't first, you're last!") better known as "winner take all." So there are a number of different sensible payout schemes just where the only score is the ranking. Other times you might want to give the prize out proportionally according to scores (which might require re-centering to avoid issues with negative scores). Other times you might want to apply some transformation to that payout though. Lots of things can make sense depending upon the context. How much spread in talent is there? How much luck is involved in performance? What real significance is there between various scores? All these things matter, and there really is no universal "right" answer. There is no "proper way"; it depends on what you are doing.
