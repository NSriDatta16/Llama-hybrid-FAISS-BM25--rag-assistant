To expand on Robert's answer, use the grid search option to avoid local maxima (note that it's maxima, not minima because it's a maximum likelihood estimator), such as: fit Also, do you have the time dimension in the equation? For example, if you have measurements over 30 years, you would want to specify time (assuming your data is in long format), for example: lcmm(fixed = heroin ~ time + covariates...) And to allow for quadratic or cubic shapes in your time dimension, use: lcmm(fixed = heroin ~ poly(time, degree = 3) + covariates...)
