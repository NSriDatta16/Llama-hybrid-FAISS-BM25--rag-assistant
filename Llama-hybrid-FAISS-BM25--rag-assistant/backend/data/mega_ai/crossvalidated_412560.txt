Let us start from the scratch here. Let $X_i \, i = 1,2,...,n$ be independent random variables which take value $0$ if failure occurs on the $i^{th}$ trial and $1$ if success. Further, let the probability of success in each trial be $p$ . Then each $X_i$ are identical too. Further we know that, from the theory of statistics, $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}X_i \sim Bin(n, p)$ Further, let $\hat{p} = \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i}{n}$ be the observed sample proportion. We need to check or infact build a $99\%$ confidence interval for $p$ based on the observed $\hat{p}$ . Now, for a very brief description of confidence intervals, it is a random interval $(a(\textbf{X}), b(\textbf{X}))$ (where $\textbf{X}$ is the random vector) with some pre-specified level of confidence say $(1-\alpha)$ such that when the sampling procedure is repeated for a large number of times, these random intervals shall contain the true parameter $100(1-\alpha)\%$ times. You can read more about confidence intervals online. Given this description, we may now proceed to solve our problem. So we need an interval of type $(a(\textbf{X}), b(\textbf{X}))$ such that when we repeat our experiment with $n$ trials, a large number of times, these intervals will contain the true value of $p$ on an average $99\%$ of times. There are various methods available to construct the confidence intervals, however I would proceed with the most common one, that is Pivotal Quantity Method . Again, you can read more about this online. For the purpose of this answer, a pivotal quantity is that quantity whose distribution does not depend on any parameter. Now, since your $n(=100)$ is large and assuming that the value of $p$ does not lie in the extremes, we have by the CLT that $Z(say) = \dfrac{\hat{p} - E(\hat{p})}{\sqrt{Var(\hat{p})}} \sim N(0,1)$ . Clearly $Z$ is a pivotal quantity. Further, $E(\hat{p}) = p$ and $Var(\hat{p}) = \frac{p(1-p)}{n}$ . But since, $p$ is unknown, we use an estimate of $Var(\hat{p})$ instead, which is equal to $\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}$ . Now, all we need is to construct the confidence interval. We know that since $Z \sim N(0,1)$ , $P(-Z_{0.005} Where $Z_{\alpha}$ is such that $P(Z \geq Z_{\alpha}) = \alpha$ and $Z$ is the standard normal variate. So, $P(-Z_{0.005} Finally, rearrange the inequalities inside the probability to obtain a statement in terms of the parameter $p$ and by plugging in the values of observed $\hat{p}$ , you get the required confidence intervals. Note : Another answer mentioned about using cumulative distribution function of Binomial distribution to construct such intervals. I would like to add that that is also a method. You can use any.
