Something tells me this might be the result of a spider crawling your site trying to guess at your URLs. Can you post of of the logs that show the pages? Are you getting lots of requests for this in a row, from the same user agent? If I'm right you really can't do anything about it except you could code a redirect for each of them, which is pretty easy to do if you can handle PHP. This answer over on WordPress Answers explains how: Creating 301 Redirects for Post, Page, Category and Image URLs? Hope this helps. -Mike
