Basic Pixel/Cell Counting Algorithm

Good night :) I am currently playing with the DevIL library that allows me to load in image and check RGB values per pixel. Just as a personal learning project, I'm trying to write a very basic OCR system for a couple of images I made myself in Photoshop. I am successfully able to remove all the distortions in the image and I'm left with text and numbers. I am currently not looking for an advanced neural network that learns from input. I want to start out relatively easy and so I've set out to identify the individual characters and count the pixels in those characters. I have two problems: Identifying the individual characters. Most importantly: I need an algorithm to count connected pixels (of the same color) without counting pixels I've previously counted. I have no mathemathical background so this is the biggest issue for me. Any help in the matter is appreciated, thanks. edit: I have tagged this question as C++ because that is what I am currently using. However, pseudo-code or easily readable code from another language is also fine.
