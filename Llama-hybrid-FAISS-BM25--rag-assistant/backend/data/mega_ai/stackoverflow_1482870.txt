fenomas is probably most right. (I should probably modify some of my code to use that method). But the method I currently use for classes is: try { if(this["myFunction") { this["myFunction"](); } catch(e:Error) {} which isn't the most elegant since it does throw exceptions. My reason for using this sort of code is that we're doing a bit of dynamic coding and abusing "includes" in flex to write boilerplate code.
