Note that this segment mentions distributions on unobserved variables . Indeed, in most applications these hidden variables are not the primary interest - for example when you make a neural network, you're interested mostly in prediction, not in outputs of hidden layers. Another take would be that when you have a classification or regression problem, you're mostly interested in minimizing loss function - and this in probability language corresponds to minimizing loss with respect to your data generating distribution. For example check wikipedia article on risk .
