how to drop div text within a textbox jQuery

I have a draggable div. I can drop it on a textbox and call myDroppableTextBox.val(draggableDiv.text()) and that works fine... (i can append and prepend as well) But, how do I drop the div text into the text box at the place where the mouse is hovering? (instead of prepending,appending, or replacing the text)
