Autoload is great PHP feature that helps you very much... The perfomance wouldn't suffer if will use the smart taxonomy like: 1. every library stays in the folders "packages" 2. every class is located by replacing the "_" in the class name with the "/" and adding a ".php" at the end class = My_App_Smart_Object file = packages/My/App/Smart/Object.php The benefits of this approach(used by almost any framework) is also a smarter organization of your code :-)
