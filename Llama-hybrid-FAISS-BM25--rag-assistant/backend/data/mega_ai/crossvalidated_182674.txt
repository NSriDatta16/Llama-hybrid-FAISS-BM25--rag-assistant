How do you specify regression models

My question is about the nomenclature of specifying models. I have a specific example, taken from a paper: The outcome $Y$ is an independent Poisson variable, with means determined by the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , such that $$ Y \sim \text{Poisson}(\alpha\beta)$$ Q1) What is the meaning of this statement? From what I understand, the distribution of Poisson variable is given by with mean equal to $\lambda$ . Thus, from the specification above, is $\lambda = \alpha\beta$ ? Q2) if I wanted $\lambda = \alpha + \beta$ , would the model specification then be: $$ Y \sim \text{Poisson}(\alpha + \beta)$$ Q3) How would one specify logistic regression models and linear models in this manner? Particularly for logistic models I have seen $$\text{logit}(\text{Pr}(Y = 1)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dotsm$$ How is this converted into the specification format given above?
