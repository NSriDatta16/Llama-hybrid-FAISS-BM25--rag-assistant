Prediction based on new data in the tsDyn package

I decided to use the tsDyn package to build the model and precision the values. The argument for this package (I previously worked with urca, vars) was the ability to make predictions based on new data. My code looks like this: start_n = 1548 delta_n = 300 pred_n = 24 k = 31 time_series time_series # A tibble: 300 Ã— 3 Osad.ilosc Biogaz.ilosc Sc.surowe 1 46.2 1204. 8370 2 46.2 1218. 8582. 3 45.5 1202. 8967 4 45.8 1220 8024. 5 45.8 1262. 7501 6 46.2 1200 7476. 7 45.8 1170. 7482 8 45.8 1160. 7498. 9 46.5 1190. 7494. 10 45.8 1230. 7484 # forecast linevarf_diff.head I achieve predictions with satisfactory accuracy, especially when using new data. My question is why two time series (Osad.ilosc and Sc.surowe) are also forecasted. What's more - the new data must cover all three time series (including Biogaz.ilosc, i.e. the time series that is subject to prediction). I would like to better understand how this procedure works?
