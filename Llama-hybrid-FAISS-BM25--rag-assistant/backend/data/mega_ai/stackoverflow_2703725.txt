No, and if you are actually reading it back from a hard disk (or probably any permanent storage), the mechanical part will be the bottleneck. If you put the container in a contiguous block of memory, that block must have some free space, and reading that wasted space from the disk wastes timeâ€¦ and disk space. This is classic premature optimization. If you really find yourself needing it, Boost Interprocess has (relatively) serialization-friendly containers.
