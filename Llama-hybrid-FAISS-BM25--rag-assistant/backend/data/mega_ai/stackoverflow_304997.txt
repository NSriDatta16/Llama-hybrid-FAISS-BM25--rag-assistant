Updating Zend_Auth_Storage after edit users profile

I have following situation: I have loged user, standard authentication with DB table $authAdapter = new Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable(Zend_Db_Table::getDefaultAdapter()); $authAdapter->setTableName('users'); $authAdapter->setIdentityColumn('user_name'); $authAdapter->setCredentialColumn('password'); When user edits his profile, I save it into Db, but I need to update also storage (using standard Zend_Auth_Storage_Session). Is there any easy way how to do it? Many thanks.
