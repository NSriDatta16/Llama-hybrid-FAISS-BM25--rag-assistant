Test-Driven-Development - Nope, on purpose. Domain-Driven-Design - Nope, we're still figuring out the domain. Model-Driven-Design/Architecture - Nope Do you test? - We test the builds, and get power-users to test. Unit Testing - Nothing formal (no nUnit etc) Integration Testing - No Acceptance Testing - Yes Code Reviews - Occassionally. Innovative Technologies - random SharePoint tools Agile - Yes Pair Programming - No UML - Never Domain-specific languages - Nope Requirement Specification (How?) - We stay light on this and iterate. We have a BA that does some requirements analysis, but usually we just invite the customer to our planning and daily meetings as we go. No formal docs. Continous Integration - Yes (cruisecontrol.net) Code-Coverage Tools - No (but we do use Visual Studio Code Analysis) Communication - Outlook Effort estimates - ballpark, double it, then double it again. Team size - 2-4 Meetings - everyday at 9am (scrum!) plus a weekly planning/review meeting Code metrics - Nope Bug tracking - Bugzilla Source Control - SVN
