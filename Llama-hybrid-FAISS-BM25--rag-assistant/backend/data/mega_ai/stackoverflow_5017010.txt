A better way to do this is to actually use the bounding box on the sprite itself (which is a CGRect). In this sample code, I put all my sprites in a NSMutableArray and I simple check if the sprite touch is in the bounding box. Make sure you turn on touch detection in the init. If you notice I also accept/reject touches on the layer by returning YES(if I use the touch) or NO(if I don't) - (BOOL)ccTouchBegan:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint location = [self convertTouchToNodeSpace: touch]; for (CCSprite *station in _objectList) { if (CGRectContainsPoint(station.boundingBox, location)) { DLog(@"Found sprite"); return YES; } } return NO; }
