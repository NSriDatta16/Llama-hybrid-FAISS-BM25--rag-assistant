It appears there was a bug (though I was unable to search up a Bugzilla citation) in the PDE Build ant-script generation process as of 3.2 that produced an ant build.xml script fragment like this from the bin.includes : The relevant Ant documentation says that includes contains a "comma- or space-separated list of patterns". Thus (since my directory name contains a space and was copied literally into the includes attribute value) I think the copy task was trying to include a file named Database and a directory named Elements/ . Neither existed, so they were quietly ignored. I suspect the same problem would have bitten if I had a comma in my directory name, but I did not test this. Since I use Eclipse 3.5 interactively, I decided to finally decouple my headless build's Eclipse instance from my target platform (which remains at 3.2 for the moment) and to update my headless PDE Build to 3.5 (by attempting to produce a minimal PDE Build configuration from my interactive instance's plug-ins). Now, the generated build.xml contains this instead: The relevant Ant documentation this time indicates that the only special characters in an individual include are * and ? . Indeed, the bug seems to have been fixed sometime between 3.2 and 3.5: my 3.5-based headless PDE Build now produces a plugin that contains Database Elements ; my tests are happy; my code is happy; I'm happy.
