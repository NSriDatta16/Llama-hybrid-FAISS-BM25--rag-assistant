You'll need to run your pcap_loop() in separate threads, one for each interface, we do that, and it works. Some parts of libpcap, isn't thread safe though, atleast pcap_setfilter(), so provide your own locking around that. If you do no want to use threads, you'll have to provide an event loop yourself, where you monitor the file descriptors of each device with select/poll or similar. You can get the file descriptor for a device handle with pcap_get_selectable_fd().
