> is the child combinator , sometimes mistakenly called the direct descendant combinator. 1 That means the selector div > p.some_class only matches paragraphs of .some_class that are nested directly inside a div , and not any paragraphs that are nested further within. This implies that every element matching div > p.some_class necessarily also matches div p.some_class , with the descendant combinator (space), so the two are understandably often confused. An illustration comparing the child combinator with the descendant combinator: div > p.some_class { background: yellow; } div p.some_class { color: red; } Some text here p.some_class, div p.some_class --> More text here Which elements are matched by which selectors? Matched by both div > p.some_class and div p.some_class This p.some_class is located directly inside the div , hence a parent-child relationship is established between both elements. Since "child" is a type of "descendant", any child element is by definition also a descendant. Therefore, both rules are applied. Matched by only div p.some_class This p.some_class is contained by a blockquote within the div , rather than the div itself. Although this p.some_class is a descendant of the div , it's not a child; it's a grandchild. Therefore, only the rule with the descendant combinator in its selector is applied. 1 Many people go further to call it "direct child" or "immediate child", but that's completely unnecessary (and incredibly annoying to me), because a child element is immediate by definition anyway, so they mean the exact same thing. There's no such thing as an "indirect child".
