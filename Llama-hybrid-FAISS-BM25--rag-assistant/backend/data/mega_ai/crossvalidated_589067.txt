HDBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm. By using t-SNE, you are inherently losing out on information, since the algorithm preserves neither distances nor density, both of which are essential for HDBSCAN. Since you are interested in preserving the density for HDBSCAN, Since you need to reduce the dimensionality of your embeddings, you may want to look into using DensMAP or UMAP in place of t-SNE. see link . Additionally, it could also be of value to try higher values for your min_samples parameter. HDBSCAN will use the min_samples parameter to estimate a probability density function for your data. Using a very low value for min_samples will result in a very noisy estimate for the PDF while using a very high value will result in the finer details of the PDF being lost. If you'd like to look into it more, consider taking a look at this article that offers some insight into the workings of HDBSCAN.
