Understanding the math behind regression from .fit method

Just to preface, I am very new to machine learning and linear regression. I have this simple data set with attributes: area, bedrooms, and age...trying to predict the price of a house. Here is a screenshot of my Jupyter notebook I am having trouble understanding how these coefficients were calculated (137.25, -26025, -6825). How were these values calculated? I have tried the least-squares solution. This was my work: As you can see I used the formula $(A^T A)^{-1} A^T b$ . The matrix I calculated does not match the coefficients calculated in reg.coef_ . What is the math behind these calculations?
