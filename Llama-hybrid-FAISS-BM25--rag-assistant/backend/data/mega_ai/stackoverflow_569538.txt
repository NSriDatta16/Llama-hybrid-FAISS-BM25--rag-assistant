"as" is faster, but things to bear in mind are: "as" returns a null instead of throwing an exception if that's a problem it won't do custom conversions iirc it doesn't work for reference->value Edit: "as" definitely is faster ( http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/csharpcasts.aspx ) Edit2: so basically a speed vs safety decision
