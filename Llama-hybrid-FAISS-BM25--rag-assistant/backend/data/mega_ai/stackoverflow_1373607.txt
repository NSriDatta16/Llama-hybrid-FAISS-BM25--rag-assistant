WebForms, AJAX and prompt popups elegantly

I have a web site already developed with tons of updatePanels, buttons, and integrated functionality. I have to add some confirmation prompts, these prompts should be customized, and have options like 'Continue', 'Cancel' . This is a possible scenario: The user writes something in one textbox, and then clicks a submit button. The Prompt appears. When the user clicks continue the page should continue with the normal flow, and when press cancel the submit action should be stopped. I want to be the less obtrusive possible, What is the best approach to achieve this? EDIT: I can't use any library like Jquery. I can use ModalPopupExtenders, or simply styled divs. Fundamentally the problem is when clicking this submit button, the submit action is taken and my popup does not appear, even if I add the JS function at onclick Event. I can ClearAll submit button handlers, add the one that shows my popup, but how can I continue with the 'submit' action when the popup's 'continue' btn is clicked?
