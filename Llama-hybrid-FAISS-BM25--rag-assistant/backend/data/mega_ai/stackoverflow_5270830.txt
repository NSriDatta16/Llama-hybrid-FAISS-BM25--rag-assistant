VB.NET isn't a dynamic language: you can't do such things. Since VB.NET doesn't have a "dynamic" keyword like C#, your option is reflection: myClass.GetType().GetProperty("Prop_" + i.ToString()).SetValue(myClass, val[i], null); But if you're more explicit with your problem maybe there's a more elegant solution than reflection ;)
