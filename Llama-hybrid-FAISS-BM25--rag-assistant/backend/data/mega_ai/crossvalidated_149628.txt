The Average is a good measure when a dataset contains values that are relatively evenly spread with exceptionally NO high or low values. You can use 'Median' if you find extreme values in your dataset. It ignores the extreme values (outliers). You may want to plot a histogram / box plot to check for outliers and decide which one to use. For more understanding please refer this link . Hope this helps !
