I would suggest plotting a histogram to see the class distribution. In the example below, our target is "death by age 75". We can see that over half of those with blood type 'b' are dead, yet there are relatively few observations having that blood type. We might want to define a minimum number of observations before we allow a unique class, e.g. require at least 30 observations - given that rule, we would bin class 'ab' and 'b' together. Imagining there were more classes, we could reduce further classes wherein the target is infrequent. Another suggestion is to use an optimal binning method: Use a machine learning algorithm, e.g. decision tree, to find a good combination of classes with respect to the target class.
