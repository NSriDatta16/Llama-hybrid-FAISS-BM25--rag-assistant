I need a statistical diagram which will help me depict the following data

I have a temperature data with respect to the land use land cover percentage. eg: Residential Area: 30% Land cover: 45 deg C Temperature Water Area: 2% Land Cover: 22 deg C Temperature and so on.... I have around 12 classes of area, and corresponding to ever class, its percentage area cover and corresponding average temperature. Percentage Area cover adds up to 100.
