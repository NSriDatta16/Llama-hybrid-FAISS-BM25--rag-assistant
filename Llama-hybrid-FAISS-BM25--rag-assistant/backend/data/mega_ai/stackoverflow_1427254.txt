Flash Font embedding problem

I am facing a wired problem with a project. I am embedding Arial font as project is multi-lingual. If I build this project on one of my development machine, Font gets embedded successfully but in any of other machine, project successfully gets published without any warning but font just dont get embedded in SWF. Note : Project code base is quite big. What on the earth can prevent flash embedding font ? any ideas guys? Thanks, Bhavesh Bagadiya
