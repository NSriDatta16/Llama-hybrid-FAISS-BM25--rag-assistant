The GData apis are what you're looking for. There are APIs for .NET, PHP, and Java at least (having used all, they are all fine)[1]. I have used the Zend Framework's implementation [2] to great success making a timeclock application totaling the hours the members in our organization recorded on their Google calendars, and the .NET framework is just as good. For a website, this is the way to go. There is also a nifty command line tool, though I have not has as much success with it (Both *nix and Windows command line, though of course you'll have much more processing power in *nix ;)) [1] http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/client-libraries.html [2] http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.gdata.html [3] http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/ [Edit] The project I mentioned for building a timeclock is available at http://code.google.com/p/gcaltimeclock/ The files you are probably most interested in are http://code.google.com/p/gcaltimeclock/source/browse/application/controllers/calendars.php and http://code.google.com/p/gcaltimeclock/source/browse/application/views/calendars/timesheets.php
