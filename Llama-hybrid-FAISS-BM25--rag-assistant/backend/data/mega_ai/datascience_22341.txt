I think the black box concept as used in this way originates from black box testing in software and hardware Quality Assurance. It is when you either choose not to / or even can't look into and see the inner working of what you are testing. It could be for a reason that it would be impractical or impossible to peek into it (it is in a sealed environment and we simply can't look into it) - But it might as well be because there is a larger chance of writing crappy tests if one can see the inside. Larger risk of (with or without intent) "writing tests designed to pass". Writing the test to fit the thing that is being tested, lowering the chances of actually finding anything. It would be perfectly possible for a skilled signal engineer to peek into the inner workings of a neural network and check which features are being selected for in a particular training sequence.
