I agree with Christian's answer (+1) but would add that, 1) EFA is not, strictly speaking, a data reduction method but a way to find latent factors. PCA is a data reduction method. 2) for regression purposes, PCA might not be ideal, because it does not consider the dependent variable at all. You could look into partial least squares regression.
