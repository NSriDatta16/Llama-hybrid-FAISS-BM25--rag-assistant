In theory, the CSS 2.0 and CSS 3 property font-size-adjust was created for that use, but its support is weak. No IE (surprise!), Fx 3.0+ and afaik no support in Saf 4 and no Op 10.5. I wonder why both Arial Narrow aren't the same size (and have no answer) but I'd like to point out that Arial Narrow is licensed by Ascender to Microsoft and can be purchased here: http://www.fontslive.com/font/arial-narrow-regular.aspx (and this condensed family was created by Monotype). For a non-commercial website http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web says that it's too late (2002) and that the packages should be kept in their original format and filenames: embedding modifies the former.
