Regarding your first question (computing reliability estimates on your own data vs. rely on published reliabilities), several methodologists recommend using your own data, in particular because reliability can vary depending on the population (see a reference on this below). In a way, reliability is a property of a particular set of scores, not of a scale per se . In the long term, reporting reliability estimates is also useful for things like reliability generalization studies. Vacha-Haase, T., Kogan, L.R., & Thompson, B. (2000). Sample compositions and variabilities in published studies versus those in test manuals: Validity of score reliability inductions. Educational and Psychological Measurement, 60 (4), 509-522.
