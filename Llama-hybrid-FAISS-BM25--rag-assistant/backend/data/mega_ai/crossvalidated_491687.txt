Very interesting question! I'll provide a couple of hints to hopefully get you started. First, please refer to the 2019 article A General Framework for Comparing Predictions and Marginal Effects across Models by Mize et al.: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0081175019852763 . While this article covers a more general setting than yours (i.e., comparing predictions across multiple models), it does include a nice discussion on comparing predictions within the same model in its section 4.1. Testing the Equality of Predictions and Marginal Effects . The discussion is simplified, in the sense that it considers a simpler setting where one would be interesting in comparing two predictions. This would be akin to you having only two education levels - no highschool versus highschool or beyond - and wanting to compare the true value of your response variable between the average subject having no highschool education and the average subject having highschool education or beyond. You could accomplish this comparison using a Wald test whose test statistic is computed as $z = num/denum$ where: $num = pred1 - pred2$ $denum = \sqrt{SE(pred1)^2 + SE(pred2)^2 -2Cov(pred1,pred2)}$ The null hypothesis of equality in the true mean values of the response variable for the two average individuals is rejected if $z$ exceeds the critical value. (I presume we are dealing with the critical value of the standard normal distrubution, but am not sure this is the case and the article is vague about it.) Here, pred1 is the predicted value of the response variable corresponding to the average subject with no high scool education and pred2 is the predicted value of the response variable corresponding to the average subject with high scool education or beyond. SE denotes the standard error of the prediction and Cov denotes the covariance between the two predictions. This link explains in detail how you can get the variance-covariance matrix for your predictions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39337862/linear-model-with-lm-how-to-get-prediction-variance-of-sum-of-predicted-value In essence, what you would need from this link is something like this: ## compute predictions from lm model oo You will need to define your newdata so that it includes all the predictor variables in your model, set to the values you need. An easy way to do that is to use the expand.grid() function. You will also need to copy the definition of the lm_predict() function from the link provided and paste it in your R working space. The article I mentioned above states that it is possible to expand this Wald testing approach to situations where you would need to compare more than 2 predicted values. The article suggests that "this test can be generalized to test more complex hypotheses, such as the equality of more than two effects (Cameron and Trivedi 2005:135â€“39)" . I have not yet checked the Cameron and Trivedi reference, but here it is: Cameron, A. Colin, Trivedi, Pravin K. 2005. Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications.
