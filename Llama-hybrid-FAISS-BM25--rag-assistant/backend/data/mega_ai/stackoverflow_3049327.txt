Replacing SUMIFS in Excel 2003

So, I need to find an Excel 2003 substitute for =SUMIFS, which is only 2007+ (apparently). The formula is used to generate this summary data table, from a list of revenue, where each revenue line has the field type (static, email or outreach) and the field fund (ABC, QRS and XYZ). type fund total count average static ABC $12,390.88 171 $72.46 email ABC $6,051.32 65 $93.10 outreach ABC $8,835.00 138 $64.02 static QRS $12,925.44 79 $163.61 email QRS $9,305.44 99 $93.99 outreach QRS $1,799.00 49 $36.71 static XYZ $4,912.20 36 $136.45 email XYZ $75.00 2 $37.50 outreach XYZ $0.00 0 #DIV/0! This is the formula `=SUMIFS('revenue'!G:G,'revenue'!AH:AH,Sheet2!A2,'revenue'!AI:AI,Sheet2!B2)` Where G is a dollar amount, and AH and AI are matching the type or fund column. How do i get this to work in Excel 2003?
