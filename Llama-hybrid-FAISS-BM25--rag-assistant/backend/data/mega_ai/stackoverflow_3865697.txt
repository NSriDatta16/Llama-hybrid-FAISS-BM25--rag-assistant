Why don't I always see IE's "Internet Explorer blocked this site from download files..."?

I see there are several questions regarding how to deal with IE's 'protect your security, Internet Explorer blocked this site from downloading files to your computer. ' toolbar. My problem is that I have two different tools that I use to download files and one, when a 'trusted' site with medium security in IE8 downloads file just fine. The other tool will not download the file. The headers for the failed download: (failed means a download file security message shows up) HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1 Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="file.xls" Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel Transfer-Encoding: chunked Date: Tue, 05 Oct 2010 16:19:08 GMT the headers for the other download: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 05 Oct 2010 16:23:41 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.3 (Red Hat) Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="excel_report.xls" Content-Length: 55808 Connection: close Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel;charset=ISO-8859-1 Both downloads are coming from the same domain, they are different web application contexts. I have tried putting content-length in the first, and event some Pragma headers I've seen bandied about on some sites. If this rings any bells for someone I'd be much obliged.
