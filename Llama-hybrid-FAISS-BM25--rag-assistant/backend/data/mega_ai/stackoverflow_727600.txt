NSURLConnection delegate doesn't get its didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge method on server status 401

I've setup a simple NSURLConnection to query an http-server. GET /path HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.1.161:8282 User-Agent: NetTest1.0 CFNetwork/441.0.2 Darwin/9.6.0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-us Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Pragma: no-cache Connection: keep-alive The server responds with code 401 and the WWW-Authenticate header set HTTP/1.1 401 Connection: close Pragma: no-cache Expires: Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT Cache-control: no-cache Cache-last-checked: Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT Last-modified: Tue, 07 Apr 02009 22:55:48 CEST Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm: I would imagine this would send a message to my delegate's connection: didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge: method, but it does not. I've also implemented - (BOOL)connectionShouldUseCredentialStorage:(NSURLConnection *)connection { return FALSE; } Just to make sure it doesn't try to send along cached credentials from my keychain, which it does not.
