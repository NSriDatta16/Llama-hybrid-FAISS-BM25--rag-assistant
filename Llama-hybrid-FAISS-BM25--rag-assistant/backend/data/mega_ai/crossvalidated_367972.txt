Difference between independence and stationarity tests in time series

This is meant to be a general question, aiming to clarify the topic for a beginner in TSA, as I haven't found any clear introductory explaination yet. Suppose I am working with some data which includes some time variable. Then I want to know if this variable is significative and if it is worth to structure my analysis as a TSA or not. I'm not specifically looking for any seasonality in the data, just want to know if time is an important feature in my analysis. Should I test for stationarity or independence ? Independence Two events are statistically independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other. Let $A$ and $B$ be two events then they are independent if and only if: $P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$ Stationarity A stationary process is a stochastic process whose unconditional joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. Let $X_t$ be a stochastic process and $F_X$ represent the cumulative distribution function of the unconditional joint distribution of $X_t$ , then $X_t$ is stationary if for all $k$ , $\tau$ and $t_1,..., t_k$ $F_X(x_{t_1+\tau},...,x_{t_k+\tau}) = F_X(x_{t_1},...,x_{t_k})$ I see that the definitions of these properties are very similar, but I'm not sure about their relation in this context. What is the difference between these two concepts in this context? [ Bonus question ] What tests should I use in this situation?
