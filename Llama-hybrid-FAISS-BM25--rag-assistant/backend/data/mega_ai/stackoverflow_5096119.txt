Okay, first things first. I'm going to assume that you already figured out how to get commands from the "admin" to the "client". If this is not true, just let me know. Second: this is an outrageously difficult thing to build Third: here's a start ;-) To use the default SL4 webbrowser component, you need to run your application out-of-browser with elevated trust. So you should set that up first. In my test app, I added a webbrowser component and subscribed to the LoadCompleted event. In your eventhandler you can use something like: void webBrowser1_LoadCompleted(object sender, System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationEventArgs e) { //Pseudo code event to update clients OnAdminNavigated(e.Uri); } Clientside you would use something like: void adminNavigated(MyCustomNavigationEventArgs e) { clientBrowser.Navigate(e.Uri); } Hope this helps.
