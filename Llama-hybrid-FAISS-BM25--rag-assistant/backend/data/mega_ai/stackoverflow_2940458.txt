You cannot store a reference to a variable, for precisely the reason that someone could do what you are doing: take a reference to a local variable, and then use that reference after the local variable's storage is reclaimed. Your approach of making the variable into a field of a class is fine. An alternative way of doing the same thing is to make getter and setter delegates to the variable. If the delegates are closed over an outer local variable, that outer local will be hoisted to a field so that its lifetime is longer than that of the delegates.
