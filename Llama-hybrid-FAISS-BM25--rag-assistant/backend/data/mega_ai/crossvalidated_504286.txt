3 models which I have built result in the exact same result, how can it be?

I have 3 models which I have built, I have used the following libraries: library(rpart) library(caTools) library(rpart.plot) library(stats) library(neuralnet) library(caret) library(e1071) library(ROCR) library(AUC) Those 3 models are: Decision tree, Logistic regression and a simple NN. for some reason all models gives me the same exact results how can it be?? All columns of the data are categorical so I made sure all be converted to factor: Converting to factors: for (column in colnames(data)){ data[,column] Decision tree: tree_model Logistic Regression logistic_model $MAX_SEV_IR, Predict_logistic) y_pred_testing_logistic 0.5, 1, 0)) y_pred_testing_logistic overall["Accuracy"])) r Neural Network: set.seed(1) nn 0.5, 1, 0)) y_pred_testing_nn Can somebody please point out what is done wrong, am I missing something? Thank you sincerely!
