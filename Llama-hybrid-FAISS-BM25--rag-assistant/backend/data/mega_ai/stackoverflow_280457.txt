How can I calculate a fair overall game score based on a variable number of matches?

I have a game in which you can score from -40 to +40 on each match. Users are allowed to play any number of matches. I want to calculate a total score that implicitly takes into account the number of matches played. Calculating only the average is not fair. For example, if Peter plays four games and gets 40 points on each match, he will have the same total score as Janne who played only one match with 40 points. Adding up the match scores isn't fair either. Peter plays 2 games (40 points on each match), total score 80. Janne plays 8 games (10 points on each match), total score 80. Is there a (simple) and fair way to calculate the total score? I have read about the Elo & Glicko system for chess ratings, but both are based upon a players rating history and the opponents rating.
