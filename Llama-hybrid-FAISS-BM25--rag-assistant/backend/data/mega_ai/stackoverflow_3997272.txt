If the uploading of files (as well as, presumably, the re-downloading of them) is done only through your website interface, you could rename each file with a GUID (or some other unique entity) and then store the new name and the old name in your database. Alternatively, you could store the file contents in the database itself, which would completely avoid the Windows file-naming restrictions. Note that this isn't necessarily something you want to do - there are pros and cons to both methods of file storage (i.e. disk vs. database).
