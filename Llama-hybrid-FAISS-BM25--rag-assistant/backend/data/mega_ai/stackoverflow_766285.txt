Java 6 includes a built in web server. You can use it like so: HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8000), 0); server.createContext("/", new HttpHandler() { @Override public void handle(HttpExchange xchange) throws IOException { String response = "This is the response"; xchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.length()); OutputStream os = xchange.getResponseBody(); os.write(response.getBytes()); os.close(); } }); server.setExecutor(null); server.start(); And then access http://localhost:8000 to see your response. There are more examples in the JavaDoc for the HttpServer package If you can't guarantee Java 6, take a look at embedding Jetty 6 which is easy and fairly lightwight, i.e. you don't need a whole webapp.
