Number of replications needed for coverage probability study

I am constructing confidence interval based on Wald, likelihood ratio and jackknife for the parameters of a model via simulation. To evaluate which methods is preferable for the parameters, I did a coverage probability study for moderate and large samples. My issue is, I could not find the rule of thumb that how many replications is required. Anyone could help me on this?
