MouseEvent shiftKey or ctrlKey is always false

I am just adding a Flex HSlider to my dialog. It allows for setting a time duration in days, and I thought it would be great if the user can snap to weeks by pressing the SHIFT key while dragging the slider. Unfortunately the event passed to the event-handler contains no key modifier information.. Here is my code: protected function onDurationSliderChange (event:SliderEvent) : void { var durationInDays : int = this.sld_durationInDays.value; // modifiers if (event.triggerEvent is MouseEvent) { var mouseEvt : MouseEvent = event.triggerEvent as MouseEvent; trace (mouseEvt.ctrlKey + " " + mouseEvt.ctrlKey + " " + event.keyCode); trace (mouseEvt); // when using SHIFT, snap to week if (mouseEvt.shiftKey && !mouseEvt.ctrlKey) durationInDays = int(durationInDays/7) * 7; } this.durationInDays = durationInDays; } which produces the following output: false false -1 [MouseEvent type="click" bubbles=true cancelable=false eventPhase=2 localX=NaN localY=NaN stageX=NaN stageY=NaN relatedObject=null ctrlKey=false altKey=false shiftKey=false buttonDown=false delta=0] Anybody got an idea how to find out if SHIFT (or CTRL) was pressed while dragging? Thanks!
