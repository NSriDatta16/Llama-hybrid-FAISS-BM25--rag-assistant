Personally, it bugs me seeing the extra bloat (unnecessary HTML structure, non-semantic use of HTML tags, embedding CSS directly in HTML) that Frontpage generates. I also dislike use of proprietary, non-standard HTML and CSS. Frontpage's code bloat is bad enough to have inspired such programs as Frontpage Code Cleaner . Here's another Stack Overflow question that deals with removing Frontpage bloat: FrontPage tags - Pain in da HTML . You might also check out Why I do not use Frontpage by Greg Moreno.
