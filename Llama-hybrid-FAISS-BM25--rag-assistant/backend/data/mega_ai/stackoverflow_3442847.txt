Just a note. This thread helped get me on track, so I'd just like to add a helpful note. August 9th 2010. In Mac OS X 10.5.8 Leopard the version of Java used is controlled by an app in the path Mac HD/Applications/Utilities/Java Preferences That may have formerly been named Java Settings? The version of Java used for a desktop app does not have to be the same version as used in a browser. I was having a problem launching Portecle (from the command line)- it was reporting a "Bad version number in .class file". As of August 2010 the Mac OS X 10.5.8 default Java sequence is: J2SE 5.0.......32 bit J2SE 5.0.......32 bit Java SE 6.....64 bit J2SE 5.0.......64 bit J2SE 1.4.2 ...32 bit Apparently the Java app I was trying to load needed Java SE 6 64 bit, because dragging Java SE 6 to the top of that list instantly fixed the problem, and Portecle was launchable after that from either the command line or with a double-click or portecle.jar. (hooray)
