In my view, ma12 and ETS(ANN) models seems reasonable. Judging by the plots all your models have equal quality, statistically identical. Which other time series models can be tried ? Not sure if you have tried ARIMA. It's also not clear how exactly you applied the linear model. After looking at raw data charts: I think you could try more steps on top of what you have done: Replace values that show a clear pattern of being out of the line with the rest of the time series with mean/median of neighbours. This may (bot not must) improve a model quality. Combine all you data together (take average all over the sales points for each week). Apply very detailed auto.arima to this one meta series, or, even better, build a model manually. It can be that one model (one set of ARIMA params) will serve well for all of your time series. In order to deal with different scales of sales for different points, I would do this: for each time series take x_diff == diff(log(X)) , than take mean(x_diff ) across all series, and then restore original scale. Make a better decision of whether your linear model is additive or multiplicative. It may be that the variance in different years is strongly not constant, thus additive model ( lm(y ~ t + s) ) may work poorly. Maybe you want to smooth the time series by applying a running mean window in order to deal with outliers.
