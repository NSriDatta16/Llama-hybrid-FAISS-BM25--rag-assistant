The question is too broad to be answered well. Different models work differently, we need to pick the right model for the given data. In general, Here are major differences: SVM is a more complex model (non-linear model) than logistic regression (linear model). It may provide more accuracy, but may suffer from overfitting. SVM will not work well for large amount of data (say a million data points). See Can support vector machine be used in large data? But logistic regression is fine (logistic regression will suffer more on number of features/columns instead of number of rows).
