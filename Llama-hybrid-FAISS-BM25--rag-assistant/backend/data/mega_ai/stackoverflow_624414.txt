YUI Panel and scrolling

I have a draggable YUI Panel defined like this new YAHOO.widget.Panel("parameters", { fixedcenter: true, constraintoviewport: true, underlay: "shadow", visible: false, close: true, draggable: true, width: "350px" }); When the panel is shown, I want it to remain always visible, even when the window is scrolled. This is also the case, thanks to fixedcenter: true . The problem is that when the window is scrolled the panel positions itself to the center of the window even if it was dragged somewhere else previously. How should I modify the above definition so that the position of the panel remains constant relative to the window when the window is scrolled?
