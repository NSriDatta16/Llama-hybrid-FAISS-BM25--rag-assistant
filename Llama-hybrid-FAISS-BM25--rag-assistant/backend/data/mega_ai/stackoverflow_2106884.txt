How large is the database? How large are the RSS updates? Is the entire catalog accessible through that RSS stream? Does the app need to function without an internet connection? The answers here will likely drive your decision. I certainly wouldn't advocate for direct MySQL access. It's a big security risk, and it is very implementation dependent. Your client couldn't do a database redesign without breaking the iPhone app, for example. If you have access to the website (or could convince the client), perhaps a good solution would be to leverage your strengths and expose a RESTful interface to the SQL over the web. Then your iPhone app can simply be a JSON or XML (or whatever) parser and interface. You wouldn't need to worry about the backing store or searching on the iPhone; it'd all be done server-side. You could potentially use RSS, but a big I presume that only the changes are pushed out through the stream. You'd need to keep a copy of the database on the phone, and use RSS to keep it updated. However, you'll have a very tough time with the first sync (since the prepopulated data may be quite stale) and then any sync after a long delay since not all changes may be available anymore. You'd probably have to allow for the entire database to be downloaded through some secondary mechanism. And if it is really big, neither users nor the host will be too happy about that. Moreover, the heuristics of the syncing would be tricky.
