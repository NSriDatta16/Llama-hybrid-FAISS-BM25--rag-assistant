Handling null results with the LINQ Average() method

I am new to LINQ and am trying to create some data points from a table to graph. The three fields of importance in this table are the id, the time and the value. I am writing a query to get the average value over a set time for a chosen id. The LINQ I have written follows: var value = (from t in _table where t.Id == id && t.Time >= intervalStartTime && t.Time However this crashes at runtime with: "The null value cannot be assigned to a member with type System.Decimal which is a non-nullable value type.." At certain intervals there is no data so the SQL LINQ generates returns null, which I would liked to be COALESCED to 0 but instead crashes the application. Is there a way to write this LINQ query to be able to handle this properly? The table definition to make things clearer: [Serializable] [Table(Name = "ExampleTable")] public class ExampleTable { [Column(Name = "Id")] public int Id { get; set; } [Column(Name = "Time")] public DateTime Time { get; set; } [Column(Name = "Value")] public int Value{ get; set; } }
