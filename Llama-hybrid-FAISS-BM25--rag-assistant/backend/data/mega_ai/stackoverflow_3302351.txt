XElement.Value not reading multi-line data

I current have the following XML fragment that I'm parsing to read its values and display them on a web page: The Needles Granite Dells, Prescott Photo Courtesy of Joe Schmoe I'm doing this through the following code (reading fragment from the database): Dim ContentDoc As XDocument Dim DocPoints As IEnumerable(Of XElement) ContentDoc = XDocument.Parse(ContentData.Item(0).content) DocPoints = ContentDoc. .Elements() For Each Item As XElement In DocPoints Dim TempLabel As New Label TempLabel.Text = Item.Name.LocalName & ": " & Item.Value Dim TempLiteral As New Literal TempLiteral.Text = " " pnlEditItems.Controls.Add(TempLabel) pnlEditItems.Controls.Add(TempLiteral) Next When the script runs, all nodes are successfully parsed and displayed, including the empty PostcardDate node, except for the PostcardImage node. When debugging, evaluating Item.Value returns an empty string. However, evaluating Item.ToString() returns the PostcardItem tags and the value within it. Is there something that needs to be done to have the XElement object read multi-line values, or am I missing something else?
