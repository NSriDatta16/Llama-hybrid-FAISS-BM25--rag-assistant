Problems including jar files outside the jar file containing the manifest

Basically let me first explain what I am aiming to do. I have a dynamic ETL transformer app written in JAVA. Due to the dynamic nature of this app I have to be able to add plugins jars to the app in a location outside of the apps jar file. Basically would like to have the following directory structure: AppFolder |- plugins/ |- configs/ |- mainApp.jar If possible I would like to be able to use wildcards in my manifest to dynamically add jars located in the plugins folder. Unfortunately all I have tried so far has failed. I have tried to use both relative paths and absolute paths neither have worked (with or without wildcard). If I however include the plugins folder in the main app's jar file itself it works fine given that I don't use wildcards. So my question is, is it actually possible to have dependencies outside of a jar or do they always have to be contained within. The other question is regarding the usage of wildcards. i have looked at [the java documentation] ( http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/classpath.html ) to no prevail unfortunately. some examples of what I have tried so far: ../plugins/* ../plugins/plugin.jar /abolute/path/to/plugins/* /abolute/path/to/plugins/plugin.jar and unfortunately none of them have done the trick so any help would be very much appreciated...
