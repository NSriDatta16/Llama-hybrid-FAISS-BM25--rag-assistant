With gcov, is it possible to merge to .gcda files?

I have the same source files (C and Obj-C) being compiled into two targets: the unit test executable and the actual product (which then gets integration tested). The two targets build into different places, so the object files, .gcno and .gcda files are separate. Not all source files are compiled into the unit test, so not all objects will exist there. All source files are compiled into the product build. Is there a way to combine the two sets of .gcda files to get the total coverage for unit tests and integration tests (as they are run on the product build)? I'm using lcov. Mac OS X 10.6, GCC 4.0 Thanks!
