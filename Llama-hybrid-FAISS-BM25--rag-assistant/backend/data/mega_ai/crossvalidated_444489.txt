The point that is made in this paper is with regard to the conditional versus marginal interpretation of the regression coefficients. Namely, because of the nonlinear link function used in the mixed effects logistic regression, the fixed effects coefficients have an interpretation conditional on the random effects. Most often this is not the desirable interpretation that relates to groups of individuals. You may find more information regarding this issue here and here . On the contrary, in linear mixed models and because the link function is the identity, you do not have this problem.
