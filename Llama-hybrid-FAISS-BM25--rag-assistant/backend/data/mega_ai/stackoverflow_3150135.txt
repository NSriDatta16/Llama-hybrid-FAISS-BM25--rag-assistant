To be honest, I think this just encourages people to use "magic numbers" as flags: SetBit(&flags, 12); // 12 is the flag for Super mode What you actually want is named constants: #define SUPERMODE_FLAG 12 ... SetBit(&flags, SUPERMODE_FLAG); But if you're going to use named constants, you might as well name masks rather than bit numbers, in which case the operation is so simple there's no need for a helper function: #define SUPERMODE_MASK (1 In the unusual case that you're manipulating individual bits by number, without knowing what they mean, then I prefer the second for the same reason as Kristo - I find side-effect-free functions slightly easier to reason about than mutators.
