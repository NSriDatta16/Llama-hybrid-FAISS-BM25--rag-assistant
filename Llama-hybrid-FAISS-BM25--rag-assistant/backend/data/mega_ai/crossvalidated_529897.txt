one sampled t-Test to compare against chance level performance

For an experiment, I want to test if people at each condition have performed significantly above chance level on average, in which they answer 3 questions, each with two options. I will compare each group to chance level performance, without comparing each group to each other. Then, should I do a one-sampled t-Test by doing these steps, for each single group? Turn each individual's performance to a proportion (0, 0,3333333, 0,66666666, 1) Turn it into a data frame. run it in R with the code t.test(my_dataframe, mu = 0.5, alternative = "two.sided") I can imagine how trivial the question looks, but it's the first time I'm doing it, so I wanted to make sure. Thank you!
