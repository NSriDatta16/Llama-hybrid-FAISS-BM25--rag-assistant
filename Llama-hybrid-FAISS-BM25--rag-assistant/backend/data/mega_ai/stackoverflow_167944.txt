I don't think it's possible to enforce strong passwords, but there are lots of things you can do to encourage them as much as possible. Rate each password and give the user feedback in the form of a score or a graphical bar, etc. Set a minimum password score to weed out the awful ones Have a list of common words that are either banned, or tank the password score One excellent trick I like to use is to have the password's expiry date tied to the password score. So stronger passwords don't need to be changed so often. This works particularly well if you can give users direct feedback about how long the password they've chosen will live for (and dynamically update it so they can see how adding characters affects the date).
