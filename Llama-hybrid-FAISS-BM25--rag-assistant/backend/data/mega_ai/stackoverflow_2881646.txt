I don't know if this also applies for MC75, but on Start->Settings->Control Panel->System there should be a Memory tab, where you can adjust how much memory is available as RAM, and how much is reserved for storing files. This does not apply to the \Permanent Storage folder (or \Storage Card, as it's called on our device), but to the other folders, like \Temp.
