(Very short answer) The text for commenting says avoid answering questions in comments. so here it goes: There is a paper about an online algorithm which seemingly runs quite well: Applying the $Q_n$ Estimator Online . EDIT (by user user603). The algorithm linked to in this article is a moving window version version of the $Q_n$ . Given a large sample $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$ divided into time windows of width $n , $\{x_i\}_{i=t-n+1}^t$ we can apply the $Q_n$ to each time window yielding $N-n+1$ values of the $Q_n$ . Denote these values $\{Q_n^i\}_{i=1}^{N-n+1}$ The algorithm cited here allows to obtain $Q_n^i|Q_n^{i-1}$ at an average cost less than the worst case $O(n\log(n))$ needed to compute $Q_n^i$ from scratch. This algorithm can however not be used to compute the $Q_n$ of the full original sample $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$ . It also needs to maintain an buffer whose size can be as large as $O(n^2)$ (though it is often much smaller).
