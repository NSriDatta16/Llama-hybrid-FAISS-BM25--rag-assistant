Is there any way to integrate OpenCV with PHP?

I am trying to develop an application with PHP. There are two possible ways this application will be developed. The first one is to try to do something like www.picnik.com , image processing directly on the browser. The other is to develop CBIR (content-bases image retrieval) algorithms. So, is it possible to send an image from a PHP script to an OpenCV program? Or even display the image being manipulated in real time? Thanks.
