How to keep testing and production e-commerce db in sync when you have "sales" updates in production?

I've read the following thread in SO, Keeping testing and production server environments clean, in sync, and consistent , and I still have some doubts in what is the best way to do it. "You should do modifications to your test environment and replicate it to your production server". Problem is I'm using Magento installation: I have different modifications in test and production environment in different times (like sales in production server), and I don't know what is the best way to keep them in sync. "Digging" in Magento's table structure is going to be a pain since there are 200+ tables. What are your opinions about it? Are there tools that could help me to sync the databases in this situation? Is there a MySql configuration to do it? Thanks in advance!
