Algorithm to estimate number of English translation words from Japanese source

I'm trying to come up with a way to estimate the number of English words a translation from Japanese will turn into. Japanese has three main scripts -- Kanji , Hiragana , and Katakana -- and each has a different average character-to-word ratio (Kanji being the lowest, Katakana the highest). Examples: computer: コンピュータ (Katakana - 6 characters); 計算機 (Kanji: 3 characters) whale: くじら (Hiragana -- 3 characters); 鯨 (Kanji: 1 character) As data, I have a large glossary of Japanese words and their English translations, and a fairly large corpus of matched Japanese source documents and their English translations. I want to come up with a formula that will count numbers of Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana characters in a source text, and estimate the number of English words this is likely to turn into.
