Average of marks in examinations

Is it statistically correct to find out final marks of a student in a paper by taking arithmetic mean only of 4 valuations of a single paper without an answer key, or any rectification measures for the outlier marks? For eg. Marks obtained by Candidate in 4 valuations are 43, 45, 48 and 51 in a single paper in 4 different valuations. Final marks awarded by taking average of these 4 are 47. Is this method scientifically and statistically correct in an examination?
