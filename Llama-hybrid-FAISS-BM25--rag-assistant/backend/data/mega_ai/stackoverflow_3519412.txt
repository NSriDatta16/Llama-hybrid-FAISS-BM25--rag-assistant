There's an awful lot to cover. If you have a specific area you're interested in, perhaps we can offer something more specific. In general terms, I'll use this opportunity to plug my blog , which has a lot of App Engine material. I would take issue with one of your points, however: Using cron jobs for keeping an application from being unserved is necessary if you want consistent response time. First of all, this is a 'tragedy of the commons' issue. Apps are unscheduled when they're idle to make way for apps that are serving traffic; a bunch of people running 'keepalive' cronjobs forces all apps to be unloaded faster, leaving everyone worse off. Second, you're always going to get occasional loading requests, even with a keepalive cron job. Additional instances of your app are scheduled whenever required, so whenever you get a surge of traffic this will happen, and someone will inevitably get a loading request. Finally, loading requests don't need to be a big issue. Particularly with the recent Python precompilation support we recently added, loading requests don't have to take a huge amount of time, and work you spend on optimization will benefit all your users.
