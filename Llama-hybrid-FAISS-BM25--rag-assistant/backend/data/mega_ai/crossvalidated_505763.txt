We can find an answer in the abstract of " Efficient Optimization for Rank-based Loss Functions " by Pritish Mohapatra Michal Rol√≠nek, C.V. Jawahar, Vladimir Kolmogorov, M. Pawan Kumar. The abstract specifically names the two ranking-based measures as OP's quotation, average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain. The accuracy of information retrieval systems is often measured using complex loss functions such as the average precision (AP) or the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). Given a set of positive and negative samples, the parameters of a retrieval system can be estimated by minimizing these loss functions. However, the non-differentiability and non-decomposability of these loss functions does not allow for simple gradient based optimization algorithms. The paper develops these ideas in more detail.
