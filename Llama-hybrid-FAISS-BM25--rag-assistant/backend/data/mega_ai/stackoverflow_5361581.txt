Warning: DOMDocument::loadXML() [function.DOMDocument-loadXML]: Entity 'laquo' not defined in Entity

I intrecept server's response using xml,xsl and extract required fragments, to extract html fragments from server reponse on client requrest. For example, lets suppose, that $content have server response, before we process it. $dom = new domDocument(); $dom->loadXML($content); $xslProgram = xslProgram; $domXsl = new domDocument(); $domXsl->loadXML($xslProgram); $xsl = new XSLTProcessor(); $xsl->importStylesheet($domXsl); $content = $xsl->transformToXml($dom); It looks like everything is working correct, but when it detects &nbsp, &laquo, &raquo, etc, there is a message appears "Warning: DOMDocument::loadXML() [function.DOMDocument-loadXML]: Entity 'laquo' not defined in Entity" At first I just replaced all this elements (&nbsp and others) with their unicode equiavalents ( str_replace), but then I understand that I can't consider all this variants. How can I solve this problem? Let me know if you don't undestand me, I can write better explanation. Thanks, Ahmed.
