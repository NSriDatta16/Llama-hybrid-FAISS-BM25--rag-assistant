XML is not a database, it's a file format (or, to be more precise, an input or output stream format). It allows you to define your own format using XML's syntax elements and then you can, for example, convert your memory object to an XML stream and save it to disk. mySQL is a software product that belongs to the class of products called DBMS (Database managent system). DBMSs manage your data and provide various storage, retrieval, indexing, querying, and transactional capabilities. What you need to decide is whether you need a file format or a management system. Depending on that, your choice may be XML (or some other format, e.g. JSON or a plain-text file) or mySQL (or another relational DBMS, e.g. MS SQL Server or Oracle -- or may even be a non-relational DBMS).
