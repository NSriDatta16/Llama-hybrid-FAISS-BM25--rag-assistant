Distinguish whether time series comes from or another Poisson process

I have a time series of binary events, where the events are drawn from a Poisson process with a 50% chance of having a rate of $\lambda_1$ and a 50% change of having a rate of $\lambda_2$ . Here $\lambda_1\approx10\times\lambda_2$ . My goal is to distinguish between the two in as minimal a total time as possible. The simplest solution would be to simply set a threshold in the total number of measured events, and if the number is less than the threshold, classify the rate as $\lambda_2$ , and if the number is greater than the threshold, classify the rate as $\lambda_1$ . However, doing so requires long time measurements so the two distributions sufficiently separate. I am wondering if there is any other information that can be gleaned from short time-series data which can help distinguish them, or what test statistic might be used for hypothesis testing besides just their total sum.
