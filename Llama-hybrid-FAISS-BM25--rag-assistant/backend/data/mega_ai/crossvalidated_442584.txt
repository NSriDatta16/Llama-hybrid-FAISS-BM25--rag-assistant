Yes, this is possible. Prediction is only one of the possible goals of logistic regression. It can also be used for statistical inference e.g. doing statistical tests on the coefficients of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation. However, if you use your model for prediction, then it is important to keep your training and test set seperate to avoid Data Leakage i.e. having overly confident estimates of prediction accuracy because the model was evaluated on the same data it was trained on.
