What could be some Classification techniques to classify a tree of webpages given the category of each webpage

I want to perform a website classification task where I have modeled a website as a tree of webpages. I already have a model which can assign categories to the nodes in the tree (webpages). I need guidance on how can I combine those node categories to get the overall category of the tree. What classification techniques could be used ? As of now I know about usage of markov chains for this task from this research paper, Web Site Mining . I would be grateful if i could get some more ideas about how to perform the task.
