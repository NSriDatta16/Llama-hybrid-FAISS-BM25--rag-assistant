The -[UIView bringSubviewToFront:] method only works for direct children, not grandchildren. Remember that the view hierarchy is a tree, and normally a view only knows about its "parent" (or superview) and its direct "children" (or subviews). You would need to do something like this: // First, get the view embedding the grandchildview to front. [self bringSubviewToFront:[grandchildview superview]]; // Now, inside that container view, get the "grandchildview" to front. [[grandchildview superview] bringSubviewToFront:grandchildview];
