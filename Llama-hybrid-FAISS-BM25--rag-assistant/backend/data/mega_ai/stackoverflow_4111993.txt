In HTML5 client-side storage how do you get the value of the key?

I stored a value with a key like this localStorage[title] = text; I know I can recall the text by doing var text = localStorage[title] but how do you get the value of the title to insert into the localStorage so that the program knows what value to get. Is there any way to loop through the keys in the localStorage ?
