How to update a view from code in an Eclipse RCP app

I have a View class (extends ViewPart ) that contains a ScrolledForm created from a FormToolkit . When certain events happen in other views in the app I want to change the form in this view and have it update in real time to the user. I have property change support support added now and the following method in the View public void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent event) { form.dispose(); toolkit.dispose(); createForm( event ); form.redraw(); } where createForm( event ) recreates the form based on the event. The problem is that the UI does not display the new form after this. I know the form is created OK because if I drag the border between the View and another view to resize it then the View is immediately updated to show the new form. How can I programmatically force the refresh of the view in the UI?
