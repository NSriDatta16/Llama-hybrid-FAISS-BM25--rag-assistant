How does shape size impact container fill rate?

Imagine that you are placing randomly-sized shapes (lines in 1d, rectangles in 2d, etc) is a cuboid-shaped container. I am interested in how increasing the average shape size (and size variance) impacts the effectiveness of how well the cuboid is filled. I did a lot of research on this mainly on Wikipedia (Knapsack problem and bin packing) but I didn't find what I was looking for. I am looking for resources on a specific relationship (or approximation) for how shape size $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ impact the % of cuboid filled. Intuitively, if you are filling a cuboid with very small cubes, you will get a near perfect fill rate, but if you are filling with large cubes (i.e. almost the same size as the container) then it will be much worse. The only good resource that I found so far was here which explains the 1d case in more detail and he number of cubes you can fit into the container tending to $x/\mu+\mu^2/\sigma^2$ .
