Flex: How to assign method to Image.MouseMove event programmatically?

I understand how to declaratively assign a method to be called when an Image receives a MouseMove event. How do I do this programmatically in Flex/AS3? EDIT: Thanks for the comments. Here's what I have so far: myImage = new Image(); myImage.id = "oneCent"; myImage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, dragIt); The code snippet above assigns the dragIt method to the MOUSE_MOVE event for myImage. So far, so good. How do I pass in the 2nd parameter to the call to dragIt?
