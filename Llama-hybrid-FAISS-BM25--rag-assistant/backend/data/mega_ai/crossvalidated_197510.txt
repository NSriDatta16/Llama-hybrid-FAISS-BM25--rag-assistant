Are All Bayesian Methods also Parameteric?

Bayesian methods have belief over the prior distribution over variables. They update this belief with evidence. We know that parametric statistical methods are considered to be methods which have an assumption on the distribution of the variables. My question: Since, Bayesian methods use a prior distribution over the variables, are all bayesian methods also parameteric?
