I am starting to feel that the word "get" is losing its meaning because of inflation. It is noise in my code. I would slightly disagree with this conclusion. I wouldn't say it loses its meaning, I would say that as it is widely used that methods with the get prefix will do pretty much what you expect them to do. For the following example: Time.isoFormattedDateString(Date date) Does this set the format type based on the input parameter so all subsequent calls will use this format? I know it is a bit of a stretch that someone would come to that conclusion as it is a static method but would you be as sure if this method was called on an instance? Probably, but the use of get removes all ambiguity: getIsoFormattedDateString(Date date) In my opinion, properties are a more elegant solution than dropping get altogether.
