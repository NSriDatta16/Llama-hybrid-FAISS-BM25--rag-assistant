If you want to test whether it breaks when used with SSL, you could easily test drive it by downloading and installing OpenSSL , follow this tutorial to create a self-signed certificate with OpenSSL, install your newly created certificate on your web server (Apache, if you are using LAMP or XAMPP) and finally restart your web server. Now you have SSL ready to be used, try to use your login form via https:// and see what happens. If a web browser like Firefox complains about your certificate, tell it to create an exception. That is how you can test it over SSL, but as for the "whether it is correctly secured", things get harder. Make sure you have at least taken care of: Session fixation Cross-site scripting Secure password storage (hashing) SQL injections Protecting against brute forcing with throttling or using CAPTCHAs
