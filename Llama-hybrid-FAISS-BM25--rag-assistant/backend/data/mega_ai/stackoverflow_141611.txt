iterating over Enum constants in JSP

I have an Enum like this package com.example; public enum CoverageEnum { COUNTRY, REGIONAL, COUNTY } I would like to iterate over these constants in JSP without using scriptlet code. I know I can do it with scriptlet code like this: "> ${type} But can I achieve the same thing without scriptlets? Cheers, Don
