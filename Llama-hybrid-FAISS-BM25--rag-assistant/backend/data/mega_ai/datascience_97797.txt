How to introduce bias in a machine learning model?

How can I introduce bias for a decision tree model while building an ML application? e.g. If I am building a stock trading recommendation algorithim, I would want to recommend a stock only when the model detects a probability of swing (upturn and downturn) but, when I have a set of stocks that I have defined as volatile, I would like the model to recommend them only when the probability of swing is above a certain value. Can I define this as bias? How can I introduce this in a model? Can I: Introduce a categorical varable that defines a certain stock as volatile and then fit ? or Set a value to such a stock as categorical and then fit ? Apologies I am not able to explain my question better but essentially, I want to introduce bias in a model. What is the correct approach to doing it?
