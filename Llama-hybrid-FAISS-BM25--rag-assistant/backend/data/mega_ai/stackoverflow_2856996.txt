Git and Rails: ignore database.yml

I finally made a great step by abandoning SVN for Git and loving it. It must be somewhere, but I can't really find on how to do this, gitosis friendly. I have my repo 'site' stored on a remote machine. I push my working copy and pull this data on a production machine. One mayor difference though is 'one' file: database.yml, which will never change on the production machine. Is it possible (and if so, how), when the data is pulled from the repo, to "ignore" only this file? I am doing this manually at this point, but some elegance would be most appreciated. Thanks.
