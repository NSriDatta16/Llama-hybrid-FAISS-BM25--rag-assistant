In the case of the form, I'd look at what I can enter into it and test various boundary conditions there,e.g. what happens if no username is supplied? I'm reminded of there being a few different forms of testing: Black box testing - This is where you test without looking inside what is being tested. The challenge here is not being able to see inside can cause issues with limiting what are useful tests and how many different tests are worthwhile. This is of course what some default testing can look like though. White box testing - This is where you can look at the code and have metrics like code coverage to ensure that you are covering a percentage of the code base. This is generally better as in this case you know more about what is being done. There are also performance tests compared to logic tests that are also worth noting somewhere,e.g. how fast does the form validate me rather than just does the form do this.
