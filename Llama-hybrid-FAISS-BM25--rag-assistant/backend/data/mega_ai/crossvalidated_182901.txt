Gerd Gigerenzer is widely acknowledged as one of the world experts in the cognitive aspects of numeracy or, alternatively, innumeracy. He has many papers and books on these topics referenced on his website ( https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/staff/gerd-gigerenzer ). One of his key texts is his 2002 book Calculated risks: How to know when numbers deceive you . Read the abstract here: https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/adaptive-behavior-and-cognition/publications/books/calculated-risks Related to Gigerenzer's work is cognition-based decision theoretic work that looks at the way information is presented. A representative paper here is Dan Goldstein's The Illusion of Wealth and its Reversal available here ... http://rady.ucsd.edu/docs/seminars/goldstein.pdf Here's from the intro: Recently, researchers and policy makers have started to pay more attention not just to choice architecture but also to information architecture: the format in which information is presented to people. Research in information architecture has shown, for example, that the caloric content of food can be well appreciated in terms of the amount of exercise it would take to work calories off, and the comprehension of carsâ€™ energy efficiency can be enhanced by presenting information in terms of gallons per 100 miles instead of miles per gallon. This paper investigates information architecture, though instead of consuming calories or gasoline, we address economic consumption in retirement. An important recent addition to the literature is Berkeley Dietvorst's research into "algorithm aversion" and decision-making. Dietvorst contends that wrt predictive modeling, the technically naive and/or illiterate tend to assume that predictive models are a "magic bullet" or perfectly informative and when the algorithms prove to be, at best, weakly predictive, then the typical response is to reject quantitative solutions altogether. https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/mktg/assets/File/Dietvorst%20Simmons%20&%20Massey%202014.pdf Then there are bloggers like Kaiser Fung who maintains his Junkcharts website critiquing the graphs and visualizations of major pubs such as the NYTs or the WSJ http://junkcharts.typepad.com/ Related to your question of visualization is the work of design experts such as Manuel Lima who maintains a website VisualComplexity.com covering the many approaches to this. Lima also teaches data visualization at Parsons School of Design in NYC. http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/ Besides Parsons, other design and visualization institutions include: College of Design and Social Context https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/our-education/academic-colleges/college-of-design-and-social-context/ UCLA's Culture Analytics Institute http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/culture-analytics/ Google's Cultural Institute https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/home A MoMA design exhibition and book http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1071?locale=en http://www.amazon.com/Talk-Me-Communication-between-Objects/dp/0870707965 In terms of conferences there is the Eyeo Festival http://eyeofestival.com/ In R software, the visualization guru is Hadley Wickham http://had.co.nz/ In SAS software, there is Rob Allison http://www.robslink.com/SAS/graph_book.htm Finally, there are no shortage of "one-off" kinds of websites: http://infosthetics.com/ great visuals of govt data http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2012/09/in-praise-of-connected-scatter-plots.html http://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/ How to display data badly by Karl Broman https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/IowaState2013/graphs_combined.pdf https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/IowaState2013/index.html Maria Popova's Design and Communication blog https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/06/26/talk-to-me-moma-paola-antonelli-book/ Gallery of Data Visualization http://www.datavis.ca/gallery/index.php Periodic Table of Data Visualization http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html Our World in Data http://ourworldindata.org/ This just begins to scratch the surface of what's out there...
