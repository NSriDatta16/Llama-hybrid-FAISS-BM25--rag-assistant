Glassfish vhost to serve only static contents. Disable session how to?

I have a folder in the server, that contains all the images, static files, and more its the storage of my application, I need to serve this files on a http://host:8080/storage/ ** context. At this moment I mount a symlink on the root of the application on the application statup called "storage", I'm trying to setup a virtualhost in Glassfish Application Server v2.1 to serve only static content, but, a big problem appeared, how to disable the httpsession management? Each request to a JS,CSS or IMG file, the session was retrieved by the jsessionid. All this work will be vain. All sugestion about how the best way to serve the static content in the "storage" context and how to disable the session management in a specific host? Regards. Rigoni
