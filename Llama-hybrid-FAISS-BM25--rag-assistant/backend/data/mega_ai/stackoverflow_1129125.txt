ASP.NET MVC: OutputCache and http headers - Cache-Control

I have just started using OutputCache on some of my controller actions and I am not quite getting the response I would expect. Basically I have set Location = OutputCacheLocation.Any and the http header is as follows: Server ASP.NET Development Server/9.0.0.0 Date Wed, 15 Jul 2009 02:14:21 GMT X-AspNet-Version 2.0.50727 X-AspNetMvc-Version 1.0 Content-Encoding gzip Cache-Control private, max-age=3600 Expires Wed, 15 Jul 2009 02:14:21 GMT Last-Modified Wed, 15 Jul 2009 02:14:20 GMT Vary * Content-Type text/html; charset=utf-8 Content-Length 640 Connection Close Now if my interpretation is correct the Cache-Control part being set to private means that it will only be cached on the client. I need to also be cached on any proxy. I would have expected that by setting OutputCacheLocation.Any the Cache-Control would have been something like " public , max-age=3600". As far as I know the private means it will only be cached on the client and not by "Any" (i.e. proxies - see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpcacheability.aspx ). Any ideas?
