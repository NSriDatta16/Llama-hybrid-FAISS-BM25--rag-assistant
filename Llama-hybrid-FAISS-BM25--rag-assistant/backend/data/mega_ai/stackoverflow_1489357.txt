I would separate out each individual test into it's own procedure or, if it requires code beyond a function or two, it's own source file. Then in my main routine I'd do something like: void main() { run_test_1(); run_test_2(); //... run_test_N(); } Alternatively, I'd recommend leveraging the Boost Test Library and following their conventions.
