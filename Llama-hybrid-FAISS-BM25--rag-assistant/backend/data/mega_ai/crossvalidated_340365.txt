This is a difficult problem. Please review this article: Krishnamoorthy, K. and Thompson, J. 2002. "Hypothesis Testing about Proportions in Two Finite Populations". The American Statistician 56(3): 215-223 This is a difficult issue because the sampling distribution of estimated proportions is not known. For many years, it was approximated by a normal distribution, mostly because it was workable. Since 1990, it has been recognized that the usual CI method, m +/- 1.96 std.err(m) is tragically wrong for proportions and there is a lot of hand wringing about what to do. This article amazed me: Brown, Lawrence D, Cai, Tony T, and DasGupta, Anirban. 2001. Interval Estimation for a Binomial Proportion. Statistical Science 16(2):101-133 I'm not a specialist and, like you, I have just wanted to know "the answer", but, sadly, no definitive answer is forthcoming. There are more than 20 proposed methods of making confidence intervals and each one of those ideas can be re-wrapped to make a hypothesis test. From all of this, we are absolutely sure that the normal-based approximation is invalid and we have suggestions for methods that are demonstrably better. However, no method is demonstrably the best and thus we can't tell you precisely what to do.
