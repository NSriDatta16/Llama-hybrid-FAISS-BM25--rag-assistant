How does extreme random forest differ from random forest?

Is ER more efficient implementation (somelike Extreme Gradient Boosting is to gradient boosting)-- is the difference important from practical point of view ? There is R package which implements them. Is it new algorithm which overcomes "generic" implementation (RandomForest package from R) not only in terms of efficiency or also in some other areas?
