How to test an HTTP 301 redirect?

How can one easily test HTTP return codes, like, say, a 301 redirect? For example, if I want to "see what's going on", I can use telnet to do something like this: ... $ telnet nytimes.com 80 Trying 199.239.136.200... Connected to nytimes.com. Escape character is '^]'. GET / HTTP/1.0 (enter) (enter) HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1 Date: Mon, 14 Jun 2010 12:18:04 GMT Content-type: text/html Set-cookie: RMID=007af83f42dd4c161dfcce7d; expires=Tuesday, 14-Jun-2011 12:18:04 GMT; path=/; domain=.nytimes.com Set-cookie: adxcs=-; path=/; domain=.nytimes.com Set-cookie: adxcs=-; path=/; domain=.nytimes.com Set-cookie: adxcs=-; path=/; domain=.nytimes.com Expires: Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT Cache-control: no-cache Pragma: no-cache Connection: close ... Which is an easy way to access quite some infos. But now I want to test that a 301 redirect is indeed a 301 redirect. How can I do so? Basically, instead of getting a HTTP/1.1 200 OK I'd like to know how I can get the 301? I know that I can enter the name of the URL in a browser and "see" that I'm redirected, but I'd like to know what tool(s) can be used to actually really "see" the 301 redirect. Btw, I did test with a telnet, but when I enter www.example.org, which I redirected to example.org (without the www), all I can see is an "200 OK", I don't get to see the 301.
