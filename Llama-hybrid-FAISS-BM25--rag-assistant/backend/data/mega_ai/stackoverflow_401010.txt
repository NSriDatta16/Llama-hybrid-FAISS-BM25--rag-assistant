I'm not a big fan of nested projects, since it buries projects deep inside a structure and if you need to reuse that project in another application then what do you do, copy/paste the code? I like to follow somewhat of a flat structure but organized by namespace. This is how I do it: - DataHelpers\ ---Factory\ ---DataAccess\ ---... - Components\ --- EmailProcessor\ --- ErrorLogger\ - Desktop\ --- WindowsApp1\ - Services\ --- WindowsService1\ --- WindowsService2\ - WebApps\ --- WebApp1\ --- WebApp2\ Now, inside each major application I have, for example: - WindowsService1\ --- WindowsService1\ (this contains all *.cs, bin, obj, etc and .csproj file) --- Solution\ (this contains the .sln file where you link to other projects like ErrorLogger, etc) I hope that makes sense!
