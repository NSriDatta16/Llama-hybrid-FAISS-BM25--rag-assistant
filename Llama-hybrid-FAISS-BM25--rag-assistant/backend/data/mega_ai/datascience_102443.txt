It might depend on what you will then use the scores for. For instance, should one long sentence score higher than two shorter sentences even if all three sentences have the same density of technical words? If so, adding rather than averaging the scores? Or adding, then doing an adjustment for sentence length. The other way to get the more technical words to have more weight, when you take the mean, is to raise their score to a power. The power becomes a hyperparameter you can tune for, but simply squaring scores would be enough to test the idea. I'll also mention https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf , in case you were not aware of it; the see also section might also bring up some ideas.
