I wouldnt cluster or classify the data at all. Since youve got ratio scaled data (isotopes) my method of choice would be PCA (Principal Component Analysis). By colouring your points in the PCA diagram according to your "eco-type" you could see their dispersal within the isotope ratio variation. Further, you will see the influence of each parameter (isotope ratios) in the biplot - the result will contain much more information than a classification.
