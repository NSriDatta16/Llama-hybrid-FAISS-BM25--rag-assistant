Sorry, but to be clear here: when you say "redraw" do you really mean redraw the currently existing content (as in "do dynamic changes to the table but don't delete it") or do you mean replacing the existing content with some new content, as is the normal Ajax technique? If you are replacing existing components with new components you should be OK as long as you provide some kind of fading/animation effect that draws the user's attention from the fact the control is being replaced. Sometimes doing some kind of "screen buffering" (loading all the new components in a hidden div , then replacing an existing div with the new one) will help if you are updating a lot of the interface.
