SAX: How to get the content of an element

I have some trouble understanding parsing XML structures with SAX. Let's say there is the following XML: Value1 Value2 and a String variable myString . Just going through with the methods startElement, endElement() and characters() is easy. But I don't understand how I can achieve the following: If the current element equals element1 store its value value1 in myString . As far as I understand there is nothing like: if (qName.equals("element1")) myString = qName.getValue(); Guess I'm just thinking too complicated :-) Robert
