CMM and CMMI both offer some benefits if your organization takes the lessions it tries to teach at heart. The problem is that getting to the higher levels is very difficult and expensive, and the only time I have seen an organization go through the effort is because their customers won't let them bid on contracts until they are at a certain level. This has the effect of the organization doing everything they can to "just get the number" without actually caring about it improving their process.
