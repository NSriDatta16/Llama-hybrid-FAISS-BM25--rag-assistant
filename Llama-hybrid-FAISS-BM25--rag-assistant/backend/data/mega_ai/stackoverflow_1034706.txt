You would probably be best served by loading the page's content (sans grid), then making a remote call to kick off the lengthy retrieval process. Here is an article that can help you with the deferred loading bit. To enable the progress bar on a global (page) level, you can do something like this: $(document).ready(function() { $.ajaxStart(function() { $(".progressBar").show();}); $.ajaxStop(function() { $(".progressBar").hide();}); }); EDIT: forgot to mention that my example as well as Dave Ward's post are done using jQuery!
