You should definitely open and close the connection each time. Indeed, if your using block has much code after the last use of the connection, call Close() to get it back in the pool as soon as possible. That way the chance of another use not needing to open a completely new connection is reduced (see What does "opening a connection" actually mean? for a bit more on when a real connection is opened and when one is taken from the pool). Is this "once a second" an average across different threads, or all on the one thread? If it's all on the one thread it doesn't matter, indeed it might even be slightly faster to keep the connection object open, because either way there won't be contention for it. I would certainly consider caching results, though this has downsides in memory use, along with potentially complicated issues about when the cached results need to be refreshed - really this could be anywhere from trivial to impossible depending on just what you are doing. It's also clearly a query to go that extra mile when optimising.
