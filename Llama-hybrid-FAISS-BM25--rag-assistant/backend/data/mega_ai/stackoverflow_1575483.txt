Antlr @header declaration for C++ generation

In ANTLR version 2.X you could specify something was to go before or after the ANTLR includes via the code below. header "pre_include_hpp" { #pragma warning( push ) #pragma warning( disable : 4511 ) // couldn't generate copy constructor } header "post_include_hpp" { #pragma warning( pop ) } With ANTLR v3.X it looks like this has been replaced by one @header block. Is there a way to do what we previously did with ANTLR v2?
