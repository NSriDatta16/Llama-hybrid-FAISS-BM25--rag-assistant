What is the best method to find the sentences that answer a given question in a document?

Let's say I have a long document (let's say 10 pages) and I have a question about the content of the document. An example could be: Document: History of Flowers Question: What type of flowers have been considered edible in the past? My objective is to find in this document the information that answers this question. My primary objective is not to have a sentence as an answer but to find the parts of the text that contain this information. Up to now I've tried using semantic search but: I'm not sure on what is the correct way to split the document (should they be phrases? paragraphs?) questions are usually written in quite a different way from the information that answer them (in fact, that information is not know to those making the question) As an alternative I was thinking that I could: run a QA model to find the answer take the answer and use it to build for the search In this case, the problem are: the QA model can only read part of the document ( how to tackle that? I was thinking of running it on chunks and then take only the "highest scoring" answer. It gets longer and more cumbersome So, my question(s) are: does this approach in you opinion make any sense? what are possible alternatives?
