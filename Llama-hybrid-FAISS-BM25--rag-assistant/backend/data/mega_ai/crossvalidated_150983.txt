Guessing the word from context

Can I train a system to decide, which one of suggested words is more likely to appear in the sentence being analyzed? For example, if I have sentence "I was playing with my ______ when I heard the bell ring" and list of words "dog", "lock", "smoke", "coke", can I train the system to arrange these words in the order of likelihood? What machine learning algorithms should I consider?
