R times series â€” correct use of forecast() and accuracy() in forecast package

Cross-posting this from Stack Overflow, because it's a bit of a stats/ technology cross-over. I'm relatively new to R and the forecast package I believe authored by Rob Hyndman. I'm having trouble understanding how the objects (time series, model, forecast) exactly relate to each other, but more importantly, the proper arguments for the forecast() function. Say I have a time-series object called Sales.ts Now, I wanted to verify that I understood the forecast() function -- which can accept both raw time series, or models based on time series, or both, as inputs. First, I did Sales.ets Now I do forecast(Sales.ets,h=12) to predict the next 12 values in the future, based on the ets model. I can also do forecast(Sales.ts,model=Sales.ets,h=12). I wanted to check that if it forecasted the Sales.ts time series using the same ets model, it should produce the same results as the first method. MAINLY, because I want to validate partitions of the data using the Sales.ets model. HOWEVER, here's the problem: forecast(Sales.ets, h=12) and forecast(Sales.ts, model=Sales.ets,h=12) produce slightly, but signficantly enough, different forecasts. My question is --- why? Why does it do this? My follow up question would be how to validate the Sales.ets model. I was going to try to validate it by doing (Sales.ts(1:k),model=Sales.ets,h=1) to check the accuracy of 1-step forecasts at each point in history in the past. Any help appreciated - thanks!
