How to estimate the largest eigenvalue of a correlation matrix from one observation of underlying data matrix?

Suppose that I have $N$ time series $x_{1t},x_{2t},\dots,x_{Nt},$ , that are correlated with each other. A $N\times N$ correlation matrix is $R=\rho_{ij}$ . It can be represented with eigen value dcomposition: $$R=\sum_{j=1}^N\lambda_j\xi_j\xi_j'$$ Assuming the eigenvalues are sorted in descending order $\lambda_1$ is the largest eigenvalue. It represents the overall correlation of series. My question : How to estimate $\lambda_1$ when you have only one observation at time $t$ of each series $x_{it}$ ? We have only $N$ values $x_{it}$ where $i\in[1,N]$ . If it helps, I suspect that the series might have $K$ common factors, so that $x_{it}=\sum_{j=1}^KB_{ij}f_{jt}+\varepsilon_i,$ where the noise is independent, i.e. $corr[\varepsilon_i,\varepsilon_j]=\delta_{ij}$ and $corr[\varepsilon_i,f_j]=0$ . Me thinks that maybe when $K=1$ , we can somehow estimate $\hat\lambda_1$ . However, I'd like a more general solution if possible. Idea Eigen value $\lambda_1$ represents overall correlation. Let's write a covariance of a sum of series: $$cov(\sum_i x_i)=\sum_{ij}\sigma_i\sigma_j\rho_{ij}=\sum_i\sigma^2+\sum_{i\ne j}\sigma_i\sigma_j\rho_{ij}$$ Assuming $\rho_{ij}=\rho$ we get the following metric: $$r=\frac{(\sum_ix_i)^2-\sum_ix_i^2}{\sum_{i\ne j}x_ix_j}$$ Suppose that one day I have two series observations (1,3), then another day they are (5,-1). Here's how we calculate the metrics: $$r_1=\frac{4^2-(1^2+3^2)}{2\times1\times 3}=\frac{6}{6}=1$$ $$r_2=\frac{4^2-(5^2+1^2)}{2\times5\times (-1)}=\frac{-10}{-10}=-1$$ In the first day both series moved in the same direction, and although the moves were smaller than in the second day, they still produced the same average move 2 because they were more correlated. Hence, this metric seems to be related to $\lambda_1$ . The idea's inspired by Eqs.6 and 7 in Bouchaud's paper .
