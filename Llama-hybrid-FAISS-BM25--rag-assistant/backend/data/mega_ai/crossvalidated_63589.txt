How to project high dimensional space into a two-dimensional plane?

I have a set of data points in a N-dimensional space. In addition, I also have a centroid in this same N-dimensional space. Are there any approaches that can allow me to project these data points into a two-dimensional space while keeping their relative distance information in the original space. Is PCA the correct one?
