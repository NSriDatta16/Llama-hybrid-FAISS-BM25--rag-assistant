How can I deserialize this json data with JSON.Net?

I'm not sure how to define the data property to deserialize the following json data... { "response": { "total_rows": 39, "data": [ [ "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXBs2VI", "a7ac4aa7-7211-4116-be57-0c36fc2abeee", "AAAAAA", "Crn Burnley & Victoria St", "Richmond", "VIC", "3121", "555-555-555", null, "Real Estate & Home Improvement > Storage", null, null, -37.8114511488511, 145.009782837163 ], [ .. ] [ .. ] .... }, status = "ok" } so I had .. public class ResultData { public Response Response { get; set; } public string Status { get; set; } } and.... public class Response { public int total_rows { get; set; } public IList data { get; set; } } but that was throwing an exception, saying "Can't cast float to string" . SO it was trying to add those last two floats, into the List<> .. but failed. How can I fix this, please? (I can't control the json output). Cheers :) Update It looks like the content of the data json property is a fixed size array with fixed object types. So is there a way i could define that, in my .NET code so JSON.NET knows how to exactly deserialize it? Do I need to make a custom json deserializer for that json property?
