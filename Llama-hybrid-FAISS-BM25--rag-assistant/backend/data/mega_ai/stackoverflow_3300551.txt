If you dont mind more of an X-copy scenario if you get your applications root folder and right-click drag it to another folder you will get the option - SVN Export all items here, or you can use SVN Export versioned items only, which will ignore all unversioned files. This will do a clean export to the new folder with all .svn files removed!
