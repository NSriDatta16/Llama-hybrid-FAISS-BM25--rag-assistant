How do I identify which factor levels do not significantly differ during within group comparisons using emmeans()?

I am currently trying to look at how the likelihood of reaching a particular insect life-stage (in this example 1st instar) is influenced by both temperature (factor: 5 levels - 20, 23, 26, 29, 32 degrees Celsius) and species (factor: 2 levels - HA and AP) using a logistic regression model as below: eggmodelA A likelihood ratio test revealed the interaction to be significant: Analysis of Deviance Table Model 1: cbind(No.hatched, No.eggs.added - No.hatched) ~ Temperature * Species Model 2: cbind(No.hatched, No.eggs.added - No.hatched) ~ Temperature + Species Resid. Df Resid. Dev Df Deviance Pr(>Chi) 1 0 0.000 2 4 40.007 -4 -40.007 4.315e-08 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 This has led me to use the emmeans() function in the package emmeans in order to complete both within species comparisons of temperature and within temperature comparisons of species. Below is the example for within species comparisons which gives the following output: Within.species I have also used the following code to plot the results of this model: emmip(eggmodelA, Species ~ Temperature, type = "response", xlab = "Temperature", ylab = "Predicted probability of reaching 1st instar from egg (± 95% confidence intervals)", CI = TRUE) Would anyone be able to help me with the following questions: How do I add letters to the emmeans$contrasts section to signify, within species, which temperatures did not differ significantly in regards to the likelihood of an individual reaching the 1st instar? Is there any way I can add the letters from pairwise comparisons within factors to the plot of my model in R or do I have to do this separately outside of R? If possible I would also like to add some form of indicator on the graph for each temperature detailing if the two species differ significantly or not. Any help anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated.
