Input sequence ordering for LSTM network

When training a LSTM network with time series data, I guess the order in which this data is fed matters, my question is how should this ordering be... Let's take a time-series vector which will be the input for the LSTM: \[ X = [x_0, x_{\small(-1\small)}, x_{\small(-2\small)},\ldots, x_{\small(-N\small)}]\] with negative indexing indicating past values. Which vector should be fed (theoretical case, not related to any API)?: \[ X = [x_0, x_{\small(-1\small)}, x_{\small(-2\small)},\ldots, x_{\small(-N\small)}]\] or \[ X^r = [x_{\small(-N\small)},\ldots, x_{\small(-2\small)}, x_{\small(-1\small)}, x_0]\] More precisely, what of these two orderings should be used in TensorFlow LSTM-Cells?
