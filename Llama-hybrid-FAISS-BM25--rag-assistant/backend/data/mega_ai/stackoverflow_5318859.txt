You could use an obscure XL4 function, GET.WORKBOOK to return a list of the sheets in the active workbook instead as follows: Define a range name called "WorksheetNameList" using the formula: =GET.WORKBOOK(1) Then, in your Sheet1 use the formula in cell A1 : =MID(INDEX(WorksheetNameList,ROW(A1)),FIND("]",INDEX(WorksheetNameList,ROW(A1)))+1,32) and then drag the formula down the rows until you hit row 30 (or you obtain a #REF! ). I would not normally recommend using XL4 functions since they could disappear at any time with new Excel releases, but they are used here based on the restriction of your question. If you'd like more information on what else GET.WORKBOOK can return, please have a look at the help file which is located at http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c09bf7f7-d30e-4ce9-8930-5d03748ca5cd
