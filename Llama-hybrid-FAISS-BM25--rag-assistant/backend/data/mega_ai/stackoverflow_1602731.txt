valarray was supposed to let some FORTRAN vector-processing goodness rub off on C++. Somehow the necessary compiler support never really happened. The Josuttis books contains some interesting (somewhat disparaging) commentary on valarray ( here and here ). However, Intel now seem to be revisiting valarray in their recent compiler releases (e.g see slide 9 ); this is an interesting development given that their 4-way SIMD SSE instruction set is about to be joined by 8-way AVX and 16-way Larrabee instructions and in the interests of portability it'll likely be much better to code with an abstraction like valarray than (say) intrinsics.
