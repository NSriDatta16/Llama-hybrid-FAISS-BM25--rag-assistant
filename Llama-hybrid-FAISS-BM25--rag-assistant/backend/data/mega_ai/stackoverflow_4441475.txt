Using RBF network for this seems like a weird solution. But if you have your heart set on it: (it is entirely possible that I totally misunderstood the problem you want to solve). You might want to put it in terms of classification and train 32 binary classifiers that determine if the "1000" is at each of the 32 entries. Or more in "neural network" terms have 32*4 entries and 32 ouputs. One efficent way to train an RBF network is to use an SVM with an RBF kernel. One good implementation of this is LIBSVM .
