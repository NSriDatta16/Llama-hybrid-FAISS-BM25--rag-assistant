How to add tracing/debug output to stored procedures in Sql Server (2008)

What is the closest to being able to add log4net style debug information to a set of stored procedures? Some of procedures delegate work to other procedures and I want trace information from both. I've sprinkled print and select statements through while developing them, and ideally would like to be able to run the proc in different modes depending on whether it's normal operation of troubleshooting and get more or less output. In this particular case the primary stored proc will be run repeatedly from an agent job, but may be run from management studio when troubleshooting. The procs already use an error log table and email facilities to catch raised errors. The kind of thing I'm looking to be able to track down is where an input data issue means the output data is wrong but the procs don't fail completely, and it would be useful to see exactly what was done at each step. What approaches do you know of for producing meaningful and ideally filterable output? One per answer so we can see the final rankings ;-) Out of the box answers welcome, such as "don't - step through with management studio when you need to"
