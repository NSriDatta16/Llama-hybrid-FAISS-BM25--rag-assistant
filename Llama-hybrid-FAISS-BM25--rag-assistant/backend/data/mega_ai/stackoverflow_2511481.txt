Have a look at the Web Presentation Patterns of PoEAA : Model View Controller - Splits user interface interaction into three distinct roles. Page Controller - An object that handles a request for a specific page or action on a Web site. Front Controller - A controller that handles all requests for a Web site. Template View - Renders information into HTML by embedding markers in an HTML page. Transform View - A view that processes domain data element by element and transforms it into HTML. Two-Step View -Turns domain data into HTML in two steps: first by forming some kind of logical page, then rendering the logical page into HTML. Application Controller - A centralized point for handling screen navigation and the flow of an application.
