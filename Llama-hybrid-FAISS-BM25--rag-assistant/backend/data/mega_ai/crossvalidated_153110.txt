A department that belongs to a larger organization is not a sample. Samples must be random, so that results extracted from the sample can be extrapolated to the population. This sample (all the individuals in a department) is not random, so it can only produce biased inference. Statistics derived from different departments are not entirely comparable because the department is a factor in the dynamics of the behaviour of individuals within the department. Smaller groups will have larger variance. This is an artifact of statistics. There is more uncertainty, and this suggests error in the process, but is generally referred to as greater variability. It is not called error. You can adjust the variance of different size groups to compare them, or test if their variance is significantly larger or smaller (as long as one group is not too small). So the the difference in variability is generally not a big deal.
