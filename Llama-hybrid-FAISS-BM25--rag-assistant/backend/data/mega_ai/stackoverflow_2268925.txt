Looking for a typecasting capability in mysql

I'm writing a query that returns whether a record is public or private. If the record is public, the user_id column for that record is zero. Otherwise, it is a positive integer. I'd like the query to return a one if the user_id is greater than zero and a zero if it is zero. In PHP, I would probably just cast it to a binary. This doesn't work in mysql, but I'm hoping that there is something else that is similar. I could always use an if statement, but figured there might be something a little more elegant. SELECT (binary)user_id as is_private FROM mytable WHERE 1
