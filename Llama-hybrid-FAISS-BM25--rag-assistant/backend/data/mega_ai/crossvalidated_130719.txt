Which statistical methods could I use to determine if a price is good, based on a history of prices?

I have the following scenario: A history of prices of a specific product; The current price of the same product. The history of prices should contain prices with a certain amount of discount, very low prices (black friday prices) and "normal" retail prices. Based on the history of prices, I want to determine if the current price is good for buying the product. The current price might not be the lowest price of the history, but still be a good price. I have a very simple algorithm to do it: I have a minimum ammount of discount per product, say 15% Based on the history, I have an average price ( sum(prices) / sum(quantity) ) If the current price is 15% (or the configured minimum discount) lower than the average price, it is a good price for buying. This is very simple, but it does not always work. The history of prices could contain older products with several months of data, or newer products with a few weeks of price data. It is acceptable that the final algorithm will work better for older products with more data. Which statistical methods could I apply that would make the algorithm more precise?
