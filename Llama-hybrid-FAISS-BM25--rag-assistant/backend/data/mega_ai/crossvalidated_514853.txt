How to calculate a similarity score between two users rating films

This is probably a standard problem for a seasoned data scientist or statistician, but I'm stuck right at the beginning: Suppose I have two users (A and B) on a site like IMDB, where they can rate a movie from 1 to 10 (10 being best). Now I want to see for two users how "similar" or "compatible" they are. To do that I want to calculate a score that takes into account how A and B have rated films - looking only at films that BOTH have rated. If both users have rated all films exactly the same, the score should be highest. If they have rated all films as differently as possible, that score should be lowest. One way to approach this would be to calculated the average of all (absolute) differences. So that when A has rated film 1 an 8 and film 2 a 3 and B has rated film 1 an 5 and film 2 a 4 the average of all differences would be (|8-5|+|3-4|)/2 = 2. This seems to be awefully simple so I assume there must be a better way to calculate such a similarity score. After researching a bit I tried using "cosine distance", but I find that this gives worse results, where diametrically different ratings end up having a high score. Any pointers are greatly appreciated.
