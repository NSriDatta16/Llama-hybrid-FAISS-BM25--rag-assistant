EJB3 is a vast improvement over previous versions. It's still technically the standard server-side implementation toolset for JavaEE and since it now has none of the previous baggage (thanks to annotations and Java Persistence), is quite usable and being deployed as we speak. As one commenter noted, JBoss SEAM is based upon it. EJB 3 is a viable alternative to Spring, and the two technologies may become more tightly related. this article details that Spring 3.0 will be compatible with EJB Lite (which I'm not sure what that is, exactly) and possibly be part of Java EE 6. EJB is not going anywhere.
