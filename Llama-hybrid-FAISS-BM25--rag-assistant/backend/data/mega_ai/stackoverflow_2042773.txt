Make an SQL request more efficient and tidy?

I have the following SQL query: SELECT Phrases.* FROM Phrases WHERE (((Phrases.phrase) Like "*ing aids*") AND ((Phrases.phrase) Not Like "*getting*") AND ((Phrases.phrase) Not Like "*contracting*")) AND ((Phrases.phrase) Not Like "*preventing*"); //(etc.) Now, if I were using RegEx, I might bunch all the Nots into one big (getting|contracting|preventing), but I'm not sure how to do this in SQL. Is there a way to render this query more legibly/elegantly?
