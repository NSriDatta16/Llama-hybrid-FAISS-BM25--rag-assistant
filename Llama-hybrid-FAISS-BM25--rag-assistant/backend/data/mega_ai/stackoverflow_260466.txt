I don't think Mac OS X keeps a global database of all bundle IDs everywhere. As noted, you can find an application in a pretty straightforward way with NSWorkspace. Also, since you used a kext for your example, on Leopard (10.5) there's a tool called "kextfind" that you can run to search for kexts in the system Exensions folder (kexts in other places won't be found unless you point the tool at those other places). kextfind has lots of options--see the man page for details--but to find a kext by bundle ID you can do this: kextfind -bundle-id com.apple.iokit.IOStorageFamily We don't currently have a C-level API for looking up kexts by bundle ID. As for hacking the path from the last component of the bundle ID: don't do that. There's nothing requiring the wrapper name to match the last component of the bundle ID, and I have seen kexts (to say nothing of other bundles), where the two do not match.
