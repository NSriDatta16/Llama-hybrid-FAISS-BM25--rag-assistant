How do you configure WorkManagers in WebLogic 10.3?

I would like to use a WorkManager to schedule some parallel jobs on a WebLogic 10.3 app server. http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/resource/spi/work/WorkManager.html I'm finding the Oracle/BEA documentation a bit fragmented and hard to follow and it does not have good examples for using WorkManagers from EJB 3.0. Specifically, I'd like to know: 1) What exactly, if anything, do I need to put in my deployment descriptors (ejb-jar.xml and friends)? 2) I'd like to use the @Resource annotation to inject the WorkManager into my EJB 3 session bean. What "name" do I use for the resource? 3) How do I configure the number of threads and other parameters for the WorkManager. My understanding is that the underlying implementation on WebLogic is CommonJ, but I'd prefer to use a non-proprietary approach if possible.
