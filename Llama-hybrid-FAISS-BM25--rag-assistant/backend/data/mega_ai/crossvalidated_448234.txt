Confidence Interval for Difference in Proportions - Mistake in Question?

Question #3 of University of Michigan's Data Science Statistics Sample Questions: Applying the formula is straightforward, but it seems that the note at the end of the question is wrong. p1 seems close enough (261/501~=.52), but p2 should be 123/252=.48, not .35, which can only come from 129/(240+129) as far as I can tell. P-hat also seems wrong - if it's supposed to refer to p1-p2, then it should be (261/501)-123/252=.0328, not .0338. Can someone confirm whether they agree that the note at the end of the question is incorrect, or at least misleading? https://www.si.umich.edu/sites/default/files/Sample%20of%20UMSI%20MADS%20Python%20and%20Statistics%20Assessments.pdf
