Drag and drop hasn't progressed since I started programming Windows UIs back in the day using Visual Basic 3. It would nice to have a xaml-friendly and mvvm-friendly drag and drop framework. Something similar to ICommand where the View could call into a binding on the ViewModel to handle drag and drop.
