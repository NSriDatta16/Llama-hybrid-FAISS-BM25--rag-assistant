Fastest Multimodal sampler

I am currently working with Multinest, a bayesian multimodal sampler however it becomes slow for higher dimensions, exponentially slow. Is there another sampler out there that can give me parameter values from chi squared minimization of a multimodal distribution? I will really appreciate your help!
