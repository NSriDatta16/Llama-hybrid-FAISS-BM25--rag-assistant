how to hide a uitoolbar on click

I have a uitoolbar with a button that when clicked captures a image of a uiwebview to the photos storage. Is it possible to have the button hide onclick and then reappear after the capture code has finished.I created the button with interface builder.Don't want the toolbar showing in the captured image.Thanks in advance for any help offered.
