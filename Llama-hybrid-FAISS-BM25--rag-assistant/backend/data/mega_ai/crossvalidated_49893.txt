k-means needs to be able to compute means . How do you compute means for categorial data? Similarly, how do you intend to do PCA here? You also need to center the data set for this. Depending on your data set size, hierarchical clustering with e.g. Gower's distance may work very well. For numerical attributes, I'd try z standardization. For larger data sets, you could still try e.g. DBSCAN and OPTICS - if you have solved the challenge of measuring similarity (which you also need for hierarchical clustering!). That is actually the first step for you to figure out: can you quantify how similar (or dissimilar) two instances are?
