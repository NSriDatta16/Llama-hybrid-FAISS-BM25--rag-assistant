You need to stop for a moment and think about what the LinkButton is actually doing. It's not magic. It's just posting the form for you. As such, you can... define an onsubmit handler to stuff that javascript value into a hidden form field or, replace that LinkButton with a simple pointing at a function that stuffs your value into a hidden form field and submits the form or, replace that LinkButton with a simple pointing at a function that constructs a URL containing ?myvalue=whatever and redirects to it. There's no reason you need to involve ASP:LinkButton in any of it. If the built-in ASP.NET controls aren't doing what you want. All you need to do is stop using them. (Incidentally, you'll have a much happier and more productive career in the .NET world if you stop using Microsoft's Rich Controls in favor of their HTML equivalents. Those things are there so that non-programmers can drag/drop their way to unmaintainable websites. Since you're here, we can assume you're not a non-programmer, and are therefore smart enough to ignore the marketing portions of ASP.NET and use the good stuff directly.)
