Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman variance correction in meta-analysis

I am doing a meta-analysis of continuous data (SMD), number of studies (k) around 75, heterogeneity high (Tau-squared around 0.15, I-sqr over 75%). Our interest is in fact in a key subgroup analysis (k 50 and 14 for each subgroup). Average sample size is around 120 (intervention and control group combined), but there are quite a few small studies. I am using the REML meta-analysis model, is there any scope for also using Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman variance correction? Could you point me to some references that discuss this? Thank you!
