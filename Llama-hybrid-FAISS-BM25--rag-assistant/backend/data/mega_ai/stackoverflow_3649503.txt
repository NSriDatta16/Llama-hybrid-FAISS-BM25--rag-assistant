Debugging C# assembly launched by embedded mono runtime?

I am talking about a small game engine using C# for game programming. So, I have a C++ app embedding mono runtime (I call it 'launcher'). And I have an assembly written in C# which is my game engine class library. The launcher launches the assembly as it is suggested in Embedding Mono . And now the interesting part! The launcher implements in C++ miscelaneous functions which are exposed to the mono runtime as internal methods of my game engine classes. That is why my game engine assembly is nothing without the launcher which implements a huge part of the engine in C++. The question: How am I supposed to debug my C# assembly? And what is more important, how am I supposed to debug a Game which I am going to write in C# ??? As you understand I cannot debug the assembly using MonoDevelop Debugger because it won't receive internal C++ implementations of some of its methods. What I need is to run the Launcher. The launcher then will launch C# assembly using embedded mono runtime. And then I need something to connect to the launched assembly to allow its debugging. Or any other way. Thank you!
