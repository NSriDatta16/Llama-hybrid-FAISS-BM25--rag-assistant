What is a sigmoid function and what does it give as output?

I know the equation of the sigmoid function and use it in logistic regression, SVM, etc. $$ S(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} $$ In the case of the sigmoid function, What is the exact input and output of this function? What I know is, it takes the value of x which is written in the above equation. The value of x is the prediction and gives output in a probability value. The probability of a point belongs to a specific class. Could anyone give me a better explanation of sigmoid function?
