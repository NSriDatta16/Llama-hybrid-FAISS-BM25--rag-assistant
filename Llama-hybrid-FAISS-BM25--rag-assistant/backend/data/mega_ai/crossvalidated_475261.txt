Why is the Wavelet Transform not affected by non-stationarity of time series?

Here we read: Wavelet analysis overcomes the problems of non-stationarity in time series by performing a local time-scale decomposition of the signal, i.e., the estimation of its spectral characteristics as a function of time Why is the Wavelet Transform not affected by non-stationarity of time series?
