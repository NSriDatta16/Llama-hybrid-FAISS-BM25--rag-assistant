Combining class priors with discriminative methods

Say we want to build a classifier for a binary classification problem using a discriminative method (e.g. SVM) and be able to impose a prior on the classes. For example, let's assume that we want to use the prior $\text{Beta}(10,50)$ on the positive class. How can I estimate the posterior probability of classification resulting from combining the output of my discriminative predictor with the above class prior?
