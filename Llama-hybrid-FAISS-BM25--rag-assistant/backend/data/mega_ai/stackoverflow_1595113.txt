Since this is for a homework assignment, I'd check with the instructor or person grading your work. A good instructor should be able to make sense of a C++ program as well as a C program if it's not written in a crazy manner (but how can students know what is crazy?) If your instructor doesn't care what language you use, use the language you are most familiar with if you want to get the work done faster. If you want a challenge, use the language you are less familiar with. School is a good time to make mistakes, but at the end of the term your grades are important. Finally, don't get too caught up trying to wrap the native API or re-invent it if the assignment's purpose is to learn the API. If you can come up with an elegant wrapper that demonstrates you understand the API, fine, but otherwise your instructor might be annoyed that your program works against the API instead of with it.
