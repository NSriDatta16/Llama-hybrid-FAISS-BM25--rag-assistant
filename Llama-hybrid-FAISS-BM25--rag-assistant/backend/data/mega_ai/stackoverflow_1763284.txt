I've made extensive use of the DevExpress ASPxGridView and many of their other controls. As mentioned earlier, the DevExpress controls can create a lot of markup, however, they other a ton of functionality and features. They're pretty easy to use. If all you're needing is a really simple grid control, then it's probably overkill. However, if you want to have features like sorting/grouping, drag-drop re-ordering of columns, hiding and adding columns at run-time, AJAX support, etc. then these controls are awesome. Recent versions (2009.2 and 2009.3) have introduced a number of performance improvements mainly around reducing the volume of traffic and cycle time involved in round-trips to the server. This has made the controls feel even snappier at the end-user side. One other key benefit of the DevExpress controls is the support. These guys are excellent at getting back to you with meaningful answers to questions in a timely manner. I also enjoy the fact that they have several releases per year which include enhancements and new functionality. You can see their release history by looking at their release history for the ASPxGridView: http://devexpress.com/Products/NET/Controls/ASP/Grid/whatsnew.xml All in all, I think it's a good value for the money. By the way, I have no affiliation with DevExpress, I'm just a happy customer.
