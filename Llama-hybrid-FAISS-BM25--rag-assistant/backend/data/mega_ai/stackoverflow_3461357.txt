After fiddling for quite a while I came up with this hackish solution that works. I would love to hear a more elegant solution. 1) Create a cookie after forms authentication: // log the user in FormsService.SignIn(userId, false); Response.Cookies["WasLoggedIn"].Value = "true"; 2) On the login GET action, look for this cookie existing and the authentication cookie not existing: if (Request.Cookies[".ASPXAUTH"] == null && Request.Cookies["WasLoggedIn"] != null) { // forms authentication timed out }
