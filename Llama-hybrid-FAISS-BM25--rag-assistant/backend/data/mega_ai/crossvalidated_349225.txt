Regression using a percentage as an outcome?

I am thinking about making a regression on these data . As a dependent variable, I want to use percent of people in a county voting for Clinton in 1992. Is this appropriate? I do not know if I should use linear or logistic regression. Can I even use logistic regression if my dependent variable is not categorical?
