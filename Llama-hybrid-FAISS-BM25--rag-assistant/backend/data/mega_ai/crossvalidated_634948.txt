Glad you liked the chapter! To answer your questions: Correct. In a linear model, fixed effects regression is just OLS performed after subtracting out the individual-level means of each variable (the "de-meaning" approach). I wouldn't call this "normalization," which implies both subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. You're only subtracting the mean. If you have a categorical variable, you would turn it into a set of binary indicators (as you might normally do in linear regression) and subtract out the means of those. So in your table in question 3, Was Employed would be (-.5, .5, 0 ,0) . Same as above. Variables that are constant over time within individual provide no useful information if included directly; they are collinear with the fixed effect themselves, and there is no variation in them after accounting for fixed effects (and thus nothing to study). That said, there's not really a need to control for these variables anyway, as the fixed effect itself accounts for it. Assuming no individuals change gender over time, a fixed effect for individual accounts for any effect of gender. Random-effects models can incorporate information about these variables into the individual-level effect and improve precision, but fixed effects does not. Sometimes in fixed effects models you will see fixed-over-time covariates included as part of interaction terms with variables that do change over time - that's fine. Unfortunately, while the logic of fixed effects extends to all sorts of models, the methods for estimation do not, and you can't just assume that your approach to estimating fixed effects with OLS extends to other models. For nonlinear models like logit I can tell you they don't outside of a few very simple cases, and you need specialized estimators. See the nonlinear models section of the fixed effects chapter. As for those machine learning models I'm not sure! But you can't just assume it will work. In some cases it's obvious it won't - for regularized regression or random forest, for example, you'd clearly get a different result whether you de-mean the data (which forces all data to be just the within variation) vs. including the fixed effects as penalizable/selectable parameters (for which some individuals will see their individual effect dropped or reduced). Which one of those is the "right" way, if either? I don't know. Might depend on whether you're including the FEs to improve prediction vs. identify a causal effect. I'd recommend looking up literature on applying within-variation methods for those estimators in particular. Having Robert in the model can improve the predictive power of the model and the estimation of covariate coefficients and thus help with precision, but he will not contribute to the effect-size estimate. See Question 3 in this section of the chapter. The treatment effect average that fixed effects gives you puts a weight on each individual's effect size that's based on their residual variance of the effect. If they have no effect variance after you limit things to within variation they'll get a weight of 0.
