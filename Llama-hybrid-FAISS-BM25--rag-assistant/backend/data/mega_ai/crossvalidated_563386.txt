For the unfiltered data (where missing observations are still marked) I calculated a rolling average of whether an observation is missing or not. I used the rollmean() function in the zoo package (link1). I used data on the speed of pupillary reactions of neurotypical infants in the age range of my study to determine the window for the rolling average (link2). Rolling averages in the filtered data still indicate whether a large amount of data were just missing or not. I can use this trajectory and compare it with the trajectory of pupil dilation. Maybe. https://www.storybench.org/how-to-calculate-a-rolling-average-in-r/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6985190/
