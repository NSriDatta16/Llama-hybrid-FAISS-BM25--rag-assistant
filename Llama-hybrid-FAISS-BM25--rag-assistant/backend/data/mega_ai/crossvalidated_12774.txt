If there is the possibility that something may belong to more than one class, another approach is to train N classifiers with the '-b 1' flag (to enable probability estimates). You will then get confidence levels of each data point belonging to each classifier. However, there's still the question of what threshold to use. If you want to get around the problem of picking the 'best' threshold, you can use 11-pt Mean Average Precision. This measures the AP for threshold values [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0] (thus the 11 pt).
