Interpreting Dickey-Fuller test vs Autocorrelation

I have time series dataset and I have run the Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test using statsmodels and got the below statistic ADF Statistic: -4.031907 p-value: 0.001252 Critical Values: 1%: -3.434 5%: -2.863 10%: -2.568 Comparing with the tests critical values, I can reject the Null hypothesis that the data is not stationary. Which means my time series data is stationary I have run the pandas autocorrelation plot which shows autocorrelation in the time series dataset. Which means that there is non-stationarity in the data. Which contradicts the conclusion from Dickey-Fuller test. Is my understanding of both these approaches correct or am i missing something ? Thanks
