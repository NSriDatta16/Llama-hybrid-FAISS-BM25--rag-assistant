imagecreatefromjpeg() error - Why is my image manipulation script failing?

I am currently using an image manipulation script to do some work on uploaded images and I'm running into a problem in my dev environment. This same code works on my production server. The error is: PHP Warning: imagecreatefromjpeg(): php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known in /path/to/script.php on line 75 The line of code on 75 is: $this->img = imagecreatefromjpeg(PHPTHUMB."?src=/".$this->image_path); which creates an image that is loaded from another made by phpThumb, which is used for further manipulation. Any ideas on how to solve this? Can anyone shed some light on what the error means? Thank you, Edit: Just as a further bit of insight, if i visit PHPTHUMB . "?src=/" . $this->image_path in my browser, the image loads fine User agent in php.ini did not solve the problem as indicated here EDIT (SOLUTION): I had to add the INTERNAL 192.168.204.XXX IP into the hosts file, so that http://dev.mysite.com resolved correctly. Trying both 127.0.0.1 and the external IP yielded no result, but the internal works perfectly. Thanks for everyone's efforts,
