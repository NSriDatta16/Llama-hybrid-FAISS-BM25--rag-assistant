What is the correct way to write the model equation for a linear probability model?

I'm trying to write down the equation describing a linear probability model . If I was writing out the equation for an OLS model with continuous y with observation unit i , I would write: $$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \epsilon_i $$ If I were specifying the model for a probit model, I would write: $$ Pr(y_i =1) = \Phi(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2}) $$ or something thereabouts. To be clear, a linear probability model is just an OLS model in which Y is a 0/1 indicator variable for some particular outcome. I know this is kind of a pedantic question, but how do you formally indicate in the first equation that $y_i$ is an indicator variable for an outcome just so that it's clear from the equation what you are doing? Alternatively, is this a silly question and you just write the first equation and clarify the meaning of $y_i$ in the text? edit: Maybe I'm encouraging too much analysis here. Simply put, what would be the reasonable equation to write down in a basic empirical driven paper to say "this is the form of the model and the relevant data items" where you were running a linear probability model?
