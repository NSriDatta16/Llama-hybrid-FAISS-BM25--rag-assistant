I think you got a wrong approach. First of all, you're doing a loop and recursion, besides using a depth variable that has no meaning since you never check it's value either to end the recursion, or to know something about what you want to do. The use a a dynamic function within the loop itself is not quite good, since the iteration should be well defined from the beginning of the loop. i is just useless in your context. So if I understand your code, a problematic case would be a case where there is 3 empty squares and 4 non empty squares since you would iterate i from 0 to 3 and do nothing but incrementing j from 0 to 3 then exit because i would have reach 3. Of course I may be mistaken on some points because I don't know what tree is, from where did it come from? is it related to n? What is a board. I hope my contribution can help you and I encourage you to post more details to clarify the holes and enable me to help you a bit more.
