You're going to need to give us more details, I think, and some code fragments, I think, from your description, you have two problems - one, the web requests start failing with 521 errors, and, two, your service stops. Given the service stops after a large number of the web request failures, I'd look at resource exhaustion of some sort - are you running out of memory? Filehandles? Threads? Something else? What does your application do when the web request fails?
