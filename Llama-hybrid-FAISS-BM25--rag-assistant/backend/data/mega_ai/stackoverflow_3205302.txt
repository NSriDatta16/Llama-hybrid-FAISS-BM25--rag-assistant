Difference between Rscript and littler

...besides the fact that Rscript is invoked with #!/usr/bin/env Rscript and littler with #!/usr/local/bin/r (on my system) in first line of script file. I've found certain differences in execution speed (seems like littler is a bit slower). I've created two dummy scripts, ran each 1000 times and compared average execution time. Here's the Rscript file: #!/usr/bin/env Rscript btime and here's the littler file: #!/usr/local/bin/r btime As you can see, they are almost identical (first line and sink file argument differ). Output is sink ed to text file, hence imported in R with read.table . I've created bash script to execute each script 1000 times, then calculated averages. Here's bash script: for i in `seq 1000` do ./$1 echo "####################" echo "Iteration #$i" echo "####################" done And the results are: # littler script > mean(lit) user system elapsed 0.489327 0.035458 0.588647 > sapply(lit, median) L1 L2 L3 0.490 0.036 0.609 # Rscript > mean(rsc) user system elapsed 0.219334 0.008042 0.274017 > sapply(rsc, median) R1 R2 R3 0.220 0.007 0.258 Long story short: beside (obvious) execution-time difference, is there some other difference? More important question is: why should/shouldn't you prefer littler over Rscript (or vice versa)?
