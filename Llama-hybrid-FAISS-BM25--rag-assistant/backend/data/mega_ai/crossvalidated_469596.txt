Does it also make sense to perform fit_transform() on the training data but NOT transform() testing data at all so that we get to test the model performance on actual real-world data that are not transformed at all? No. You've scaled the training data, so you should scale the testing data using the same scales as the training data. If I train a model using kilometers but then I measure my testing data in centimeters, my model will be wildly incorrect because the two measurements are using incompatible scales. The correct thing to do is rescale my testing data to also use kilometers. I get an error so I thought this may not be an acceptable case to do, It's impossible to comment on this without a reproducible example. Here's an example that might help: if my preprocessing on the training data is using PCA to project from 100 dimensions to 2 dimensions, then by not applying the transformation to my testing data, I'd be passing an object with 100 dimensions to a model that only expects to receive 2 dimensions. This should, and does, cause errors.
