Setting default url for R to look for packages in Mac OS X

Mac64 R> install.packages("quantmod") Yields a discouraging message. Namely, Warning: unable to access index for repository http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/languages /R/CRAN/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.12 Warning message: In getDependencies(pkgs, dependencies, available, lib) : package ‘quantmod’ is not available No big deal, just pass in a different repo, like this: Mac64 R> install.packages("quantmod", repo="http://R.research.att.com") And all is well. But how do you set the default repo so you don't need to pass it in every time? In Ubuntu, there is a file that manages this but the documentation for Mac OS X is a bit sparse.
