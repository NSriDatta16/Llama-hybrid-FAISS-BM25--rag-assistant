How to retrain the neural network when new data comes in?

I am new to deep learning. Can anybody help me with the online learning implimentation for deep learning models. As per my understanding, i can save a keras/tensorflow model after training and when new data comes in, i can reload the network back and retrain the network using the new data. I havenâ€™t seen anywhere documenting this method. Is my understanding incorrect? If yes, let me know what can be done so that the model keeps on getting retrained when new data comes in?
