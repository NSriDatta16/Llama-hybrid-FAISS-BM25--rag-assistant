There are (free) express editions of Visual Studio and SQL Server 2005/2008 . And you don't need any servers to develop ASP.NET applications - you can do this on XP/Vista as well. You will only need to pay for a hoster if you want to make an application publically available. Please also have a look at the following question for some similar information: Does Learning C#/.NET Require An MSDN Subscription? Update : As an alternative to a commercial hoster (e.g. to temporarily make one of your applications available to others), you can host them on your PC and use a dynamic DNS service (such as DynDNS ) to make your PC accessible from the internet. Although (as Robert mentions in his comment), permanently hosting a web application in that way might be a violation of your agreement with your ISP.
