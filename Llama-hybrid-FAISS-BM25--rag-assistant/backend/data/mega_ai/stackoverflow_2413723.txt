This is something that's bothered me for a long time. Probably the "right" solution would be to submit a patch to vim itself that would allow you to customize paragraph boundaries with a regex (like :set paragraphs, but actually useful). In the meantime, I've made a function and a couple of mappings that almost do the right thing: function! ParagraphMove(delta, visual) normal m' normal | if a:visual normal gv endif if a:delta > 0 " first whitespace-only line following a non-whitespace character let pos1 = search("\\S", "W") let pos2 = search("^\\s*$", "W") if pos1 == 0 || pos2 == 0 let pos = search("\\%$", "W") endif elseif a:delta } :call ParagraphMove( 1, 0) onoremap } :call ParagraphMove( 1, 0) " vnoremap } :call ParagraphMove( 1, 1) nnoremap { :call ParagraphMove(-1, 0) onoremap { :call ParagraphMove(-1, 0) " vnoremap { :call ParagraphMove(-1, 1) This doesn't correctly handle counts like '4}' or visual mode correctly (uncomment the vnoremap lines at your peril), but seems ok for things like not clobbering the current search pattern and not flickering. Also, 'd}', 'y}', etc. seem to work ok. If anyone has ideas for making counts work or fixing visual mode, please let me know.
