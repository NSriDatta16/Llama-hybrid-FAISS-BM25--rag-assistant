If you're right, and code which used to work is no longer working, then something outside your code must have changed. There's at least 2 MTAs (one local, and one remote) which might be interfering with your email. If you control the local one, then checks the queue and logs to see if it is being forwarded. Unfortunately, because of the volume and nature of spam, lots of people invent non-standardized methods of dealing with it - RBLs, RMX, domain Keys, sender id, bayesian filters....there's nothing intrinsically wrong with these approaches but for the fact they are unilaterally applied by service providers often without the knowledge, let alone consent of the service users. And providers are usually very secretive about the provisions they've put in place. But if you're sending to gmail then it will probably be bayesian-like filtering systems they use - HAVE YOU CHECKED THE SPAM FOLDER? So it is very probable that even if the change has been applied somewhere beyond your sphere of influence, it may not be an absolute block, however routing your mail through the mail server may well require a lot of experimentation.
