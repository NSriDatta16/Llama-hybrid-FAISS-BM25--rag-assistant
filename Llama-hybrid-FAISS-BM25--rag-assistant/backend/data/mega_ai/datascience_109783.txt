The only way is to obtain two comparable datasets for method A and method B. How exactly to do that is specific to your data and likely involves expert knowledge, but I can at least try to sketch possible directions: If there are cases where customers were randomly assigned A or B and you have clear indications of these cases, that would perfect. If there are enough cases where the same customer was sometimes billed by method A and sometimes B, that could the basic of a fair dataset: even if the customer was switched from A to B, one can still observe by how much this decreases the risk of non-payment. Note that the comparison would be paired by customer. If none of this works, the company has to organize a proper A/B testing on a sample of transactions (basically building a dataset like described in the first option). This may cost a bit in the short term, but it could be beneficial to obtain reliable estimations in the long term.
