drag and drop workflow kind of interface..how easy to develop?

How easy it's to come up with a drag and drop web-based interface that'll provide me features to wire objects together, setup configurations nicely in a modal window for each object? I'm looking for links that've any similar kind of interface, or articles on this. also, i'm looking for your technology/language suggestions. Another way I'm thinking - as a desktop appln + browser dependent addon.. Is it good to create such an user-interface using XUL, which can be deployed as an addon on Firefox/as a stand-alone application in Windows? Are there any other similar things/technologies which can provide a basic framework for us to build on it further? Why do I need this, finally? ..for building simple Workflows, for defining process flows, that can provide me some auto-generated xml content which I can use for further processing. Thanks!
