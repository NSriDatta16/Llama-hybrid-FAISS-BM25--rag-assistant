A series is said to have an unit root if it's non-stationary. When you have, say, two non-stationary processes integrated to order 1 (I(1) series) and you can find a linear combination of those processes which is I(0) then your series are cointegrated. This means that they evolve in a somewhat similar way. This channel has some nice insights about time series, cointegration and so https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvTKjm94Ars As for books, I quite like "Econometric Theory and Methods" by Davidson & MacKinnon.
