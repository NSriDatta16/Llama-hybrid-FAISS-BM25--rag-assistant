Fixed effects or Random effects model?

I am trying to understand the difference between fixed and random effects modelling. The panel data I have is in the form of basic longitudinal panel time series. I know that I can use the Hauseman test to determinate which model to use. But my problem is that in fixed effects model I have to use fixed slopes or there won't be a coefficient for the whole model available. In random effects I can use random slopes and intercept and still get a slope coefficient for the whole model. So how can I determinate whether to use random effects model with varying intercept and coefficient or fixed effects model using only varying coefficient and fixed slope?
