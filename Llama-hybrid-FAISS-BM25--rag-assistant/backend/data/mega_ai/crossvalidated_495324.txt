Ordinal logistic regression with stacked data

I have a panel dataset (covering 3 periods), in which we've stacked the data so that each individual respondent has 4-8 observations. The independent and dependent variables are both on a Likert scale. My general idea is: dependent = indep1 + gend + indep1*gend , with fixed effects. I found this paper that seems to do a similar thing (ordinal logistic regression with fixed effects, feologit in Stata). I'm basically just wondering whether this still works for stacked data? My dataset looks like this: Resp depen Indep1 gend 1 1 1 f 1 2 2 m 1 4 3 f 2 2 4 f 2 4 1 m 3 3 2 f A paper did a similar thing to what I intend to do and used alternative specific multinomial probit - but I have the Likert scale outcome, more time periods and I'd rather not estimate separate models for the gender ( gend ).
