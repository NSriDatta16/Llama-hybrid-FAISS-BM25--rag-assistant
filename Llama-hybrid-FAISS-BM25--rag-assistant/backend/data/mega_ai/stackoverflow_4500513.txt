How to know when isolated storage is being deleted in Silverlight?

I have a Silverlight app that uses IsolatedStorage to store some info about the current session. If the user right clicks the mouse and chooses Silverlight and goes to delete the application storage, I get an exception of type IsolatedStorageException when I call IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForSite(). I don't want to use try-catch block to catch the exception, I just want to be able to call the method successfully, or a similar method like the one above. Is there a way to know (maybe an event) when user deletes the application storage? I use Silverlight 4.0. Thank you very much !
