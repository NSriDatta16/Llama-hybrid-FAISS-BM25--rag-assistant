Object the follow the cursor of the mouse

i am doing a Wpf Application and i create a Control with the shape of an eye ,i put a Ellipse(eye) in a Canvas and my purpose is when the cursor of the mouse enter in the Canvas the Ellipse follow the cursor of mouse. Do you have any suggestion how perform this task? Thanks so much for your attention. Cheers EDIT I have update my code in Xaml: and in the code behind : private void mov(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { System.Windows.Point pt = e.GetPosition((Canvas)sender); Storyboard invokeStoryboard = this.Resources["OnLoaded1"] as Storyboard; ((DoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames)invokeStoryboard.Children[0]).KeyFrames[0].Value = pt.X; ((DoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames)invokeStoryboard.Children[1]).KeyFrames[0].Value = pt.Y; invokeStoryboard.Begin(); } now my purpose is when i move the mouse in the Canvas area(LayoutRoot) the Ellipse(ctrCircle) move only inside the Border(border_eye) and don't overcome the area of the "border_eye" this effect is similar an eye. Do you have any input to work out this step? Thanks so much Have a nice day. Cheers
