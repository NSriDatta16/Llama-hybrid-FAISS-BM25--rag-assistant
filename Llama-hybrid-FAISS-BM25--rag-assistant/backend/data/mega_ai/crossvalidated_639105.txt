You ask How can I describe such data, such that in the end I can quote an "average" cluster size per sensor (including the uncertainty). And finally, per such set of settings of the sensors, I want to quote an "average" number +- uncertainty. This depends entirely on what you want to describe. You write that you think mean and RMS doesn't make sense because the distributions are not normal. But this is not correct. The mean exists for skewed data as does RMS. It's true that it's often said that it's not good to use the mean for such data and it's true that the mean is strongly affected by outliers, but ... do you care? I don't know. Maybe you want a measure that's affected by outliers. If you want to use the median, you could also list median absolute deviation (MAD) or interquartile range (I prefer to show this as two numbers). The median is not affected by outliers (unless there are so many that they hardly qualify as outliers) and has a very high breakdown point. Or maybe you want the trimmed mean -- these are compromises between the median and mean. Or, possibly, there is no single number that does what you want and you have to use a five-number or seven-number summary (these aren't used much any more, but Tukey liked them and Tukey knew what he was doing). Or maybe you want boxplots. However, if you do use boxplots on data with such large N, then I suggest adding jitter to the outliers and making the symbol transparent or very small, so that overplotting is avoided to the extent possible.
