Can a Bayesian estimator perform better than an MVUE?

According to wikipedia: In statistics a minimum-variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) or uniformly minimum-variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) is an unbiased estimator that has lower variance than any other unbiased estimator for all possible values of the parameter. Can a biased Bayesian estimator perform better? If so, are there any examples? I personally think it cannot since the least value of the (MSE = $\text{Bias}^2$ + Variance) is achieved by the MVUE, for a biased Bayesian estimator to perform better than this would mean that it has a strictly lower variance as compared to the MVUE. I'm unable to justify this part. Can a bayesian estimator have a lower variance than the MVUE?
