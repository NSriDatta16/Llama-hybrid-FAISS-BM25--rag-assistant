A two-way split followed by another two-way split on one of the children is not the same thing as a single three-way split I'm not sure what you mean here. Any multi-way split can be represented as a series of two-way splits. For a three-way split, you can split into A, B, and C by first splitting into A&B versus C and then splitting out A from B. A given algorithm might not choose that particular sequence (especially if, like most algorithms, it's greedy), but it certainly could. And if any randomization or stagewise procedures are done like in random forests or boosted trees, the chances of finding the right sequence of splits goes up. As others have pointed out, multi-way splits are computationally costly, so given these alternatives, most researchers seem to have chosen binary splits.
