Either way works the same. However, if you run code coverage metrics for your unit tests, the if (!FullScreenEnabled) return; will count as a separate block and you'll have to create a unit test to cover it to get to 100%. Granted, even with the other approach you might want to have a unit test that verifies you are not executing your code when FullScreenEnabled is false. But if you cheat and don't write it, you still get 100%. :-)
