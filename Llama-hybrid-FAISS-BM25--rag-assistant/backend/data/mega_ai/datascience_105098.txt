Below is some sample data limited to few examples only out of >1000. First picture is a colored print-screen of a table to highlight different categories: main, macro-, micro-categories & below the picture is a raw data. The objective is: User enters two (can be one or even all) macro-categories (e.g. Citrus and Leafy green) For these macro-categories (which were entered) the model returns top best matches I am afraid that if I train a model (RF or SVM) over whole dataset, using macr- and micro-categories as different features in the model -> the model could predict micro-category not related to the macro-category (e.g. I will get as a result Oranges (Citrus), but I entered to the model only Berries and Melons).
