Particular cases in Granger's causality test

I'd like to expand a question about Granger's causality test by focusing on some particular cases one may happen to encounter. I have two time series x and y where the Granger causality test gives: > grangertest(x,y,1) Granger causality test Model 1: y ~ Lags(y, 1:1) + Lags(x, 1:1) Model 2: y ~ Lags(y, 1:1) Res.Df Df F Pr(>F) 1 23 2 24 -1 1.4754 0.2368 and > grangertest(y,x,1) Granger causality test Model 1: x ~ Lags(x, 1:1) + Lags(y, 1:1) Model 2: x ~ Lags(x, 1:1) Res.Df Df F Pr(>F) 1 23 2 24 -1 1.0869 0.308 The fact that both p-values are quite high (say I choose a confidence level 0.05) makes me think that I cannot reject the null hypothesis that x does not cause y for Y = f(X) . In other words I can't say neither if x causes y , nor if y causes x . Is this interpretation correct? Just out of curiosity, then, I have tried to see what happens when I use two synthetic random series. x and I get > grangertest(x,y,1) Granger causality test Model 1: y ~ Lags(y, 1:1) + Lags(x, 1:1) Model 2: y ~ Lags(y, 1:1) Res.Df Df F Pr(>F) 1 996 2 997 -1 1.5105 0.2193 and Granger causality test Model 1: x ~ Lags(x, 1:1) + Lags(y, 1:1) Model 2: x ~ Lags(x, 1:1) Res.Df Df F Pr(>F) 1 996 2 997 -1 0.1859 0.6664 This is an outcome quite similar to my data and, it seems to me, consistent with the interpretation of the function output I gave above, but please let me know if I'm missing something.
