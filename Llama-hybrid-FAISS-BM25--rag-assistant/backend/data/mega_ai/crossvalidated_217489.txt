You can perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on the correlation matrix of your continuous variables. PCA is a method of dimension reduction and hence it is usually applied to reduce the number of collinear variables, like in your case. Many softwares, such as PC-ORD, can perform it. But, I am not sure that you can do correlation analyses with your categorical or nominal variables at the same time. However, you can get some ideas on how to handle these nominal variables after you have reduced some of collinear continuous variables through PCA.
