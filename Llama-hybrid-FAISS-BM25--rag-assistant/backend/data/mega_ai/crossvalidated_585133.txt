So you want to use the genetic marker presence to predict the clinical measurements? You can use a multilevel regression to do this even though some participants only have one observation. To do this, organize your data into long format and create an ID variable, like this (id denotes an individual, gmark is genetic marker, I assumed it is yes/no variable, and y is the clinical observation, I assumed it was a continuous variable): id gmark y 1 yes 2.73023175 1 yes -0.73526896 1 yes -0.86780859 2 no -0.60646945 2 no -0.02059873 2 no -0.21054050 3 yes -0.83122649 3 yes -1.37551132 3 yes 1.30495183 The multilevel regression code in R would be: library(lme4) library(lmerTest) model Edit. though you'd want to code the genetic marker as 1 and 0 so you get interpretable estimates. An alternative might be single-level regression with clustered standard errors (see here: https://www.statisticshowto.com/clustered-standard-errors/ )
