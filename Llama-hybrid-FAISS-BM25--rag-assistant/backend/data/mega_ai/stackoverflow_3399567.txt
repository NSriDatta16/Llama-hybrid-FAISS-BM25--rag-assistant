You could use a the $_SESSION variable to persist data. // Call at start of PHP script session_start() //.... // Store object $_SESSION['obj'] = json_encode(obj); in your pull script: // Call at start of PHP script session_start() // Retrieve object echo $_SESSION['obj']; Note that when using sessions you have to make sure that you call session_start() at the top of every php script that uses the session. I would not recommend trying to store this in a file unless you are supporting a very low number of users and have taken proper data sanitation steps to physically write files to the server. If you need this to persist past the length of a session you should be using a database. It is worth noting that you can't update a users session without some other form of centralized storage. Unless you have some sort of long-polling / comet type setup you will have to have some sort of central storage place. Something I would take a look at would be memcache .
