One way is to use a TCP Socket from the client to connect back to your server. Have the client listen for data, and have the server send updates whenever needed. This may require firewall changes (to allow the port you'll be using) and a server which accepts multiple persistent client connections. This may only work for a fixed smallish number of clients, since if you are keeping multiple connections open it will incur some server overhead. If you have firewall restrictions and need to use HTTP ports, you can investigate Comet implementations. What I proposed in the first paragraph is more or less the same thing - Comet just does it over HTTP and standardises some aspects of the communication.
