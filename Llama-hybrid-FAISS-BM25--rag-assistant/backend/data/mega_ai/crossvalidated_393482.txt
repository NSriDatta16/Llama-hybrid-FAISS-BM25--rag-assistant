help with formula for prediciting electrical consumption

I am trying to find a formula that I can use to find out what my consumption will be based on what the temperature might be, based on the comparison of what the consumption/temperature has been in the previous years. How else would I know if I made an energy efficiency improvement has worked? I can't use energy consumption alone as the savings could have been a product of a milder winter. Which is why it needs to be normalized in comparison to the average temperature for that month. So, if we made an improvement to the thermal efficiency of the roof and would have previously consumed 300mw of power in the month of December; but instead are consuming only 200mw. How do I mathematically prove that it was due to the efficiency of the new roof and not a milder winter. Where would I find resources to help me with these types of calculations and formulas? *note: I understand formulas written in Excel type format better than the customary graphical layout. Example Historical data is as follows: Year/Avg Temp for Month/Electrical consumption 2014,12c,300mw 2015,-8c,450mw 2016,-4c,400mw
