A two-way bar chart is often as effective as anything else. You have in effect a table of bars arranged in rows and columns. Length or height of bar encodes count or amount in cell, rather than colour of tile in a heat map. The same kind of display comes under many names, including aligned bar charts, multi-pane bar charts, survey plots, table lens, Bertin plots, Hinton plots, Willshaw plots, and no doubt others. A correspondence analysis can indicate good ordering of rows and columns; this problem is often called seriation. See for example http://www.jstatsoft.org/v25/i03
