Django: sorl-thumbnail and hosting image files on my own file server

I like very much sorl-thumbnail library and I want to store image files not in current application (django) server, but to (another) my own file server with webserver for serving static files. Do I have to write custom django storage or not? How can I upload files to remote static file server(s)? What if I have many application (django) servers and many file servers? Is it better to use custom file upload handler ? And if not then when is it useful? And if yes then how to use it with sorl-thumbnail? P.S. I'm not sure what is the right (good) way to do this, because I have not much experience in web programming and Django.
