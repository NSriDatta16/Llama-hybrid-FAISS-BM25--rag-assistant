You don't set the custom option on the product model, you pass it in through the second argument to $cart->addProduct($product, $params) . The set up we have for a project, that requires an external app to add to the Magento cart, is to use a $params array of the following format: $params = array( 'product' => 1, // This would be $product->getId() 'qty' => 1, 'options' => array( 34 => "value", 35 => "other value", 53 => "some other value" ) ); The $params['options'] contains the custom option information. The keys are the custom option ids, you can see them if you inspect the custom options section of the product screen with Firebug, or similar. The $params['product'] may be redundant, I wrote this script a while ago for a much earlier version of Magento. Also, I'm fairly sure that the standard add to cart events will fire when you add this way, so you'll need to set them off yourself. There may be side effects.
