Empirical verification of the probability integral transform

I just discovered when working on Copulae that it was common knowledge that if $X$ is a continuous random variable with probability density function $F_{X}$, then $Y=F_{X}(x)$ follows a uniform distribution. Before finding the proof online I was trying to empirically verify the above statement in R, but couldn't seem to succeed. Could someone please tell me what is wrong in my approach? In the code below I am plotting the histograms (empirical PDFs) of $10^3$ values sampled from the Normal CDF and of $10^3$ values sampled from the Cauchy CDF. Instead of observing uniform distributions, here is what I am getting: par(mfrow=c(1,2)) hist(pnorm(ppoints(1e3))) hist(pcauchy(ppoints(1e3))) I was not expecting perfectly uniform distributions, but $10^3$ values should be enough to at least approach something that looks uniform. So what is wrong?
