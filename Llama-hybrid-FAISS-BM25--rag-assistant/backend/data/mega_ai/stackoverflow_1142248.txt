The Second Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary contains full entries for 171,476 words in current use The average length of English words is 4.5 letters In bytes that would be 4.5 per word Therefore 171,476 x 4.5 = 771,642 bytes to store all the words In MB that would be 0.735895157 So what I'm trying to say is, you have enough storage to have your own dictionary :)
