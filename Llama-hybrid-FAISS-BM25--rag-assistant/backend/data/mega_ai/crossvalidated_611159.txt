The best approach would be not to use a grid search. Nearly any other algorithm would be more efficient starting from random search , and ending on specialized optimization algorithms doing Bayesian optimization or using other techniques (see e.g. hyperopt or optuna ). They would usually do the job faster, giving you better quality results. If a priori you don't have a good idea about the grid to search, the way to go would be to test some values and use them to narrow down the search space, then repeat the procedure recursively. Roughly speaking, this is what those specialized algorithms would be doing, but in a way that is proven to be optimal (vs ad hoc).
