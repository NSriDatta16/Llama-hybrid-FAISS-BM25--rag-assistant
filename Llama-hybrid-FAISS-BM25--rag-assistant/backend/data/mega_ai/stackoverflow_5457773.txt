How to make an FPDF's generated pdf non cacheable?

I'm checking an app written in raw php, without any framework. In a module there are reports generated with FPDF and working fine, except that the pdfs gets cached. The original invocation of the generation routine was Print tr_inci_print.php uses 2 parameters, year and month that are stored in session. I've changed the code to &mes= " target="_new">Imprimir that solves partially the problem, because of the URI changing in every month. But if data changes externally and the browser is still in the original page, reinvoking the link does generates an not updated pdf. There is any way to change $FPDF->output() to make the pdf non cacheable? ------ Partial solution ------------------- following oezi answer, changed : $oPdf->output() with $buffer=$oPdf->Output('','S'); header('Content-Type: application/pdf'); header('Content-Length: '.strlen($buffer)); header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename="doc.pdf"'); header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=1"); // HTTP/1.1 header("Expires: Sat, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); // any date in the past header('Pragma: public'); ini_set('zlib.output_compression','0'); echo $buffer; that solved the problem in Chrome and IE, but not in FireFox 4.
