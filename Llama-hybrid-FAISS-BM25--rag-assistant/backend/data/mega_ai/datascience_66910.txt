You need to set bootstrap=False in the random forest to disable the subsampling. (I originally commented because I expected there to be more impediments [in addition to your already-coded random_state s and max_features=None ], but I guess there aren't any!) You probably don't want to do this in general; by stripping out all the randomness so that the first tree is the same as the DecisionTreeClassifier, you'll end up with all the trees being the same, and the random forest loses its usefulness.
