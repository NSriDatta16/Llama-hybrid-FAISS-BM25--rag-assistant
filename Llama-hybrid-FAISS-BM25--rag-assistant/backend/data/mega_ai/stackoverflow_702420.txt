AS2 FLA Component with embeded classes

I'm trying to create an AS2 component which is easily skinnable. I create an FLA component by creating a mc with some assets > component definition > link it to MyClass, and drop the fla into the Components dir. If I then drag the component into a new fla and try to render, it obviously throws the error that it can't find MyClass. I'd rather not provide the src files separately. I've tried following some walk-throughs that described using the componentShim, but it seemed like that was only for AS3. Any suggestions ? TIA!
