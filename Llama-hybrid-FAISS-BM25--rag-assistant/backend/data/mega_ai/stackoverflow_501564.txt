One way to do it, since the RichTextEditor's sub-components are declared in MXML and are therefore publicly accessible, is to assign their styleName properties individually at runtime (after the container's creationComplete event fires, to be sure the editor and all its children have been created), like so: .myRTECombo { color: #FF0000; } The Flex docs don't call out the subcomponents ("boldButton", "fontSizeCombo", et al) by ID, but the component's source is available for viewing, so you should be able to get all the info you need from the source code itself. Since I use FlexBuilder, I usually use the Eclipse Ctrl+click shortcut, on the tag/class name, to jump into the associated class-definition file, but you can also open the source file directly at [installDir]/sdks/[version]/frameworks/src/mx/RichTextEditor.mxml to have a look for yourself. I'm sure there are other approaches ( setStyle being one, although its explicit use is generally discouraged for performance reasons), but this ought to work out for you. One thing to note, though, as you'll see when you dig into the component's source, is that many of the buttons in the default button set actually use PNGs (e.g., icon_style_bold.png ), not text, which is why my example includes a reference to the ComboBox instead, so you can see how the color changes apply; if you want to change the look of the buttons, be aware they're using the styleable icon property, not font-style settings, for their look and feel. Hope it helps!
