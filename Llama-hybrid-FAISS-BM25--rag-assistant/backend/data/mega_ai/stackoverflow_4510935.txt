Display image using a RSS feed

I have an application in which use a RSS feed reader. My problem is that I don't know what is the best way to display an image. The closer I could get was to pull the image description (). I know I could parse this String by myself and get the image url, but I was wondering if there is a more elegant way to solve this issue. I tried using the SAX and the DOM classes, but I couldn't figure it out.
