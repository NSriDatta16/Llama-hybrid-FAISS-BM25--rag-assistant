How To Build a Template Framework for Joomla?

If you are a Joomla developer, I am sure you have heard of or used the T3, Gantry, Zen Grid, YJSimpleGrid, or the new Gavern template frameworks built by various sites. I want to make one for my own company, we have some specific sites we build where pieces are always the same etc. But I am trying to figure out just how to start building one? Have you built one? How would you build one?
