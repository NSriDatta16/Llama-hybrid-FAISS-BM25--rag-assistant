C++ - How to read Unicode characters( Hindi Script for e.g. ) using C++ or is there a better Way through some other programming language?

I have a hindi script file like this: 3. भारत का इतिहास काफी समृद्ध एवं विस्तृत है। I have to write a program which adds a position to each and every word in each sentence. Thus the numbering for every line for a particular word position should start off with 1 in parentheses. The output should be something like this. 3. भारत(1) का(2) इतिहास(3) काफी(4) समृद्ध(5) एवं(6) विस्तृत(7) है(8) ।(9) The meaning of the above sentence is: 3. India has a long and rich history. If you observe the '।'( which is a full stop in hindi equivalent to a '.' in English ) also has a word position and similarly other special symbols would also have as I am trying to go about English-Hindi Word alignment( a part of Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) ) so the full stop in english '.' should map to '।' in Hindi. Serial nos remain as it is untouched. I thought reading character by character could be a solution. How can I do this? The thing is I am able to get word positions for my English text using C++ as I was able to read character by character using ASCII values in C++ but I don't have a clue to how to go about the same for the hindi text. The final aim of all this is to see which word position of the English text maps to which postion in Hindi. This way I can achieve bidirectional alignment. Thank you for your time...:)
