Magento admin extension fails to show in live server menu bar

I have recently built my first Magento extenstion. It involves adding a new menu item in the admin area and works perfectly on my development server. On the live server however, the menu bar item fails to display. I am pretty sure that all the files have been copied over and I have refreshed all of the cache. I have checked the system > configuration > advanced area and the module is listed in the disable section. Are there any other settings/configurations I need to check?
