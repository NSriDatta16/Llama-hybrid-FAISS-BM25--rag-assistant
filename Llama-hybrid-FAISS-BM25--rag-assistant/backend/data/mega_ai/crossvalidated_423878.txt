How can I do subject clustering in a high dimension?

I am working on a dataset with 200 participants' data. For each participant, we collected 20-70 days' data. After data engineering, we got features over 300 dimensions. Do we have any way to cluster the participants based on the features? In the current stage, I calculate the average value of each participant's features. For example, if we have 30 days' data from one participant, I would calculate the average value of these 30 days' data across features. Then, the problem becomes doing clustering based on 200 sample points with 300 dimensions of features. I applied PCA and reduce the dimension to 90 (95% as the variance ratio), and tried k-means and GMM in doing clustering. However, I got the silhouette score lower than 0.1. Is there any method I can try to improve the clustering performances? I am not sure whether it is okay to calculate the average value of each participant in the high dimension data. Also, the dimension of 90 is still high. I think the k-means and GMM may not work well in this case. Is there any clustering algorithms that can be applied in high-dimension data? Thanks all!
