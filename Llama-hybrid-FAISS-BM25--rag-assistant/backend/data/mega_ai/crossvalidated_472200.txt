There are different forms of heteroskedasticity and ARCH is one of them. In a cross-sectional setting, conditional heteroskedasticity usually means that $\text{Var}(\varepsilon_i|X_i)=\sigma_i^2=\sigma^2(X_i)$ where $\varepsilon_i$ is the error term of observation $i$ and $X_i$ is the vector of regressor values for observation $i$ . Thus, the conditional variance is a function of the regressors. Example: $\text{Var}(\varepsilon_i|X_i)=c|X_{1i}|$ for some positive constant $c$ . ARCH is a specific kind of conditional heteroskedasticity that applies only to time series data (or data that has a time series dimension). As is clear from the title, it is autoregressive. Here, $\text{Var}(\varepsilon_t|I_{t-1})=\sigma_t^2=\sigma^2(I_{t-1})$ where $\varepsilon_t$ is the error term of the time period $t$ and $I_{t-1}$ is the information available at time $t-1$ , e.g. the set of historical values of the dependent variable: $I_{t-1}=\{y_{t-1},y_{t-2},\dots,y_1,y_0\}$ . Example: the popular GARCH(1,1) model has $\text{Var}(\varepsilon_t|I_{t-1})=\sigma_t^2=\omega+\alpha_1\varepsilon_{t-1}^2+\beta_1\sigma_{t-1}^2$ . Note that in the case of ARCH, the conditional variance does not vary with the regressors. (You could have a combination of ARCH patterns and variance dependence on regressors, but this would not be a pure ARCH any longer.) The tests you are referring to do not test the same thing. Breusch-Pagan tests for the first kind of heteroskedasticity, while ARCH-LM tests for the second kind (ARCH).
