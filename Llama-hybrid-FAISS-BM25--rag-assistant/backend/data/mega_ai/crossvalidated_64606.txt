What are the structural rules for arc reversal in a Bayesian network?

Given a Bayesian network, if I reverse the edge from $X \rightarrow Y$, what additional edges do I need to add to the structure of the network? I know that there are some rules about linking (adding edges amongst) the parents (and/or children) for one or both of $X,Y$, but I haven't found a good concise set of rules on line.
