I believe the correct approach here is to compare the fit of a model where IV(a) and IV(b) are allowed to vary - that is, your present model - with the fit of a model where IV(a) and IV(b) are fit to the same value (in which case the mediator is just an average of the two). The two models can be compared using a Chi-Square difference test. This is simple enough to be performed by hand - I am not quite sure how to do that last, final step in SPSS. But all of the requisite values for calculating the Chi-Square difference will be available to you in SPSS, and there are several online calculators that could be used for determining the value of this test statistic and its p-value. I hope that helps!
