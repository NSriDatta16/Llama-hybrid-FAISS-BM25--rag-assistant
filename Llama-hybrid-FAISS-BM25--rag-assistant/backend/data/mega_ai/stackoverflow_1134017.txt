Linking an existing folder to a solution in Visual C# Express

Note that these are my first steps in the world of C# so I may be asking something really basic here, however neither Google nor Visual C# Express Help helped me so I'm forced to ask this here. I have a set of .cs files in a folder (and its subfolders) I have checked out from SVN repository using TortoiseSVN. I would like to see those files with the same folder structure in Visual C# Express 2008 I'm running. However, I can't find the correct import or dynamic linking wizard, and drag'n'drop apparently clones the files to the solution instead of just linking them. So, what am I missing, coming from the Java world and being an Eclipse user I've become used to this kind of functionality, but with VC#E I feel stumped already and I haven't even managed to open a single source file. The reason for this setup is that we have a collaborative project with a couple of friends and not every one of us uses VC#E, in fact not all of us even use Windows either.
