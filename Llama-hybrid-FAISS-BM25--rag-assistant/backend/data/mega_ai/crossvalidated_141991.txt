You can not order features according to their variance, as the variance used in PCA is basically a multidimensional entity. You can only order features by the projection of the variance to certain direction you choose (which is normally the first principal compnonet.) So, in other word, whether a feature has more variance than anther one depends on how you choose your projection direction.
