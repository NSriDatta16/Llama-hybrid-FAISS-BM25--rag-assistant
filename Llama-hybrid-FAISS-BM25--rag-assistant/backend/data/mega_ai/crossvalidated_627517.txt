Interpreting normalized value in logistic regression

I'm trying to interpret results from my logistic regression. I normalized the values between 0 and 100 because I had many variables with different units. My intercept is -0.741 and I'm using that to calculate probability P0 For the variable investment cost, I calculated the unit change as function of the max and min original values. The coefficient of this variable is -8.247 and is significant. Can you please check if my reasoning and interpretation are correct ? Thanks a lot !
