how to queue users who want to access the same database

I am developing a web application which requires that multiple users submit there queries (each user on an average has at least 200 quires) and the queries are process through different statements in db. the system can process 8 queries/sec. when more then one user is accessing the application the db is getting more queries then it can handle. how can i queue the queries coming from different user so that all the users time delay is equal. All your suggessions are most appritiated I am using php and mysql Thanks
