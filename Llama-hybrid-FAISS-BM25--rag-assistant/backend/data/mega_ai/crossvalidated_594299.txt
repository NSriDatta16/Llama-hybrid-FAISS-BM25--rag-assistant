What models can be used to prove causality?

Right now I am looking into analyzing the factors of crime in an economics paper. I currently have a multiple OLS regression set up that is pretty standard: Y = B0 + B1(Variable) + B2(Variable) + B3(Variable) + ... + u (error term) Here is a small sample of my dataset: However, this model seems very weak in terms of proving causality, or even telling us if there is a significant relationship. Thus, my question is how can one prove causality with a time series dataset? I have looked into doing a Fixed Effects model, but (as I understand it) this only will control for variables that do not change over time, thus not helping much. I also looked into a Pooled OLS model, but this seems to only work when we have multiple entities observed over time, not just one. I have also looked into VectorAutoregression (VAR), but this seems mainly reserved for forecasting, not proving statistical relationships. In addition to this, I looked at Granger Causality but I believe that this also suffers from being too simple and not really providing anything of use. What model would be the best to be applied here?
