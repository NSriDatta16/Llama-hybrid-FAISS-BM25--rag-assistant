Hey. There can also be some other issues. Provisioning Profile. From Apple documentation: For your protection, the instrument does not allow you to process any application that is not code-signed with your provisioning profile. This includes any copy that has been downloaded from the iTunes App Store. Device. Instrumetns UIAutomation doesn't work on iPhone 3G, only 3Gs, 4. Sadly support for instruments is bad. Apple doesn't seem to put much attention to it.
