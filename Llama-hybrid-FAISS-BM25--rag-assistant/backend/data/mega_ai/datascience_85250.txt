You can follow the give steps as a rough outline to approach your end result. Step 1: Since your main aim is to identify objects from the background and then classify them into three categories. You can initially implement a Haar Cascade classifier to identify the object from different backgrounds. This might take some work in regard to creation of training set. But you can always crop out a few samples from the trash data set. Step2: After applying the trained Haar Cascade Classifier on you real-world images it will return the images containing trash, and sometimes it may return the background too. You can classify the images using a normal CNN network . This is light enough to be implement on low end hardware.
