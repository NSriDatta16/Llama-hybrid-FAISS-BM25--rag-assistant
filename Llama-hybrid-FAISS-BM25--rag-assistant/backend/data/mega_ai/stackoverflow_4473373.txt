[IOS SDK]- touchesBegan with specific object?

When I touch anywhere on screen touchesBegan event triggered. but I couldn't manage how if I touch specific object as like UIImageView? -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView: touch.view]; imageView.center = location; } -(void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; }
