bounding reciprocal of a number

I have met several cases where people computing reciprocal of a number with very small absolute value. They say the result should be upper bounded, since the reciprocal is very big. (1) I wonder about the reason why is that? e.g. in page 18 of this paper http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ftp/boost.ps , the first paragraph, the reciprocal of a probability is computed. The author said "Since this number can get large if p is small, threshold this ratio at zmax" and a upper bound in [2,4] would be fine. I wonder if it is because the precision is huge when the reciprocal is huge, but bounding by a value in [2,4] does not mean the value for the reciprocal is huge? Another example, which is in my previous post about inverse-distance-weighted interpolation, inverse distance weighting interpolation , do we have to lower bound the distance before taking its reciprocal, or just only deal with the case when the distance is exactly 0? (2) If the number has absolute value very large so that its reciprocal is very close to 0, do we have to lower bound the reciprocal? (3) If we indeed have to upper bound the reciprocal of a number, which way is better, lower bounding the number or upper bounding its reciprocal? Thanks and regards!
