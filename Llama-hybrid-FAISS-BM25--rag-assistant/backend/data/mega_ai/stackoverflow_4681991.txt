Provide new references for static blocks in Magento layout

I want to display a carousel and two banners at the top of each page content of my site. I’ve created a custom reference starting from the footer block in page.xml. So this is what it looks like: Page Top Content topcontent-container Then I created a topcontent.phtml file where I put getChildHtml('topcontentContainer') ?> getChildHtml('topcontentCarousel') ?> getChildHtml('topcontentLeft') ?> getChildHtml('topcontentRight') ?> I have my carousel displayed correctly, but when I try to put a block in topcontentLeft or topcontentRight, it is not displayed ad all. I think I’m doing something wrong with the block type parameter, but I can’t figure out what: can someone provide me some help? Thanks.
