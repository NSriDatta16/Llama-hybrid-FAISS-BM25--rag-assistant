The average precision directly emphasizes the ability to distinguish between positive and negative examples, whereas area under the precision recall curve (auc) gives an overall measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. The average precision score would be more suitable when dealing with imbalanced datasets as it focuses on the positive class being predicted, which is usually the one of interest in an imbalanced scenario. Auc considers both the positive and negative class, which wouldn't helpful if the negative class is significantly larger.
