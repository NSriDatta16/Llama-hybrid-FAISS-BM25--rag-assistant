For something that will actually work on the iPhone, try texture combiners . I used them to mask an RGBA texture against another, transformed alpha texture. This was for generating a complicated shadow in the absence of a stencil buffer, but your situation doesn't seem so different. Note that this link explains combiners in terms of fragment shaders, which works well. Unfortunately the combiners are more complicated than their shader counterparts.
