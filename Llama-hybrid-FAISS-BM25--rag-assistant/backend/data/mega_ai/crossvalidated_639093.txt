Before one thinks about "tests", try drawing a graph. It's pretty obvious that more aphids are dead in the dishes with more aphids at the start, so I'd look at the proportion of aphids that were dead in each dish. And I'd take the average number of aphids over each experiment. That gives me these numbers for the proportion dead in each group of experiments time 4 aphid 8 aphid 16 aphid 32 aphid 2 hr 0.43 0.25 0.20 0.21 18hr 0.61 0.54 0.54 0.53 Then I drew a bar chart. Excel is good at drawing them, or you can do it by hand. You don't need tests and p-values to immediately notice that the bars for 8,16, and 32 are pretty much the same. It seems clear that the lacewing kills about 1/5 to 1/4 of the aphids in 2 hours and about 1/2 the aphids in 18 hours, regardless of how many there are. It seems that it kills a slightly greater proportion when the supply is low (but the numbers are so small that it is unlikely to be significant) Doubtless R could do this same graph, but the benefit of R is when you have lots of data, because computers are fast. The danger of R is that you can throw "tests" at your data without thinking. Slowing down and graphing the data can give you time to think about what you are actually interested in, and then whether doing a formal hypothesis test is necessary. It can also slow you down, and notice any inconsistencies in the data. I noticed that in the second experiment with 4 aphids, there were 2 dead aphids after 2 hours, but only 1 dead aphid after 18 ... something odd!
