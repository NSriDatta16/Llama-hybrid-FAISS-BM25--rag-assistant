Since you tagged this question with the join tag, you probably know you need to write a join query to get what you need. "> " id=" "> "> I also made some small changes - I use the optionNamesID in the select and label tag names - I don't know how you knew previously which select belonged to which option. I also assumed that categoryID and productID came from somewhere, since it's not specified in the code. Pushing all the rows to an array at the beginning is optional, but it makes the code a bit more organized (since you can check ahead in the array to see where to close the select tags). NOTICE - this code is untested so there could some minor typos. Please make the needed corrections if necessary.
