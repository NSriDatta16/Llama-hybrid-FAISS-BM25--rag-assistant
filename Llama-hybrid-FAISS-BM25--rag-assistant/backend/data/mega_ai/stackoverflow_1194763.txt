ADO.NET Whitespace padding problem

I've switched from LINQ to SQL to ADO.NET (with MSSQL) because of a problem I described earlier , but I also ran into a weird problem using ADO.NET. I import data from an excel worksheet using excel interop and I place its contents to the database. I trim everything that gets inserted, so this is not (supposed to be) the source of the problem. When I view the contents of the table using DataGridView, what I see is that every cell has got loads of whitespaces after the text they contain. Screenshot below. alt text http://shadow.crysis.hu/so_adonet_whitespaces.png I used Google to find a solution, but the only usable result I found was to SET ANSI_PADDING OFF GO I did it (so I set ANSI_PADDING OFF before I began to import and set it back ON when I was done), but nothing changed. Oh, I'm using NCHAR(255) as field type. If I trim the contents I display in the datagridview, it's fine, but if possible, I'd like to avoid this overhead (after all, I have to loop over ALL the rows and columns displayed, and since I'm working with a lot of data - a few thousand rows - it's not the best solution). What should I do? Thank you very much in advance!
