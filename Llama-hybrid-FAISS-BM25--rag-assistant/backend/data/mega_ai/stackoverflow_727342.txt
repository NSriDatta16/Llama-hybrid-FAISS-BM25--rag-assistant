Component for "priority table" in JSF?

In a certain page of our JSF application, the user sees a table listing many objects, which we will call "jobs". Let's say each job has a priority, which is nothing but a number, and in this screen the user is able to edit the priorities of the jobs. However, two jobs can't have the same priority number. For this reason, I'm finding it hard to build an appropriate UI to deal with setting the priorities. We tried a simple editbox in the beginning, but it soon became clear that it sucked: if the user wanted to lower the priority of a job from 100 to 50, he would have to manually "make room for that job" by adding 1 to jobs 50 to 99. Now I'm thinking about a table in which the user could drag & drop the rows to visually adjust priority, without ever having to fiddle with priority numbers (in fact never seeing them), but I can't find such component. Does anybody know of such component or have any better UI suggestion?
