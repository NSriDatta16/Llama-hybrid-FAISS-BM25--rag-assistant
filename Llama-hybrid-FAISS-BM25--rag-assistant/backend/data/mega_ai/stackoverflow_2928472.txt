I think this question has two distinct parts. Technical: as it is a pure static site with no dynamic content, the translations will be provided in static pages as well. If you're running Apache, the mod_mime module lets you add language suffixes to file names, so that you might have mypage.html.en, mypage.html.fr, etc. - cf: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_mime.html . Other web servers might offer similar options. Organisational: the workflow for website translation is a totally different matter; a Wiki or CMS might be helpful here, but they are at least difficult to realise with pure static pages. If language string bundles, resource files and the like are of any help, depends on your content, and in most cases will require to create pages dynamically. Which workflow you can support and maintain, largely depends on your (your organisations) capacity to handle it. In my opinion, this problem deserves a more thorough analysis to get a satisfactory solution.
