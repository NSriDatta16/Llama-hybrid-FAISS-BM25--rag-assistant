Newbie questions about COM

I am quite new to COM so the question may seem naive. Q1. About Windows DLL Based on my understanding, a Windows DLL can export functions, types(classes) and global variables. Is this understanding all right? Q2. About COM My naive understanding is that: a COM DLL seems to be just a new logical way to organize the functions and types exported by a standard Windows DLL. A COM DLL exports both functions such as DllRegisterServer() and DllGetClassObject() , and also the Classes which implements the IUnknown interface. Is this understanding all right? Q3. *.def & *.idl *.def is used to define the functions exported by a Windows DLL in the traditional way, such as DllGetClassObject() . *.idl is used to define the interface implemented by a COM coclass. Thanks in advance.
