@COOLSerdash pointed to a source (reading) that describes the phenomenon. After some other readings in here and here , I learnt about the Anderson-Rubin scores, which give uncorrelated scores. As my concern was multicollinearity among components in my post pca estimations (i.e. regressions), I applied them with R (couldn't see them in Stata). I used the principal R function, requiring for 3 factors, varimax rotation, and afterwards I estimated factor scores with the Anderson method: x1=principal(df, nfactors=3, rotate="varimax") f1=factor.scores(df, x1, method="Anderson") Hope it can be helpful.
