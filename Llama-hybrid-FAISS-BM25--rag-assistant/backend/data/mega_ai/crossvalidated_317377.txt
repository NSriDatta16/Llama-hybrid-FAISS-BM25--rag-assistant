Other name for "Parameter"?

I am currently writing up a statistical part of a report. In the field where I am from a "parameter" would refer to what is known as the "independent variable" or "predictor" in statistics (that is $x_{1}$ below). To avoid confusion I was wondering if the "parameter" in statistics ($\beta$ right ??) had another name I could use ? I was thinking of "coefficient" but I want to make sure it doesn't have another specific meaning in statistics. At the start of the section I will add a paragraph explaining the correspondence in terminology. I hope this will keep the report rigorous whilst still understandable for people with no background in statistics. $y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1}$
