Distance Estimation from Signal Level?

So, I want to learn about machine learning and apply it to my project. I have set of data which includes position of a car and unknown emitter signal level. I have to estimate the distance based on this. Basically signal levels varies inversely to the square of distance. But when we include stuff like multipath,reflections etc we need to use a diff equation. Here come the Hata Okumura Model which can give us the path loss based on distance. However , the distance is unknown as I dont know where the emitter is. I only have access to different lat/long sets and the received signal level. What I am asking is could you guys please guide me to techniques which would help me estimate the distance based on current pos and signal strength. I will look into it further.
