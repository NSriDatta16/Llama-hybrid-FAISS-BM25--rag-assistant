What's inelegant about doing the steps you want to do? If you want to change something's position within a List (which is a vector style collection) then what you want to do is insert it at the new position and remove it from the old. Precisely what you are complaining about having to do. If it really upsets you then write an extension method: public static void MoveIndex (this List list, int srcIdx, int destIdx) { if(srcIdx != destIdx) { list.Insert(destIdx, list[srcIdx]); list.RemoveAt(destIdx Edit: Oh, you just want to swap? Simpler (and more efficient) still: public static void SwapItems (this List list, int idxX, int idxY) { if(idxX != idxY) { T tmp = list[idxX]; list[idxX] = list[idxY]; list[idxY] = tmp; } }
