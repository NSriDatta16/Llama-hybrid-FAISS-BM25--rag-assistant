Don't view the HTML as "formatting", but as structure, and save all of it to a resource data store (such as resx, or a database, or xml files or something). Then you can stop worrying about little bits of text inside a paragraph. Instead, you'll have some reference to a resource called "paragraph_energized_with_coffee" or something, per locale, and whatever software you use to edit the resources will determine what flexibility editors have in structuring the html inside each resource.
