The MVVM Light Toolkit is a set of components helping people to get started with the Model - View - ViewModel pattern in Silverlight, WPF, Xamarin, .NET Core and Windows Phone. It is a light and pragmatic framework that contains only the essential components needed. The main purpose of the toolkit is to accelerate the creation and development of MVVM applications in WPF, Xamarin, .NET Core, Silverlight and Windows Phone. Like other MVVM implementations, the toolkit helps users to separate the View from the Model which creates applications that are cleaner and easier to maintain and to extend. It also creates testable applications and allows to have a much thinner user interface layer (which is more difficult to test automatically). More information about the MVVM Light Toolkit can be found on http://www.galasoft.ch/mvvm . Currently there are versions for .Net 4.5, 4 & 3.5 and a portable version as well.
