Further to Robert's answer , the following line of (Java) code fixes this problem, in that it prevents Excel from hanging: response.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=\"" + filename + "\""); [NB 'response' is an HttpServletResponse] However, it forces the spreadsheet to be loaded into an Excel window rather than being displayed in the IFrame... Update: Resetting the URL of the IFrame to blank forces the Excel instance to be disposed and fixes this problem (without requiring the Content-Disposition change).
