Using Random Forest Variable Importance to train SVM models (R)

I have trained a Random Forest model in R with the caret package but the results are not very promising. I have decided to try with SVM models but I have a great dilemma: Would it be acceptable to use the "ranking" of important variables given by the Random Forest model ( varImp function) to train SVM models with different number of predictors (based on this ranking)? I supose that this Variable Importance is specific to the Random Forest model but I would like to know if it would make sense to apply this ranking to other models like SVM.
