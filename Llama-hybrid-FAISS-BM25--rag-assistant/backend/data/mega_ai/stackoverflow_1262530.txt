Where to put Application scope components in Winforms?

Where do you store application scoped components in your winforms apps? I see that I can create a descendant of Component in my application. I could then drag and drop the components that I want to share among the forms in my project. Is this the best practice for shared access to components (non-visual controls)? In Delphi, we had a DataModule. A DataModule was a simple design surface that functioned as a container for non-visual components. I would drag and drop Data Access objects onto this surface and access them from all forms. It provided a nice central location and cache for my data objects. How are you guys doing this in Winforms?
