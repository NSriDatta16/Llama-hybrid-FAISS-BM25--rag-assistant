According to this article: http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2009/01/01/windows-workflow-changes-direction.aspx Windows Workflow Foundation 4.0 is a "bottom-up rewrite with entirely new thinking...WF 3.0/3.5 will remain part of the framework and will run side by side with WF 4.0. This lets you manage the transition at a time that fits your organization's broader goals." ...which is code for, "We know we just screwed up your programming model, but we have a long term strategy, so we hope you will forgive us." The article goes on to say that The gains are enormous: custom activities take center stage, and authoring them is much simpler; workflows are entirely declarative; and there are three workflow flow styles that you can combine seamlessly. It's possible that you could see a 10-fold improvement in the time required to create and debug workflows, in addition to 10- to 100-fold runtime performance improvements. The change is not without its detractors. In this article at DotNetKicks , the author states that "Microsoft is seriously damaging the Dot Net developer community and adoption in the industry with these half baked product releases and abrupt about-faces after shipping." Which is why I generally wait for the 2.0 or 3.0 version of Microsoft technologies, although I made an exception for ASP.NET MVC.
