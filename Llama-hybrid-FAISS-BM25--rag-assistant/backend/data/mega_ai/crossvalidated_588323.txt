Does this study design lend itself to a logistic regression?

I have a cohort comprising of individuals who participate in a weight-loss program and their weight measurements are collected longitudinally for 12 months (not necessarily at the same time points). Their characteristics at baseline are also collected. Over the 12 months individuals can have multiple visits as part of the program, and the research question is whether the total number of visits after 12 months is related to achieving a meaningful outcome. The dichotomous outcome is defined as whether an individual's 12 month weight is at least 5% lower than the baseline weight. My question is whether this study design lends itself to a logistic regression, because the exposure - i.e. total number of visits - is time-varying within that 12 months. Some could spread out their number of visits over the 12 months or complete them within a few weeks. In a case-control study, where the selection is based on outcome and information is collected retrospectively to look at exposure, there is no explicit need to look at when in that look-back period the exposure takes place. This leads me to believe that the study design above can be appropriately addressed with a logistic regression. Looking for additional thoughts in case I missed anything.
