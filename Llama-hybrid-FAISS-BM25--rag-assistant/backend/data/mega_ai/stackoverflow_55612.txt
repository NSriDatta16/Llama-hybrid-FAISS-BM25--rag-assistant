CSS to select/style first word

This one has me kind of stumped. I want to make the first word of all the paragraphs in my #content div at 14pt instead of the default for the paragraphs (12pt). Is there a way to do this in straight CSS or am I left wrapping the first word in a span to accomplish this?
