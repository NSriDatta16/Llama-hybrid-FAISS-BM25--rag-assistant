Disclaimer: I do not know the details about the panel version of the Newey-West standard errors and their implementation in Stata. The references I give below are for time series data (without panels) but hopefully these take you a step further. In the classic Newey & West (1987, Econometrica ) paper, they only consider the growth rate of this lag length parameter. Some implementations do use lag selection heuristics based on this growth rate, though. A proper nonparametric lag selection procedure is introduced Newey & West (1994, Review of Economic Studies ). Alternatively, there are parametric bandwidth selection procedures (based on AR(1) or ARMA(1,1) approximations) that can also be employed - suggested by Andrews (1991, Econometrica ) and refined by Andrews & Monahan (1992, Econometrica ).
