To be able to do this you can't use the built-in accept option because that will not trigger the drop event for the current droppable if the draggable is not accepter, and will therefor propagate into the parent droppable. So the best way is to implement your own accept check, which is fairly simple: $('#foo').droppable({ drop: function(e){ console.log(e); } }); var accepted = '#red'; $('#bar').droppable({ greedy: true, drop: function(e,ui){ if (!$(ui.draggable).is(accepted)) { return false; } console.log(e.target); } }); You can see how the above works on jsFiddle .
