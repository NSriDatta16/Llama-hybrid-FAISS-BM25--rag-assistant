It would be a good idea to do a semi-deep dive into logistic regression before proceeding. There are many textbooks and online resources. Logistic regression is not a classifier but is a direct probability model. Odds ratios do not provide relative likelihoods of an event. Standardizing by standard deviations is not a good idea, and "standardized" odds ratios don't have a good interpretation. Even more important, they have a hidden linearity assumption. Percent change is not a good change measure because of asymmetry.
