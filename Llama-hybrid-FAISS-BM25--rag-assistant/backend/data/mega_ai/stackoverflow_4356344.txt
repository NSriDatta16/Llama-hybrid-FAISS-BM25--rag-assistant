You can use the table view delegate's scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation: method. This is because a UITableView is a subclass of UIScrollView and UITableViewDelegate conforms to UIScrollViewDelegate . In other words, a table view is a scroll view, and a table view delegate is also a scroll view delegate. So, create a scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation: method in your table view delegate and deselect the cell in that method. See the reference documentation for UIScrollViewDelegate for information on the scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation: method.
