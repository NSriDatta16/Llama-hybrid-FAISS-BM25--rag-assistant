What are good Bipartite Graphs Algorithms?

Currently, I have a dataset with pairs . The idea is to detect any anomaly in these relationships . I was able to just use pandas to do the analysis so far. |Customer|Agent|Duration|Marks|etc |C1..............| A1......| 2hrs.......|23 | As an example above, you can project the bipartite nodes into Agent nodes. You get a normal graph then. All Agents which share a common Customer, form cliques, which you can easily get just using pandas operations in the original graph. Other than this, is there any worthwhile algorithms to run ? Or any links will be appreciated as well. Btw, I have good experience working with many unipartite graphs (normal), where I have run many types of algorithms (centrality measures, clique/communities, connected components etc) and social network analysis. Edit : Just to confirm, my question is not to get the subgraph or write any new algorithms. I am just going to be using Networkx to achieve this. However, I am stuck at what are the analytics possibilities with bipartite graphs ? Edit : I am digging through the web. And add the resources here, as I find them. Once I find something useful, I will add a solution to my question. http://www.appstate.edu/~hirsthp/talks/SocialNetworks/intro-to-graphs.pdf Networkx - Lists all bipartite graph algorithms
