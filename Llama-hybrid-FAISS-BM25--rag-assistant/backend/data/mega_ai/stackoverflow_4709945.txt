Treeview drag and drop with a gtk CellRenderer in python

When extending a gtk cell renderer such as gtk.CellRendererPixbuf in python, what needs to be done to make sure drag and drop works? Drag and drop works for gtk.CellRendererText but not for my custom CellRender where I have extended gtk.CellRendererPixbuf .
