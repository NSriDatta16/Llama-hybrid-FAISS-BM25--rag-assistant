I would say that the property should be named aptly, and that the term Flags characterises the property rather than describing it. Flag or Flags | There is no replacement term. Do not use. For instance, Flags is generally used with enumerations (that are decorated with the appropriate attribute) and we certainly don't need to explicitly state so within the name / identifier of a property: [Flags] enum StorageMode { None = 0, Next = 1, ... Last = 32 } class StorableItem { public StorageMode StorageMode { get; set; } } But, in your case, I get the feeling that whatever is named, or contains within its name, Flags , isn't actually a set of flags in the above sense - which just brings up another reason as to why to avoid it.
