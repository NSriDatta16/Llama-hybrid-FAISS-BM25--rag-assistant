How do you define a generic tree for such cases? I wouldn't try to in the first place. If what I wanted to model was: I have a list of documents A document has a list of paragraphs A paragraph has a list of words then why do you need generic nodes at all? Make a class Paragraph that has a List , make a class Document that has a List , and then make a List and you're done. Why do you need to artificially impose a generic tree structure? What benefit does that buy you?
