It would look more like this: avg_num_votes = Count(votes)/Count(items with at least 1 vote) avg_rating = Sum(votes)/Count(items with at least 1 vote) this_num_votes = Count(votes for this item) this_rating = Sum(votes for this item)/Count(votes for this item) If you are using a simple +/- system, Sum(votes) = Count(positive votes) (ie. treat + as 1, - as 0) See also: Bayesian average .
