To do this discounting rounding you could do: Convert.ToInt64(Math.Floor(Convert.ToDouble(value))); If you need to round you could replace Math.Floor with Math.Round . Edit: Since you mentioned in a comment that you'll be rounding: Convert.ToInt64(Math.Round(Convert.ToDouble(value))); If you have to worry about localization/globalization then as @xls said you should apply a CultureInfo in the conversions. Edit 2: Alternative method using a string function (not terribly elegant IMO - maybe it could be elegantized with a predicate function): Convert.ToInt64(value.Substring(0, value.IndexOf('.') > 0 ? value.IndexOf('.') : value.Length));
