Unfortunately, as far as I know, there is currently no accepted way to estimate repeatability using a zero-inflated model. This is because of the two different distributions being fitted to the data which (I'm assuming) makes it very difficult to estimate the total variance in the data. However, you can estimate repeatability using a Poisson error distribution as you suggested. The details for this are best found in Nakagawa & Schielzeth 2010 (Repeatability for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data, Biol Reviews). They detail the equations you need to estimate the residual variance for Poisson (or count) data. The key will be to determine whether your model estimates the overdispersion as additive or multiplicative - this changes how to estimate the residual. I'm not sure what glmmADMB uses but I know that MCMCglmm uses additive overdispersion and glmmPQL uses multiplicative overdispersion (and you can fit mixed effect poisson models with both). Nakagawa & Shielzeth did create a R package for estimating repeatability (rptR) associated with the paper, but as far as I can remember it doesn't handle other fixed or random effects and I don't think it has been updated lately (hence I haven't used it in several years). However, if you can get the code from the package, maybe that would be helpful?
