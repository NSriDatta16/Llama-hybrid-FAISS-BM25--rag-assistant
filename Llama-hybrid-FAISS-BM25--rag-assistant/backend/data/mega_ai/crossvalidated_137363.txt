Allowing for resets in an accumulating time series

I am extracting data from IP21 (a sensor historian logging system). This is a weightometer weighing material moving over a conveyer belt I need to calculate hourly differences/increases from an accumulating figure I can get these aggregated hourly measurements from my dataset: Minimum Maximum Average Standard Deviation Variance Assuming the accumulating figure never resets, I can find the hourly change as Maximum-Minimum and this the incremental weight that has moved over the conveyer belt However if the accumulating figure does reset in the middle of the hourly period, I will know only these things: Minimum = 0 Maximum = last reading before reset Average Standard Deviation Variance Can I work out the true incremental change from these figures? If I had the last and first reading for the period (which I can actually get but it complicates things) then I could use this: If Minimum = 0 Added Weight = (Maximum - start period value) + end period value else Added Weight = (Maximum - Minimum) But I want to know if I can work it out from Min, Max, Avg, Std Dev, Var, or perhaps approximate it
