Here's your answer: Your 'details' field is defined as 'string'. In Solr, it means it's indexed as a single literal token. The 'string' type is usually used for identifiers. Therefore, your query 'details:Server' would ONLY match the documents where 'details' exactly equals 'Server', and NOT the document where 'details' contains 'Server'. Change your 'details' field to something that will index your text as separate words (tokens): And re-index everything. You might also want to review your other fields definitions. I encourage you to read the default type definitions in your schema.xml.
