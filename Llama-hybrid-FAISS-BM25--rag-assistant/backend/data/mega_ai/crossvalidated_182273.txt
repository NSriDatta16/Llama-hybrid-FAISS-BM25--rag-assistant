Interpreting Mediation Output when Direct Effect is not Stat. Sig but ACME and Total are

The mediation package in R returns results in which: Average Direct Effect (ADE) (the unmediated effect) is not statistically significant The Average Causal Mediated Effect (ACME) (the effect of the mediator alone) is positive and statistically significant The Total Effect (ADE+ACME) is larger than the ADE and ACME alone, positive and statistically significant Does this indicate that the variable being mediated can only act through the mediator DV? I'm not quite certain as to how this would be interpreted. Thank you for any help.
