Exploratory data analysis - Feature influence on outcome

Am new to data science. In my dataset, I have 100+ features in our dataset of 2000 rows. I guess using all this 100+ features will overfit. So, before I build ML model, I would like to only select important features and exclude noisy (useless) features that don't have any impact on outcome. So, as a biz user, I want to showcase this approach to biz users from sales team. So, can you share with me the list of feature selection methods? Is there any specific method that you would suggest for easy interpretability to the biz users?
