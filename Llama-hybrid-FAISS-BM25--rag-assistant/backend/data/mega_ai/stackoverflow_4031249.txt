Dll Memory Management

I have few doubts regarding how windows manages a .dll's memory. when .dll's are loaded into the host process, how is the memory managed? Does .dll get access to the entire memory available to the host process or just a portion of it? i.e is there a limitation when memory is allocated by a function inside the .dll? Will STL classes like string, vector (dynamically increasing storage) etc used by the dll, work without issue here?
