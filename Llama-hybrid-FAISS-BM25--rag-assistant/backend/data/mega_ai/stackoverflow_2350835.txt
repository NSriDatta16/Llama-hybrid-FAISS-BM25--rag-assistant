"The operation could not be completed" Error when saving a file, in many projects

I am getting this annoying problem, whenever i do some changes to any file in any of my many projects and try to save the file, i get the error "The operation could not be completed"!!!! it only has an "OK" button, clicking that button will open a "Save As" dialog to save the file into a different location. most of the time, after trying with different approaches (click CTRL+S, open File-> Save, open File-> Save All, or closing the windows and clicking "Save" when being asked to save), it works, but usually that takes 2-3 tries in average per change (a developer has a finger glued to CTRL+S). i disabled all add ins, actually i only have JustCode. i restarted the machine, nothing worked. anyone can help please? BTW: i have VS.NET 2005 Team Suite SP2, Windows 7 Ultimate, and the problem happens in all types of projects (WEB, Windows Service, SQL, anything).
