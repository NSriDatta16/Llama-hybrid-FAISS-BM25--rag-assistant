What you are trying to do is what I call a "configurable bundle." The base bundle product would be a case with 12 bottles. You can then configure the bottles within the bundle. There isn't a way to do this with Magento proper. In my former position we tried doing this with custom apparel. The base bundle product would be a blank shirt. You would then try to configure the shirt with screen printing, embroidery, etc. We ended up creating/managing a custom object within the cart. We then had to write some custom pricing logic for the cart. I know that this feature has been talked about for quite some time.
