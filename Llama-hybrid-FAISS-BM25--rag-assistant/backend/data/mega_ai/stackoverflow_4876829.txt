Azure Table Storage, WCF Service and Enum

Here's my problem. A class which defines an order has a property called PaymentStatus , which is an enum defined like so: public enum PaymentStatuses : int { OnDelivery = 1, Paid = 2, Processed = 3, Cleared = 4 } And later on, in the class itself, the property definition is very simple: public PaymentStatuses? PaymentStatus { get; set; } However, if I try to save an order to the Azure Table Storage, I get the following exception: System.InvalidOperationException: The type Order+PaymentStatuses' has no settable properties. At this point I thought using enum isn't possible, but a quick Google search returned this: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazure/thread/7eb1a2ca-6c1b-4440-b40e-012db98ccb0a This page lists two answers, one of which seems to ignore the problems and suggests that using an enum in Azure Storage is fine. Now, I don't NEED to store the enum in the Azure Table Storage as such, I could just as well store a corresponding int , however, I do need this property to be exposed in the WCF service. I've tried making the property use get and set to return the enum from a stored integer , and remove this property from Azure by using the WritingEntity event on my DataContext , but I get that exception before the event for this entity is fired. At this point, I'm at a loss, I don't know what else I can do to have this property in WCF as an enum , but have Azure store just the int .
