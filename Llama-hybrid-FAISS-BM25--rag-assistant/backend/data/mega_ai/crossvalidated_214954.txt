SVD is only defined for complete matrices. So if you stick to plain SVD you need to fill in these missing values before (SVD is not a imputing-algorithm per se). The errors you introduce will hopefully be cancelled out by your matrix-factorization approach (general assumption: data is generated by a low-rank model). Removing complete rows like you want to do is just bad. Even setting the missing values to zero would be better. There are many imputation strategies, but in this case, i would impute with the column-mean (or maybe row-mean). This is basically the strategy recommend in your 2nd link. Movie1 Movie2 Movie3 User1 5 4 User2 2 5 5 User3 3 4 User4 1 5 User5 5 1 5 becomes (column-mean; average score of movie) Movie1 Movie2 Movie3 User1 5 3 4 User2 2 5 5 User3 3 3 4 User4 1 3 5 User5 5 1 5 And one more remark: you should preprocess the data. At least subtract the mean from all values! Have a look at this introduction . It mensions the impute+SVD approach and also talks about a more direct modelling of missing values. But in this case, other algorithms are used.
