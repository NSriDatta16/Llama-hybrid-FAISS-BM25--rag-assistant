If you know approximately what the average will be (or, at least, that all pairs of numbers will have a max difference long.MaxValue ), you can calculate the average difference from that value instead. I take an example with low numbers, but it works equally well with large ones. // Let's say numbers cannot exceed 40. List numbers = new List () { 31 28 24 32 36 29 }; // Average: 30 List diffs = new List (); // This can probably be done more effectively in linq, but to show the idea: foreach(int number in numbers.Skip(1)) { diffs.Add(numbers.First()-number); } // diffs now contains { -3 -6 1 5 -2 } var avgDiff = diffs.Sum() / diffs.Count(); // the average is -1 // To get the average value, just add the average diff to the first value: var totalAverage = numbers.First()+avgDiff; You can of course implement this in some way that makes it easier to reuse, for example as an extension method to IEnumerable .
