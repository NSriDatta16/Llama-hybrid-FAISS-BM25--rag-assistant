JQuery star rating plugin - disable after vote submission

I'm using the JQuery star rating plugin (v2.61) from http://www.fyneworks.com/jquery/star-rating/ . Everything's going well, but I'd like to disable the stars when a user has voted. Currently my users select their rating and click the mouse. This updates my database through an AJAX call. The star rater changes to show the user's selection, with the stars displayed in red. However if the user rolls their mouse over the stars they are still active and they can submit another vote. I'm stopping this duplicate voting server side, but from a usability point of view I'd like the stars to be disabled after the user's click. (I guess I could reload the div or something with JQuery to show a read only version of the stars, but I was hoping there was some more elegant and simpler solution). Thanks.
