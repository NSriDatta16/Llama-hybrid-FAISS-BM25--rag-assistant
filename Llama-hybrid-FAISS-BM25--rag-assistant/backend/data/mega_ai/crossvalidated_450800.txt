I don't have Oakland's book, but I'd guess the text you quoted is meant to apply only to the discussion of runs (all above or below the mean) but not trends (all increasing or decreasing). I infer this based on the language of "risk of finding one point above the average..." in the quoted text. Also, there's substantial disagreement amongst SPC people about what is useful in SPC, so I'd be hesitant to generalize anything beyond "use Rule 1." Wheeler, for example, considers trend-based rules as problematic and criticizes them in his Advanced SPC book, but also in this article: https://www.spcpress.com/pdf/DJW322.Oct.17.Using%20Extra%20Detection%20Rules.pdf "Recommendation: The best modern practice is to completely avoid using Nelsonâ€™s rule three and all other runs-up-and-down tests as well. Rule one will get there first in most cases." If you really want to dig into why seven was chosen for the trend rule, you might have pull up Nelson's work from the 80s (see Wheeler's article), though I admittedly have never read those, so I can't be sure if he has theoretical explanations for the rules. Also, Nelson chose six instead of seven, so you'd have to figure out why Oakland decided to increase the number by 1. Finally, my experience has been that experienced SPC practioners generally do not refer to anything as "statistically significant" in SPC applications, though that could be a function of those I've encountered. If a point is unusual, it's "out of control" not "statistically significant."
