Finding the Average from a list of numbers in Java

This is my first attempt at java problem I have been given as part of my Programming assignment. I must make a program which calculates the average of a list of numbers that a user enters. the data enty should be terminated when 0 is entered. my problem is with this "ALL NEGATIVE NUMBERS SHOULD BE IGNORED" for some reason the following code does not work, when I enter a negative number it should be ignored but for some reason it terminates the data enty import java.util.*; class Task_8 { public static void main() { Scanner inputLine = new Scanner(System.in); float row, numberentered, numbersum = 0, negativenumber = 0; double result, count = 0; System.out.println ("Welcome to Task 8 of 10 of my Programming Assignment... Nearly There!"); System.out.println ("_____________________________________________________________________"); System.out.println (); System.out.println ("Enter as many numbers as you like and this program will tell you the arithmatic mean"); System.out.println ("Terminate data entry by entering 0"); do{ System.out.print ("Please enter a number: "); numberentered = inputLine.nextInt(); count++; if (numberentered any Ideas guys? Thank you
