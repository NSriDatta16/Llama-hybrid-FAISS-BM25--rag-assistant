Algorithms and tools for ranking text as a job description

We're working on a ranking texts by degree of the similarity to vacancies. We have 4-year data set (≈1M texts) of custom search feeds from social network. We also have vacancies (≈30K) manually selected from this set. Now the vacancies are selected in 2 stages: We make several specific search queries (i.e. "need translator") on the social network by API, receiving and combining the search feeds into one. Then we look through each post in it for real vacancies. Generally, it should contain a request for interpreter services. Often it contains some job details (such as a place, salary, subject, deadlines, languages, contacts) and stylistic features of speech (i.e. greetings, exclamations, request to write in private, ask for recommendations, etc.). Before the point 2, we would like to have first in our final moderation feed the texts, that are most likely to be vacancies. We're going to try ranking by using the Naive Bayes classifier or the Natural Language Processing, but it's not as simple as it seems: there are a lot of various tools, schemes, models. The question is, what algorithms and tools could help in our case? What we should pay attention to?
