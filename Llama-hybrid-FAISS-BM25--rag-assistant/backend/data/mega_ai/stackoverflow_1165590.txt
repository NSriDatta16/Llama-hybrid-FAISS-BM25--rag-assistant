What you are doing is correct. Look at the following example: mysql> create table baz (data TEXT); Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.20 sec) mysql> insert into baz (data) values ("Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal"); Query OK, 1 row affected (0.06 sec) mysql> select data from baz\G *************************** 1. row *************************** data: Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal 1 row in set (0.00 sec) If you don't see any "data", then it means the field is empty, or contains only whitespace. EDIT: If you're seeing "boxes" as you state in your comment, then it could be a character encoding mismatch, or possibly you have binary data in your TEXT field. Please provide the output from the following: SHOW CREATE TABLE foo; SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'character_set%'; SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'collation%';
