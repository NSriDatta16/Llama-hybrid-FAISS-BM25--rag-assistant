Detecting Windows 7 with Google Analytics

This question might belong on one of the other trilogies, but it sorta seemed to be the best place. I have google analytics set up, but it doesn't seem to detect Windows 7. I'm on Win7 myself, so I know there should be at least some number of Win7-users. The user agent for Win7 is NT 6.1, and google analytics have detected NT users, but I'm not sure if that's a coincidence or not... Any ideas?
