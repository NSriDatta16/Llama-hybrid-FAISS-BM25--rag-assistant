Accessing a git repository via ssh behind a firewall

I would like to access (clone/push/pull) a private (via ssh) git repository while behind a corporate firewall that only allows http proxy access. I have written a robust Java (daemon) program (based on the JSCh class library) that will allow me to leverage local and remote port forwarding and I am hoping to leverage this but my brain hurts when I try to envision how to set this up. The git repo depot (to coin a phrase) is at foo.server.com/var/git so the natural inclination, ignoring the fireall, to set up a clone would be: $ git clone ssh://foo.server.com/var/git/myrepo.git but the firewall will block this command. I'm inclined to try something like $ git clone ssh://localhost:8022/var/git/myrepo.git where localhost:8022 is forwarded to foo.server.com:22 So is this path worth pursuing? Is there any easier solution that is still secure? Are there pitfalls or gotchas I should be aware of?
