Having looked deeper into the code and probed it a bit, it seems like the problem is not related to the storage of the intervals in el.data. The intervals are stored just fine. I suspect the problem is related to routines that are executing in the wrong order in the code. The correct order should be: Load a chunk of HTML-content (images) using jQuery's load(). Calculate the total width of all these elements. Start the interval that scrolls these imags. The problem seems to be that the routine that calculates the total width of all the elements is triggered before/at the same time as the content is loaded through AJAX using jQuery load. The result is that the calculated total width of the the loaded elements is 0 (zero) and the scrolling routine grinds to a halt since there's no point in scrolling something that has a width of zero.
