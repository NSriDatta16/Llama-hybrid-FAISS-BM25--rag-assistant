git:// protocol blocked by company, how can I get around that?

Attempting something like git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git will not work, it results in: Initialized empty Git repository in /home/robert/node/.git/ github.com[0: 207.97.227.239]: errno=Connection timed out fatal: unable to connect a socket (Connection timed out) However, cloning over HTTP works fine. So far I've gathered that it's a problem with the protocol, but I'm trying to install cloud9 which is requiring the command git submodule update --init --recursive which is trying to use the git:// protocol and failing. Is there a way to change how that command will work or something?
