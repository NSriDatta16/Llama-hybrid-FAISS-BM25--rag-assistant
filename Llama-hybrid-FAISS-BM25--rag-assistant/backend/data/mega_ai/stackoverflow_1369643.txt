WPF Error Styles only being rendered properly on visible tab of a tab control

I have a data object used to contain my UI data that supports INotifyPropertyChanged and IDataErrorInfo . Originally I had all of the UI controls displaying in one big WPF application and was happily seeing errors flagged via this custom style: I was reorganizing the program today and decided to distribute the various UI controls over several pages of a TabControl . The structure layout I am using for this is: [.. various Stack Panels, Groups and UI controls moved from original layout ..] [.. various Stack Panels, Groups and UI controls moved from original layout ..] ... (I am using the AdornerDecorator as I had experienced in a previous program the error style not being re-rendered when swapping tab pages. I can't remember where I saw this but it did help me out.) Now when I start my program the error style correctly renders on the TabItem that is open when the program starts, but does not correctly render on the other (hidden) TabItem s. When I select (and reveal) one of those TabItem s the tool-tip of the error style is set, but the error icon image is not displayed. I also tested removing the custom style and revert back to the default WPF error style for textboxes and I still get a similar behaviour, i.e. no red box around the control on the TabItem s that are hidden when the program opens. So it seems that I am totally missing something that is stopping the error styles from correctly rendering on other than the open tab Item. Any ideas? Edit Sep 3 Changed description to support a better understanding of what I have seen Talk about Déjà vu in 2014 It's November 2014 and today I had this stupid WPF problem with error templates not showing up on items presented in a tab controller. Something in the back of my mind suggests that I have seen this problem before. So I google, and the first thing that pops up is my own question from 2009! This time I see the comment from dkl which was added after I solved things the last time around. So I tried it his way and used this solution (which worked well and I didn't need to sprinkle an Adorner control over my tab controls): *
