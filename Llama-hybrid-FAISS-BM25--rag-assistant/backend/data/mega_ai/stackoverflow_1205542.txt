There is no good reason to write !false instead of true. Bad reasons could include obfuscation (making the code harder to read), personal preferences, badly considered global search-and-replace, and shenanigans converting boolean values to integers. It's possible that some confusion has been caused by the TRUE and FALSE definitions in Win32, which are not of bool type but ints, and which may trigger warnings when used in boolean statements. Mainly, anything non-zero is "true", but if you want to make sure that "true" is always one when using integers instead of booleans, you sometimes see shenanigans like this. It's still not a good reason ;-)
