Actor pool in scala

I have a project that is actor-based and for one part of it I must use some actors that receive message after that one actor assigns to each request separately and each actor is responsible for doing its message request, so I need something like a thread pool for actors of my project, are there any features in Scala that is useful for my necessity? I have another question: My project has a great amount of requests and also these requests must be done as soon as possible so I thought that an actor-pool is necessary for handling them, is there any feature in Scala that is related to my demand? tanks a lot for your attention!
