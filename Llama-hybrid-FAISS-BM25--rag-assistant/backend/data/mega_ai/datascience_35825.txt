In GANs you have to train some parameters, freeze them and train some other which this operation may occur multiple times. You can do the following sequence of operations. Specify all generator related variables inside their corresponding variable scope and after that access them using tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES, scope='my_scope') . After that, during training, you can pass these variables as the trainable parameters of your optimiser by setting the var_list of the minimize method. You can also take a look at here . If you want to get all the trainable variables, you can get all of them inside of a list using tf.trainable_variables method. Maybe it worth looking here for other aspects for freezing variables. You can also take a look at Hvass-Labs 's implementation of adversarial networks. Take a look at here too.
