If the HTML you're using XHTML compliant, you could load it as an XML document, and then use XPath/XSL - long winded but kind of elegant? An approach I used in the past is to use HTMLTidy to convert messy HTML to XHTML, and then use XSL/XPath for screen scraping content into a database, to create a reverse content management system. Regular expressions would do it, but could be complicated once you try stripping out tags, image names etc, to remove false positives.
