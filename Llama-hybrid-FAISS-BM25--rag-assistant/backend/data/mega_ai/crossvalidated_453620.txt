All this is explained in details in the book Modern Epidemiology by Sander Greenland. But forgive me for not being able to remember the details, the answers to your questions are: Yes. It's one way to calculate the overall odds ratio. Besides the logistic regression method, there's also the Mantel-Haenszel method, widely used before the age of computers. Logistic regression makes the assumption that the odds ratio in your two $Z$ groups are the same. If so, then it is the most efficient method, in the sense it reaches the Cramer-Rao bound asymptotically and is consistent. If not, then it is "wrong", but still approximates the population causal odds ratio, as you calculated (see some work by Greenland in the book). In the 2x2 case, perhaps an intuitive explanation is that they are both doing maximum likelihood?
