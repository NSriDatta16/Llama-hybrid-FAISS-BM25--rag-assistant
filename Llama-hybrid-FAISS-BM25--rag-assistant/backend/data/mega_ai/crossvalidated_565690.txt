Advice on improving the model fit of a mixed model on repeated measurements?

I've got repeated measurements data on an outcome including a total of 310 measurements (range in the amount of measurements per patient is 1-6) conducted in 149 patients. For all patients, clinical risk factors were measured once at baseline. For my analyses, I've modeled the association of all risk factors with change in the outcome, using a linear mixed model with age as time variable. Furthermore, the mixed models include a random intercept per patient and a continuous first order autoregressive correlation structure on residuals, and the natural log transformation of the outcome (as that was severely right skewed). My data looks as follows: # Load packages library(tidyverse) library(magrittr) library(nlme) library(broom.mixed) library(GLMMadaptive) # Get data. mydata The model that I have specified is as follows: model Given this model, the residual plot and QQ plot don't look all too good in my opinion. Specifically, residuals seem larger for smaller fitted values, and the tails of the QQ plot deviate from normality. The code to obtain the plots: # Get residuals and fitted values into 1 tibble. residuals % tibble(.) %>% rename("log_residuals"=".") %>% mutate(log_residuals=as.numeric(log_residuals)) fitted % tibble(.) %>% rename("log_fitted"=".") %>% mutate(log_fitted=as.numeric(log_fitted)) residuals_and_fitted % ggplot(aes(x=log_fitted, y=log_residuals)) + geom_point() + theme_classic() + geom_smooth(method="loess", formula=y~x, se=FALSE) + xlab("Fitted") + ylab("Normalized residuals") + labs(title="Residual plot") # Make a quantile-quantile plot. residuals_and_fitted %>% ggplot(aes(sample=log_residuals)) + stat_qq() + theme_classic() + labs(title="QQ plot") + ylab("Normalized residuals") + xlab("Theoretical") Which give the following two plots: The diagonal line that is present in the residual plot are patients with observed outcomes of 0. Therefore I thought the model fit might improve by specifying a hurdle model that includes a logistic regression for the dichotomous indicator that the outcome is zero or not, using GLMMadaptive::mixed_model. However, this model will not converge (and I don't understand the statistics well enough to undestand why). I tried making the model more simple by removing some fixed and/or random effects but it still wouldn't converge: zi_model Any thought on improving both the normality of residuals and/or how to further model the excess zeroes are greatly appreciated!
