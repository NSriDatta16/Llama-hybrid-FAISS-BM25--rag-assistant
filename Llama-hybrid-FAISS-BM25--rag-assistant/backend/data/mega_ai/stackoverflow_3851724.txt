What should be my first step in Agile programming? Read the 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto over here . Understand and try to make sense out of each one and implement them as simply as they are stated. Although agile principles can be adopted individually, it should be adopted on an organisation level or at least project level IMO. Urge your Team and your project to use SDLC methodologies which are more agile like Scrum for e.g. If you adopt Scrum properly you will automatically be agile. As for Agile programming - Pair program, configure a Continuous Integration and Build system, use Test Driven Development, pay continuous attention to code quality and design best practices by doing Code Reviews, design discussions and have high unit testing code coverage.
