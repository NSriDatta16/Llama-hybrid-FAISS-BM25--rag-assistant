Time series prediction using ARIMA

I have a dataset which contains data from a sensor for every 5 minutes and am trying to predict for example 10 future values based on the first 500 values. My data looks like the following and could be downloaded here : timestamp,value 2014-04-01 00:00:00,-21.0483826823 2014-04-01 00:05:00,-20.2954768676 2014-04-01 00:10:00,-18.127229468299998 2014-04-01 00:15:00,-20.1716653997 2014-04-01 00:20:00,-21.223761612 2014-04-01 00:25:00,-19.1044911334 I am taking the following steps: # Read data from file and create time series myData But when I print the prediction results they do not seem promising and model always converges to a single value: $pred Time Series: Start = 1396474800 End = 1396477500 Frequency = 0.00333333333333333 [1] 81.62789 81.62789 81.62789 81.62789 81.62789 81.62789 81.62789 81.62789 81.62789 81.62789 $se Time Series: Start = 1396474800 End = 1396477500 Frequency = 0.00333333333333333 [1] 7.136100 9.728122 11.762177 13.493007 15.025767 16.416032 17.697417 18.892088 20.015580 21.079276 And here is the summary of fit: > summary(fit) Series: z ARIMA(0,1,1) Coefficients: ma1 -0.0735 s.e. 0.0463 sigma^2 estimated as 50.92: log likelihood=-1688.17 AIC=3380.34 AICc=3380.37 BIC=3388.77 Training set error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set 0.2215984 7.121813 3.141386 1592726 1592732 0.07197436 0.001426353 This is my first day with R and I think I might be doing something wrong. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks
