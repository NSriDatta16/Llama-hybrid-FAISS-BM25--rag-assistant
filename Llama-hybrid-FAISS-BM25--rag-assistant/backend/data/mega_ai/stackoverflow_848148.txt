Looking for examples of simple web-based form designers

I have a requirement to implement a "simple" web-based form designer that allows "simple" users to create their own web-based forms. I've come across these things in rich clients, such as Outlook and Acrobat, but my requirements are much simpler and must be web-based. Pretty layout, custom validation, complex fields and types are simply not a factor. Ideally I would like to find something that is neat like this very SO question composer, in which I'm typing right now, plus the ability to drag a text input box or a checkbox right into the text. Output could be as crude as this: What is your name? [Fred Bloggs] Do you have an internet? [x] I'm using asp.net but the backend technology doesn't really matter as I fear this is all javascript! No need to consider old browsers. Any examples links would be helpful, as well as suggestions for existing open or commercial components. Thank you!
