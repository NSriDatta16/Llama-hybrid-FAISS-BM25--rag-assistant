ActiveModel based class does not create the same results as an ActiveRecord equivilent

I am developing a Rails 3 app in a largely tabless capacity. I am using savon_model and ActiveModel to generate similar behaviour to ActiveRecord equivalents. Below is my code: class TestClass include Savon::Model include ActiveModel::Validations # Configuration endpoint "http://localhost:8080/app/TestService" namespace "http://wsns.test.com/" actions :getObjectById, :getAllObjects attr_accessor :id, :name def initialize(hash) @id = hash[:id] @name = hash[:name] end client do http.headers["Pragma"] = "no-cache" end def self.all h = getAllObjects(nil).to_array return convert_array_hash_to_obj(h, :get_all_objects_response) end def self.find(id) h = getObjectById(:arg0 => id).to_hash return convert_hash_to_obj(h, :get_object_by_id_response) end private def self.convert_array_hash_to_obj(arrayhash, returnlabel) results = Array.new arrayhash.each do |hash| results OK, so everything works as expected; values are pulled from the web service and onto the page. Unfortunately, when I look at the html produced at the client side there are some issues. The Show links are along the following lines: /testclasses/%23%3CTestClass:0xa814cb4%3E instead of... /testclasses/1 So, I did a print of the object (hash?) to the console to compare the outputs. [# ] instead of what I believe it should be... [# ] I have three questions: 1: What is the hex suffix on my class name when it is printed out 2: How can I modify my class to match the desired output when printed to the console? 3: Why are the frontend links (Show, Edit, Delete) broken and is there an easy fix? Thanks so much for your time and apologies for rubbish code / stupid questions. This is my first Ruby or Rails app! Gareth
