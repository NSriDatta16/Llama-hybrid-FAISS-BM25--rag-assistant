To return any attribute on the class you're averaging against you're probably better off using the standard find(:all, ...) method with a custom :select option. So your example would be: groups_of_people = Person.find(:all, :select => 'avg(age) as avg_age, last_name', :group => 'last_name') They aren't really Person instances then (although they will be return as such) but you can do: groups_of_people.each do |g| g.last_name g.avg_age end
