jquery plugin alternatives to jquery ui draggable?

seems to be a bug in jquery UI when trying to drag a draggable outside the screen (i.e. when the page scrolls down) where the draggable loses it's position relative to the cursor. you can see the bug here... http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/default.html are there any other recommended jquery draggable plugins i could use instead? alernatively i could try and fix the bug but I fear it's beyond me atm! thanks :)
