Store your column width settings in an Xml Serializable object. Ie, something that implements IXmlSerializable then create a single setting entry of that type in Settings.settings. A good option would probably be an Xml Serializable Dictionary. A quick google search found quite a few different blog posts that describe how to implement that. As mentioned in other answers you'll need to ensure that this object is a User setting. You may also need to initialize the setting instance. Ie, create a XmlSerializableDictionary() instance and assign it to the setting if the setting is null. The settings subsystem doesn't create default instances of complex setting objects. Also, if you want these settings to persist between assembly versions (ie, be upgradable) you will need to upgrade the settings on application startup. This is described in detail on Miha Markiƒç's blog and Raghavendra Prabhu's blog.
