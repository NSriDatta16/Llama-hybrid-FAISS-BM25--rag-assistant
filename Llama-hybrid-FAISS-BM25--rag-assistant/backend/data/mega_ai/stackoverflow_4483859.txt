I have always used either a string or two 64-bit integers. The former in the case where I just want to record it, the latter in the case where I need to do calculations on whether a certain address is contained in a certain network, or even whether two networks overlap. When storing it as integer, the only option is indeed to split it into two 64-bit numbers. As this makes comparisons more cumbersome, I wouldn't do this unless you need numerical calculations, to see whether an IP falls within a certain network. I would not be too concerned about performance for storing IPv6 addresses in a string - depending on how many lookups you do for the data. Usually, there are very few, or there is simply very little data. Yes, the storage and lookups are less efficient than with numbers, but it's not much more painful than storing e-mail addresses, person names or usernames. And why would you not be able to mix IPv4 and IPv6 in string fields? They are easy to distinguish when retrieving one. Their range of possible values do not overlap. In short: use numbers for checking overlaps, use strings elsewhere. The inefficiency of strings is irrelevant compared to the ease of use.
