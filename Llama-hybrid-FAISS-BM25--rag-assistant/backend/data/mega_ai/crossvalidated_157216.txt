I ended up using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model a.k.a Marginal Multilevel Model (population averaged model). In R the GEE model can be found in the geepack package. require(geepack) pondtemp.gee To see the model result: summary(pondtemp.gee) To do the post-hoc pairwise comaprison I used lsmeans function from the lsmeans package. require(lsmeans) pondtemp.posthoc The pondtemp.sum$contrasts will contain the pairwise comparisons, which I wrote to an excel file and filtered for the comparisons I needed.
