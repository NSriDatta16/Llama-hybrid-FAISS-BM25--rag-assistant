If the assembly is in .NET, and the form and its fields are public, you can just reference the assembly in your program, new up the form in question, and set its fields, then call whatever behavior you need. If the assembly is unmanaged, but registered for COM, you can do much the same thing. If the program hides its internals and doesn't play well via COM, you'll have to get creative with GDI and other unmanaged hooks. You can get the handle of the window and interrogate its children to find the fields you need, then set their values. This is extremely messy to do in an unmanaged way, so I would encourage you to explore any other option you have.
