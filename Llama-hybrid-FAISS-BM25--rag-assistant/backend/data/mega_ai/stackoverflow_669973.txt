My first answer in StackOverflow, so pardon if some stupid was said. From my experience: PHP : gettext has been extremely helpful; non-western languages : UTF-8 everywhere (code, DB) and so far we're doing well; Are there any specific gotchas that you've experienced in practice? Breaking long paragraphs for i18n into different sentences can be less expensive to translate, if the string is repeated more than once in the site you only need to have it translated once. But, be careful, if you fragment the text too much translators will lose context; I've seen a lot of projects and sites let their communities provide translation for their applications and content. Do you recommend this and what are some good strategies for ensuring that you have a good translation? If you have a very large number of volunteers go for it, but depending on how much text you have, you might really need a ton of volunteers. Always make sure also that you have someone you trust being the leader of a language project to be the proof-reader controlling the accuracy of the translation.
