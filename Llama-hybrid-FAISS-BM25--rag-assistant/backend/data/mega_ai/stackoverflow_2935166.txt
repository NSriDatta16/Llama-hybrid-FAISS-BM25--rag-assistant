What good programming practices will change with C++11?

For example, "Don't return objects by value if they are expensive to copy" (RVO can't always be used). This advice might change because of rvalue references. The same might be said about storing collections of pointers to objects, because copying them by value into the collection was too expensive; this reason might no longer be valid. Or the use of enums might be discouraged in favour of "enum class". What other practices or tips will change?
