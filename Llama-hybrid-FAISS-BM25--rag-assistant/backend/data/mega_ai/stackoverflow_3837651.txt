If you're refreshing the page, then the objects on that page will be released and the new page won't have access to them. You do have some options though. You can use frames and only refresh the "main" frame. The objects stored in the JavaScript code and/or window object of the other frame(s) will be unchanged. These could be traditional frames or iframes. You can serialize your objects out to a string (perhaps a JSON string) and store them in cookies, which the refreshed page will have access to and can deserialize back into an object graph. On modern browsers you may have access to web storage in the form of web storage (Google Gears is one implementation) which is backed by an SQLite database (or any database implementing the web storage API, which at the moment is pretty much an SQLite database â€” this is one of the things holding up the web storage API, in fact, the lack of a second implementation). This also involves serializing/deserializing.
