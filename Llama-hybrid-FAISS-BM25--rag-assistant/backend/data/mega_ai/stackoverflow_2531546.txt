jquery-ui from a bookmarklet

I'm trying to create a bookmarklet which will use the jquery-ui - what steps must I take to do this? My bookmarklet loads a remote script and appends it to the page. This script includes jquery and jquery-ui, but getting the stylesheets and images is turning into a nightmare. Do I have to edit all the CSS to point images to their locations on the remote server? Effectively what I'm trying to do is have a bookmarklet which will pop up some information in a nice pretty draggable jquery-ui dialog. Is there an easier way? Thanks, Mala
