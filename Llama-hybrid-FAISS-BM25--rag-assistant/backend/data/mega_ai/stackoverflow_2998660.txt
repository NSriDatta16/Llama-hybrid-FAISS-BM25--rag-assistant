Have you checked the value of PHP's session.gc_maxlifetime parameter? Regardless of the life that Magento allows, this lifetime setting will still kill cookies after a little while. In your .htaccess file in the magento directory, add this: php_value session.gc_maxlifetime 31536000 That may solve the problem. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
