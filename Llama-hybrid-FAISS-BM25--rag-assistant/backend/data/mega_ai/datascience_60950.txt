Is it necessary to normalize data for XGBoost?

MinMaxScaler() in scikit-learn is used for data normalization (a.k.a feature scaling). Data normalization is not necessary for decision trees. Since XGBoost is based on decision trees, is it necessary to do data normalization using MinMaxScaler() for data to be fed to XGBoost machine learning models?
