Univariate approach to a Bivariate logistic regression

Consider a situation where two independent agents (out of a set of many agents) look at the same problem and attempt to solve it with a yes/no response, obtaining $(Y_{i1},Y_{i2})$ for $i \in \{1,\ldots,N\}$ . Each agent is highly trained, and they often come to the same conclusion. If we had a set of covariates of the task $X_i$ which influence each decision that we wish to gather information about, this could be approached as a multivariate problem simultaneously modelling $(Y_{i1},Y_{i2})$ using a logit or probit link function. The 'agreement' between the two agents would be inferred from the covariance matrix between the two latent response variables. In the probit example, this would resemble: $$(Y_1^*,Y_2^*) \sim MVN((\mu_1,\mu_2),\Sigma)$$ where $Y_i = \{1 \text{ if } Y_1^* > 0, \text{ 0 otherwise}\} $ , $\Sigma = \left(\begin{matrix} \sigma_1 & \sigma_{12}\\ \sigma_{12} & \sigma_2 \end{matrix}\right)$ and $\mu_i = \beta X_i$ . If a multivariate approach were for some reason infeasible (in my case due to software incompatibility with other modelling choices), is it possible to approach the problem by modelling each decision independently by combining the response vectors into a single $Y_j$ for $j \in 1,\ldots,2N$ response and using factor variables to distinguish between the two? For example the probit regression would then resemble: $$\mu_j = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Other decision}_j + \beta_3 \text{First or Second}_j + \beta X_j$$ for $j \in \{1,\ldots,2N\}$ using a regular normal distribution. In this approach the $\text{First or second}_j$ variable effectively models the different intercepts of each agents' acceptance rate and the $\text{Other decision}_j$ models the strength of agreement between the two agents. Is this, or any, univariate approach equivalent to solution to the bivariate problem? I would think that the only difference between them is the choice to combine or partition the elements of variance but I cannot find any references to this being done or considered before.
