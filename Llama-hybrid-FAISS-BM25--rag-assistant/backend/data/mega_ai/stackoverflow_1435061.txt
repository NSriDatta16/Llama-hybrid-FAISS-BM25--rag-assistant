I would say the .config file is the right place. Just be sure to use the User scoped area of the Settings.settings file rather than the Application scope. This works well for simple data types and when you have fixed values that will need to be saved because you need to define what variables you want to store at design time. So if your textboxes are dynamically created and you don't know many values you need to store it is not very useful. Using IsolatedStorage might be another good option. You can create your own file in any format you want (keeping any values you need) and store it to the local machine in "IsolatedStorage".
