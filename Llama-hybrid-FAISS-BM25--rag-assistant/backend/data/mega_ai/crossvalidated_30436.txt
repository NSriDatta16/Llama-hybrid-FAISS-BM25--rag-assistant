Using generalized method of moments (GMM) to calculate logistic regression parameter

I want to calculate coefficients to a regression that is very similar to logistic regression (Actually logistic regression with another coefficient: $$ \frac{A}{1 + e^{- (b_0 + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + \ldots)}},$$ when $A$ could be given). I thought of using GMM to calculate the coefficients, but I'm not sure what are the moment conditions I should use. Can anyone help me with that? Thanks!
