Deep Learning in a Camera

I don't know if this is the right place to ask this. Is it possible to run deep learning inside a camera and if so, how? I want to be able to take a picture and then use deep learning techniques to do image recognition by using it against hundreds or thousands or millions of other images. Is the only way to do this by taking a picture, sending it to a cloud or something like that and then input it in some model?
