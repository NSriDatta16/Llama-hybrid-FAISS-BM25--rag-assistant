MLE for Poisson Process

I asked a similar question here regarding method of moments, and now I need to figure out how to solve using MLE. Here is a repeat of the problem: A School of Ornithology researcher wants to estimate the number of red-tailed hawks in Ithaca. She radio tags 10 birds, and then sets up a feeding station with automatic camera The researcher believes that each individual bird's visits to the feeder can be modeled as a Poisson process with some unknown rate $\lambda$ . Over the first five weeks, she observes an average of 28.8 birds (tagged and untagged) visiting the feeder, with an average of 6 tagged birds per week. Next, she develops a video processing program which can identify and distinguish different individual birds from their pictures. Using this, over the next week, she observes 20 unique birds visiting the feeding station, out of which 4 are tagged. What is the MLE for the size of the hawk population in Ithaca? Here is what I have so far: We want to know what the distribution of number of tagged birds out of unique visitors in a week is. P(a given hawk visits at least one time) = 1 - P(no visits) = $1 - \frac{\lambda^0e^{-\lambda}}{0!}= 1 - e^{-\lambda}$ . Let $p = 1 - e^{-\lambda}$ . Then we see that the number of unique hawks to appear in a given week follows a binomial distribution with probability $p$ . Then $L(\theta | D) = \prod_{i=1}^{10} {10 \choose k_i} p^{k_i}(1-p)^{10-k_i}$ . We know from theory that MLE for a binomial is $p = \tfrac xn$ where $x$ is number of successes and $n$ is total trials. So here $p = \frac{4}{10}$ . Which implies $1-e^{-\lambda} = \frac{4}{10} \implies \lambda = -\ln(\frac{6}{10})$ Assuming my logic is correct, I am not sure how to use $\lambda$ to infer about the total population. Edit: I have attempted this: We know that the population is now a sum of $N$ bernoulli trials, i.e. binomial with probability $p = \frac{20}{N} = 1 - e^{-\lambda} = \frac{4}{10} \implies N = 50$ hawks. This is close to using Method moments of my original problem which estimated 48 hawks. Does this logic seem correct?
