That's like asking "describe how to perform a coronary bypass". Yes, one can explain how, but one is better first studying medicine and learning about the basics, before starting with specific procedures. However, in bulletpoints: Your browser will want to know the IP address of cnn.com. It doesn't do DNS lookups itself, but rather asks the operating system. Your browser will connect to that IP address on port 80 Your browser will send a HTTP GET request The webserver will reply with statuscode 200 and the body contents Your browser will parse the HTML In the HTML, other resources (images, scripts, css-files...) might be included, which the browser will also fetch. After the browser is done, it will close the connection. If it doesn't, the webserver will.
