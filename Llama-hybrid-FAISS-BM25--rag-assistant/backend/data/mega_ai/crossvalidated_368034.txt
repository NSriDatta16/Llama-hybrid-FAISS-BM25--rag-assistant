I would say, that there is a sense to overfit your data, but only for research purposes. (Don't use overfitted model in production!) In cases when data can be complex and task non-trivial, trying to overfit a model can be an important step! If you can overfit a model - it means that the data is possible to be described by the model. If you cannot even overfit - it can give you a clue for investigation: you data is not ready to be modelled, so you would need do more data preparation / feature engineering your model is too simple and cannot capture all data dependencies
