Find optimal number of clusters before clustering or independent of clustering algorithm

I am trying to implement a functionality which can auto compute the optimal number of clusters for a given data. I tried using Average Silhouette Width, Dunn Index, Davis and Bouldin index etc. But all these indices require that I first cluster data and then compute these. But for clustering the data I'll have to use a clustering algorithm. I don't want to do that first. I was wondering if there are some data properties or some indices - like mentioned above - which can be used for my purpose to estimate the number of clusters in data, but which do not require to use of any clustering algorithm. Is it possible to find optimal number of clusters for a given data without or prior using any clustering algorithm?
