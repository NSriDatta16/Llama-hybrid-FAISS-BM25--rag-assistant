How do I crop faces with a neural network?

I am looking to build a facial recognition system and realized I could probably pump up accuracy by first cropping the faces. I know I can use a Haar Cascade classifier to do this but would prefer to use a deep learning approach, as that is my current area of focus. To do this do I simply create a CNN with inputs being an image and outputs being the X, Y, Width, Height? Or is there more to it? I have tried this approach with an Adam optimizer and around 600 pictures but results haven't been great. Any ideas on how to improve this?
