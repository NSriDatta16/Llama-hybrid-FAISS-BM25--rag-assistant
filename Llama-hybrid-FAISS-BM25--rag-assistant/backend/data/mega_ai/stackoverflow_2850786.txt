Consider the average web project, and how many languages it involves: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, Java, SQL/HSQL. When each language is far better suited to the domain than the languages you're already using, toss another language in. I've also had data-heavy programs with a web front end written in Java, but a back end (to actually crunch numbers) written in C, hosted on different servers, and so on. And I've gotta say, don't model off of Twitter. You're unlikely to have an idea that tons of people want that much, that has no built in profitability, that investors shower you at money for. They're also absolutely terrible at the fit and finish in places; if you ever put your Gmail password in, odds are it was transmitted in the clear, for example, and for at least two years, you could friend people without their permission through the text message interface. (Gah.)
