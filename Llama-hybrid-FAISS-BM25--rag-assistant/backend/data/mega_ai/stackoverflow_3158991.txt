Widgets and extensions are not mutually exclusive. A widget is a nice way to let users who are not so technical add blocks of functionality to their pages, providing a boost over the blocks that users had to interact with before. That said, a widget is created as part of an extension, and is generally limited to visual changes to the page. A Widget cannot be used, for example, to trigger a cron script or change core functionality in Magento. For that reason, widgets are not the end-all solution. In the future, expect to see widgets used in all sorts of places to build extra functionality into the frontend of a site. Also expect to see other extensions running strong without them, editing functionality on the site. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
