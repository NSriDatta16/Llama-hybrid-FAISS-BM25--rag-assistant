It is a strange thing to do. The essence of Neural network is automatically do feature selection and transformation according to training samples. Why we want to do that manually?

If Yes, directly change the regularization parameter may be a better option. Here is a tutorial for regularized neural network. The regularized cost function can be found around 3:15 in the video .
