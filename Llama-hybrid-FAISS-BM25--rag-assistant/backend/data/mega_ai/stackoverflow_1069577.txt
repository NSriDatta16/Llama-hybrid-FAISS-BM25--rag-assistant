Select item programmatically in WPF ListView

I'm unable to figure out how to select an item programmatically in a ListView. I'm attempting to use the listview's ItemContainerGenerator, but it just doesn't seem to work. For example, obj is null after the following operation: //VariableList is derived from BindingList m_VariableList = getVariableList(); lstVariable_Selected.ItemsSource = m_VariableList; var obj = lstVariable_Selected.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromItem(m_VariableList[0]); I've tried (based on suggestions seen here and other places) to use the ItemContainerGenerator's StatusChanged event, but to no avail. The event never fires. For example: m_VariableList = getVariableList(); lstVariable_Selected.ItemContainerGenerator.StatusChanged += new EventHandler(ItemContainerGenerator_StatusChanged); lstVariable_Selected.ItemsSource = m_VariableList; ... void ItemContainerGenerator_StatusChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { //This code never gets called var obj = lstVariable_Selected.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromItem(m_VariableList[0]); } The crux of this whole thing is that I simply want to pre-select a few of the items in my ListView. In the interest of not leaving anything out, the ListView uses some templating and Drag/Drop functionality, so I'm including the XAML here. Essentially, this template makes each item a textbox with some text - and when any item is selected, the checkbox is checked. And each item also gets a little glyph underneath it to insert new items (and this all works fine): ... So what am I missing? How do I programmatically select one or more of the items in the ListView?
