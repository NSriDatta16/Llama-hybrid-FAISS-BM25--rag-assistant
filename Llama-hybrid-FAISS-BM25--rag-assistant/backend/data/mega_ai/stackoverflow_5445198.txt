Using webkit database storage for highscores

I just made a simple HTML5 game for mobile webkit. I have made a simple function that inserts the record into the database: Javascript: db = openDatabase('highscores', '1.0', 'Whackem Highscores', 2 * 1024 * 1024); db.transaction(function (tx) { tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE scores (id unique, int,text)'); tx.executeSql('INSERT INTO foo (id, text) VALUES (?,?,?)',["",score,date1]); }); It doesn't seem to do anything!? How can I fix this? I also have to make a loop that prints out the highest scores, If you have any advice on something like that, it would also be very helpful.
