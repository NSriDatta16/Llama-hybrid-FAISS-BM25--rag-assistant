Presumably there is a degree of noise in your original 34k features dataset? In which case the full rank PCA is modelling that noise in the smaller (higher numbered) components, and this results in and over-fitting of the classifier. A typical way to account for this would be to use cross-validation of the PCA models to generate a Q 2 score that would tell you at what point your components were fitting to noise and not use these in your model.
