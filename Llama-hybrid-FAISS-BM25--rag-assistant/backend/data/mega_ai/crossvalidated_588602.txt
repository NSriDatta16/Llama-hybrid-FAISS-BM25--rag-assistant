I would start with some exploratory data analysis techniques before jumping into models. Visualizations of the data can save a lot of time. I'll assume that features are fixed. Otherwise you might consider feature selection techniques. Once you have explored the data, then you might start considering choices of model. You sort of answered your own question that you could train a neural network on the data generated from the black box. Just make sure you split the data into training, validation, and testing sets as usual for such ML projects. But I would recommend starting with simpler models than typical neural networks. The failures of simpler models can hint at what improvements should be used, and you might luck out at a simpler model doing the trick.
