UPDATE: oops! @gbn is right, my ORDER BY sample was broken! Updating with correct code sample. In the most common case where the "top" is based the order of values in a particular column or columns, you can use a CTE and ROW_NUMBER to simulate an ordered TOP: WITH cte AS ( SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY SomeColumn, OtherColumn) AS RowNum FROM table ) DELETE FROM cte WHERE RowNum See Itzik Ben-Gan's SQLMag article on TOP for more info on this suggested pattern. If you simply want to delete any row of a set of duplicates, or just want to delete a random row for some reason, then it's safe to omit the ORDER BY and do something simpler: DELETE TOP (1) FROM table Quoting from the DELETE docs on MSDN : TOP ( expression ) [ PERCENT ] Specifies the number or percent of random rows that will be deleted. expression can be either a number or a percent of the rows. The rows referenced in the TOP expression used with INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE are not arranged in any order. Parentheses delimiting expression in TOP are required in INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. For more information, see TOP (Transact-SQL).
