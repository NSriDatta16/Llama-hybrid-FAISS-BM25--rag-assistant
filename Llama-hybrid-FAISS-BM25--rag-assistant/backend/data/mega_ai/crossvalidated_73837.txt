Numerical sampling in hierarchical Bayesian models (HBM)

I am reading chapter 5 of $\textit{Bayesian Data Analysis}$ by Gelman $\textit{et al.}$. There it explains the few steps of data analysis for hierarchical models and if I quote from the book it will be: "We first perform the following three steps analytically. Write the joint posterior density, $p( \theta, \phi|y)$, in unnormalized form as a product of the hyperprior distribution $p(\phi)$, the population distribution $p(\theta|\phi)$, and the likelihood $p(y|\theta)$. Determine analytically the conditional posterior density of $\theta$ given the hyperparameters $\phi$; for fixed observed $y$, this is a function of $\phi$, $p(\theta|\phi, y)$. Estimate $\phi$ using the Bayesian paradigm; that is, obtain its marginal posterior distribution, $p(\phi|y)$. The first step is immediate, and the second step is easy for conjugate models because, conditional on $t/J$, the population distribution for $\theta$ is just the iid model (5.1), so that the conditional posterior density is a product of conjugate posterior densities for the components $\theta_j$. The third step can be performed by brute force by integrating the joint posterior distribution over $\theta$: $$p(\phi|y) = \int{p(\phi,\theta|y)d\theta} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(5.4)}"$$ Now my question is whether we can (in a numerical approach) sample from $p(\phi,\theta|y)$ and ignore the $\theta$s to generate a sample of $p(\phi|y)$?
