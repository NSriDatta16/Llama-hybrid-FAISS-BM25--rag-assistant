You're trying to do network bridging. Windows has this support built in starting with XP. This will make your computer into a very expensive two port Ethernet switch (where the wireless link is a port). If you want to do some more fancy filtering, I suggest using a TUN/TAP driver or pcap /WinPCAP , which will allow you to receive raw frames.
