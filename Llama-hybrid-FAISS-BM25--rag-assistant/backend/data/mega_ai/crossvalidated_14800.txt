How to compare data with difference in scale?

I am working with the data obtained from a travel survey from a town. I have the data from mean of trips made by different travel modes on the day of the survey. From a national suevey I have got data of total number of trips made by each travel mode for the towns with similar populations. Could you suggest a way to compare these two except calculating percentage of each mode across the five travel modes. Because the data from the town we conducted the survey is much smaller in numbers than than numbers from the national survey. They look as follows Total number of trips weekdays in **low populated towns** 436000/ 137000/ 39000/ 88000/ 225000 Average number of trip by each mode on day of survey in the **town X** 126,6/ 23,6/ 2/ 5/ 34,8
