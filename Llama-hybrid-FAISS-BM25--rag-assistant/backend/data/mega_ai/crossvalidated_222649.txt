Upper bounds on mixing times in MCMC for bayesian analysis in practice

I'm familiar with how, for a general markov chain with some transition kernel, the spectral gap and the log-Sobolev constant both provide an upper bound on mixing time. I also have heard people alluding to how these quantities might be used in general cases of MCMC to indicate convergence rates (for example, in this set of lecture notes ). In all of the material I've seen so far, in order to calculate these quantities, the transition kernel was needed. For many uses of MCMC, however, I don't believe you have the kernel in hand (eg using MCMC to calculate a posterior in a Bayesian analysis). So, my ultimate question is, can you place an upper bound on mixing time using the quantities above without having the kernel provided? Say with only a tentative generative model and the data at hand? Is there work out there on this? I haven't been able to find anything yet.
