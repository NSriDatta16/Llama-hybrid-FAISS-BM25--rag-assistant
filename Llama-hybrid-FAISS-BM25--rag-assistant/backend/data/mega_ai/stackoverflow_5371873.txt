How to drag-n-drop links/pages via the jQuery plugin?

Hi I'm doing a self-project on creating a jQuery UI to allow users to drag-n-drop links/webpages, specifically, articles from Wikipedia, to a sort of 'organizer' like the stacks in Solitaire. I'm hoping to add various features such as when the user drag-n-drops the Wikipage to the UI such as grouping items/card visuals. I'm unsure where to start as I'm relatively new to jQuery. Is it possible to drag a page from Wikipedia and drop it in a jQuery UI? If anyone has any advice, that would be awesome as I'm really trying to figure out how to kick this thing off the ground. Edit: Anyone? I've had no luck finding anything yet.
