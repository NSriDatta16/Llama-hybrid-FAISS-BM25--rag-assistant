How to sample from a given accessible PDF?

I am learning Gibbs Sampling for GMMs. Particularly, given $\boldsymbol \theta$ , I must sample from the latent $\boldsymbol z$ before sampling $\boldsymbol x$ . The PDF of $\boldsymbol z$ is given as $$ P(z=k|\boldsymbol x,\boldsymbol\theta)\propto P(z=k)\mathcal N(\mu_k,\Sigma_k) $$ for $k=1\cdots.K$ and by assumption, $\mu,\Sigma,P(z_k)$ are given. Gibb's sampling states that I should iteratively sample from $\boldsymbol z$ and $\boldsymbol x$ and accept all sample (since it is a MH with proposal probability $1$ ). The problem is, how do I sample from $\boldsymbol z$ ? Sampling from $P(\boldsymbol x|\boldsymbol\theta)$ is easy once I have $\boldsymbol z$ since I will simply select a Gaussian component corresponding to $z_k$ and call packages for sampling a Gaussian distribution. Do I need to perform another MCMC for a every single sample of $z$ or perhaps rejection or importance sampling?
