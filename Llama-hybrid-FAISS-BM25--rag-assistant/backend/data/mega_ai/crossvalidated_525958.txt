$j$ is an integer that takes values restricted by $q . In other words, $j$ takes all integer values that satisfy the inequality $\frac{q-k}{d} . As Pedro Schuller correctly said, if you have monthly data, $w_1$ will be the average deviation in the month of January between the real value and the value that the Moving Average Filter takes in that month . $w_2$ will be the corresponding value for February, and so on.
