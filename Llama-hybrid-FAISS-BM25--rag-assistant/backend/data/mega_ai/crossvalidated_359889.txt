I think it will help to start with a statistical model where the values of interest (true success probabilities) exist as parameters of the model. Assume we have 2 Bernoulli random variables $X$ for the true drug sample result and $Y$ for the given test results. Both of these variables are conditioned on the manufacturer and $Y$ is condition on $X$ such that each observation $y_i$ is accompanied by an unobserved $x_i$ and together have a joint distrubution of $P(Y|X, c_1,c_2)P(X|c_1)$ where $c_1,c_2$ are labels for the drug and test makers respectively. We then have a model with between 25-55 parameters (the probabilities) and $N$ latent variables that we can fit using maximum likelihood (expectation-maximization) or a Bayesian approach. In order to deal with positive bias, we use constraints (or priors) such that $P(Y|X,c_1=c_2)>P(Y|X,c_1\neq c_2)$.
