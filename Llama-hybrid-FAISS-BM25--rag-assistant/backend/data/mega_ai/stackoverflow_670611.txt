Java generics work by type erasure. This kinda sorta means that when the app is actually running, the JVM doesn't care about generics. The compiler pays attention to them, then discards them from the bytecode (allthough certain annotations are put in the .class file etc etc) So serialising and deserialising objects of a generic type is kind of a no-brainer. It deserialises as a List, and you cast it.
