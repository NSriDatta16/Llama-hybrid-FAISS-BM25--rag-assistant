I recently dealt with CSV parsing for Yahoo! Finance as well. I used Ragel to write a parser in C that was good enough for the CSV I was getting. It handled everything but escaped quotes, which are not going to show up much in stock quotes. It was pretty painless and a good learning experience. I'd post the code, but it was work-for-hire, so I don't own it. Turning a C string into an NSString is easy. If you have it as an NSData , as you likely do at the end of a URL download, just do [[NSString alloc] initWithData:csvData encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] . If you have a pointer to a character buffer instead, use [[NSString alloc] initWithBytes:buffer length:buflen encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] . buflen could be strlen(buffer) if buffer is a normal, NUL-terminated C string.
