Thanks to dh14-sl and lecou—the solution was a combination of both your answers. I was trying to drag a tab bar controller from the library onto the list of elements but it wasn't working—turns out I had to drag it to the view itself. Then I had to change the parent class of my rootvc and re-setup connections, but now it seems to work! Thanks guys!
