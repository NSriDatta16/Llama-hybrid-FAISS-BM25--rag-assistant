Create a maven project which contains all your shared code. Keep packaging of this project (in the main pom.xml) as jar. This would help make this project kind of library for your usage. In all the projects which access the shared code, add dependency for this project according to your needs. (compile, provided). Now package and install the shared project before you build any of the dependent projects. This will add the shared project to your local repository which can be then used by your dependent projects. Adding sample pom.xml for shared and dependent projects. Shared project pom. 4.0.0 com.myspace.test com.myspace 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT com.myspace shared 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT shared-module shared module which contains code shared by other modules. Dependent project's pom. 4.0.0 com.myspace.test com.myspace 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT com.myspace dependent-module 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT dependent-module Dependent module. com.myspace shared 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT provided Parent project can be added optionally in case such organization is required. Hope this helps.
