This looks more like a superuser.com question. I'm no PHP expert but here are some thoughts: a) PHPfm or FileThingie might do it for files. b) It's up to you how you organize/design your table/database structure to accomodate collections/albums/etc. c,d) - ImageMagick or GD library can easily handle crops and resize, and even more. e) - see b) If it's a commercial project and time is a constraint consider solutions like SlideShowPro . It has been around for a few good years, has a nice design, good support, in short it's an affordable and professional product . If you don't consider buying this, analyze it, break it down, see what works well and how and most importantly how you can improve this.
