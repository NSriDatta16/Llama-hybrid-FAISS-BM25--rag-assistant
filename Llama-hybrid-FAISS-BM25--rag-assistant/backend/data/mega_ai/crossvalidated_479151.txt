Why is this a problem? : Error: "the researcher is assuming an alpha level below the nominal" (p < 0.05)

I'm trying to understand an article about significance testing and ANOVA, where Monte Carlo simulations were run. The final sentence of this paragraph (in bold) makes absolutely no sense to me. "Type I error is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is actually true. The robustness of a statistical test can be evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation techniques, and in order to ensure the comparability of results from Monte Carlo studies a standard criterion to assess robustness must be established. Bradley’s (1978) liberal criterion is considered the most appropriate (e.g.,Keselman, Algina, Kowalchuk, & Wolfinger, 1999;Kowalchuk, Keselman, Algina, & Wolfinger, 2004). According to this criterion, a statistical test is considered robust if the empirical Type I error rate is between .025 and .075 for a nominal alpha level of .05. When the rate is above .075 the test is considered liberal, increasing the risk of declaring mean differences that do not exist. When the rate is below .025 the test is considered conservative, such that the researcher is assuming an alpha level below the nominal " (Blanca et al., 2018). Throughout the article, rates below .025 or above .075 are considered "non-robust." Robustness, a binary variable, is what's used in all the chi-squares testing the article talks about. The point of the article to assist researchers in determining whether they can trust their F-test, based on differences in group variance and group sample size. My question is , why is it considered a failure here to have an actual significance level of 0.01 when you did a wide range of simulations at a significance level of 0.05? And how is this being attributed to "the researcher?" This is simulated data, where the differences in variance and sample size are being adjusted, while maintaining normality. I'm looking for an explanation of the last sentence in the above paragraph. Reference: Blanca, M. J., Alarcón, R., Arnau, J., Bono, R., & Bendayan, R. (2018). Effect of variance ratio on ANOVA robustness: Might 1.5 be the limit? Behavior Research Methods , 50(3), 937–962. (This particular article is open-access through Springer.)
