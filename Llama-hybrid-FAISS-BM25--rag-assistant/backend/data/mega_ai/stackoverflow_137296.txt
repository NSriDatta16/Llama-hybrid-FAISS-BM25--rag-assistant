From a practical standpoint, I create a list of tests that I believe must pass prior to acceptance. I test these and automate where possible. Based on how much time I've estimated for the task or how much time I've been given, I extend my test coverage to include items that should pass prior to acceptance. Of course, the line between must and should is subjective. After that, I update automated tests as bugs are discovered.
