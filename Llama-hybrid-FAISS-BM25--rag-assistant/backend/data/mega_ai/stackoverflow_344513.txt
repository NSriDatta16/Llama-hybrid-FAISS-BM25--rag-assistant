Disable "Adjust Date/Time" in Vista Home Edition

My company has got quite a number of client laptops out in the field. These laptops are running Windows Vista Home edition. I was recently asked if I could find a way to disable the user's ability to adjust the system time. My first thought was to use gpedit, but as I found this is unavailable in home edition. I then looked for registry edits that I could use, but I drew a blank. Apparently the user rights related bits of gpedit do not involve registry settings. We adjust the system time automatically from our software that runs on the laptop. This means that we need a way to be able to disable the user's ability to adjust the date/time, but allow our program (running under that user's context) to adjust it for them. Has anybody got any ideas, or know a way of getting gpedit to work on home edition? (Our software is .Net based and has automatic update features, so we can leverage that in the solution if needed). Update: Local Security Settings aren't available in Vista Home edition either.
