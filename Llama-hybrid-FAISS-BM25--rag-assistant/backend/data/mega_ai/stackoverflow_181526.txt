Actually, just before FF3 was out, I did some experiments, and FF2 sends only the filename, like did Opera 9.0. Only IE sends the full path. The behavior makes sense, because the server doesn't have to know where the user stores the file on his computer, it is irrelevant to the upload process. Unless you are writing an intranet application and get the file by direct network access! What have changed (and that's the real point of the bug item you point to) is that FF3 no longer let access to the file path from JavaScript. And won't let type/paste a path there, which is more annoying for me: I have a shell extension which copies the path of a file from Windows Explorer to the clipboard and I used it a lot in such form. I solved the issue by using the DragDropUpload extension. But this becomes off-topic, I fear. I wonder what your Web forms are doing to stop working with this new behavior. [EDIT] After reading the page linked by Mike, I see indeed intranet uses of the path (identify a user for example) and local uses (show preview of an image, local management of files). User Jam-es seems to provide a workaround with nsIDOMFile (not tried yet).
