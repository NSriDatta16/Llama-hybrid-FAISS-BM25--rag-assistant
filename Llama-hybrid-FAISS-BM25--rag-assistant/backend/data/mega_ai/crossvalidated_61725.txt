Prediction errors for Adaboost

I understand how the adaboost algorithm works to produce a prediction of a class, however one thing I haven't seen is how to get a measure of accuracy for that prediction. For example, if I fit a logistic regression, then I get a set of coefficient estimates and their standard errors . This allows me to create a prediction interval for a new unseen case, as well as a point estimate. However, for adaboost, I've only ever seen formulae and algorithms for creating the prediction, but nothing for the prediction interval. The only thing I can think of is the test set error - but this is a "global" error estimate. Another, more mathematical way to formulate this question is: Suppose we fit an adaboost algorithm to data $D_{T}\equiv\{(x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_T,y_T)\}$ and get an estimated prediction function $\hat{f}$. Now we use this to predict $n$ new observations $(\hat{f}(x_{T+1}),\dots,\hat{f}(x_{T+n}))$ (we don't observe $y$ for these data points). What is the mean square error matrix $MSE(\hat{y})=E((y-\hat{y})(y-\hat{y})^T)$?
