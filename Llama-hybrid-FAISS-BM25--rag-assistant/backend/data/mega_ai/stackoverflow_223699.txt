You are facing the usual main issue of mobile development : targetting as many handsets as possible with only one programming language means using J2ME, which doesn't quite give you access to all the features of the handset. Most open handsets will support J2ME but different phone manufacturers implement it in different ways and fragmentation is enourmous accross the board. Unfortunately, the majority of open handsets (the ones where you can install third-party applications) only allow you to develop in J2ME The only good news is that your intent to only write small applications will provide large relief from fragmentation issues. J2ME also has huge limitations in terms of file system access, complete lack of a telephony API, very poor interaction with the system applications management... In order to get full features, you always need to use the native technology of the open platform you are targetting, be it Android, iPhone, the several variants of Symbian OS, Brew, Windows Mobile or Palm OS handsets. Each of these has its own native technology. Writing your application many times in many different languages in the costly price of wanting both a large number of targetted handsets and access to the full features of each of them. I'm a Symbian/J2ME veteran myself and, given your stated background and goals, I suspect that you are trying to learn about mobile technologies. I'll therefore shamelessly plug my book, which is meant as an introduction into the Symbian development ecosystem : http://www.amazon.com/Quick-Recipes-Symbian-Smartphone-Development/dp/0470997834/ Good luck
