It's not really clear what you're asking here. Magento has a basic one resource to one table resource, and a one resource to many tables constructed in a specific manner resource for EAV style models. The scenario you're describing above isn't directly supported by the system, but if you wanted to implement something like it there's nothing stopping you from implementing a resource that works any way you want. As for the possible children, create the simple config viewer described here to get a dump of the entire merged config, and then use an xpath viewer to examine all the nodes (and their children) that you're interested in
