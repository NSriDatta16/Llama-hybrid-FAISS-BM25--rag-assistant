High scores table

I am looking to add a (local, not online) high scores table to my Android app and I wanted to get some insight on the best way to approach the problem. I have a list of users (right now being saved out to a file and read back in as an array of User objects), and the high scores need to reference this data to populate the table with the user's name and photo, etc. For the display, I think a TableLayout would probably be my best option. I can make columns for picture, name, score, etc. For the information itself, I'm thinking maybe a SQLite table would be the best way to organize my data? If so, then it may be worthwhile to move my user data to a SQLite table as well so I can ensure the data is cross-referenced properly. Does anybody here have any helpful information or opinions on this? Thanks. UPDATE : I went with the SQLite database (using two tables) and it works great! Wasn't too hard to learn and get working either. For the layout, it turns out a ListView with a custom adapter was the best way to accomplish what I wanted (more flexible than a TableLayout).
