This is more of a comment on the paper by RIA Davis referenced by Bittenus (above) . I will have to agree with Bittenus, there is not much of a mathematical backing behind the techniques proposed in the paper - it is more of an empirical comparison. The paper only considers the case wherein the HMM is of a restricted topology (feed-forward). (in my case I have a standard topology, and I found the most consistent results by implementing a non-weighted averaging of all models trained with Baum-Welch. This approach is mentioned in the paper but only cited with marginal results). Another type of model-averaging training was detailed by RIA Davis in a journal article and uses Vitterbi Training instead of Baum-Welch Comparing and Evaluating HMM Ensemble Training Algorithms Using Train and Test and Condition Number Criteria . However this paper only explores the HMMs with the same restricted feed-forward topology. (I plan to explore this method and will update this post with my findings.)
