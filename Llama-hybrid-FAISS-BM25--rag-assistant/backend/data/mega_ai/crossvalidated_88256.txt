What does "sampling period" mean in MCMC?

In MCMC, Use a single chain with a burn-in period of 100 iterations and a sampling period of 1000 iterations. If I am correct, the "burn-in period" is the length of the first part of a sample path that is to be discarded. What does the "sampling period" mean? Suppose from a MC, $(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_N)$ is a single sample path of the chain (where the sample path length $N$ is sufficiently large), and the burn in period is $t_b$, and the sampling period is $t_s$. Is it correct to collect $X_{t_b}, X_{2*t_b}, \dots, X_{t_s*t_b}$ as iid sample of the stationary distribution? Does the sample period $t_s$ mean the sample size for the sample that I need to collect? Thanks!
