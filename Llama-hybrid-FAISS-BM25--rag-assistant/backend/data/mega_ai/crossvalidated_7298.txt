You can improve the acceptance rate using delayed rejection as described in Tierney, Mira (1999) . It is based on a second proposal function and a second acceptance probability , which guarantees the Markov chain is still reversible with the same invariant distribution: you have to be cautious since " it is easy to construct adaptive methods that might seem to work but in fact sample from the wrong distribution ".
