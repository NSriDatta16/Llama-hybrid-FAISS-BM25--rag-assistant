There are two things you can do to reduce your bandwidth: Send smaller images (more compression) Send less images When implementing an algorithm that picks image size and quantity to honor the user-selected limit, you have to balance between a simple/robust algorithm and a performant algorithm (one that makes maximum use out of the limit). The first approach I would try is to use a rolling average of the bandwidth you are using at any point in time to "seed" your algorithm. Every once in a while, check the average. If it becomes more than your limit, instruct the algorithm to use less (in proportion to how much you overstepped the limit). If it becomes significantly lower than your limit, say less than 90%, instruct the algorithm to use more. The less/more instruction might be a variable (maybe int or float , really there is much scope for inventiveness here) used by your algorithm to decide: How often to capture an image and send it How hard to compress that image
