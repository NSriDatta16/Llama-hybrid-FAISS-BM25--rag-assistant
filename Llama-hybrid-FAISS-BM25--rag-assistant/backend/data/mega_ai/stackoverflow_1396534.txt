Alternatives to CAT.NET for website security analysis

I'm looking for an alternative tool to CAT.NET for performing static security scans on .NET code. Currently the CAT.NET tooling/development is at a somewhat fragile stage and doesn't offer the reliability that I'm looking for. Are there any alternative static code analyzers that you use for detecting security issues?
