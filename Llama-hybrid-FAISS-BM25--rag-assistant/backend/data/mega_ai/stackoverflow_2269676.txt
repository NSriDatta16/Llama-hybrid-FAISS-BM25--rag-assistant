WPF Databinding in code question

I've got the following collection, which serves as a global storage for a group of LineSeries ItemsSources for a chart. public ObservableCollection > AllDataSeries; The said collection may change every now and then, when it's reset I clear the chart from all series - and when it's re-populating again I'm adding as many series to the chart as the AllDataSeries.Count tells me to. At this point I need to set the binding. for(int i = 0; i The thing is, I have no ide how to compose the Path for the binding. I tried : String.Format("AllDataSeries[{0}]", i) but it didn't work. How should I set the Path property on the binding ?
