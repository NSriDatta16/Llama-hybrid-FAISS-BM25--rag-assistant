jQuery Draggable: Image Flicker

I've been developing an Image panning tool, and after a kind member directed me to the draggable plugin for jQuery, I have most of it completed. Right now if the user drags the image (contained inside a div of about 300px by 300px), the image will first flicker, then pan. This problems seems to occur after a mouse down event, on the mouse move event. The image will shift into one of the four corners on mouse move, and moving to certain areas will cause another shift. I haven't been able to find anything through google, and I'm relatively new to jQuery still. I've uploaded the code here, in case my description is too vague: http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/csa/test/zoom.htm Any ideas or advice is greatly appreciated!
