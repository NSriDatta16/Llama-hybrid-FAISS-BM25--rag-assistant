Ok, so I too fought with this, and here is what I have found to be the simple solution to the problem: Create your application/framework Create your test bundle "additional target", do not set a dependency on your main Drag the files you want to test from your classes to the "compile sources" of your test bundle target Create your test cases, adding them only to the test bundle target compile test target, tests run. Note, this means you simply have to compile your test bundle target when you want to run your tests. Ideal, no; works, yes. Apple really automate this and get it working correctly, out of the box.
