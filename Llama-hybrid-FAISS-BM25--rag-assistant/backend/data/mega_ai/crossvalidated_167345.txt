Simple option is not to use caret and just use the tune function from E1071. svm_model The default setting from tune is 10 fold CV. Using tune.control you can adjust this to repeat this as many times as you want. see ?tune.control for more options If you want to use caret you will have to build your own model, because at the moment there is no one-classification model. But if you follow the steps on the caret page for using your own model you could adjust the first example. Also look at these examples( example1 , example2 )
