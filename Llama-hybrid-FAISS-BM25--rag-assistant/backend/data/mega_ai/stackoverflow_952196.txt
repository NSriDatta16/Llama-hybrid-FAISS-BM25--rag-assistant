Is there a way to execute VBA code when specific tables and fields in a Microsoft Access database are updated?

I have a program that uses a Microsoft Access database for its back-end. I need to have some VBA code (that calls a web service) execute whenever specific tables/fields are updated by the program. I see this working just like a trigger in SQL Server. Is it possible to monitor for and act upon changes like this in Access? Update The program in question does not run inside of Access (i.e. not a VBA app), it simply uses an MDB file as its back-end storage. Unfortunately I don't have access to the program's code as it is a closed third party application.
