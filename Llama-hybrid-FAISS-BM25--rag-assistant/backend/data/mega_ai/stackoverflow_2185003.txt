The dependency information GCC produces is actually generated by GNU make, called by the gcc driver. You can get a version of GNU make for windows from lots of places, including http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys . You might also consider using GCC on Windows - you can get the MinGW version at http://tdragon.net/recentgcc .
