Rails - how to serialize a tree not in a form

I started with the standard scriptaculous drag and drop tree, and that all works fine. Then started implementing this: http://www.artweb-design.de/2008/5/30/scriptaculous-sortabletree which gives a good drag and drop tree Where I am stuck is how to get serialize the tree (unordered list)? It's not in a form, and I can't find a way to serialize it to move onto setting up the AJAX update.
