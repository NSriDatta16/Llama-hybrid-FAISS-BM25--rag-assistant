If the assumptions of randomness, fixed distribution, fixed location, and fixed variation hold, you can perform an independent samples t-test. If the assumptions are violated, try a Mann-Whitney test. If you are just interested in correlation, try a Pearson test. If the assumptions are violated, try a Spearman test. If you would like to perform a statistical test with time series in mind, consider a Granger causality test.
