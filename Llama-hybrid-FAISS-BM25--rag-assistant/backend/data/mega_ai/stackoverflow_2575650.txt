(sum(ratings) / number(ratings)) * min(number(ratings), 10)/max(number(ratings), 10) The first part is the un-normalized average rating. The second part will slowly increase the rating towards 5 as the number of individual ratings grows to 10. The question isn't clear enough for me to provide a better answer, but I believe the above formula might be something you can start with and adapt as you go. It goes without saying that you have to check if there are any ratings at all (not to divide by zero).
