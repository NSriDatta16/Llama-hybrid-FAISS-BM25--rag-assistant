Baum-Welch training example

I'm the author of a new Baum Welch trainer using MapReduce for the Apache Mahout project (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-627) I'm looking for an example with a reasonably small data set which I can use to demonstrate the usage of the trainer I have developed. Does anyone here know of any online demonstrations for this training which go beyond the normal "toy" examples? I'm interested in typical HMM training application areas--bioinformatics, NLP, Signal Processing etc.
