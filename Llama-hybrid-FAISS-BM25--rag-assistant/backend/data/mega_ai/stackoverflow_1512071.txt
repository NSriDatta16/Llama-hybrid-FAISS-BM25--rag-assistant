NeuPro Language?

I don't have so much a question about how to program something, but rather I'm looking for information on a specific programming language that I can't seem to find anywhere. It seems to be referenced in a few papers I'm looking at. The name of the language is "NeuPro" - it would be for working with Neural Networks and appears to have a syntax very similar to prolog. Anyway, if someone could shed some light of provide a reference I can work on that would be great.
