Neural network basic concepts

I want to apply neural network as an auto associative memory. So, the desired output is equal to the input. I would apply Hebbs rule to train the network. I have a pattern in the form Sample1 = [1 1 1 1 1 1 -1 1 1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ]'; The length d = 30 . I have a set of p samples stored in a database, Database, X = {Sample1,Sample2,....,Sample_p} But I have some conceptual problem in understanding what determines the input to the neural network -- will it be all samples (example) or each sample /example? Would there be $p$ input neurons or $d$ neurons? In general, what is meant by number of inputs and number of outputs?
