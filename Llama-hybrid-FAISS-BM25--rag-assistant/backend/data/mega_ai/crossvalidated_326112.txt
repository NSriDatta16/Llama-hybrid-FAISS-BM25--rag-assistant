Is it a creditable approach to use Random Forrest Variable importance for causal inference?

I recently ran into a discussion with a college who used Random Forrest Variable importance to discover causal links between some actions of web users and their characteristics. As I come from econometrics, I was wondering whether this is a good approach, since I intuitively would have fitted a Logistic Regression (the action is binary) and analyze its coefficients for this task. To make it more concrete consider the following problem setting: Lets say we have a data set $D = (X,y)$ which consists of an output variable $y$ and $d$ explanatory Variables $X = (X_1, \dots, X_d)$. Furthermore, the goal is not to predict new data points $y$, but only to find causal links between $X$ and $y$ . Would it be good idea to fit a Random Forrest to the data and extract Variable importance in this setting? If yes, what are pros and cons of this comparing it to Linear/Logistic Regression coefficient analysis?
