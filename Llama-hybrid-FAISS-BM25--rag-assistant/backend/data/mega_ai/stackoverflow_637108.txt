If you're going to simulate this, I'd probably recommend something like dividing up the contact surface between the disk and the table into a radial grid. Compute the relative velocity and the force at each point on the grid at each time step, then sum up the forces and torques (r cross F) to get the net force F and the net torque T on the disk as a whole. Then you can apply the equations F=(m)(dv/dt) and T=(I)(dw/dt) to determine the differential changes in v and w for the next time step. For what it's worth, I don't think a flat disk would curve under the influence of either a frictional force (velocity-independent) or a drag force (linearly proportional to velocity).
