I think more elegant solutions exists, but I'll toss this one in. This will also work for filenames with spaces and/or newlines: i=0; for f in *; do array[$i]="$f" ((i++)) done You can then e.g. list the files one by one (in this case in reverse order): for ((i = $i - 1; i >= 0; i--)); do ls -al "${array[$i]}" done This page gives a nice example, and for more see Chapter 26 in the Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide .
