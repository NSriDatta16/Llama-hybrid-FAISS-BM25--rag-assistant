You can look at it one of two ways: How can you leverage PowerShell inside your C# program How can you leverage C# programming inside PowerShell. To some degree, they are quite different questions with different answers. From C# you can leverage the PowerShell engine, runspaces, pipe-lines, etc. As is done with Exchante, you can use C# to do all the GUI stuff, then invoke a PowerShell cmdlet to do all the hard stuff. This option is appropriate if you can find PowerShell cmdlets or scripts to leverage. From PowerShell, you use C# to expand what you can do in PowerShell. You can create cmdlts and providers to enable others to access application data. Or you can just create objects that can be used within a PowerShell script. This option is the way you help to open up your application to be managed in a more automated way. So depending on what you are looking to do, you have options.
