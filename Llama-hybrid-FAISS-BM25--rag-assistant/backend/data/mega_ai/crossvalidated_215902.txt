Is data visualization a sufficient indication for the separability of the data? What are other indications of data separation?

In other words, let's say we have a data representation as in the image below, which is generated from the PCA, the projection of the data onto the first two PCs. As it's shown in the 2-D space, the data is not separable. Is that a good indication that this data is not separable? What other metrics can be used to figure out data separation?
