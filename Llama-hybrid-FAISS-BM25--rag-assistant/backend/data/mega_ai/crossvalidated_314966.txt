Post-Match Analysis After Already Adjusting For Everything

Let's say I am conducting an observational study in which a group that received treatment (T+) is matched to another group (T-) using propensity score analysis where I use the "throw-the-kitchen-sink" methodology and include all risk variables. My question is when doing post-match analysis with conditional logistic regression, is my categorical variable the outcome variable with only one risk variable (the treatment)? For example, if I use clogit would it look like: clogit(outcome ~ treatment, data) or is it possible I would need to still adjust for additional risk variables which have been shown in the literature to affect the outcome variable (even though when performing matching, I have already adjusted for all these variables): clogit(outcome ~ treatment + riskVariable1 + riskVariable2, data)
