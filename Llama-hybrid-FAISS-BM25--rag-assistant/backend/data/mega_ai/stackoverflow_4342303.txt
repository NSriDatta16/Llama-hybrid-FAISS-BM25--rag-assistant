I think VueMinder Calendar Lite will do what you're looking for. It loads as a background process when Windows starts, and will provide reminders without needing to be opened. On my system, it uses only around 8 MB of RAM and Process Lasso shows average CPU usage over several hours to be one-tenth of one percent when it's running in the background. It's pretty amazing how much cool stuff has been crammed into it, while hardly using any CPU or memory. Even better - it's free! http://www.vueminder.com
