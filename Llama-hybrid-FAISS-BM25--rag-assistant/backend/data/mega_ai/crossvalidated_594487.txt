You can always apply transformations to your x and y values before doing Bayesian Linear Regression. This looks a lot like power-law to me, so I would try taking the logarithm of both x and y. Here the assumption is that y is log-normally distributed for a given x. If that isn't enough you can first transform your y data to cover the entire reals and then apply a Gaussian Processes, which assumes that the transformed ys are joint normally distributed for a set of xs.
