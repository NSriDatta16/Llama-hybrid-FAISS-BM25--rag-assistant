DL is a subset of ML, so I'll comment on ML particularly. You'd be wrong because classification, although an important one, is only one of the tasks we perform. Some other problems addressed by ML methods can be listed as follows: Regression (many classification algortihms also do regression) Clustering (k-means, hierarchical clustering etc.) Dimensionality reduction (autoencoders, pca, t-sne etc.) ... It's even possible that classification problems can be though of as regression of the probability that the given sample belongs to a certain class or not.
