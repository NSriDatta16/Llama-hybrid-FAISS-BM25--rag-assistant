Lift from a Django developer's point of view

I'm currently looking at Lift - and coming from Django it seems like it is much less elegant (and more messy?). There does not seem to be a standard "good" way of doing things in Lift. There is no MVC, nice templates, etc... Have any django (or even rails) people tried lift - and if so, did you have any success?
