The cross validation (CV) and the generalized cross validation (GCV) statistics

I have found possibly conflicting definitions for the cross validation (CV) statistic and for the generalized cross validation (GCV) statistic associated with a linear model $Y = X\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\varepsilon$ (with a normal, homoscedastic error vector $\boldsymbol\varepsilon$). On the one hand, Golub, Heath & Wahba define the GCV estimate $\hat{\lambda}$ as (p. 216) the minimizer of $V\left(\lambda\right)$ given by $$ V\left(\lambda\right) = \frac{\frac{1}{n} \left\|\left(I - A\left(\lambda\right)\right)y\right\|^2}{\left(\frac{1}{n} \mathrm{tr}\left(I - A\left(\lambda\right)\right)\right)^2} $$ where $A\left(\lambda\right) = X\left(X^T X + n\lambda I\right)^{-1} X^T$ On the other hand, Efron defines the same concept as $V\left(0\right)$ (p. 24), yet he attributes the introduction of this concept to Craven & Wahba, where its definition (p. 377) is essentially the same as Golub, Heath & Wahba's above mentioned definition. Does this mean that $0$ minimizes $V\left(\lambda\right)$? Similarly, Golub, Heath & Wahba define the CV estimate of $\lambda$ (p. 217) as the minimizer of $$ P\left(\lambda\right) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n \left(\left[X \beta^{(k)}\left(\lambda\right)\right]_k - y_k\right)^2 $$ where $\beta^{\left(k\right)}\left(\lambda\right)$ is the estimate $$ \hat{\beta}\left(\lambda\right) = \left(X^T X + n \lambda I\right)^{-1} X^T y $$ of $\beta$ with the $k$th data point $y_i$ omitted. The authors attribute the introduction of the CV estimate (also called the PRESS estimate) to Allen ("Allen's PRESS", ibid.) Yet in Allen's paper, the PRESS estimate is defined (p. 126) as $n P\left(0\right)$ (in Efron's article it is defined as $P\left(0\right)$ (p. 24)). Again, does this mean that $0$ minimizes $P\left(\lambda\right)$? Allen, David M. The Relationship Between Variable Selection and Data Agumentation and a Method for Prediction.
