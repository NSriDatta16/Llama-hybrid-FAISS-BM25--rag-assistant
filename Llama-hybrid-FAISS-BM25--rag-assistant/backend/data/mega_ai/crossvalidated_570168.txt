The bottom line of this answer is that the difference of the means is proportional to the area between the lines, and the constant of proportionality is just the range of the Days . So you might as well use the difference of the means and let it go at that. If you do EMM then a reference grid is created consisting of the four combinations of the two drugs at the lowest and highest values of Days , then the predictions are averaged over the two days. Then pairs(EMM) ... takes the difference between those two means. Note that if the two lines in your picture have end values $y_{11}$ and $y_{12}$ for the first line and $y_{21}$ and $y_{22}$ , then this result is equal to $\frac12(y_{11} + y_{12} - y_{21} - y_{22})$ . Meanwhile, it is easy to show (see below) that the area between the two lines is $\frac b2(y_{11} + y_{12} - y_{21} - y_{22})$ where $b = t_{max} - t_{min}$ , the range of the Days variable. Thus, the AUC is in fact the constant $b$ times the result of pairs(EMM) . Thus, comparing those two means is essentially the same as computing the area between the lines. To show that the area is as shown, first consider the case where the lines do not intersect; then we have a trapezoid of area $b$ times the average of the left difference and the right difference, which is the same as $b$ times the difference of the averages. Now, if the upper line is lowered by $\epsilon$ , then the area is decreased by $b\epsilon$ and it keeps decreasing linearly even when the lines cross (where we then have the difference of areas of two triangles). If you have curves instead of lines, then instead of cov.reduce = range , use at = list(Days = c(...)) and put in several equally-spaced values spanning the minimum to the maximum.
