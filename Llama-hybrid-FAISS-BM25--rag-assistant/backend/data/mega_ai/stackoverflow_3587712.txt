iPhone resizing UIView on rotation problem

I setup in IB in portrait mode my main view (for iPad). I have a toolbar, a map view (x=0, y=44, w=768, h=774) and a footer view (x=0, y=818, w=768, h=186). When I rotate the iPad, I want the map to stay on the left side and be resized vertically to fit the view (x=0, y=44, w=756, h=704) and put the footer view on the right side (x=0, y=818, w=768, h=186) and extend vertically too. Anyway, the effect is exactly the same as the WeatherBug application. I don't know how they do that, but their view containing the information is rotating by 90 degrees with the UIScrollView and UIPageView, I have basically the same needs and really don't know how to make this. Do they have everything in the same xib? I'm so confused... Please tell me if you know how to do/organize a such view! Thank you...
