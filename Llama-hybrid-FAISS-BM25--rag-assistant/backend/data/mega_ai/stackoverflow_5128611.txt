A session will only be created once your code requests the session so if your application doesn't require the session then just simply dont access it. Checkout the section on getSession() in HttpServletRequest http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#getSession(boolean ) I'm not sure if there is a way to replicate the session across different tomcat instances however if you require some user state without session then you can use cookies instead. EDIT: If you do need to replicate the session you could probably start by reading this tomcat document. http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/cluster-howto.html
