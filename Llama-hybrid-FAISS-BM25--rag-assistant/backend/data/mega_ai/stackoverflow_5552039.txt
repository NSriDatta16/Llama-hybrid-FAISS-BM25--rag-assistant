JOINS and INTERSECTS work fine as a substitute for IN , but they're not so obvious as a substitute for NOT IN , e.g.: inserting rows from TableA into TableB where they don't already exist in TableB where the PK on both tables is a composite. I am currently using the concatenation method above in SQL Server, but it's not a very elegant solution.
