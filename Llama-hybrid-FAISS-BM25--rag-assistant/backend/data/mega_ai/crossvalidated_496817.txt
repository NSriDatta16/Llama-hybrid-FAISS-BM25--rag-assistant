Traditional neural network consists of linear maps and Lipschitiz activation function. As a composition of Lischitz continuous functions, neural network is also Lipschitz continuous, but multiplication is not Lipschitz continuous. This means that neural network cannot approximate multiplication when one of the x or y goes too large.
