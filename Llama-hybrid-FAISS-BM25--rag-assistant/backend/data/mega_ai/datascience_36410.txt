How to deal with Optional Input

I'm from the vision world and only worked with pixels from 0-255, ignoring any side effects. My current problem is different, in the way that I cannot rely on the input data. What my problem is: I have a number of inputs. Each input is categorical (for now) and optional. For example I have a number of user features, {male, female, [..not given]}, {single, relationship, â€¦ , [..not given]}, .. What I want: X optional Input-Features mapped to Y Output-Features, with uniform output vales across the features. I tried kernel pca, different kinds of matric factorization for guessing missing inputs and simple autoencoder networks. By sight, the last two yield "ok" results. Any advice here?
