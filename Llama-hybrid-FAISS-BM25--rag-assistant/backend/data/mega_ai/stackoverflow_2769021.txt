Take a closer look at the paths in the error messages: . /uploads/saiyanz2k/images/banner/azumanga-wall.jpg /services7/webpages/util/s/a/saiya.site.aplus.net/helixagent.com/public/upload2.php The destination is a relative path, most likely relative to upload2.php's directory. The one relative path I see is the line: // Take directory and break it down into folders $dir = "uploads\\{$username}\\images\\banner\\thumbs"; Which should probably be: // Take directory and break it down into folders $dir = "\\uploads\\{$username}\\images\\banner\\thumbs"; Actually, it should be $dir = "/uploads/{$username}/images/banner/thumbs"; since PHP supports using a forward slash as directory separator on all platforms, while the backslash is only supported on MS platforms.
