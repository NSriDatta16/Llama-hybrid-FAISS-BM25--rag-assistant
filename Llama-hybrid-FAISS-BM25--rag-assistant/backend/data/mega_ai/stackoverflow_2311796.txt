How to pass data from Google App Engine(Python) to Flex 4 application

I am using python and webapp framework in app engine for backend and flex 4 for front end. I would like to pass a string form backend to front end, so i write the following code in the main.py: class MainPage(webapp.RequestHandler): def get(self): userVO = "test" template_values = { 'url': self.request.uri, 'userVO': userVO, } self.response.out.write(template.render("templates/index.html", template_values)) And in the flex 4, I have the following code: var user:String = FlexGlobals.topLevelApplication.parameters['userVO']; However, I receive null value. Please advice how to correct it. Thanks. Edit: 25 Feb. Thanks for the people who answer my question. For my question, I am try to figure out how the python app engine pass data to flex app when it render the html file that include the swf file. Maybe, there is something I can set in the main.py, swfobject.js or the index.html to do my task. I know how to use Pyamf as a gateway to serve the flex app, I am thinking how to make the app more simple. Thanks. Edit: 28 Feb. Robert, the index.html is the standard file created by flash builder 4. Wish you can give me some hints how to modify it. The following is the file: html, body { height:100%; } body { margin:0; padding:0; overflow:hidden; text-align:center; } #flashContent { display:none; } var swfVersionStr = "10.0.0"; var xiSwfUrlStr = "/swfs/playerProductInstall.swf"; var flashvars = {}; var params = {}; params.quality = "high"; params.bgcolor = "#ffffff"; params.allowscriptaccess = "sameDomain"; var attributes = {}; attributes.id = "index"; attributes.name = "index"; attributes.align = "middle"; swfobject.embedSWF( "/swfs/index.swf", "flashContent", "100%", "100%", swfVersionStr, xiSwfUrlStr, flashvars, params, attributes); swfobject.createCSS("#flashContent", "display:block;text-align:left;"); To view this page ensure that Adobe Flash Player version 10.0.0 or greater is installed. Either scripts and active content are not permitted to run or Adobe Flash Player version 10.0.0 or greater is not installed. Thanks, Robert. Edit: 7 Mar. Robert, Refer to http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Flex/4.0/html/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf626ae-7feb.html Before I post the question here, I tried the following code: In the index.html, and also flashvars.userVO = " "; The result, I get: Do you know why I can't get the correct data. Thanks.
