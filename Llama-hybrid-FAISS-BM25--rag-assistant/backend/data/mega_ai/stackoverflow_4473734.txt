Karen Liu of the C# IDE team responded to this in a feedback report : Thanks for submitting this suggestion. This is something we are aware of and had tried to do as a Design Change Request before. Ultimately, based on cost to implement this where we were in the product cycle, we made the tough decision that since references would be something you would need to add only once, this did not make it into VS2005. This is something we are looking to do in the future though and hearing feedback on this is valuable. Only nine upvotes, not enough to make it a popular request. I'd recommend you vote it up, they do pay attention to that.
