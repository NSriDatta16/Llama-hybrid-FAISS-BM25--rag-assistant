I set up something for my wife to link work samples during a job search. I used smoothgallery ( http://smoothgallery.jondesign.net/ ) which is very lightweight. It is just the gallery UI essentially, and basically rewrites the DOM for a specially tagged unordered list if I remember correctly. So the gallery organization is up to you, but its as easy as a little php + mysql to output the list.
