Maximum Dimensionality of AWS Machine Learning

I am toying with AWS Machine Learning and I have a dataset with about 200 records with about 220,000 variables each. Apparently, AWS Machine Learning has a hard limit of 1000 variables . How can I still analyse my dataset through AWS ML? Should I apply a MDR procedure through my 200 x 200000 dataset or should I split my variables into chunks of 1000 and combine them somehow after processing each of those chunks through AWS ML?
