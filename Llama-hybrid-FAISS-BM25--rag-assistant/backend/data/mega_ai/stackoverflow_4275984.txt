How to convert decimal to string value for dollars and cents separated in C#?

I need to display decimal money value as string, where dollars and cents are separate with text in between. 123.45 => "123 Lt 45 ct" I came up with the following solution: (value*100).ToString("#0 Lt 00 ct"); However, this solution has two drawbacks: Upon showing this solution to a fellow programmer, it appears to be unintuitive and requires some explaining. Cents are allways displayed as two digits. (Not real problem for me, as currently this is how I need it to be displayed.) Is there any alternative elegant and simple solution?
