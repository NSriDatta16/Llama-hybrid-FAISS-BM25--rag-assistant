I spent some time looking for a decent directory script for WP myself and never really found anything that was better than merely average. Your question finally got me motivated enough to make a big list of them, so I made a big post on my blog today with a heap of link index / article site scripts . Surprisingly I found a pretty decent article/directory solution for wordpress when I was nearly finished. That being said, after looking at dozens and dozens of link/article scripts today, I think there's betters solutions than WP if you're serious about that sort of site. WSN links, and the article script that same company makes would be my personal choice. The problem with those sorts of sites (compared to a personal blog) is that you're suddenly dealing with lots of other webmasters changing things around on you, so you've really got to have decent tools to check links and make sure it's all OK and what you linked to originally, otherwise you're going to lose surfers. Hope that helps :)
