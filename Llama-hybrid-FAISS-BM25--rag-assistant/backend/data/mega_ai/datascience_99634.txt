Which kind of technique is used for classifying a graph datastructure?

I have a 3D surface from which I extract certain spatial parameters like extremas and their locations (a.k.a coordinates), which then I convert into a bipartite graph with distance between them as edges. Now, using MST, I reduce it to a tree. This end structure is supposed to represent a lower dimensional version of the above surface. Now, I assign a label to the graph (actually, I get two graphs for 1 label) I need to pass this data set to a supervised classifier to get an output. But, CNNs and RNNs seem not to work on graph data. Is there a way to input Graph and get a classified label?
