How to parse text fragments located outside tags (inbetween tags) by simplehtmldom?

I'm using simplehtmldom to parse html and I'm stuck in parsing plaintext located outside of any tag (but between two different tags): Аdress: 7 Hange Road Phone: 415641587484 Contact: Alex Meeting Time: 12:00-13:00 Is it possible to get these values of Adress, Phone, Contact, Meeting Time? I wonder if there is a opportunity to pass CSS Selectors into nextSibling/previousSibling functions... foreach($html->find('div.text_small') as $div_descr) { foreach($div_descr->find('b') as $b) { if ($b->innertext=="Аdress:") {//someaction } if ($b->innertext=="Phone:") { //someaction } if ($b->innertext=="Contact:") { //someaction } if ($b->innertext=="Meeting Time:") { //someaction } } } What I should use instead "someaction" ? upd. Yes, I don't have an access for editing the target page. Otherwise, would it be worth to? :)
