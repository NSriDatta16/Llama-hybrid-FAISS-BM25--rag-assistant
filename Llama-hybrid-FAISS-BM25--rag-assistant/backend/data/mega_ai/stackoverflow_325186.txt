What are the benefits of R6RS Scheme's make-variable-transformer?

While looking at the syntax-case section in R6RS, I saw the keyword make-variable-transformer , described as an identifier macro . The example given is very minimal, and I am not groking why it is necessary, or what use-cases require it. Finding additional examples of its use is also proving difficult. Presumably it makes some form of syntax transformation possible, or more elegant?
