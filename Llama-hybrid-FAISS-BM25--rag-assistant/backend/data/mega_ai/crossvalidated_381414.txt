Word for loss function except weight regularization?

A typical loss function in machine learning is: $$L(\theta,x) = \mathcal L(\theta,x) +\sum_{\theta} |\theta|$$ I typically use the word “loss function” both for $L(\theta,x)$ and for $\mathcal L(\theta,x)$ . What terminology is there to distinguish these? How do I refer to $L(\theta,x)$ ? how do I refer to $\mathcal L(\theta,x) $ ?
