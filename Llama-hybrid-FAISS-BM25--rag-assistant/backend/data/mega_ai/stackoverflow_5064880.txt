Are you sure you can raise errors inside a query like that? I can't find it anywhere. I think the proper way would be to select a COUNT or EXISTS and return the result of that INTO a variable. Then, after the query, raise an error if the result doesn't meet your expectations. Something like this: SELECT count(id) INTO IDCOUNT FROM products WHERE id = NEW.brand_id; Wouldn't it be better by the way to just add a real constraint? Or do you use a storage type that doesn't support that?
