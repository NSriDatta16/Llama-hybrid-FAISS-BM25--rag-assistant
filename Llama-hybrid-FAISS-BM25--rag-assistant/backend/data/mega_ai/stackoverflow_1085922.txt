Delegates are used to "call" code in other classes (that might not necessarily be in the same, class, or .cs or even the same assembly). In your example, delegates can simply be replaced by if statements like you pointed out. However, delegates are pointers to functions that "live" somewhere in the code where for organizational reasons for instance you don't have access to (easily).
