The thing about the SQL language is that it is pretty much a static target. Pretty soon you are looking at increasing your understanding of set theory and the problem domain itself rather than the details of the language. The real meat is on either side of the language, in either the databases themselves (how to store, retrieve, and organize large data sets) or in the applications (with ORMs and such)
