How do I get a Springer book which reference proofs for time series linear and non-linear regression?

I am sure people know Springer has a lot of math/stat books some of which proofs. Was wondering if people know which books have proofs on the following. I have browsed through a lot of them in the library but could not find enough info for them. Time series Linear regression Non-linear regression Was wondering if someone could make some recommendations ? This is a cross-post but I got no reply there: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2177104/how-do-i-get-a-springer-book-reference-of-proofs-for-time-series-linear-non-linear-models .
