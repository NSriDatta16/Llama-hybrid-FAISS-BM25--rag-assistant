When does the sum of the medians = the median of the sum

I have two random variables (say x1 and x2) defined by empirical probability distributions, and would like to calculate the median of their sum. Under what circumstances (in terms of the distributions of x1 and x2) can I assume the median of the sum is equal to the sum of the medians i.e. median(x1) + median(x2). (1) The alternative approach I've used is to randomly generate large samples of x1 and x2 and then calculate the median as median(sample of x1 + sample of x2). (2) Approach (1) is quicker and I need to do this calculation many times. Under what circumstances is approach 1 approximately correct? Are their alternatives to my second approach? I've seen this Q&A What does it mean if the median or average of sums is greater than sum of those of addends? ---- Additional information after reading the comments If we have two normally distributed random variables then median of the sum is approximately the sum of the medians N1 This doesn't work for exponential variables set.seed(2002) e1 So, looking at @glen_b's comment, is symmetry the sufficient condition that would allow the assumption that the median of the sum is the sum of the medians?
