Is there a difference between hierarchical GAM (HGAM) and Mixed effect GAM (GAMM)?

What is the difference between Hierarchical GAMs (HGAM) and Mixed GAMs (GAMM), if any? I am looking to model time series of count data against a range of candidate explanatory variables (hoping to understand which environmental parameters could explain the fluctuations). I have a year of data at 7 sites, quite different from each other in terms of environment, but not completely independent (species can easily move from one to another). I struggle to identify which of the two frameworks would be the most appropriate. A HGAM with grouping per site, or a GAMM with site as a random variable... Is there any key difference I am missing here? Thank you for any advice!
