If the template fragment you're trying to cache can't be pickled, memcached won't be able to store it and will raise an exception. From what I can gather, exceptions generated when rendering Django templates are suppressed. Since your custom tag is doing HTTP requests, maybe socket objects (which can't be pickled) are getting stored to the template fragment somehow. If this is the case, the only way around it I can think of would be to modify the custom tag to get rid of any leftover socket objects.
