Honestly, unless you're into "bleeding edge", I would stay away from OO databases. In almost all cases, they're not well supported, immature, and have various support issues client side. The problem is, only the relational databases (and certain non-relational ones) get 99% of the attention, and thus end up far more mature. ORM may be a workaround, but if you want reliability, it's really what you need. UPDATE: To clarify, I'm sure there are some very reliable open source OODB's out there, but my requirements for "realiability" are more than just whether it doesn't crash and doesn't corrupt data. It includes reliability of the client connectors, reliability of the integration with the object models of popular languages, etc... This is about open source OODB's, not commercial ones.
