I will take the example of your first question "do you have health insurance ?" with "yes" or "no" being the response variables. I would build a model (glm for binomial distribution) along the lines of answer~ race + gender + income + county of residence and then use the MuMIn package to see what variables receive the most support. Then within the ones which do not have health insurance, I would use a multinomial logistic regression with the same model structure. You can read more about these here : https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/05/multinomial-logistic-regression-with-r/ If you follow this link, go directly to "Setting the reference level". In your case "adi" "car" "con" "other" would be "Can't afford it" "Don't know how to sign up" "Not eligible due to immigration status". Maybe you would prefer this example here : https://quantifyinghealth.com/multinomial-logistic-regression-in-r/ Of course if your first question already has more than 2 possible answers, you can directly use a multinomial logistic regression. Apparently the MuMIn package works fine with multinomial regressions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19465641/bad-compatibility-of-mumin-with-multinom-nnet-objects-having-3-level-response The downside of this being that you will basically have one model per question, but I do not think you can avoid this.
