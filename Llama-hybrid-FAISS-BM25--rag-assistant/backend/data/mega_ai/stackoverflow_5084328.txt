Using weka for the first time is a pain, but you will need to go through it. Also, I tried out weka, but I had to dump it due to JVM out of memory exceptions. I wrote my own small clustering algo using Ruby, it's performance was way better. Any way, here is how to use SVM in WEKA: You can follow this tutorial of how to use SVM in weka: www.stat.nctu.edu.tw/~misg/WekaInC.ppt Now, you will need data in ARFF format (and I recommend you use this, as per my exp, it helps, data looks more structured from WEKA's prespective). So, you can do that using XML2ARFF-Converter which I wrote for my self. You can modify it to read text files and convert your text file to ARFF.
