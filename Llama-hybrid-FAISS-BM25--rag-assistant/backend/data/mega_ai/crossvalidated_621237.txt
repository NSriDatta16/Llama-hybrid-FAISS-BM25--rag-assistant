Let's say I'm running a model to predict getting a job (so the dependent variable is 1 for people who have a job and 0 for those who do not). Let's say that I have one independent variable that I really care about - attending a job training program - and a bunch of control variables. The model gives me a coefficient for the job training variable, which is positive and significant. This tells me that, holding all other variables constant, attending the training program is associated with a higher probability of having a job. But HOW much higher? The coefficient, as you note, doesn't help me answer this question. But neither does transforming it into an odds ratio. An odds ratio tells me how much the "odds" of having a job change, but we want to know how the PROBABILITY changes, and odds and probabilities are different things (the odds of Y are the probability of Y divided by the probability of not-Y). This is a problem because often when you report odds ratios people will think you are reporting "risk ratios" how the probability of Y changes. But an odds ratio will always be an overestimate of the size of the risk ratio, sometimes by a lot. This is one major reason why odds ratios are discouraged - they aren't that interpretable but people often think they are. Average marginal effects are ONE way of answering the question that people actually care about - how much the probability of the outcome changes. In this case, the AME tells you the "risk difference" - that the probability of getting a job increased by X percentage points. You could also hold the control variables at mean or modal values, calculate the predicted probability for similar cases who did and didn't get the treatment and divide those two numbers to get a risk ratio. The downside of these approaches, AMEs and predicted probabilities, is that you have to calculate them separately, and you have to make some choice about what to hold all the other covariates at, and that choice will impact the result. This is just a consequence of dealing with probabilities, since they are bounded between 0 and 1. This is NOT an issue with IRRs or hazard ratios however. The Cox and negative binomial models are not nonlinear in the same way as a logit model, so these ratios can be interpreted as changes in the thing you actually care about: the hazard ratio or rate.
