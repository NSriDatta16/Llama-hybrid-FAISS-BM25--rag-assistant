How about generating a synthetic binary target variable first and then running a logistic regression model? The synthetic variable should be something like... "If the observation is in the top decile on all of the input variable distributions flag it as 1 else 0" Having generated the binary target variable... Run logistic regression to come up with probabilistic metric 0 to 1 assesing how far/close in the tails of multiple distributions observation is?
