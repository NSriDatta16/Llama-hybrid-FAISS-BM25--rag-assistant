C# Out of Memory when Creating Bitmap

I'm creating an application (Windows Form) that allows the user to take a screenshot based on the locations they choose (drag to select area). I wanted to add a little "preview pane" thats zoomed in so the user can select the area they want more precisely (larger pixels). On a mousemove event i have a the following code... private void falseDesktop_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { zoomBox.Image = showZoomBox(e.Location); zoomBox.Invalidate(); bmpCrop.Dispose(); } private Image showZoomBox(Point curLocation) { Point start = new Point(curLocation.X - 50, curLocation.Y - 50); Size size = new Size(100, 90); Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(start, size); Image selection = cropImage(falseDesktop.Image, rect); return selection; } private static Bitmap bmpCrop; private static Image cropImage(Image img, Rectangle cropArea) { if (cropArea.Width != 0 && cropArea.Height != 0) { Bitmap bmpImage = new Bitmap(img); bmpCrop = bmpImage.Clone(cropArea, bmpImage.PixelFormat); bmpImage.Dispose(); return (Image)(bmpCrop); } return null; } The line that fails and has the Out of Memory exception is: bmpCrop = bmpImage.Clone(cropArea, bmpImage.PixelFormat); Basically what this does is it takes a 100x90 rectangle around the mouse pointer and pulls that into the zoomBox, which is a picturebox control. However, in the process, i get an Out Of Memory error. What is it that i am doing incorrectly here? Thanks for your assistance.
