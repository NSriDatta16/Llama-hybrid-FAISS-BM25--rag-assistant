Which loss function to use for autoencoders, if the inputs are binary features [0/1]?

Let's say I have the following dataset: A|B|C -|-|- 1|0|0 0|1|0 1|1|0 0|1|1 .|.|. .|.|. .|.|. I want to use the above dataset as input to an autoencoder. I did do some research and found that the best loss function to use given such a dataset is the sigmoid cross entropy loss function . I used the implementation in tensorflow. The following is the description of the loss function: Measures the probability error in discrete classification tasks in which each class is independent and not mutually exclusive. For instance, one could perform multilabel classification where a picture can contain both an elephant and a dog at the same time. Can the above loss function be used? If yes, are there any limitations?
