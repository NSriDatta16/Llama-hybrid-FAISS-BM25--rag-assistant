If you have a managed switch of some kind, you could probably connect to that, that would be a fairly elegant method. If you're on a domain, you can can get a list of all the machines joined to the domain from the domain controller. Failing that, all I can think of is either a challenge/response thing (e.g. pinging them) or by detecting traffic sent from them (see this question maybe as a starting point?), neither of which strike me as an elegant approach.
