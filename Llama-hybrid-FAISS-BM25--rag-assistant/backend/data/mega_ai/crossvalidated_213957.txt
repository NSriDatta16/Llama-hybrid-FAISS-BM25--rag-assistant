Why do the loadings returned by psych::principal() in R change with the number of components?

I have been using the principal() function of the psych package in R and setting the number of components after a scree plot analysis ( fa.parallel ). But I don't understand why the number of components are important to the principal() function. In any case the principal component of the data should not change with the number of component you setup, or am I mistaken? In my mind the subspace and explained variance should not change... First component should be the one explaining the most variance, the second with the most residual variance orthogonal to the first component etc.. no ? In contrast, princomp for example does not ask for the number of components... it makes more sense to me. set.seed(23434) X = seq(-5,10,0.2) X = X + (rnorm(n = NROW(X),mean = 0, sd = 2)) Z = sample(x = seq(-4,12,0.1), size = NROW(X))+(rnorm(n = NROW(X),mean = 0, sd = 2)) Y = 2*X+Z+(rnorm(n = NROW(X),mean = 0, sd = 2))+3 # center the data Ycent = Y - mean(Y) Xcent = X - mean(X) Zcent = Z - mean(Z) # scree plot to determine the number of components fa.parallel(data.frame(X=Xcent, Y=Ycent,Z=Zcent)) # compare different PCA methods principal(data.frame(X=Xcent, Y=Ycent,Z=Zcent)) principal(data.frame(X=Xcent, Y=Ycent,Z=Zcent), nfactors = 2) principal(data.frame(X=Xcent, Y=Ycent,Z=Zcent), nfactors = 3) a =princomp(data.frame(X=Xcent, Y=Ycent,Z=Zcent)) loadings(a) # Results > fa.parallel(data.frame(X=Xcent, Y=Ycent,Z=Zcent)) Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = 2 and the number of components = 1 > > # compare different PCA methods > principal(data.frame(X=Xcent, Y=Ycent,Z=Zcent)) Principal Components Analysis Call: principal(r = data.frame(X = Xcent, Y = Ycent, Z = Zcent)) Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix PC1 h2 u2 com X 0.89 0.79 0.213 1 Y 1.00 0.99 0.006 1 Z 0.46 0.21 0.792 1 PC1 SS loadings 1.99 Proportion Var 0.66 Mean item complexity = 1 Test of the hypothesis that 1 component is sufficient.

Shouldn't the first one explain the most variance ?
