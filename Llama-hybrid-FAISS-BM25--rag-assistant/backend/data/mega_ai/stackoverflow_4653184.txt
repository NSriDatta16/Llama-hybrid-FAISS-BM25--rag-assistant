If you're always doing the same operation (e.g., putchar), you can just statically initialize an array that maps to what each character should map. You could then access the proper mapping value by smartly accessing the array per the offset of the incoming character. For example, (in pseudo-code -- it's been awhile since I wrote in C), you would define: const char* [] map = {"NUL", "SOH, ...}; and then index that smartly via something like: const char* val = map[((int)ch)]; to get your value. You would not be able to use this if your "from" values are not sequential; in that case, you would need to have some conditional blocks. But if you can leverage the sequentiality, you should.
