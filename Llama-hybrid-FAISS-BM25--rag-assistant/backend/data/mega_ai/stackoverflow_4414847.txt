The problem and solution to this issue is actually extremely simple. Calling [self.navigationController popToRootViewControllerAnimated:YES] sets self.navigationController to nil . When you subsequently call [self.navigationController pushViewController:someOtherViewController] you are effectively sending a message to nil , which does nothing. To workaround, simply set up a local reference to the navigationController and use that instead: UINavigationController * navigationController = self.navigationController; [navigationController popToRootViewControllerAnimated:NO]; [navigationController pushViewController:someOtherViewController animated:YES]; As stated by Jason, the popToRootViewController must be performed without animation for this to work correctly. Thanks go to jpimbert on the Apple forums for pointing this out.
