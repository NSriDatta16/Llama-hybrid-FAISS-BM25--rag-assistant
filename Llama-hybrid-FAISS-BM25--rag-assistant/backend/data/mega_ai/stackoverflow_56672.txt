How do you profile your code?

I hope not everyone is using Rational Purify. So what do you do when you want to measure: time taken by a function peak memory usage code coverage At the moment, we do it manually [using log statements with timestamps and another script to parse the log and output to excel. phew...) What would you recommend? Pointing to tools or any techniques would be appreciated! EDIT: Sorry, I didn't specify the environment first, Its plain C on a proprietary mobile platform
