First things first, C's stringification can help you make multiline-strings easier on the eyes: char *script = "expect -c 'spawn ssh user@host cat /proc/stat\n\n" "expect {\n" "-re \".*yes/no.*\"\n" "send \"yes\\r\"\n" ... The compiler will happily smash all those strings together for you. Note of course that the \n are turned into newline characters in the string at compile time, while \\r is turned into \r in the string at compile time, which expect is hopefully turning into a carriage return at run time. Second thing, are you sure embedding an expect script into an executable program is the right approach? Perhaps the host you are logging into will change along the way; replacing the script is much easier if it is broken out separate from the executable. (I can't tell you how many hundreds of pppd chat scripts I have written in my life, I'm just glad it didn't require a recompile of pppd to make them work!)
