The accuracy of my validation set is always the same

I am training a CNN model which is used for a multi-label classification task. My training data set has 5000 data points, every data point is a 100000 long 1-D array. So the shape of my training set is (5000,100000). The CNN model . The picture shows the structure of my CNN model. The problem I have encountered right now is that the accuracy of my validation set is always the exactly same (always 0.88) no matter how I modify the model. Epoch 1/10 79/79 [==============================] - 36s 445ms/step - loss: 0.3915 - binary_accuracy: 0.8705 - val_loss: 0.3892 - val_binary_accuracy: 0.8800 Epoch 2/10 79/79 [==============================] - 34s 426ms/step - loss: 0.3711 - binary_accuracy: 0.8800 - val_loss: 0.3714 - val_binary_accuracy: 0.8800 Epoch 3/10 79/79 [==============================] - 34s 425ms/step - loss: 0.3702 - binary_accuracy: 0.8800 - val_loss: 0.3872 - val_binary_accuracy: 0.8800 I have tried to change the number of filter and kernel size, the number of layers, and the convelutional function(I used CONV2D before). And I've standardized my data set. I want to know what might be contributing to this problem, or where I can modify in my model. Thank you in advance for your help! Any possible aspect would be very helpful to me. I want to understand why this is happening and where I can make adjustments.
