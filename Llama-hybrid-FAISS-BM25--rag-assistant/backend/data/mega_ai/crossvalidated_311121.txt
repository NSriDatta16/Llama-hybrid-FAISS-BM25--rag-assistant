Predicting gamma distribution using NN, using method of moments in loss function?

I'm trying to train a neural network on a time series that would predict the gamma distribution of time between 'events' in the next hour. I would like to do an empirical fit on the time between 'events' in order to get an α and β (parameters of the gamma dist.) that will be used as labels. My thought is that I want to have my final NN layer output two parameters α' and β' that will be used as parameters for predicted gamma distribution. However, I'm struggling to come up with a loss function that makes sense. Would using method of moments in my loss function be statistically sound? If I were to define the loss function as the squared error of the first, second, third,... moments as such: where α and β are the label's parameters and α' and β' are the outputs from my neural net. This loss function seems a little hackey, and I'm not sure if there's a better way to define it. Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated! Thanks alot!
