Good unit test should makeâ€¦ Easy to write tests Easy to organize your tests Easy to run tests (all, some, one) I also firstly had experience with NUnit and later moved to MSTest. In my opinion MSTest has 2 strength: it is much easy to create unit test for particular method and run test. The only problem with organising tests in group - that is what was easy to do with NUnit. More information regarding creating effective unit test for .Net also described here
