A bump in CV score curve! What does it mean?

My learning curve is behaving strangely and I don't know if I'm doing anything wrong or it is because of the dataset nature. I'm using a Neural network with (30,30,15,1) layers and 'ReLU' activation function for training and linear for the output layer. My learning curve is showing weird behavior while learning. There is a bump like increase and decrease in the validation curve around 100 epochs which I don't have any idea about the source or how to resolve it(or even if it is needed to be resolved). Can anybody help me with this? (Any related comments are welcomed)
