Instead of using all of the individual Glassfish jar files that you might need (such as gf-client-module.jar, imqjmsra.jar, and imqbroker.jar), the preferred method is to use the gf-client.jar file. It can be found at $GLASSFISH_HOME/lib. There is more information at http://glassfish.java.net/javaee5/ejb/EJB_FAQ.html#StandaloneRemoteEJB . That document pertains to using EJBs in standalone clients, but the solution is the same for using JMS.
