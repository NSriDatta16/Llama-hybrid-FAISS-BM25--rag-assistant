That is working as specified. The RFC ( http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt ) indicates that any character may be escaped, and your average printable character can be written in the \uXXXX format. Any JSON parser that cannot understand a character escaped in that way is not compliant with the standard. Work on resolving that problem rather than trying to coax PHP into misbehaving as well. (It is legal to put UTF-8 characters into JSON strings without escaping them as well, with a few exceptions, but the safe approach of escaping anything questionable is wise.)
