You can try using RCPServiceClient class in axis2. Here is the java doc for it: ws.apache.org/axis2/1_1_1/api/org/apache/axis2/rpc/client/RPCServiceClient.html It doesn't require you to generate code to call web services. Here is a decent example of how you can interact with a service using RPCServiceClient. ws.apache.org/axis2/1_2/pojoguide.html#testingpojows Do remember that java is strongly typed language so you can't do things like serviceClient->someRandomFunction(params), since someRandomFunction will not be defined ahead of time if you are trying to do something like PHP's SoapClient. However, it will be equivalent to $soapClient->_soapCall function, as you will be able to do something like serviceClient.invokeBlocking( opProcess, -- function you are trying to call.. opResponseArgs, -- these are arguments you are passing returnTypes); -- types that you are expecting back Hope this helps.
