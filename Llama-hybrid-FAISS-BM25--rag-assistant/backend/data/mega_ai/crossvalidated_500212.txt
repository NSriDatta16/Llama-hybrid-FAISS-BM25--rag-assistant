maximum reasonable sample size

I'm supposed to recommend a sample size for a nation wide measure. The population is at least several million. The objective is to calculate a monetary average. Last year, a sample size of 900 was used, and the sample average was 12, while the standard deviation of the average, as in As I understand it, if I were to aim for a 95% confidence interval and a 5% margin of error, the formula would be: But this leads to roughly n = 40,000, if I use that sigma value, which is over what is feasible. So this brings me to two questions: Is the computation completely wrong because I'm using a sigma that is estimated on a sample size that is too low? Is it safe to say, a lower sample size, such as 10,000 would be fine in all cases?
