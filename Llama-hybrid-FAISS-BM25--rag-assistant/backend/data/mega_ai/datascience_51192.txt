Very interesting question indeed. I will dare to give you an answer, but I could be changing it if I find a better reasoning about the problem after watching the data. Your problem is perhaps a problem of multi(many)-label classification, where your label is the country and your data is what you have as "patience", "risktaking", etc. You could work with random forest or decision trees but on the dataset containing all the individuals (not the summarised by country). Why on this dataset and not on the summarised? Because the summarised is summarised (!), and only has the data for the mean of "risktaking" (for example) and does not take into account the internal variance of risktakingness inside the countries. Is important to take this into account, because is possible that risktaking has a variance so large inside a country that is makes the variable meaningless to select a nationality for a person and this is not seen in the summarised database. If is mandatory that you run the model in the summarised dataset first, then the solution is this: You should run a tree where your node_size parameter is 1 , because your summarised dataset has "one individual (country) per label", this is a extreme case where you need a node leaf for every country.
