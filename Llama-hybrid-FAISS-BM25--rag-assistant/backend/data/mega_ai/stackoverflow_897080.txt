If you're using Rails, then it becomes a lot cleaner with rjs to update a div with some multiline HTML: page.replace__html 'lightbox_id', :partial => 'overlay' then overlay.html.erb would contain the raw html above without escaping. The added benefit is that the fragment 'overlay' could also be used in the initial page load as well, which in a lot of cases is what you want.
