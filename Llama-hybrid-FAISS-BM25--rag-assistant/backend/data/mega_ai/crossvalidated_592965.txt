Multilevel Logistic Regression with categorical variables

I want to explore the effect of time of a day on 4 different medicine types in a between group design. My data looks like: Medicine Type Participant Time of the day First 1 Between 9 am - 12 noon First 1 Between 12 noon - 3 pm First 1 Between 3 pm - 6 pm First 1 Between 6 pm - 9 pm First 1 Between 9 pm - 12am .... ... ... Fourth 160 Between 9 am - 12 noon I plan to analyze each row as one observation and perform multilevel logistic regression per category, predicting proportions of the 5 times of time of the day separately . So in such a model each row is one observation, with 5 rows per participant. With a random intercept per participant and a dependent measure that indicating whether this is between 9 am - 12 noon or not (and 4 more measures for the other 4 time of the day). I use lmer for this: fit02 where I coded each time of the day between 1 to 5, i.e., Between 9 am - 12 noon as 1 , Between 12 noon - 3 pm as 2 and so on.. My output is: REML criterion at convergence: 8069.5 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.8486 -0.8998 -0.1661 0.7278 2.3438 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Participant (Intercept) 0.1609 Residual 1.5826 Fixed effects: Estimate (Intercept) 2.31500 Second -0.23167 Third 0.01833 Fourth 0.08333 Std. Error (Intercept) 0.08162 Second 0.11542 Third 0.11542 Fourth 0.11542 t value (Intercept) 28.364 Second -2.007 Third 0.159 Fourth 0.722 Correlation of Fixed Effects: (Intr) MLM $CB MLM$ CH Second -0.707 Third -0.707 0.500 Fourth -0.707 0.500 0.500 Questions : a) Am I using the correct method to do the logistic regression? If yes, the effect of first medicine is not visible in lmer. b) How can I showcase which medicine type was significantly different than other for a specific time of the day?
