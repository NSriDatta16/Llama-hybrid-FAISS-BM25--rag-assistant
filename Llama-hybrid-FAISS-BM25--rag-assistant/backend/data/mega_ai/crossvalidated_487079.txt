Find the value that occurs most frequently or use the average?

If I were trying to predict the next number in a list of numbers based on past performance would it make sense to find the number that has occurred most frequently? For example, if I were to say based on some parameters an event has produced that numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15] and I want to predict what number will occur next could I do import numpy as np data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15] res = max(set(data), key = data.count) print(res) # 6 is this statistically valid? side note these numbers come from a high variance sample and won't be as uniform as the example. All of these numbers are average as well.
