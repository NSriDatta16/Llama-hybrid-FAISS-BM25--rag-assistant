ARIMA for daily data over 5 years - forecast package

I have a question to auto.arima and seasonality. I have to analyze 39 single datasets which are prices of futures or equities. There are missing data which I replace with na.approx. Then I calculate the log return of the data with ln and lead. I split each data set into a in sample (2013/10/1 – 2017/09/30) and out of sample part (2017/10/01-2018/09/30). I have to find an appropriate ARIMA Modell for each series which delivers good results in my foreacst. My calculated returns are stationary, tested it with ADF, KPSS and Philipps and Perron. First of all, I used auto.arima function. With regard to ACF and PACF of the residuals some of the model suggestions where not good, since ACFs and PACFs showed of the residuals where significant or showed a clear pattern. For these datasets I created AIRMA manually. Now having all models, I used the forecast function in R to get results. My MASE and RMSE where pretty bad for my forecasts (with auto.arima and manual arima) and the results tend to zero. One example of one dataset where auto.arima provided good results: d $date,format="%d.%m.%Y") require("tseries") require("forecast") DJCT DJCT DJCTaprx accuracy(forecast(arimaDJCTinsa, h=365), DJCTretOUTSA[1:365]) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE Training set -0.0001304150 0.008908426 0.006162879 NaN Inf 0.8182688 Test set 0.0003074467 0.010278043 0.006968379 -Inf Inf 0.9252182 ACF1 Training set 0.002305611 Test set NA Going through many blog posts of forecasting daily data and arima I wondered whether I had to add a seasonal component like fourier terms to improve my results. I used tsDJCT $aicc aicc) bestfit Or ets() function I always get 1 or no seasonality as result. Also findfrequency always showed (1) for all of my time series. Adding Fourier terms didn’t turn the AIC better. auto.arima(tsDJCT, xreg=fourier(tsDJCT, K=1), seasonal=FALSE) Series: tsDJCT Regression with ARIMA(1,0,1) errors Coefficients: ar1 ma1 S1-365 C1-365 0.4519 -0.3228 -7e-04 -3e-04 s.e. 0.1538 0.1633 4e-04 4e-04 sigma^2 estimated as 7.939e-05: log likelihood=4822.33 AIC=-9634.67 AICc=-9634.63 BIC=-9608.24 fcDJCT I tried to change the kind of time series and add the frequency with 365 which didn’t change my results. Can anybody help me with the following questions? Was my way to find seasonality within my data right? So I should exclude it? Since I only got results for “no seasonality” I think I can exclude msts, right? Am I using auto.arima in a wrong way since my forecast results are that bad? How can I improve my results for arima for better forecasts if seasoanliyt or trend is not a factor? Thank you!!!
