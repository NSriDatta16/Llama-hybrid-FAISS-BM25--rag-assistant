The idea is good, but Grails has this directory structure for a reason. The view folder is intended for a certain artifact type (views).. You could clone your view folder structure under web-inf, but that gives you more work as I guess the idea behind this is to keep related files close together for convenience reasons. Even though I'm not to excited about storing Javascript together with the view I loved Robert's idea of hooking into the build process by using build events to copy javascript sources into the right directory! If you decide to go down that road you might as well compress the sources while you're at it. ShrinkSafe is popular library.
