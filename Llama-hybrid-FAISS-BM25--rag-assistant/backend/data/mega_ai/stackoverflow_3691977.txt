I don't know anything about games programming, but I would imagine (based on intuition and what I've read in the past) that a complete grid will get very inefficient for large spaces; you'll lose out in both storage, and also in time, because you'll melt the cache. STL containers are fundamentally one-dimensional. Yes, things like set and map allow you to define arbitrary sort relationships, but it's still ordered in only one dimension. If you want to do better, you'll probably need to use a quad-tree, a kd-tree, or something like that.
