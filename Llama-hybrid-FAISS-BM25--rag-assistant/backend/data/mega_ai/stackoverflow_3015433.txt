LaTeX - vertical space equivalent of \makebox?

I'm making a LaTeX document and I'm getting success with \makebox , which puts text in an invisible box and will add extra horizontal whitespace to the end to make the whole thing fit within the size you specify. Is there something like that for vertical space? I have a few variable length paragraphs, images, etc. that I want to put in this vertical box. I want LaTeX to put in the right amount of vertical space (at the bottom) so that the whole thing is of the set size that I give it.
