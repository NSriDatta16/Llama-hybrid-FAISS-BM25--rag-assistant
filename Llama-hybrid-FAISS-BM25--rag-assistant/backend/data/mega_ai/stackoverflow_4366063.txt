The JQuery UI Autocomplete control can accept the list of search results as a set of Display/Value objects. From memory, you create a Json object in the following format... [ {label:"Display Name for result 1", value:1}, {label:"Display Name for result 2", value:2}, {label:"Display Name for result 3", value:3} ] The label property contains the text to display and the value proberty contains the id. These values can be inspected when a search result is selected by the user. The control has a select event that you can listen for.
