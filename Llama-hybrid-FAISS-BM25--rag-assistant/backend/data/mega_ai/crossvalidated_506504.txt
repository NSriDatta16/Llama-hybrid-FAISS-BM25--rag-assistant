Linear regression for main effect not interaction effect

I have a linear equation: lm(Connectivity ~ (Complex-Attention + Memory)*MDD, data = D) From this association I obtain a significant main effect but no interaction effect. Is it okay for me to report on the main effect? This would be interpreted as both (healthy controls and depressed) patients connectivity strength is significantly associated with complex attention, when memory is held constant. Is that correct?
