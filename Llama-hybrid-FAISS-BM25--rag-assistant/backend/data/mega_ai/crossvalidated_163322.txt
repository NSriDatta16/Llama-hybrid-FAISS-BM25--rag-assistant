Statistical Model: How much will my open bar at my wedding cost?

I am getting married in November in Mexico and after fidgeting with my wedding budget, I was wondering if anyone had any insight into how I should approach my problem. Thought it was relatively interesting enough to open it up to this community. I need to forecast/budget my open bar costs for my wedding. The objective would be to have some form of a model that I can say with a reasonable prediction interval, that my open bar costs will be X. Here is the information I have available to me. Number of Guests: 120 male/female ratio: ~50% 25-35 yrs old moderate drinkers: 75% 55+ light drinkers: 25% Weather: 70-80 degrees/beach Drink costs: Water/Soda: \$3 Beer \$5 Wine/Liquor: \$10 Duration: Wedding: 6 hours Bar: 5 hourse Average drink rates I have found online is one drink an hour but open to other suggestions based on better/more informed research. Anyone have any thoughts? I have done some basic statistical regressions and models, but am a novice. Feel free to ask questions and I will do my best to answer them.
