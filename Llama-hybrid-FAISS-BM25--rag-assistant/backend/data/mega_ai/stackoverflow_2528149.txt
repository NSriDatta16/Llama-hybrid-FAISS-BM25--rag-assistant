Integrating a C project in the iPhone SDK

This is my first time doing this sort of project so apologies if the question is silly. I've got a question about using a C project with a project in the iPhone SDK. I've dragged and dropped the C project into the iPhone project in Xcode (so it appears in the screenshot below). sjeng.h is a file inside GameEngine.xcodeproj, but when I try to include the header file, I not only receive an error, but the file it is looking for seems to be capitalized whereas the import statement is not. Does anyone know what the problem might be? Thanks!
