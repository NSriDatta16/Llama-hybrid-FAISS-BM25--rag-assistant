The other mutators were trying to use java.util.Date as a calendar, rather than as an instant in time, wrapping a number of milliseconds since Jan 1st 1970 12am UTC. As such, it makes sense for that one mutator not to be deprecated. The Date / Calendar APIs are still terrible of course, and you should still use Joda Time wherever possible - but I can see why that call wasn't deprecated. You can't make a type immutable after the fact, and that wasn't the point of the deprecation - the point was to try to stop people from using it as storage for "June 19th 1976" etc.
