I would say the first thing I am concerned with is: "#define SHIFT 0" Why not make use of a constant rather than a macro? As far as efficiency get, the constant allow to determine the type, thus making sure than no conversion will be needed afterwards. As for the efficiency of your technic: - first, get rid of the else clause (why set the bit to HIGH if its value is already HIGH ?) - second, prefer to have something readable first, inlined setters / getters using bit masking internally would do the job, be efficient and be readable. As for the storage, for C++ I would tend to use a bitset (combined with an enum).
