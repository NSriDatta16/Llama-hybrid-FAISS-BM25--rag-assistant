Adjusted $R^2$ and regression without an intercept

I am using $R^2$ and then computing the adjusted $R^2$ in cases like linear regression that use an intercept and the regression line does not necessarily passes through the origin. Lately, I've been experimenting with regression provided by random forests and therefore, no intercept is present. I know that the formula for $R^2$ is different for each case. My question: knowing that this difference exists, is adjusted $R^2$ with no intercept computed in the same way as the case where an intercept is present?
