Where can I find a list of all GHC extensions

I wanted to use {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} but I forgot how it's called. This kind of thing isn't hoogle-able, and also it takes some time finding using google*. Is there somewhere a list of GHC extensions named as they are in the LANGUAGE pragma? * My googling search journey: Google Haskell at wikipedia GHC at wikipedia GHC language features Overload string literals OverloadedStrings
