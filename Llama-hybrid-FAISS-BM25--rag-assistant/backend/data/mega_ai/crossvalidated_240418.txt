How to add features of higher order for Logistic Regression

I'm starting my first Machine Learning project to classify some entities and I decided to use Logistic Regression for the task. Initially I starter with around 10 features and I can see that my model is underfitting the data (F-Score around 0.63). That can be explained because all of my features are of first order and so my hypothesis is a first order polynomial. I would like to add more of higher order features, but I quickly realized that I don't have a good intuition on how to do that. I could take each of my features $X_n$ and add new ones $X_{n^2}$, $X_{n^3}$ etc. I could also start adding more complex features like $X_1$ * $X_2$ etc. Immediatelly I noticed that there are countless possibilities. How do I start? What are good practices in adding more features. How can I avoid overfitting the data?
