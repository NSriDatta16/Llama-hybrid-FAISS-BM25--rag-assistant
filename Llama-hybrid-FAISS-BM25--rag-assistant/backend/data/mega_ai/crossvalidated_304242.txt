Does the training data for a CNN need to be the same size?

According to the example given on this blogpost on wildml (see image below), it seems like it makes no difference what size the input because the size of the max-pooling layer is constant. However, I swear I've heard people talk about various methods of normalizing input images by rescaling and cropping so that they are the same size. Would that be purely for the purpose of mini-batching? Or, is the pooling layer above a special case which allows uneven input sizes?
