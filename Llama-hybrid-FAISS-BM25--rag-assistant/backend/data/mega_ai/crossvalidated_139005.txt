Where do you find info about which predictive distribution an algorithm uses for forecasting?

I am trying to fit a mixture model to a time series in order to make forecasts. I'm told that this is quite straightforward as long as the predictive distributions used by the component algorithms are the same. But where do I find out which predictive distributions they use? I'm using R for my analysis and the models I'm trying to average are an arima model, an ets model and an stlf model, if it's any interest.
