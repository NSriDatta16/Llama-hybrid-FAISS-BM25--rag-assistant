Given a binary number that repeats, for example 0.(0011) or 0.0(101), how would one go about converting it to decimal? This can be solved (ie the exact rational quantity can be determined) in binary just the same way as in decimal. In decimal, if we have, say , 0.(567) , and we want to determine the exact rational quantity it represents, we simply take 567 as our numerator, and 999 (the number that has n 9 s, where n is the number of digits in the repeating group) as our denominator: 0.(567) = 567/999 = 189/333 = 63/111 which is now in lowest terms. This process is a distillation of the full infinite geometric series result mentioned by @Rick Regan . In binary we do the same thing, except that instead of n 9 s as our denominator, we want n 1 s (as 1 is the highest digit in binary). So for example 0.(0011) = 0011 / 1111 =(in decimal) 3/15 = 1/5 Where you have digits before the repeating group, just do some arithmetic around this calculation: for example, 0.0(101) is just 0.(101) divided by 2. This latter is 101 / 111 , or 5/7 , so 0.0(101) is 5/14 .
