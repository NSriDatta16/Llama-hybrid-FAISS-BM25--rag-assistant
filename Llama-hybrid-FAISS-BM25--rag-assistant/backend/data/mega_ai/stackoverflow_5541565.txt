Alternative to Dictionary for Int32 keyed collections?

The hash of an Int32 is the value of the Int32 via: Hashtables (Dictionary etc) with integer keys As such, what value is added by using a Dictionary(Of Integer, someObject) (or any hashing collection, for that matter)? I will, of course, need to use .Contains(integerKey) for either to prevent errors... but I can skip the hashing algorithm altogether, right? What type would you use to optimize insertion/retrieval? EDIT: I expect that I may perform on the order of 10^5 lookups and 10^3 insertions, and these operations are certainly not the bottleneck of my process.
