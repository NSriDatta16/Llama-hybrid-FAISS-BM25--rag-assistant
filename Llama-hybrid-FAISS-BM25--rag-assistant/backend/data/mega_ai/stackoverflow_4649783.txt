WebSQL Databases between two different pages?

Is there any particular way in which we can access the Web SQL Database of one page, by other page. To make it more clear, suppose a.com creates the database DB and store some info. Now b.com comes and want to access the same database DB. Is there a way? Or are there any alternatives to do this? I tried to implement in HTML5 and Javascript but the databases as well as the localStorages are confining only to particular pages, I want this to be cross the pages.
