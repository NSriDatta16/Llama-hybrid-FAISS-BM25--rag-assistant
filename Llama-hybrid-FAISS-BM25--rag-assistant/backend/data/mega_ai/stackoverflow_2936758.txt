The first problem is that you are loading the MainMenu NIB/XIB repeatedly. That will do Very Bad Things -- the MainMenu should only be loaded once at application startup. You want to break out any UI that needs to be loaded repeatedly into a separate NIB/XIB file (the same way a document based application has a MainMenu.xib and Document.xib files). To properly do this, you need to understand the concept of "File's Owner" and how to leverage it properly . Note that there is also overlap with window controllers and understanding those, if you want to use them, will be helpful.
