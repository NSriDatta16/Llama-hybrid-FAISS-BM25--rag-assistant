Either method is equivalent if implemented correctly. In the second method, you should be careful while creating new indices for each fold so that we'll have non-overlapping sets of indices, i.e. a sample shouldn't be included in two different folds. However, this requires more programming effort than the former method. (Or, you can generate these indices using exactly the same method with the first one, i.e. convert index numbers to 0-1 arrays). There is another implicit benefit of the first model by the way, and that is the shuffling of the entire data. For example, in some ML models (e.g. neural networks), we typically feed the data after shuffling it. So, if you shuffle beforehand, you won't need to shuffle each fold again for the training. Of course, this has little effect when you shuffle each epoch.
