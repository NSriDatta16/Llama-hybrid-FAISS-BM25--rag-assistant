You said it in the question: the risk with having many indexes and/or many columns in indexes is that the cost of maintaining the indexes may become significant in databases which receive a lot of CUD (Create/Update/Delete) operations. Selecting the right indexes, is an art of sort which involves balancing the most common use cases, along with storage concerns (typically a low priority issue, but important in some contexts), and performance issues with CUD ops.
