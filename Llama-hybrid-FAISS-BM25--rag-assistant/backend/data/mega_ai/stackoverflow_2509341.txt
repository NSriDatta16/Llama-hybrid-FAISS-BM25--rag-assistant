WinForms "mini-windows"

I need to create some mini-windows, like the ones shown in the image bellow, in my winform main form. It would be nice if they could be draggable, resizable, and, mainly, closable. How can I approach this design? Has anybody already seen some control (with code available) implementing something similar? alt text http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/5765/imagea.png
