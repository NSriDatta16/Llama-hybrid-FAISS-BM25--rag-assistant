You should probably throw an exception. If you have an id that doesn't point to a valid patient, where did it come from? Something very bad has likely happened. It is an exceptional circumstance. EDIT: If you're doing something other than an integer-based retrieval, like a search based on text, then returning null is fine. Especially since in that case you are returning a set of results, which could be more than one (more than one patient with the same name, same birth date, or whatever your criteria is). A search function should have a different contract from a retrieval function.
