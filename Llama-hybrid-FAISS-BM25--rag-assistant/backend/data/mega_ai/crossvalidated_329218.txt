This is an appropriate thing to do. For your example, the number m (number of tests) would equal five, rather than six. However dunntest in Stata (and dunn.test in R) assumes your will be performing all 6 multiple comparisons. Therefore, while dunntest can provide you with the unadjusted p -values for each pairwise test, and you can simply direct your attention to the 5 your care about, you will need to perform the multiple comparisons adjustments by hand or using some other software. I am the author of dunntest, and can talk to you about how to work out the arithmetic if you want to email me (my contact info is in the help file).
