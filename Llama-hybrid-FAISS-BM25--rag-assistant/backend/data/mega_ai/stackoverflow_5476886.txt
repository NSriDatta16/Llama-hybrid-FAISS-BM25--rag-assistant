Here's an elegant and unobtrusive one with some limitations (see below). JSFiddle CSS: dl { width: 400px } dt { float: left; width: 300px; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap } dd { float: left; width: 100px; overflow: hidden } dt:after { content: " .................................................................................." } HTML: Drug 1 10ml Another drug 50ml Third 100ml limitations: Doesn't work in IE Accepts only literal characters in the content property, no HTML entities, so no &middot; for example. (This is no problem as @Radek points out, as UTF-8 characters should be able to serve almost every need here).
