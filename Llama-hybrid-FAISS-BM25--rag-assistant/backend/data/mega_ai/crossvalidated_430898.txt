On the paper "Outline of forecast theoryusing generalized cost functions" 1 Clive Granger (a nobel prize winner no less!) gives the following properties of a loss function $L(x)$ : $L(0) = 0$ (no error, no loss). $\min L(x) = 0$ , so $L(x)\geq 0$ . $L(x)$ is monotonically non-decreasing as $x$ moves away from zero. (similar to your first requirement) You could write your code to check these conditions Also interesting is the paper "Loss Functions in Time Series Forecasting" 2 by Lee Links:
