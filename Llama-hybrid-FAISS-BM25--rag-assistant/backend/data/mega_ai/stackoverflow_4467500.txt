May I just add... It really depends on the size and complexity of the development team working on the same project. For example, we have a large dev team consisting of 100s of devs from all over the world, and this team really benefits from all the features that UCM provides (as mentioned by master VonC above). On the other hand, most of the teams in my organization are around 10 people, and they are all co-located at one location, and these teams really do not want to mess around with the deliveries and merges, so they choose to simply use base CC with basic branching strategy, e.g. one Integration/Release Branch, followed by each dev branch for each release, or personal dev branch. For smaller teams, we usually recommend them to use base CC because it is easier to manage. Hope this helps.
