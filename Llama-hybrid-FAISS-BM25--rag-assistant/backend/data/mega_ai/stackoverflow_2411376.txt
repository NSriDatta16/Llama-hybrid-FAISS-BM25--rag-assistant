You can use the query objects (specifically those object created using GL_ARB_occlusion_query extension Specification ). Those object are used to query how many fragments are rendered using a sequence of OpenGL operations (begin/end, etc...). Another scheme (software only), is to determine a bounding box for your rendered text, then compute mathematically whether the bounding box is inside the view frustrum (derived from the current perspective used for rendering. A note: using OpenGL picking doesn't necessary imply the use of gluPickMatrix. You can render you scene "as is", and the query the rendered names (altought picking is deprecated from OpenGL 3). Query objects are easy to use, and they are lightweight. Picking is another good solution for most hardware, but more schematic than query objects.
