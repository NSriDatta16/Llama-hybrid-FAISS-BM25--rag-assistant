I am building one right now. Bayesian networks just define associations that must exist. They can be used to predict anything that is predictable. Your model must make sense, but assuming it does you just need to determine proper likelihood functions. That said, I am hand building everything. If you step outside the standard process the usefulness of packages can fall apart. EDIT I thought I would provide an example. Consider the case where a binary (or multinomial) choice is made, each of which result in other possible choices. However, at the end of the chain may be the total number of gallons of gas consumed if the decision is to drive, for another it is the price of an airline ticket, for another it is price of an airline ticket plus the cost of lodging, for yet another it estimates the travel time on an airline plus Eurorail. Your base nodes could be regressions.
