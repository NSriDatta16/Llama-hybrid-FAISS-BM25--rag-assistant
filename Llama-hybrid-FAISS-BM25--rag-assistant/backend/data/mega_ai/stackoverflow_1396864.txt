The strategy for storage you proposed would need to be addressed if you intend to move your content to different machines (SAN/NAS). To do this, you would need to strip all the customer data from the path, and just create a hash that you then save in the database to link to the file you are accessing. This way you are left with a folder structure something like this: NAS1/00/01/86/63/54/89/image01/image.tiff NAS2/00/02/46/62/22/11/image02/image.tiff ... I would also recommend you take a gander at MogileFS . All you need to do to speed it up is to add some sort of a proxy in front of it and all should be well. And like Dave mentioned, make sure you don't have too many children in one folder. Things tend to get quite sluggish around 10.000.
