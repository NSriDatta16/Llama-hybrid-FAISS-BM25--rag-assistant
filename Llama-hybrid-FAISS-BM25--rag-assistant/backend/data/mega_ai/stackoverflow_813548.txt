Yeah, what you're seeing there is a horrific collision of design paradigma from different corners of the universe: the GoF's aggregation/composition leveraging colliding with the "Law of Demeter". I am on record as believing that, in context of aggregation and composition use, the Law of Demeter is an anti-pattern . Contrary to it, I believe that constructs like person->brain->performThought() are absolutely right and appropriate.
