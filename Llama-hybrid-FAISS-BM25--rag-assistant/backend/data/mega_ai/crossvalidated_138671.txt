Larger p-values but less misclassification error in Logistic Regression

I was doing logistic regression in R on 'Smarket' data set available in the ISLR library. Since correlation between variables were less, I used all variables in my model and I was getting the following result Here p -values are greater then 0.05 for all the variables. Then I checked the misclassification error and the error was almost zero. I have tried removing some variables. But still the p values are greater than 0.05 and the misclassification error rates are high for those models. Can I use this model ?? Is p-value insignificant in logistic regression?
