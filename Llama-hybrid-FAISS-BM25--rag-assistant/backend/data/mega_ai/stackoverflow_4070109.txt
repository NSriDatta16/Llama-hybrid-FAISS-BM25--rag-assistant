Confused about average response time and calls per second correlation

I have average response time, lets say its 10 secs, also I have a max number of parallel connections my service can handle, lay say its 10. Now, how do I calculate calls per second (CPS) value my service has handled from these data? My guess is it's 1 / 10 (= av time) = 0.1 CPS or 1 / 10 (av time) * 10 (parallel flows) = 1 CPS.
