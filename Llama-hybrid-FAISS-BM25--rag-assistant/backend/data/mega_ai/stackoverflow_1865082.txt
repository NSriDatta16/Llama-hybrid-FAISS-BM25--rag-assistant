Query ragarding Solaris find command with -exec option

I want to create tar file with all the output files resulting from executing find command. I tried the following command: find . \(-name "*.log" -o -name "*.log.*" \) -mtime +7 -exec tar cvf test.tar.gz {} \; But it is including only the last found file in the test.tar file. How to include all files in test.tar file? Regards Chaitanya
