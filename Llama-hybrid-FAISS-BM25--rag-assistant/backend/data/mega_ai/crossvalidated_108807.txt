Bayesian stats: trick to accept the null?

There's a lot to be said and read about this, but I haven't found a clear answer to this question: Bayesian statistics are said to 'penalize' vague hypotheses with weak priors, by giving more support for the null hypothesis. Say the theory I'm interested in proving actually predicts that the null is true. I could cheat, and set up my model with a weak prior. This would unfairly bias my empirical evidence towards the null. How can this be prevented? Thanks! EDIT: I realized I was actually referring to Lindley's paradox, where as far as I understand) a precise null and an uninformative prior might bias towards the null, whereas frequentist statistics would reject the null. http://www.laeuferpaar.de/Papers/LindleyPSA.pdf
