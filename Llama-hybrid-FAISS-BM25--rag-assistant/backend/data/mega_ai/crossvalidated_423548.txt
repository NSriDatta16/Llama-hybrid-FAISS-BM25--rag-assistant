Do Bayesian credible intervals treat the estimated parameter as a random variable?

I read the following paragraph on Wikipedia recently: Bayesian intervals treat their bounds as fixed and the estimated parameter as a random variable , whereas frequentist confidence intervals treat their bounds as random variables and the parameter as a fixed value. However, I am not sure whether this is true. My interpretation of the credible interval was that it encapsulated our own uncertainty about the true value of the estimated parameter but that the estimated parameter itself did have some kind of 'true' value. This is slightly different to saying that the estimated parameter is a 'random variable'. Am I wrong?
