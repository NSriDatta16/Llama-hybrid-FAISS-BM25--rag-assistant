how to identify Button click in Cocoa /Objective-C

I have a button in my program to start a new game.I didn't use IB,done it manually.Now the problem is that how will i identify that the button is pressed .Is there any built-in method like 'ButtonClick' or something??I have used :- -(void) touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event In this function i used CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; to find touch position.And then used this to determine whether it is inside the button.If then i triggerd a action.But my program doesn't work.So Can anyone help me????
