Bayesian belief network for finding combinatory effects of multiple environmental variables on allele frequency

I'm a beginner to Bayesian belief network (BBN). I read a few articles on introduction to BBN. So I know a general idea of BBN. But I'm struggling to construct a graphical network and conditional probability table (CPT) with my data set. A main aim of my research is to find any combinatory (synergistic, additive, antagonistic) effects of multiple environmental variables on allele frequency of some genetic loci. Please go to this link to download a part of my data set. I have 15 environmental variables (each denoted as "var" in the excel sheet) and an allele frequency data (locus1 in the excel sheet) collected at 18 sites. I made a pairwise correlation table of environmental data to see some interactions between the environmental variables but this does not provide information on combinatory effects of them on allele frequency (I think....). I would really appreciate it if you could give me any suggestions on how to make a network graph and CPT with my data set. I use R. So if it's easier to guide me with R scripts, please do so.
