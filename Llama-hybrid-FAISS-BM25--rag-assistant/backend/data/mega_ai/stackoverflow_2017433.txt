All objects are, by default, referred to as references. In order to make a copy of the object, you must clone it using the clone keyword. private function scale_image_dimensions(Dimensions $dimensions, Dimensions $max_size) { $old_dimensions = $dimensions; $dimensions = clone $dimensions; if( $dimensions->width > $max_size->width ) { $dimensions->height = $dimensions->height / ($dimensions->width / $max_size->width); $dimensions->width = $max_size->width; } if( $dimensions->height > $max_size->height ) { $dimensions->width = $dimensions->width / ($dimensions->height / $max_size->height); $dimensions->height = $max_size->height; } return $dimensions; } This keeps PHP from making large amounts of objects, and generally people want objects to be passed by reference anyway. PHP Classes are not very often used as a 'Data Storage' utility, because arrays often work just as well. But, if you are coming for another language that does use many classes to store data, I can see that it would be a big problem.
