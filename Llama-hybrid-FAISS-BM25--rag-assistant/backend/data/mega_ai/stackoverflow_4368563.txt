jasmine with jscoverage automated testing

Had been looking at the jsunit and jcoverage demos here ( click on coverage report link. Open this in a new tab) . I was wondering if any one had done anything similar with Jasmine and JSCoverage ? I'm a little unsure on how to proceed. [EDIT] I am wondering if there is something I can do with a jasmine reporter. My Jasmine "hello world" example makes reference to a TrivialReporter. Maybe this can be extended ?? [EDIT] I've wired up js-test-runner with jasmine right now. Now If I could think of a way to get coverage ??
