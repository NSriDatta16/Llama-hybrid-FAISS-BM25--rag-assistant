Checking for preprocessor macros is not a good solution. uClibc and possibly other libc implementations define macros to mimic glibc (without providing all of its bloated functionality) for much the same reasons that all browsers include "Mozilla" in their User-Agent strings: broken programs that expect to see glibc and turn off lots of features if they don't see it. Instead you should write a configure script to probe for backtrace and use it only if it's available.
