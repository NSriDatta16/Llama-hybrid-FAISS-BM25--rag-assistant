dojo.dnd one item at a time only

Using dojo.dnd, I want to allow a user to drag only one item at a time , rather than any arbitrary number, as per the dojo's default behaviour. At the moment, a user can hold Ctrl and click multiple draggable items at a time, then drag them all as a group. I want to disable this so that the user can only drag one item at any given time. I'm using a dojo.dnd.Source(), as below. new dojo.dnd.Source(containerNode) ...which makes all of the child nodes of containerNode draggable. Thanks.
