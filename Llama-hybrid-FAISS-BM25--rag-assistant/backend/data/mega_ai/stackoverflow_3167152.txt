You can't get cookies that weren't set by your site (or one on the same domain). From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Privacy_and_third-party_cookies : "Cookies have some important implications on the privacy and anonymity of Web users. While cookies are sent only to the server setting them or the server in the same Internet domain, a Web page may contain images or other components stored on servers in other domains. Cookies that are set during retrieval of these components are called third-party cookies. This includes cookies from unwanted pop-up ads." OpenID is a decent way to deal with this. Zend supposedly has a decent library for doing this (though I haven't tried it myself): http://devzone.zend.com/article/3581 Update: Here's an article I found using cURL, since you said you're already using that: http://www.110mb.com/forum/tip-how-to-use-simple-openid-t30219.0.html
