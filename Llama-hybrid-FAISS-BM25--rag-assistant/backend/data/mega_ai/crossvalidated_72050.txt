How would one calculate a geographic estimate from a dataset of people?

Given you had a large dataset of people with a name and country. How would you calculate an estimate of the origin country from one of the names? If i looked up a name, Kim and just averaged the rows from each country, it seems to me that my numbers would be skewed since the dataset might contain a lot more names from a given country in the first place. How can i make up for this uncertainty?
