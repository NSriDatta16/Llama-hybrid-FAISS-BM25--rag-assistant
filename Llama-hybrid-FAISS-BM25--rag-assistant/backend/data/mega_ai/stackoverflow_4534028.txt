How to deskew a fisheye panorama using css3?

I feel that it has come time to convert my flash panoramas to js/html5/css3. I've seen some elegant solutions using separate flat images, but mine are all fisheye... My intuition tells me that it's doable using -webkit-transform: matrix3d but I'm not quite hitting it. Any ideas if this can really be done in css3? Thanksya kindly.
