With the sizes you mention you are probably running into Large Object Heap (LOH) fragmentation. Reusing StringBuilder objects is not a direct solution, you need to get a grip on the underlying buffers. If possible, calculate or estimate the size beforehand and pre-allocate. And it could help if you round up allocations, let's say to multiples of 20k or so. That could improve reuse.
