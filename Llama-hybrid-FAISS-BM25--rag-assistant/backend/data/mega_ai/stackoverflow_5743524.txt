There's nothing special about the Facebook Apps inside page tabs but: The signed_request contains an extra parameter ( page ) Its frame is of 520px or 810px width Now brands main purpose of the Facebook pages is attracting fans to maximize their reach. This is why "allowing" an application is not needed but "encouraging" liking the page is the target. Check my tutorial about this for more info (check real world examples). Also the RedBull Facebook page is a great example (with nice illustration to encourage liking the page). From there, how to ask for extended permission is really a no-brainer because at the end a "page tab app" is a Facebook App and everything in the documentation applies to it!
