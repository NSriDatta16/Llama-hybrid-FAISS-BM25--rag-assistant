Obtaining valid win probabilities from contest data using a binomial model

I conducted an enclosure experiment on lizards where I recorded contest outcome for every male-male combat. We had three morphs of lizards (o, w, y) in each enclosure. I am interested in obtaining probabilities of winning of each morph against every other morph (e.g. o beats y, y beats w, w beats y) and test whether they significantly differ from even odds (0.5). To do so, I dealt with pseudo-replication (5-3 wins between lizards A and B turns into 1-0) and fit three logistic mixed models, one for each morph. Each of the datasets looks like this: Enclosure id1 id2 morph1 morph2 outcome e1 e1m4 e1m3 w o 1 e2 e2m4 e2m1 w y 0 e3 e3m4 e1m3 w y 1 e3 e1m6 e3m1 w o 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . In which morph1 is always "w", "o", or "y". I then use the following model q And then use emmeans to try to extract the probabilities of winning against the other two morphs. wbin.emm For each of the three models this yields very odd results (e.g. in the white morph model I obtain extremely small probabilities. morph2 prob SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL o 1.19e-07 6.54e-07 Inf 2.49e-12 0.00565 y 2.53e-05 8.21e-05 Inf 4.35e-08 0.01450 These results make no sense to me because just from checking the average probabilities with summarySE (i.e. neglecting the lizard's identity) we can see that no morph combination is strongly biased in its outcome. tgc I would gladly upload some of my data if requested (I couldn't find how to do it). Edit: results from summary Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. id2 (Intercept) 149.7 12.24 id1 (Intercept) 1001.5 31.65 Encl (Intercept) 142.4 11.93 Number of obs: 101, groups: id2, 51; id1, 29; Encl, 10
