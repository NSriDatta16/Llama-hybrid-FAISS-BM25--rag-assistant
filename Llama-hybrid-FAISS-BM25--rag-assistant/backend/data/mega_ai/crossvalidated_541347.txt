Practical Value of Sufficient Statistics

Can anyone provide some comments about the practical value of sufficient statistics research? Nearly all sufficiency results, such as the Fisher-Neyman factorization rule, build upon parametric models that assume a known type of distribution but unknown parameters. However, most real data are not easily modeled using distributions, and non-parametric approaches and machine learning techniques are gaining popularity. What is the practical value of the parametric-model-based sufficient statistics research in modern statistics?
