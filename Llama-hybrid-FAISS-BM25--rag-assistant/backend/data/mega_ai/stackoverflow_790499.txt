Where to find .NET version usage statistics?

There are some technologies like LINQ and WPF which are nice, but installation of .NET 3.5 is still slow procedure. It's important to understand - among Windows users how many of them have .NET 3.5 installed? Is there any good up to date stats gathered about .NET Version availability/usage? I've searched a lot, but can't find. Update: .NET version IS present in web-agent strings for FF and IE at least. So there SHOULD be somebody who have that information. Anyone with access to really large web-site logs? Update 2: I also understand Vista means that user have 3.5, but XP is still dominating the market.
