Sample size equation based on clinical paper

Hoping this one is easy, but I've been struggling to try to find what approach is being used online. I'm trying to replicate the powering of a clinical trial for research purposes based on the below paragraph - any input into what methodology is likely being used here would be very much appreciated. Thank you! A planned sample size of 156 patients in the placebo group and 104 patients in each of the AMG 334 groups was expected to provide 80% power for a two-sided test with a significance level of 0·05, assuming the same effect size recorded in a randomized controlled trial of topiramate of 1·6 days difference from placebo21 with a common SD of 3·7 days and a 30% dropout. The paper is an older Ph 2 trial titled: "Safety and effi cacy of AMG 334 for prevention of episodic migraine: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial"
