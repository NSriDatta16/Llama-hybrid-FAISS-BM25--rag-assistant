Using the mouse wheel to scroll a browser window horizontally

I have a very wide website, intentionally designed to have no vertical scrolling but a lot of horizontal. Scrolling horizontally is usually a pain to users so was wondering if there was some way of using the middle mouse or other scrolling habits (eg. page up/down, up/down arrows, middle mouse click/drag) to scroll horizontally instead of vertically. Edit: The main reason for requiring horizontal scrolling is because the layout/approach is a left to right graphical/interactive timeline. I've since found some examples; This one with MooTools: http://www.tinkainteractive.com.au/ and a few other examples I found at http://naldzgraphics.net/inspirations/40-examples-of-horizontal-scrolling-websites/
