Given data, how strongly do we believe that 2 groups do not come from the same population (H_1: they do not come from the same population vs H_0: they come from the same population). This can be done with a Bayesian t-test. Complexity is used to figure out how much the prior is overlapping with one hypothesis. Fit is used to figure out how much the posterior is overlapping with one hypothesis. Combined you can compare the hypotheses and express your posterior belief in whether or not they come from the same population.
