Why is predicted rainfall by LSTM coming negative for some data points?

I have used supervised learning with LSTM network using tanh activation function and 0.1 dropout for time series prediction.my loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam'. The predicted time series is shown below where x axis shows future months and y axis shows rainfall in mm.Orange line is predicted and blue line is actual. Some points are being predicted below 0 (negative) even though training dataset has all points having values >=0. My training dataset is of 64 years (all positive data) and I am predicting for 12 years (144 data points shown) Model code using ReLU activation: model = Sequential() # LSTM model model.add(LSTM(128, batch_input_shape=(batch_size, look_back, 1),activation='relu', stateful=True, return_sequences=False)) model.add(Dropout(0.1)) #for better regularization model.add(Dense(1)) model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')
