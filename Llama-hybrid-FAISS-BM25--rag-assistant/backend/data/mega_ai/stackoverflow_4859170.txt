You could always do a server side redirect, and hide it all away from the client. So regular requests go to index.cfm (www.domain.com) And then if there is a city (in onRequestStart()): city = ListFirst(CGI.SERVER_NAME, "."); if(!StructKeyExists(request, "forward") AND (city != "www" || city != "domain")) { request.forward = 1; getPageContext().forward("/#city#/index.cfm"); abort; } I put the request scope variable 'forward' in there to stop potential infinite loops, as the Application.cfc is called again.
