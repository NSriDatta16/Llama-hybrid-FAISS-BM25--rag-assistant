Is there new easy to use methods for bidimensional density estimation?

Recently, I was learning about density estimation with non-parametric methods, brilliantly detailed here by Jake VanderPlas. I'm just a beginner in the area, and I also heard about mixture models. I realized that KDE and GMM are well known to the public in two-dimensional (often spatial) analysis, but, as far as I know, these are relatively old methods. Is there a new method for estimating two-dimensional density based on deep learning or another new technique that can be easily used to compare with KDE? For example, I was wondering if there is any method that has bandwidth and kernel varying over the data range.
