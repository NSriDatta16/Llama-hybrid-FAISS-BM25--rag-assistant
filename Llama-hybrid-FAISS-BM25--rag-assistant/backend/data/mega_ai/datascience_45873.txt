How to launch a Machine Learning model?

First of all thank you for taking your time to read my question. I have done a Machine Learning model with a dataset (The famous one about Cancer) and I want to know how can I do to predict the results for new variables. I think that I have to keep training the data (often) to have more accured data to use in my prediction but for predicting new data, Â¿Is as simple as changing the test data (y variable) to the new data? Thank you so much for taking your time and any help would be appreciate it.
