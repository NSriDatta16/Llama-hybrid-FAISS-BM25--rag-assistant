Comparing SVM and logistic regression

Can someone please give me some intuition as to when to choose either SVM or LR? I want to understand the intuition behind what is the difference between the optimization criteria of learning the hyperplane of the two, where the respective aims are as follows: SVM: Try to maximize the margin between the closest support vectors LR: Maximize the posterior class probability Let's consider the linear feature space for both SVM and LR. Some differences I know of already: SVM is deterministic (but we can use Platts model for probability score) while LR is probabilistic. For the kernel space, SVM is faster (stores just support vectors)
