To encourage you to actually do the coding yourself rather than copy-and-pasting snippets from the Internet , I will describe the way I would do it, leaving it to you to write the actual code. The jQuery documentation site is very well-written and helpful, but you also need to know the basics of JavaScript programming to write real scripts. The jQuery cookie plugin can help (documentation is in the source code). Example: // Setting the cookie $.cookie('url1', 'http://www.google.com', { expires: 999 }); // Reading the cookie alert($.cookie('url1')); jQuery allows you to easily attach event handlers to elements, such as when an element is clicked (to perform an action when the "Set home page" button is clicked, for example). It also allows you to get values of form fields (to get the URL to set the home page to), set the src URL of an iframe , and run code when the page has loaded (the latter two to load the home pages in the iframes when the user opens the outer page). You're already using all this in the snippet you lifted for the Go button; it's definitely easy enough for any programmer to add cookie storage (use variables and an if statement to take different actions depending on whether the user has selected a home page). Because of the same-origin policy used to protect user privacy and security on the web, it's not possible to get the URL of a page loaded in the iframe. You would only be able to add support for setting the home page URL to what is inside the text box.
