Well, this may prove unpopular and/or not actually answer your question but have you given any thoughts to your data granularity? Once you've reduced your HTTP headers as much as you can, I suspect you'll still want to reduce the header/data ratio some more. The obvious way to do that is to send/receive more than one item of data in each http request. An added layer of logic on either the client or the server side (or a change to your data model) would allow you to request data in bigger chunks, based on measuring what other data you are likely to need when you request a single item. The whole point would be to transfer more data in each request in order to reduce the number of requests. The waste of bandwith (and client storage) - coming from transfering data you will not actually need - could end up being more acceptable than the HTTP header footprint.
