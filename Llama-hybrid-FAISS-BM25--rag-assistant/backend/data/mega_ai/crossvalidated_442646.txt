What are the appropriate ANOVA and classification methods to use for this data set?

I have collected data on 293 individuals. I measured the concentration of the same 7 Substances in each individual, represented by Sub1:Sub7 . The concentration of these Substances may be different in individuals from different Locations . I am interested in seeing how well the Individuals can be separated based on their concentrations of these Substances . I am also interested in seeing how these Substances may be correlated with each other, as the concentration of some may effect the concentration of others. Each Individual in my data set is represented by a unique ID number. Three "nested" grouping variables ( Location , State , and Region ) can be used to separate these individuals. Multiple Locations are in each State , and multiple States are part of larger Regions . The broadest grouping variable is Location , which has 26 levels (26 different locations). Each Location contains roughly 10 individuals (10 IDs ). The State grouping variable contains 18 levels, and the Region grouping variable contains 9 levels. I want to use these grouping variables to see the level of refinement at which the Individuals can be separated using the Substances . My data is structured like this: --------------------------------------------------------------- Location State Region ID Sex Sub1 Sub2 Sub3 Sub4 Sub5 Sub6 Sub7 --------------------------------------------------------------- Loc1 FL Reg1 1 F 0.123 0.222 ect... Loc1 FL Reg1 2 M Loc2 FL Reg1 3 F Loc2 FL Reg1 4 F Loc3 GA Reg1 5 F Loc3 GA Reg1 6 M Loc4 GA Reg1 7 F Loc4 GA Reg1 8 M Loc5 NC Reg2 9 F Loc5 NC Reg2 10 M Loc6 SC Reg2 11 M Loc6 SC Reg2 12 F Loc7 SC Reg2 13 F Loc7 SC Reg2 14 F ------------------------------------------------------------------ I want to ensure that I do not violating any critical assumptions and still reach the full potential of my analysis. My questions are: What assumptions do I need to be concerned about? What is the appropriate kind of ANOVA to use in R (aov, anova?) and post hoc test? What would be the best classification method to use on this data, and if new individuals were added to the data set in the future (I was thinking Random forest, Bayes, or LDA)?
