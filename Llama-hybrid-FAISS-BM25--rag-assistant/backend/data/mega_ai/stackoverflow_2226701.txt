A System Scrollbar in Windows is part of the non-client area of the window. You tell Windows that you want a scrollbars by adding the WS_HSCROLL and WS_VSCROLL styles to the window when it is created. Then you use Windows functions to set the scrolling range and position of the thumb. You receive WM_HSCROLL and/or WM_VSCROLL messages in your window procedure when the user clicks on your scrollbar or drags the scrollbar thumb. The window class called SCROLLBAR is just a child window with the WS_HSCROLL or WS_VSCROLL style an no client area. See Scrollbar Functions for information on how to do this in Win32 C++ code. If you are using .NET forms, you would derive your custom window class from the ScrollableControl class that Benny mentioned.
