I agree with your reasoning, however I would like to know if Microsoft/WPF creators guarantee that the binding will be evaluated to its first value before the control is loaded... For example i have a a combo box and I have code as public CustomCombo() { this.Loaded += OnLoaded; } private void OnLoaded(Object sender,RoutedEventArgs e) { if(CustomDP != null){ //Populate Items inside combo } } In such situation if my binding is not being evaluated before my combo is loaded , it would remain empty.. isnt it? Some us believe that this condition would never arise, and my question to you is whether it is really so, or bindings can be evaluated post load as well, as it might depend on Datacontext or position in Visual/logical tree
