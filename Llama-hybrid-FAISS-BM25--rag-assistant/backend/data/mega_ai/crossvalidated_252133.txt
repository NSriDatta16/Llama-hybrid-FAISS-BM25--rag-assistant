Binary Bayesian Network complexity

Imagine a Bayesian Network with binary random variables, with the structure of a binary tree of arbitrary height: I want to find the minimum number of probabilities that I must store at depth k to describe the entire tree up to that point (i.e. the joint distribution) Starting at depth 0 (the root node A), I only need to store 1 probability, i.e. $P(A = True) = P(a)$ because I get $P(\bar{a}) = 1 - P(a)$ for free. At depth 1, I need to store $P(ABC) = \sum_{ABC} P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A)$. I need to only store $P(a), P(b|a), P(b|\bar{a}), P(c|a), P(c|\bar{a})$ = 5 probabilities. This is because from $P(b|a)$ I get $P(\bar{b}|a) = 1 - P(b|a)$, and $P(\bar{c}|a)$ similarly. At depth 2, using similar logic, I store 1 + 4 + 8 = 13 probabilities And so on. So at depth k, I store $\sum_{i=0}^{k} 2^{i+1}-1$ probabilities. Is this correct?
