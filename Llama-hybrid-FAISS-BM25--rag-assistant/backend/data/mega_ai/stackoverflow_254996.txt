If you're just drawing the control and not hosting children, then derive from Control - VS will make you a suitable class (it calls this a 'Custom Control') with the OnDraw handler already stubbed in. If you're hosting other controls within your control, then derive from UserControl, (VS calls this a 'User Control' and you'll get support for VS designer, so you can drag around other controls on top. For simple non-scrolling charting I would derive from Control.
