I've used both JProfiler 4 and YourKit 7.5, and YourKit wins hands down. It's so much less invasive than JProfile, in that I'll happy run production servers with the YourKit agent installed, which I would never do with JProfiler. Also, the analysis tool that comes with YourKit is more intuitive (in my opinion), making it easier to get the root cause of problems.
