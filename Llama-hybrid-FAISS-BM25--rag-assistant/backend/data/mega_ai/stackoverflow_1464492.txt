A client should not be able to distinguiish between web services implemented using either technology, or ideed any other technology. The promise of Web services is that they should be interoperable across many platforms, and service providers can use whatever technologies they prefer, so a Java shop would use Java, JAX-WS for example, and .NET shoop their technologies - clients just don't care, they use the WSDL. Things get a bit more interesting when we move away from basic SOAP/HTTP web services and use standards for security, transactions, messaging etcs (the whole WS-* space). Ideally the implementation transparancy is still true, but you can't count on an arbitrary implementor supporting what you want to do. The WS-I organisation, and it's participating vendors, do a great deal of work to ensure interoperability, so the story is not too bad even for these more advanced WS-* standards.
