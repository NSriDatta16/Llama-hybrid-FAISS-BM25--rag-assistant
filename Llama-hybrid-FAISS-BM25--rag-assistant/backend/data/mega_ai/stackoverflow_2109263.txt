Have you considered switching to standard gettext methods? Gettext is a widely spread approach for internationalization and very well embedded in the Python (and the Django) world. Some links: Python's gettext module Django's support for gettext with special attention to unicode PoEdit, an editor for .po-files produced by pygettext Your template would then look like this: {% load i18n %} {% trans "Header of my Collection" %} The files for translations can be generated by manage.py: manage.py makemessages -l fr for generating french (fr) messages, for example. Gettext is quite performant, so I doubt that you will experience a significant slow-down with this approach compared to your storage of the translation table in memcache. And what's more, it let's you work with "real" messages instead of abstract dictionary keys, which is, at least in my experience, ways better, if you have to read and understand the code (or if you have to find and change a certain message).
