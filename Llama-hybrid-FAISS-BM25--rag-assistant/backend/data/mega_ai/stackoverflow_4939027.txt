I would use this situation as a hard reason why your company needs to go ahead and make the switch to a newer browser. Often in large organizations, they don't upgrade because they simply don't need to and they wait for a scenario in which it's required. In this case, they need to and so I'd use it as the excuse to get that ball rolling. Instead of hacking up SharePoint 2010 to work with IE6, which is a solid waste of effort, I've spent time building custom controls to warn IE6 users that their browser won't work on the site. You're better off not spending a lot of time and money to customize SharePoint to work on a browser that's 10 years old, not supported by the product, and that you'll be replacing anyway.
