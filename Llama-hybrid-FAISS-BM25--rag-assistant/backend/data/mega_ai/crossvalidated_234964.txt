I gave a +1 to Cliff AB's answer. To add one little tidbit, if you want to work at a lower level but not down to the code-everything-yourself level, you should poke around for the LaplacesDemon package. The original author was brilliant, but seems to have dropped off the grid, and the package has been taken over by someone else. (It's on Github, I believe.) It implements an impressive number of algorithms used in MCMC and the included vignettes are worth the read even if you don't use the package. Pretty much any kind of sampler you read about, it has. You code in a different way than BUGS/JAGS or Stan, and it's all in R, but often times it's so efficient that it's competitive.
