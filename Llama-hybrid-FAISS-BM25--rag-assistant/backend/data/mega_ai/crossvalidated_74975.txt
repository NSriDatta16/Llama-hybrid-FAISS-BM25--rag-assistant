Time series as cross-sectional data

I have time series, for example, gdp and unemployment( unemp ), freq= 4. What if I interpret it as cross-sectional data and do cross-sectional analysis instead of time series? My task is to test how unemployment affects gdp. Is it allowed to do that kind of analysis? Do the coefficients in the model lm(gdp~unemp) have an economic explanation?
