People are usually using WYSIWYG editors on the web sites to let people enter some nice looking text. To do that the editor is automatically wrapping the text that was entered by the consumer with the html tags. In this way, when the text will be then shown separately on the page, it will look exactly like you entered it. There is no way of how to make the text looks great without using html tags. If you don't believe, open simple notepad editor and try to create nice looking text with paragraphs, images, etc. You couldn't do that. So, at the very end, after editing of the text in WYSIWYG editor complete, the editor prepares entered text wrapped with HTML. In other words, you will always has HTML if you use WYSIWYG editor. If you don't want html, use simple textarea or text input tag on the page.
