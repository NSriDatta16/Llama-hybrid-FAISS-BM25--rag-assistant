This behavior of javac conforms to the spec. See ยง15.12 Method Invocation Expressions in the Java Language Specification, specifically the paragraph under "Compile Time Step 1" explaining the meaning of an unqualified method invocation: If the Identifier appears within the scope (ยง6.3) of a visible method declaration with that name, then there must be an enclosing type declaration of which that method is a member. Let T be the innermost such type declaration. The class or interface to search is T. In other words, the unqualified method name is searched for in all enclosing scopes, and the innermost "type declaration" (which means either a class or an interface declaration) in which the name is found is the one that will be searched for the whole signature (in "Compile Time Step 2").
