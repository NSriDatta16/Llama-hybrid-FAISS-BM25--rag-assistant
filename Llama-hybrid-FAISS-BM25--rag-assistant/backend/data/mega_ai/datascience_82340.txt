Train-Test split for Time Series Data to be used for LSTM

values = df.values train, test = train_test_split(values) #Split into train and test X_train, y_train = train[:, :-1], train[:, -1] X_test, y_test = test[:, :-1], test[:, -1] Executing the above code splits the time series dataset into training- 70% and testing 30%. I want to control the train-test split as 80-20 or 90-10. Can someone please help me understand what train[:, :-1] does in this context? It is borrowed from https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/ . Note : I cannot split the dataset randomly for train and test and the most recent values have to be for testing . I have included a screenshot of my dataset. If anyone can interpret the code, please do help me understand the above. Thanks.
