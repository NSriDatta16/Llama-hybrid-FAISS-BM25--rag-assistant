Rolling Time Series Forecasting with data on underperforming year such as COVID scenario i.e. 2020

Recently I am working on a project where I am to forecast volume and sales of merchandise as well as fuel. While streamlining my thoughts and the method to go ahead with the exercise I realized that if I forecast monthly volume using past years' data for the next 12 months will my forecasts be biased somehow, considering 2020 had been a weird year and the trends were all messed up compared to the previous year? Also, when I am building the model, train it on previous years and test it on the most recent year i.e. 2020 , the MAPE might be huge because this year was "unpredictable" My question is how to overcome these two problems? P. S. Only time series models are allowed, I cannot use any other ML models
