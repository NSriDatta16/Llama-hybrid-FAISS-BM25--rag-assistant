ARIMA for measuring effect size of mood stabilizing therapy?

Hi Im doing a research project regarding self-reported mood fluctuations. during a one year psychotherapy for 80 different subjects (they are in psychiatric treatment. The patients has trouble controlling their temper). I'll be measuring mood outbursts. I have daily measurements 0-5 of loss of temper, along with daily scorings of 8 different basic emotions. I'll also a monthly symptom severity index(0-100). So It's a rich time series with lots of info. I plan on doing ARIMA analysis, and wish to demonstrate significant differences in emotion regulation which I hope to find. I expect the tendency to be broad frequent waves changing over time to slimmer less frequent waves. I also expect to find the monthly symptom level to slightly taper off. 2 very basic questions: 1) Is arima a good path to follow here ? 2) Is arima-modelling especially sensitive to missing values ?
