I hate to be "that guy", but I just gave it a try and it worked fine for me. Here's the copy of the authors file I used: RNO\_MCLWEB = Ronald McDonald SND\krobertson_cp = Some Guy I did, however, use a slightly different method than you did to generate author names, following these directions . My specific incantation was: $ svn log --xml | grep author | sort -u | perl -pe 's/.>(.?) I'm also using Git 1.6.6.1 (doubt that makes a difference, but you never know). I did notice that when I used your pipeline to get the SVN authors, there were spaces in front of their SVN usernames in the resulting file (i.e., there was a space in column 1 on each line). Don't know if that makes a difference or not.
