No. To be linearly separable, you have to able to separate data with a straight line for 2D, plane for 3D, etc: a1*x1+a2*x2+ ...an*xn = b is equation for nD. If you need a curve, then data is not linearly separable. With 2D or 3D feature vector - plot different classes with different colors and look at them :) For nD you can just try to separate them with linear SVM. Yes, the same story.
