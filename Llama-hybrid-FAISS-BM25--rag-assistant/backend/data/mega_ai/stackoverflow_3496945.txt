Interface Builder will do this for Core Data models if you option-drag parts of (or all of) your data model from the Data Modeler into a window or view in Interface Builder. When you drop the managed object(s) you dragged, you're given an option to create a Single Item View, a Master/Detail View (with search and detail fields and add/remove buttons), or a Collection View (with box + search field). I don't know of any third-party solutions to do this from "just any model." It'd be a great tool, but would likely require using an object model to define the entities (like Core Data's Managed Object Model).
