You are entirely correct! A couple of months ago I was in the exact same position when justifying a different feature selection approach in front of my supervisors. I will cite the sentence I used in my thesis, although it has not been published yet. Since the ordering of the variables depends on all samples, the selection step is performed using information of all samples and thus, the OOB error of the subsequent model no longer has the properties of an independent test set as it is not independent from the previous selection step. - Marc H. For references, see section 4.1 of ' A new variable selection approach using Random Forests ' by Hapfelmeier and Ulm or ' Application of Breimanâ€™s Random Forest to Modeling Structure-Activity Relationships of Pharmaceutical Molecules ' by Svetnik et al., who address this issue in context of forward-/backward feature selection.
