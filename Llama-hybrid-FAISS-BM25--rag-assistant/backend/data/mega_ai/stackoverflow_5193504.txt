How to make custom WPF ContentControl that supports drag-and-drop at design time?

I want to create custom WPF control that has a single "child" control inside. Subclassing ContentControl or UserControl works, but has one flaw: these controls don't work in designer mode. By "don't work" I mean this scenario: suppose I have a Canvas with my custom control in it. I want to put, say, a Button inside my control. I drag it from the toolbox, and it appears inside my control. However, XAML view shows that the new button actually belongs to Canvas , not to my control. I can place it inside my control by manually editing XAML, but I want the designer to work too. Interestingly, when I subclass Canvas , Grid or Panel , designer works as expected. However, these controls have many children, which is not what I need. How can I make a single-child control that works in designer?
