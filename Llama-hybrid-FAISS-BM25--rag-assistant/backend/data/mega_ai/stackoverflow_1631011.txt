A 960 grid is a framework that should be implemented from the initial design stage. It helps both the designer and developer create clean organised UIs. In my experience the 960 grid system ( http://www.960.gs ) has helped a lot as it will allow me to create a formatted page quickly without re-writing any css files no matter what a client asks for. Typically I implement CSS styles like the following .marginLeft20 { margin-left: 20px; } .oneColumn { float: left; width: 60px; } This means I can make a div with the above classes applied This is a oneColumn example If you need anymore info on grids I would recommend http://www.960.gs
