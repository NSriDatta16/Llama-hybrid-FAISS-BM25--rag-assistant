PHP: Strip Wrapping Paragraph Tags

I need to write a PHP function which removes opening and closing paragraph tags from a string, but only if they are at the very beginning/end. So the strings: "Simple Test" " Here " " Test Nested Outside " Would Output: "Simple Test" "Here" "Test Nested Outside" Can HTMLPurifier do this or should I use substr? My first attempt was: if(strpos($str,' ') === 0 && strcmp(substr($str,-1,4),' ')) $str = substr($str,3,strlen($str)-4);
