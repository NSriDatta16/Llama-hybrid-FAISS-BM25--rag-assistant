For typical web apps, the difference in speed won't usually be felt within the request itself (the network latency dwarfs your compute time for a typical script that runs inside an HTTP request). There are plenty of other things that affect scalability, but the processing needs to handle an average request does factor in. So, a lonely user will not feel the difference. A user who is one of many might feel the difference, as the server infrastructure struggles with load. Of course, throwing more processor will mitigate the issue, but as jrockway says, maintaining two servers is significantly more than twice as hard as maintaining one. All of that said, in the vast majority of cases, your bottlenecks will not be processor. You'll be running out of memory, or you'll find that your database interaction is the real bottleneck.
