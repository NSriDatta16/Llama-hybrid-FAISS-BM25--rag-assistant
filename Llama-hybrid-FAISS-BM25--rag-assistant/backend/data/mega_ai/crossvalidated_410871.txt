The logistic regression coefficient is a log-odds ratio. The results from a logistic regression model are usually reported by exponentiating the coefficients and their 95% CIs. The null hypothesis (no effect) is when the odds ratio is 1, e.g. the odds of outcome does not differ comparing groups among exposure levels. The odds ratio is bounded by 0 and infinity. An odds ratio of 0 is a perfect negative relationship (the likelihood of outcome is a negative step function with 1 probability below a certain threshold and 0 probability above a certain threshold. A log odds ratio of -0.222 is an odds ratio of 0.8. A log odds ratio of -0.087 translates to an odds ratio of 0.92. The first value, 0.8 indicates a stronger negative relationship between exposure and outcome.
