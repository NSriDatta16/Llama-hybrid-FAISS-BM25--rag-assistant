Compare Log-Normal Distributions

I am looking at distributions for the fuel consumption of vehicles in the US and I have two sets of data: Data Set 1 - This is a dataset for the fuel consumption of all vehicles made available for sale from 1990 to 2010 (not sales weighted), which follows a log-normal distribution. Thus, I am able to define the mean and standard deviation for the entire population of vehicles available for sale each year. Data Set 2 - This just has the annual average sales weighted fuel consumption of vehicles in the US from 1990 to 2010. Thus, I am only able to define the mean (no standard deviation) of sales weighted fuel consumption each year. Is there any way for me to infer a distribution for the sales-weighted fuel consumption with the data in Data Set 1? Put another way, am I able to establish the standard deviation for Data Set 2 using the data that I have available in Data Set 1? Any advice would be greatly appreciated and many thanks!
