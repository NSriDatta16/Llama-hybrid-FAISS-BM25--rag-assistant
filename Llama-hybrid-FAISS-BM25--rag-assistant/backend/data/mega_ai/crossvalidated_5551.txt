I will give the outline of the solution. Numbers of each coloured ball in a draw follows multinomial distribution as tshauck pointed out. Let $R$ denote the number of red balls, $G$ - number of green balls, $B$ - number of blue balls and $Y$ - number of yellow balls in the draw of the size $n$. Then the probability that in random draw we have exactly $x_1$ red balls, $x_2$ green balls, $x_3$ blue balls and $x_4$ yellow ball is $$P(R=x_1,G=x_2,B=x_3,Y=x_4)=\frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!x_3!x_4!}p_r^{x_1}p_g^{x_2}p_b^{x_3}p_y^{x_4}$$ where $p_r$ is probability of picking red ball, $p_g$ - green, $p_b$ - blue, $p_y$ - yellow. Denote the number of unique balls in a draw by $U$. Then $U=f(R,G,B,Y)$. Since you have the distribution of vector $(R,G,B,Y)$ you can calculate distribution of $U$. Since we have four colours $U$ can get values $0,1,2,3,4$. So to get probability that $U=0$ you need to find all the possible combinations of $(R,G,B,Y)$ for which $U=0$ and add the probabilities of these combinations. So when $U=0$? When All the balls appear more than once: $R>1$, $G>1$, $B>1$, $Y>1$ One colour is absent and all others appear more than once a. $R=0$, $G>1$, $B>1$, $Y>1$ b. $R>1$, $G=0$, $B>1$, $Y>1$ c. $R>1$, $G>1$, $B=0$, $Y>1$ d. $R>1$, $G>1$, $B>1$, $Y=0$ Two colours are absent and all others appear more than once. $6$ cases Three colours are absent, all the draw is of one colour. $4$ cases All the four cases are mutually exclusive, so you can add the probabilities. Cases of $U=1,2,3,4$ can be treated similarly. This of course is not an elegant solution, but it I do not see why it should not work. I suggest asking this in math.stackexchange.com . Update 1 This approach is for calculating the probability distribution of $U$. For expected value of $U$ - whuber's answer is the right one.
