In topological data analysis, a persistence barcode, sometimes shortened to barcode, is an algebraic invariant associated with a filtered chain complex or a persistence module that characterizes the stability of topological features throughout a growing family of spaces. Formally, a persistence barcode consists of a multiset of intervals in the extended real line, where the length of each interval corresponds to the lifetime of a topological feature in a filtration, usually built on a point cloud, a graph, a function, or, more generally, a simplicial complex or a chain complex. Generally, longer intervals in a barcode correspond to more robust features, whereas shorter intervals are more likely to be noise in the data. A persistence barcode is a complete invariant that captures all the topological information in a filtration. In algebraic topology, the persistence barcodes were first introduced by Sergey Barannikov in 1994 as the "canonical forms" invariants consisting of a multiset of line segments with ends on two parallel lines, and later, in geometry processing, by Gunnar Carlsson et al. in 2004. Definition Let F {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} } be a fixed field. Consider a real-valued function on a chain complex f : K → R {\displaystyle f:K\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } compatible with the differential, so that f ( σ i ) ≤ f ( τ ) {\displaystyle f(\sigma _{i})\leq f(\tau )} whenever ∂ τ = ∑ i σ i {\displaystyle \partial \tau =\sum _{i}\sigma _{i}} in K {\displaystyle K} . Then for every a ∈ R {\displaystyle a\in \mathbb {R} } the sublevel set K a = f − 1 ( ( − ∞ , a ] ) {\displaystyle K_{a}=f^{-1}((-\infty ,a])} is a subcomplex of K, and the values of f {\displaystyle f} on the generators in K {\displaystyle K} define a filtration (which is in practice always finite): ∅ = K 0 ⊆ K 1 ⊆ ⋯ ⊆ K n = K {\displaystyle \emptyset =K_{0}\subseteq K_{1}\subseteq \cdots \subseteq K_{n}=K} . Then, the filtered complexes classification theorem states that for any filtered chain complex over F {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} } , there exists a linear transformation that preserves the filtration and brings the filtered complex into so called canonical form, a canonically defined direct sum of filtered complexes of two types: two-dimensional complexes with trivial homology d ( e a j ) = e a i {\displaystyle d(e_{a_{j}})=e_{a_{i}}} and one-dimensional complexes with trivial differential d ( e a i ′ ) = 0 {\displaystyle d(e_{a'_{i}})=0} . The multiset B f {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}_{f}} of the intervals [ a i , a j ) {\displaystyle [a_{i},a_{j})} or [ a i ′ , ∞ ) {\displaystyle [a_{i}',\infty )} describing the canonical form, is called the barcode, and it is the complete invariant of the filtered chain complex. The concept of a persistence module is intimately linked to the notion of a filtered chain complex. A persistence module M {\displaystyle M} indexed over R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } consists of a family of F {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} } -vector spaces { M t } t ∈ R {\displaystyle \{M_{t}\}_{t\in \mathbb {R} }} and linear maps φ s , t : M s → M t {\displaystyle \varphi _{s,t}:M_{s}\to M_{t}} for each s ≤ t {\displaystyle s\leq t} such that φ s , t ∘ φ r , s = φ r , t {\displaystyle \varphi _{s,t}\circ \varphi _{r,s}=\varphi _{r,t}} for all r ≤ s ≤ t {\displaystyle r\leq s\leq t} . This construction is not specific to R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } ; indeed, it works identically with any totally-ordered set. A persistence module M {\displaystyle M} is said to be of finite type if it contains a finite number of unique finite-dimensional vector spaces. The latter condition is sometimes referred to as pointwise finite-dimensional. Let I {\displaystyle I} be an interval in R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } . Define a persistence module Q ( I ) {\displaystyle Q(I)} via Q ( I s ) = { 0 , if s ∉ I ; F , otherwise {\displaystyle Q(I_{s})={\begin{cases}0,&{\text{if }}s\notin I;\\\mathbb {F} ,&{\text{otherwise}}\end{cases}}} , where the linear maps are the
