I'll echo jonothan sampson. As long as a reasonable number of people are still using older browsers, it's hard to make that jump. On the other hand, it's probably sensible to detect browsers and send a version that makes good sense. Since the differences between the two languages will be moderate, it will probably be feasable to transform an HTML5 page to HTML4 with additonal class and styles depending on user agent, perhaps with a little server side xslt. That said, I doubt I'd be the one to invent that technology, although I'd use it if or when it becomes available.
