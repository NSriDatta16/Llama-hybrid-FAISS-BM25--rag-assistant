Changing annotations in time series plots in R

While I can change annotations with the generic plot command turning off axes and annotations and specifying them again using the axis command e.g. cars I cant do it with time series object e.g. www How can I plot Maine.98 with annotations looking like: "Jan-98" "Feb-98" "Mar-98" "Apr-98" "May-98" etc?
