Intuitive meaning of a transition kernel in a Markov Chain in MCMC algorithms?

I read that in the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm, the transition kernel $K$ is given by: $$ \forall \theta^{t-1} \in \Theta , \ \ \ \ \ \ \ K(\theta|\theta^{t-1}) = \alpha\left(\theta|\theta^{t-1}\right)q\left(\theta|\theta^{t-1}\right) + \left(1-\alpha\left(\theta^{t-1}\right)\right)\delta_{\theta^{t-1}}(\theta) $$ Here, $\alpha\left(\theta|\theta^{t-1}\right)$ denotes the probability of acceptance given $\theta^{t-1}$, $q\left(\theta|\theta^{t-1}\right)$ denotes the proposal distribution and $\alpha\left(\theta^{t-1}\right)$ denotes the overall probability of accepting a candidate, given that the current state is $\theta^{t-1}$: $$ \int_{\Theta} \alpha\left(\theta|\theta^{t-1}\right)q\left(\theta|\theta^{t-1}\right)d\theta $$ and finally, $\delta_{\theta^{t-1}}(\theta)$ is the dirac delta mass. I am wondering if there is any intuitive meaning behind defining the transition kernel like this and why it is called a kernel and what it is used for. Thanks!
