Connecting timeseries quantities to CDF

In the following paper, [Ponce-Flores, M., Frausto-Solís, J., Santamaría-Bonfil, G., Pérez-Ortega, J., & González-Barbosa, J. J. (2020). Time series complexities and their relationship to forecasting performance. Entropy, 22(1), 89.][1] several quantities have been used to express the computational hardness of timeseries forecasting, for example: Spectral Entropy (internally the definition uses Autocovariance Function and Autocorrelation Function) Permutation Entropy (internally the definition uses Phase Space Reconstruction and Permutation Distribution) What is the best way to express Spectral Entropy and Permutation Entropy in terms of Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the time series?
