MUDs actions are usually performed on 'ticks' rather than immediately - this allows for limited affect of latency and for monster's commands to be inserted in the queue and processed fairly. Personally, I don't like this approach, but pretty much 99% of MUDs use it. You need to design a robust command queue & event queue which can handle both AI and user commands. You can then add "virtual latency" to AI commands which may be predefined or an average of all users latency, or whatever you like.
