Why are generative and discriminative models called that way?

In machine learning, if I understand it correctly, a generative classifier is one where we directly model the joint distribution $p(x,y|\theta)$ , while in a discriminative classifier we model $p(y|x, \theta)$ . Firstly, I don't understand why they are called that way. Secondly, I don't understand what makes these models different, since we can always use the product rule to get one from the other.
