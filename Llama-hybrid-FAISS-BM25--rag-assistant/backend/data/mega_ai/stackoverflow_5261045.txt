Currently I have only one tip for Xcode 3 users - don't use xcode 4 unless you have free time to start learning again and/or are willing to report lots of bugs . Wait at least until 4.1. There are still lots of bugs unresolved. Nothing is stable. Also Xcode 4 advertises as having single window ui which is nice, but is unstable as U238. Also - it's probably single thing that is good about new Xcode 4. So here are some of my headaches currently: There is no possibility to commit whole project (except for separately selected modified files); There is no possibility to push (if SMC is git). At least I haven't found that; Since symbol indexing is broken you cannot: see normal syntax highlight; jump to certain symbol definitions; Jump bar is just one big misunderstanding: Previously comfortable Ctrl+2 shortcut from Xcode 3 which lists method names and pragma marks has now become finger breaking Ctrl+6 (emacs user's rejoice ). There is no direct button to switch between interface and implementation files. If you have 13.3" macbook[pro] - don't even try to use navigators with utilities (inspectors or libraries). Also transition guide is made for working Xcode 4 which it is far from. Update 1: There is no such thing as "Build & Run". Only build, build for running, build for testing, build for profiling, build for archiving. Then just run without building and run without profiling. AFAIK it supposed to be easier so summa summarum - 8 actions instead of 1. Go figure. So these are only few of my instantly found glitches for Xcode 4. P.S. probably will be updating this in upcoming few days.
