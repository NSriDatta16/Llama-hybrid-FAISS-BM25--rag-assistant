If you simply seek a correlation coefficient then you can compute the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient, and this will produce a statistic in the range of (-1, 1) However, since you mention the response and explanatory variables, I suspect you would like to fit a regression model. An appropriate model in this case is Logistic Regression, a specific type of a generalized linear model, which will provide an odds ratio.
