[tableView reloadData]; doesn't work until I scroll the tableView

I have a simple app that downloads search results in XML when the user types in a UISearchBar . The download+parsing is threaded and once done it fires an NSNotification to tell the ViewController with the table view to [tableView reloadData]; Here is the code that receives the notification fired once results are in: - (void)receivedResults:(id)notification { results = [notification object]; DLog(@"Received %i results",[results count]); [[self tableView] reloadData]; } I get the log output "Received 4 results", but the table view doesn't reload the data until I scroll/drag it a couple pixels. I am using the built-in UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle cell style and im not changing the height or ding anything fancy with the table view. What am I doing wrong?
