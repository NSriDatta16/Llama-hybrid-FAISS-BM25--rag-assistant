Why steep loss reduction is an indication of inadequate initial weight allocation in neural network training?

This article says At times, you might see that your loss drops steeply after a short period of training, before stabilizing. This is a strong indication that your initial weight allocation is inadequate. I am wondering why steep loss reduction is an indication of inadequate initial weight allocation. Thanks!
