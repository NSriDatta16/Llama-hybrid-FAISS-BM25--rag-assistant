make a WPF Popup not screen bound

The default behavior of a Popup is if it is placed where it would extend beyond the edge of the screen, the Popup will reposition itself. Is there a way to turn this behavior off? I have a Popup that the user can drag around the screen. However, when it gets to the edges it gets stuck. It gets stuck on the edge and stays there until the mouse is dragged far from the edge. Also, I have two monitors and when the Popup is dragged to the edge the two monitors share I get flickering. The Popup flickers between the two monitors.
