How to organize import and export code for versioned files?

If an application has to be able to open (and possibly save) the file format for the last N releases, how should the code be organized sanely so that updating the file format is easy and less error-prone? Assume the file format is in XML, and functions take in objects for export and produce objects for import. Append a number to the end of each function name, and copy/paste it and increment the number for each new version? That's like maintaining multiple versions of version-controlled functions within source code. Perhaps do some magic at build time?
