Matt you are correct you raise a very good point - yes Laplace Smoothing is quite frankly nonsense! Just simply throwing away those features can be a valid approach, particularly when the denominator is also a small number - there is simply not enough evidence to support the probability estimation. I have a strong aversion to solving any problem via use of some arbitrary adjustment. The problem here is zeros, the "solution" is to just "add some small value to zero so it's not zero anymore - MAGIC the problem is no more". Of course that's totally arbitrary. Your suggestion of better feature selection to begin with is a less arbitrary approach and IME increases performance. Furthermore Laplace Smoothing in conjunction with naive Bayes as the model has in my experience worsens the granularity problem - i.e. the problem where scores output tend to be close to 1.0 or 0.0 (if the number of features is infinite then every score will be 1.0 or 0.0 - this is a consequence of the independence assumption). Now alternative techniques for probability estimation exist (other than max likelihood + Laplace smoothing), but are massively under documented. In fact there is a whole field called Inductive Logic and Inference Processes that use a lot of tools from Information Theory. What we use in practice is of Minimum Cross Entropy Updating which is an extension of Jeffrey's Updating where we define the convex region of probability space consistent with the evidence to be the region such that a point in it would mean the Maximum Likelihood estimation is within the Expected Absolute Deviation from the point. This has a nice property that as the number of data points decreases the estimations peace-wise smoothly approach the prior - and therefore their effect in the Bayesian calculation is null. Laplace smoothing on the other hand makes each estimation approach the point of Maximum Entropy that may not be the prior and therefore the effect in the calculation is not null and will just add noise.
