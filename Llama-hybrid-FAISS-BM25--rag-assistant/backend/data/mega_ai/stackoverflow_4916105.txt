Smarty caching problems with nested templates

I have a problem in caching in nested templates in Smarty 3. It seems that when I do an {include} Smarty ignores the caching settings of the caller template. For example, supposing smarty cache has been enabled in the controller: In template1.tpl: {include file='template2.tpl' nocache} In template2.tpl: {include file='template3.tpl'} In template3.tpl {$smarty.now} The {$smarty.now} value displayed on page is, until the cache is not cleared, always equal to the time of the first page visualization, although the first subtemplate is forced to be not cached. This is an annoying problem for me, since I need to control caching settings of all the content of template2.tpl and its subtemplates from template1.tpl. Are there elegant workarounds?
