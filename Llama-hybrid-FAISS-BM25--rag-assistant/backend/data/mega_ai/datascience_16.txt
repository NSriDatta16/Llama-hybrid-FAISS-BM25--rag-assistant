Use liblinear on big data for semantic analysis

I use Libsvm to train data and predict classification on semantic analysis problem. But it has a performance issue on large-scale data, because semantic analysis concerns n-dimension problem. Last year, Liblinear was release, and it can solve performance bottleneck. But it cost too much memory . Is MapReduce the only way to solve semantic analysis problem on big data? Or are there any other methods that can improve memory bottleneck on Liblinear ?
