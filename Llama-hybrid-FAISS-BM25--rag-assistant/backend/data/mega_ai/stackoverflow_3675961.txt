I am doing just this at the moment, and after initially implementing jqGrid I have settled on SlickGrid since I have a large amount of data (both columns and rows) and the performance of SlickGrid is much better. I also really like the observer based programming pattern which is encouraged in the examples, however this is more of a personal preference rather than an objective one. Here is the link to the demo page: http://wiki.github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/examples
