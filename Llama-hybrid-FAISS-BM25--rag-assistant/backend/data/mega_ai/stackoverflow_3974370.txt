ZipKit and iPhone

I tried to use the ZipKit framework ( http://bitbucket.org/kolpanic/zipkit/wiki/UsingZipKit ) in the test application for iPad. I followed the "Traditional way" of the installation (as it is described on their page) with no success. Hope somebody can help me with it: 1/ I used hg to get sources 2/ I build the ZipKit project (Release build) 3/ After doing this there was created in the build folder the new ZipKit.framework folder 4/ I have created a new test project for the iPad 3.2 (XCode 3.2.4) 5/ I have drag&dropped the ZipKit.framework folder created in the step 3) into Frameworks section on my new test project 6/ In Targets section I have created new Copy File Build Phase and I drag&drop the ZipKit.Framework from Frameworks section to the new Copy Files folder. 7/ Then I build and run the project. The project cannot be even started, it is being closed after I press the project icon - so I must do something terribly wrong. In the console output I can see the error - it is pretty clear what is missing, but I do not know what to do with that... Might be some XCode expert or someone, who used the ZipKit can help me - this must some really stupid mistake I am doing... There is the console output: dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/Frameworks/ZipKit.framework/Versions/A/ZipKit Referenced from: /Users/sten/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/3.2/Applications/3C51FC4F-0E85-48D2-BC68-D01ADD73DAE1/ZipExample.app/ZipExample Reason: image not found Failed to launch simulated application: iPhone Simulator failed to find the process ID of com.yourcompany.ZipExample. BTW - I have tried to run the ZipKit Touch example provided with the framework and it works perfectly... Thanks a lot BR STeN There is the screenshot of my test project - on the left side you can see the ZipKit.framework I drag&drop into my project:
