An algorithm similar to (or based on) K-means that do not require the 'k' number of clusters

These days I'm using a lot (and discovering) nice ways to use k-means' clustering. For example, clustering word embeddings (word2vec vectors) to find synonyms or clustering doc vectors (doc2vec) to classify topics. But for these tasks I always need to specify the number of clusteres (the 'k'). Is there some unsupervised algorithm that estimates a good number of clusteres and (but not must do) do the clustering task?
