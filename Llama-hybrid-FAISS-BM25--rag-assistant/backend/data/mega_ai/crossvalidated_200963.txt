You pose several important questions, some focusing on hypothesis testing, some on multiplicity, and so forth. These are my answers: The typical approach is to repeat the experiment analyzing every time as no prior study has been conducted. So in a standard frequentist framework only this eventual p counts. I find it wrong and wasteful, as a frequentist meta-analysis or a Bayesian synthesis would borrow information from prior studies as well. Notice indeed that a Bayesian meta-analysis without informative priors and a frequentist meta-analysis encomppassing the same studies will provide very similar, if not identical, inferential estimates. Yet, take notice that the typical Food and Drug Administration approach for regulatory approval of drugs typically disregards prior studies for hypothesis testing. The problem is not simply sample size, it mainly has to do with the precision of the effect and the effect size you think meaningful. A drug which reduces blood pressure by 0.001 mm Hg might be shown efficacious in a mega-trial, but this statistical significance would not be clinically meaningful (that is why ASA and many others are pushing for the abolition of p values and a transition to other approaches, such as confidence intervals). In any case, in a typical frequentist framework, a study could only test a single hypothesis (single test thus), per study, with all the other analysis requiring some penalization for multiplicity. You may indeed perform a meta-analysis of meta-analyses (meta-epidemiologic study), but this would mainly inform on the meta-analytic process, rather than on the intervention or effect size of interest. Accordingly, if you wish to simply combine studies, than you do not need a meta-meta-analysis. Selective publishing is very difficult to recognize by looking at a single study. If you have many studies, you can recognize peculiar patterns (eg. p=0.049 occurring much more frequently than p=0.051). However, if you only have one study at hand, then the only hope resides in looking at the pre-specified protocol.
