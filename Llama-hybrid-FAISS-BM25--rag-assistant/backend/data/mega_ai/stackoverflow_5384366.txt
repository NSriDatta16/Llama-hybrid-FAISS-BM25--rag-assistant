Your .rc file is compiled by rc.exe to embed the icon in your executable. rc.exe uses the include path to find the resources. This is specified by either the INCLUDE environment variable or by using /I option to rc.exe. If "my_icon.ico" doesn't work, try moving the file or change the include path. Clarification: rc.exe compiles .rc files into .res, but its the linker that does the actual embedding into the executable.
