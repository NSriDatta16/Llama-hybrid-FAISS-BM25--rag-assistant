So... I also need that feature. Before a began to use Eclipse, I was a Vim user. Actually a still use it for some edit task. There is a vimplugin for eclipse, so you can use it as your Eclipse editor. But its a matter of taste. You can configure vim to do exactly that: Tab insert 4 spaces. Backspaces deletes indentations. Here the config for your settings: set tabstop=8 " This is the default in any editor, Tabs are 8spaces Wide" set expandtab " Tabs are converted to spaces" set softtabstop=4 " Tabs are 4 spaces" set shiftwidth=4 " Indent is 4 spaces" " Here the magic" set backspace=indent,eol,start " Deletes over indent, line breaks, edit starts" HTH
