Survival analysis- how to assess the relative difference between two pairs of survival curves?

I am working with a model organism, and we are interested in looking for difference in the effect on survival of both genotype and treatment. For example, we would like to know if there is a larger relative difference in genotype A for a given treatment than for genotype B, something like ((A treated vs A untreated) vs (B treated vs B untreated)). What would be the most appropriate way to get at this? I am using the survival package in R, so should I just include the interaction of genotype and treatment in the formula in survdiff()? I've done quite a bit of survival analysis before, but usually only with varying one factor at a time, so this is new territory for me, and searching did not seem to turn up much literature on this issue in particular. Thanks!
