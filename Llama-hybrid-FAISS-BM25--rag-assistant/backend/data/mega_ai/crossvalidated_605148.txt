Portfolio Optimization using causal inferences

I'm trying to use causal inferences in portfolio optimization and I used CausalImpact library in python because it deals with time series. I wanted to check the effect of covid19 on the daily closing prices, so I selected the prior and post period as the period before and after 2019-03-01 respectively. Since there are no companies that weren't affected by covid19, I used the S&P500 stock market index as the control series. Is this feasible or are there any other alternatives I can use? Even though I predicted the counterfactual time series as above, I'm confused on how to use causal inferences in portfolio optimization. how can I use these causal inferences on portfolio optimization?
