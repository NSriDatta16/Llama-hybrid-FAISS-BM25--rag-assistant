Check out the tutorial at http://ant.apache.org/manual/tutorial-writing-tasks.html#complex There they show an example that just fails gracefully, throwing a BuildException in the custom task but not showing the stack trace in the console window. The code to pay attention to is in the execute() method of the ' HelloWorld ' Class, and where the helloworld task is called from the use.fail target.
