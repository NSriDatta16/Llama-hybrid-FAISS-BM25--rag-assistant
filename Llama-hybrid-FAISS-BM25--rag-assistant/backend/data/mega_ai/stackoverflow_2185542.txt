See W3C specs : id , class (document-wide identifiers) lang (language information), dir (text direction) title (element title) style (inline style information) align (alignment) onclick , ondblclick , onmousedown , onmouseup , onmouseover , onmousemove , onmouseout , onkeypress , onkeydown , onkeyup for is for label and specifies the id attribute of the input element to which the label applies. See also the HTML5 specs : The div element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. It can be used with the class , lang , and title attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements. Note: Authors are strongly encouraged to view the div element as an element of last resort, for when no other element is suitable. Use of more appropriate elements instead of the div element leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.
