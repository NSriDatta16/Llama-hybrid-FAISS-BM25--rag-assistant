Clarifying web development tools and languages (Java)

With a Java background, but having never developed for the web client side (i.e. scripts to be run by a browser), but java applets (which I suspect being, mmm, old-fashioned (right?) or otherwise I would clearly use them for some of the following) then consider the following scenarios: Only client side application (with no server interaction). Would you recommend to learn javascript or better to use the Google web toolkit (GWT) (which I understand that translates java code into javascript+html) Other choices? BIS: A client side application interacting with another client side app (i.e. both within a -different- browser) or with a server (standalone). The same choices than before? I know that GWT allows remote-procedure-calls. More? A rich internet app. Flex seems the usual choice (right?) I think there is no java-based language for this (JavaFx, despite its name is not Java, and I read around "it is fatally wounded") Other choices? A business application. Then, the choice is clearly JavaEE (which includes JavaFaces for the client-side). Really clear? Other choices? Please correct me if I'm wrong.
