You need to be very careful of view selection formula that have dates in them. If you use @Today or @Now then then Notes/Domino will always consider all of the documents in the view to be out of data and will have to rebuild the index every time it is accessed. This will be ok for very small databases, but a disaster in larger ones. Some people will try and work around that by using a formula like @date("Today"). Notes/Domino will not recognise that as a Date/Time based formula, since it doesn't contain @Today or @Now, and will work initially. But you will find that the view will not remove old documents unless the index is fully refreshed, which can be tricky to arrange for. The best way to deal with this is to have an agent run every night that updates the selection formula with the correct fixed date values. Jake Howlett at codestore.net has some excellent posts on doing this.
