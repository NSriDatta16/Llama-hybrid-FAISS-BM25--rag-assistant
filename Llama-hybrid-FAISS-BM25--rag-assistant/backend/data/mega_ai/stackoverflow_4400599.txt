You can reduce 1) with FastCGI. It will reduce stages 2) and 3) too. For measuring 3) you can use BEGIN blocks. Example: use Benchmark ':hireswallclock'; my ($t0,$t1); BEGIN {$t0 = Benchmark->new;} use DBIx::Class; BEGIN {$t1 = Benchmark->new;} print "the loading took:",timestr(timediff($t1, $t0)),"\n"; Deve::NYTProf will help you with 4). Also there are specific modules like Template::Timer, CGI::Application::Plugin::DevPopup::Timing, DBIx::Class::Storage::Statistics.
