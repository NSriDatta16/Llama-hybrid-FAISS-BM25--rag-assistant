Aggregating data by timespan in MySQL

Basically I want is to aggregate some values in a table according to a timespan. What I do is, I take snapshots of a system every 15 minutes and I want to be able to draw some graph over a long period. Since the graphs get really confusing if too many points are shown (besides getting really slow to render) I want to reduce the number of points by aggregating multiple points into a single point by averaging over them. For this I'd have to be able to group by buckets that can be defined by me (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, ...) but so far all my experiments had no luck at all. Is there some trick I can apply to do so?
