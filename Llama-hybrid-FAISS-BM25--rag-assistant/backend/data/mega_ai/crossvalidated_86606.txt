Yes the posterior will be Gaussian, because normal priors are conjugate with normal likelihoods that you probably know. I will ask you to go back to your book and verify the meaning of intractability, because though the posterior has a known form (multivariate normal), sampling from the multivariate normal distribution requires MCMC techniques, which may simply be why the say it is intractable. In any case i will want to know what intractability means in your case.
