You are trying to determine if some event/treatment (i.e. going on sale) has a significant effect on sales of some product_x. An A/B test is appropriate to answer this question if you have both test and control groups. Given: ( T )est and ( C )ontrol groups, where O1 = observation 1, a baseline measurement of normalized sales (i.e. average sales of product_x over some pre-defined time period) and O2 = after treatment measure of normalized sales. Between the first and second observation/measurement, T are given experimental treatment X . Typical experimental design - T: O1 X O2 C: O1 . O2 From the OP's description it sounds as if you don't have an adequate control group - although not ideal, it is possible to create control-like groups after the fact (sometimes you can use packages to help create matching control groups after the fact e.g., {optmatch} ). In your case, is it possible to get sales data from a similar store to the one you are studying, but one which did not have the sale on product_x? If so, this may be adequate as a control group. From your description, however, it sounds like you have a pre-test post-design: Given: ( T )est group with treatment X and normalized sales before and after the event -----time-----> T: O1 X O2 With this design, the primary threat to validity is lack of an adequate control group to ensure that any observed effect is actually due to the experimental treatment (i.e. the Sale). For example, if you observe an increase in over all sales of product_x from the pre to the post-sale period, this finding is consistent with your original hypothesis (A Sale will increase overall sales of product_x), but it is also consistent with some sort of temporal effect that happens to correlate with sales (e.g. seasonality effects , where product sales increase during certain time periods like the holiday season).
