Complex queries using Rails query language

I have a query used for statistical purposes. It breaks down the number of users that have logged-in a given number of times. User has_many installations and installation has a login_count. select total_login as 'logins', count(*) as `users` from (select u.user_id, sum(login_count) as total_login from user u inner join installation i on u.user_id = i.user_id group by u.user_id) g group by total_login; +--------+-------+ | logins | users | +--------+-------+ | 2 | 3 | | 6 | 7 | | 10 | 2 | | 19 | 1 | +--------+-------+ Is there some elegant ActiveRecord style find to obtain this same information? Ideally as a hash collection of logins and users: { 2=>3, 6=>7, ... I know I can use sql directly but wanted to know how this could be solved in rails 3.
