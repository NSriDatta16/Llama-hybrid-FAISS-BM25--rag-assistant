What would we violate if we use principal component analysis on datasets containing only dummy variables?

I have 23 dummy variables that are generated through a multiple-answer question. Respondents could choose more than one option. I ran a PCA and could see meaningful components emerging. I then calculated the values of components as the new variables (they are 7); varimax is used for rotation. I however wonder if there is any issue with respect to the required assumptions or the nature of data that would question the credibility of this practice? I am not interested in workarounds. I have 23 dummies resulting from a multiple-answer question, answered by 96 cases. PCA with varimax rotation generated 7 PCs. the loadings on the variables/options make almost perfect sense (for loadings above 0.35), for instance, PC1 clearly is loaded by the variables that are about the environment, PC2 is loaded by variables that are about social justice, etc etc. what could be wrong statistically? I also ran an optimal scaling in multiple correspondence analysis in SPSS. for this you need to change your dummies from 0-1 to 1-2 (categorical). determining 3 dimensions (instead of 2 or 7), the three dimensions here correspond well with the three of the seven dimensions found in normal pca. dummies seem to be functioning like scale variables when using normal pca. so again, assuming that we can make a sensible interpretation, what statistical/mathematical assumption could be violated by running pca on dummies?
