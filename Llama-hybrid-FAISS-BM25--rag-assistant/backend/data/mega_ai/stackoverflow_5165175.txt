Based on your edited question, and on the comments, here is a way to change your layout to a relative one: Though, if you want a perfect solution, you need to design the buttons and background pictures in 3 sizes, and put them in the respective folders drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi and drawable-ldpi(and for tablets, from 2.2, you can also have drawable-xhdpi!). Read carefully this article and test your layout in emulator for as many screens as possible (from ADT 10.0 it is really easy to preview your layout for different configurations directly from Graphical Layout tab in xml). Also, android:layout_marginTop="160dip" and android:layout_marginBottom="25dip" are not really useful in a Relative Layout. I would suggest you to try a 9-patch picture for your background, with only the wood board stretchable for the buttons (though I am not sure it's working like that). Alternatively, I would have a separate picture with Main Menu , that I'd place above the buttons, and keep in the background only the trees and everything else.
