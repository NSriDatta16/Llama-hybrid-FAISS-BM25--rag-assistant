That sounds pretty harsh to me, but if you think about the amount of money that changes hands during acquisitions, it's probably one of those cases where your IDE vendor just gets paid without complaint most of the time, so they keep with the policy. I can see why it shouldn't be completely free to transfer the license -- there is some (probably 'nominal') administrative work to do on the vendor's side, and they need to discourage people from transferring licenses all over the place when they really shouldn't be. But 25% seems awfully high for the amount of work and verification they need to do -- it seems like they could put some sort of cap on the license transfer fee, or have a fixed price. It does seem like the kind of policy that would drive customers to a competitor, particularly one that does not have the same kind of draconian license transfer policy.
