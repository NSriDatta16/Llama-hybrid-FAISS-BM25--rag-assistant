How to interpret curve of regularization loss during CNN training?

I am fine-tuning a single shot detector (SSD) in tensorflow object detection api. I didn't freeze the backbone (mobilenet), I programmed the learning rate to go from e-3 to e-4 to e-5. In the paper the loss function is the sum of a weighted l1 norm and a weighted softmax . But is the tensorflow object detection api, the default configuration uses a weighted sigmoid instead of a weighted softmax . When I visualize training progress on tensorboard, I get a curve showing the progress of the regularization loss. Here are 2 different examples of curves I got (first image : when I used weighted softmax, second image : when I used weighted sigmoid): How to interpret the progress of the regularization loss, is it bad when it is high?
