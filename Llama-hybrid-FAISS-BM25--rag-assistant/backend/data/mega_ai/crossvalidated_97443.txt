The pairing factor is the store within each region (OP later clarified). I would recommend you decide how to boil down the sales figures pre-launch into a single number from which to compare the post-launch figures against. I'll take the simplest, and therefore most interpretable approach here. It is OK to recompute every week with fresh results. This depends on 2. Take a close look at the 10 weeks prior to the launch, across all your test and control markets. Are there trends due to external factors? Make sure to adjust for these factors when simplifying to one pre-launch figure per store, whether it's an average of the 10 weeks or the week just before launch or something other adjusted number. Do a paired t-test for each market using store as the pairing factor, then present week-by-week post-launch t-test results to management.
