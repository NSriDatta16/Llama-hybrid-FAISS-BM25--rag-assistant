The first important part about your problem is its an imbalanced multi-class classification. In these cases, it's a valid point to tune the threshold of classification which is by default = 0.5. Moving to the important part is that since both of your classifiers - KNN & Logistic Regression aren't perfectly tuned it's not sound to compare the classifiers or the method of feature extraction. Secondly, your different classifiers are responsible for different decision boundary - LR makes a linear unlike KNN with non-linear boundaries. Thirdly, usually I have seen doc2vec to be better but it depends how good is your data. If documents are really small then doc2vec doesn't provide the additional benefit hence not much difference might be observed in TF-IDF & doc2vec.
