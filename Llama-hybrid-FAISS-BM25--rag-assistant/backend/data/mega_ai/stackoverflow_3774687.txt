Users of your project are interested in this things, in order of purely subjective importance: Downloading your apps Knowing what your apps does (project descriptions, screenshots) Get Help and Documentation How to report bugs How to get access to the source and to contribute How I would do it is to have a huge download link in the first page, with a short description of what your program is (max. 1-2 paragraph). Then there should be a link in obvious place longer description; forum/mailing list and documentations; and how to contribute and to report bugs. Rationale Why download links first instead of project description first? Your user likely come from two sources: articles referring your project, or your project announcement forums search engine In both cases, it is very likely they already have an idea of what your project is about before landing on your page. In the first case, they have read the article; while in the second case, they are searching for a tool similar to your project. However, for the second case, it is likely that they are still not sure that your project really are what they are looking for; that is why you add a brief project description on the side of the download link. This is to ensure them your project is/is not what they are looking for. Why "Help and Doc", "Bug Report", then "Contribute"? That's the order that user will do when they have problems with your program. First, they will look at the help and documentations, then maybe ask a few people in the forums; failing that, now they will file a bug report or feature requests; then if nobody took interest on the bug report/feature request, some will then have have the willingness to contribute.
