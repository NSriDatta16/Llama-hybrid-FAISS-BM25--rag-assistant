Reading your comments I have learned a little more about your situation and @ERT makes useful suggestions. That prompts me to speculate how you might approach this problem by looking at real data. Suppose you have data for 200 days and you want to start your investigation by looking at the one busy hour between 13:00 and 14:00. By looking at the historical data you might find that the average number of requests during that hour has been 550. Poisson model: If you assume that calls arrive randomly at the rate of 550 per hour at that time of day, then you might say that the number $X$ of calls per hour mid-day is distributed $\mathsf{Pois}(\lambda = 550).$ While you can't really find a realistic maximum and minimum that you will ever see during one mid-day hour, it might be useful to get an interval estimate designed to include requests during 90% of such hours. Interval estimate for requests in a mid-day hour: If the Poisson model is right, you can cut off the bottom and top 5% of probability from $\mathsf{Pois}(550),$ which gives the interval $[512, 589].$ Then you could plan to have staff or bandwidth (or whatever) available between 13:00 and 15:00 each day to accommodate about 590 requests in a timely fashion. (I used the computations below in R statistical software, where qpois is a Poisson inverse CDF (quantile function) and ppois is a Poisson CDF. qpois(c(.05,.95), 550) [1] 512 589 diff(ppois(c(511, 589), 550)) [1] 0.9036664 Interval for a mid-day five-minuted period: I'm not sure I would push the Poisson model down the the one-minute level, but the rate of calls during a mid-day five-minute period would be $550/12 \approx 46$ and you could use a similar method to get an interval estimate that would express the number of requests arriving within 90% of typical five-minute mid-day time periods: $[35, 57].$ (Because of the discreteness of the Poisson distribution it is not possible to get an interval that contains exactly 90% of the probability--91% is close.) qpois(c(.05,.95), 46) [1] 35 57 diff(ppois(c(34, 57), 46)) [1] 0.9109021 Similar analyses could be done for other times of day when the arrival rate of requests is smaller than at mid-day. I hope something like this approach will get you almost the kinds of answers you are looking for.
