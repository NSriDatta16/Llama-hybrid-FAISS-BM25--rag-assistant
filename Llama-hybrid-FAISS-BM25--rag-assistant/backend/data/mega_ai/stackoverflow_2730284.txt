Is it possible to easily modify the log4net section in the config file of several running applications remotely?

Our product consists of client, server and agents. Each deployed on different machines. The QA is having a hard time to manipulate the log4net sections in the respective config files. Right now, they have to have remote desktops to all the relevant machines and open notepad in each of them and then edit the files one at a time switching between different machines as they proceed. A real pain in the ass. Can anyone suggest a better solution to this problem? Thanks.
