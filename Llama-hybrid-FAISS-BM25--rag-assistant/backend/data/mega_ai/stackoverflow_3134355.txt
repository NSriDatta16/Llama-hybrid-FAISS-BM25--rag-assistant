1 Hour for Human Factors and Usability

I have volunteered to give a one hour lunchtime briefing at my workplace to our user experience team. I have a passion and love for human factors and user interface design and have had my hand in it for entire (albeit short) career. The problem I am having is it has been very difficult for me to decide how to focus this discussion so that I can convey some good information but within the one hour time limit. I was hoping to get input from SO on what you would be interested in hearing about that can also be contained within one hour. Here is what I have so far: Introduction to Human Factors Psychology Behind Human Factors UID Principles Usability Testing Standards Everything at this point is very high level. I am not sure if I should cut down the topics and dive in deeper, or if it would be better just to give an entire high-level presentation and encourage individuals to come talk to me for more information. Update About Audience The audience (the User Experience team) is made up of a number of individuals who already have a high-level understanding of what user experience entails. Many of the individuals are software developers and some are designers. However, not all the individuals are trained designers and it may be necessary to re-hit some high points. There are areas I see for improvement (which I could talk to). Unfortunately, I am not directly part of the group, so I don't know about the internal workings of the team (which would also help me better focus this presentation).
