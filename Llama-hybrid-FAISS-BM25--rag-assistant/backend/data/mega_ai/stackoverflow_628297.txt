Are evolutionary algorithms and neural networks used in the same domains?

I am trying to get a feel for the difference between the various classes of machine-learning algorithms. I understand that the implementations of evolutionary algorithms are quite different from the implementations of neural networks. However, they both seem to be geared at determining a correlation between inputs and outputs from a potentially noisy set of training/historical data. From a qualitative perspective, are there problem domains that are better targets for neural networks as opposed to evolutionary algorithms? I've skimmed some articles that suggest using them in a complementary fashion. Is there a decent example of a use case for that?
