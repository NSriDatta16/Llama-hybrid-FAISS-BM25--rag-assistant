Firstly it depends how you're going to mix them. That is, you could average the RGB components (this means blue (0,0,255) + yellow (255,255,0) == grey (128,128,128)), or you could work on Hues, Saturation and Value, which often gives a much more "as expected" result. Anyway, in either case, it's some simple maths: if the way to get the average is C3 = (C1 + C2) / 2 then the way to find C2 is C2 = (C3 * 2) - C1
