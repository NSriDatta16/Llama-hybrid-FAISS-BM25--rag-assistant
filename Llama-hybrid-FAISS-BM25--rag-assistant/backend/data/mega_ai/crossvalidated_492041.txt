There are multiple ways to build a computation graph. "Unroll" is a way to transform the recurrent calculations into a single graph without recurrence. This is a trade-off: faster processing, but consumes more memory. It's best for short sequences, which have low memory overhead. I've found the text and diagrams in this blog post helpful: http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/ The Keras documentation says much the same. unroll : Boolean (default False ). If True, the network will be unrolled, else a symbolic loop will be used. Unrolling can speed-up a RNN, although it tends to be more memory-intensive. Unrolling is only suitable for short sequences.
