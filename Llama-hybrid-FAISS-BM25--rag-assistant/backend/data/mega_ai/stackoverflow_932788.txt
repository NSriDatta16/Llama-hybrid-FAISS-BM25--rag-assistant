How to divide a long article and store in the database for easy retrieval and with paging?

Suppose it is a long article (say 100,000 words), and I need to write a PHP file to display page 1, 2, or page 38 of the article, by display.php?page=38 but the number of words for each page can change over time (for example, right now if it is 500 words per page, but next month, we can change it to 300 words per page easily). What is a good way to divide the long article and store into the database? P.S. The design may be further complicated if we want to display 500 words but include whole paragraphs. That is, if we are showing word 480 already but the paragraph has 100 more words remaining, then show those 100 words anyway even though it exceeds the 500 words limit. (and then, the next page shouldn't show those 100 words again).
