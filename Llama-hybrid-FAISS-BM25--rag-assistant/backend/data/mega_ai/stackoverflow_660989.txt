To solve this, I ended up using the TupleToPropertyResultTransformer and providing the list of property values. There are a few limitations to this, the main one being that the SQL query must return the results in the same order as you provide your properties to the TupleToPropertyResultTransformer constructor. Also the property types are inferred so you need to be careful with decimal columns returning only integer values etc. Apart from that using the TupleToPropertyResultTransformer provided a reasonably easy way to use an SQL query to return a collection of objects without explicitly mapping the objects within NHibernate.
