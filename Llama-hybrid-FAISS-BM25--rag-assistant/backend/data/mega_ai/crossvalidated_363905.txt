Welcome to CV. Questions about code are off-topic here, but most of your question seems to be about statistics, so that's OK. If you are trying to show evidence in favor of "no effect" the usual method is equivalence testing. One method of equivalence testing is TOST (two one sided t-tests). Searching for this term should help you find things. An alternative that may suit you is to combine the two samples and then include the sample (A vs B) as an independent variable. You could then look into mediation models. I am not sure why you think a Bayesian approach would be good here, but I am not at all expert on Bayesian methods.
