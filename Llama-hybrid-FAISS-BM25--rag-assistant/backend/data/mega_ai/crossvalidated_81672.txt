Bayesian Classification evaluation

I am trying to implement Bayesian Classification on the data set as follows: "Problem: classify whether a given person is a male or a female based on the measured features. The features include height, weight, and foot size." Example training set below (borrowed from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier ) Testing Below is some samples to be classified as a male or female. sex height(feet) weight(lbs) foot size(inches) sample 6 130 8 sample 4 140 5 Results: Actual:'female' and the output is (0.99, 'female') Actual:'female' and the output is (0.89, 'male') Here, i want to evaluate the classification accuracy. I am confused between two options for evaluation: First option, it classified 1 of 2 test data correctly, so the accuracy is 50%. Second option, the probabilities of being female are (0.99 + 0.11) /2 = 0.55, so the accuracy is 55%. Which option makes sense to evaluate the classification accuracy of this method? What are the meaning of each options?
