I have been very happy using CI to develop two rather small web applications. Having worked with Ruby on Rails, the MVC aspects of CI were easy to pick up, although CI is much "looser" a framework than RoR. I like CI since it does a good job of organizing your code, but ultimately gives you the flexibility to work with your code how you see fit. Some alternatives you may consider are: Kohana CakePHP Symfony
