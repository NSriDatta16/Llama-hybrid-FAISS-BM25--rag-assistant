First: It's generally a bad idea to include a .cpp file in another file - it leads to problems like this :-) The normal way is to create separate compilation units, and add a header file for the included file. Secondly: C++ has some confusing terminology here - I didn't know about it until pointed out in comments. a) static functions - inherited from C, and what you are talking about here. Outside any class. A static function means that it isn't visible outside the current compilation unit - so in your case a.obj has a copy and your other code has an independent copy. (Bloating the final executable with multiple copies of the code). b) static member function - what Object Orientation terms a static method . Lives inside a class. You call this with the class rather than through an object instance. These two different static function definitions are completely different. Be careful - here be dragons.
