Given the context I added to the question, which I suppose is why you asked that particular question, here, Herbert Scheidt said it is middle-level because of some kind of weird concept of taking the average of "high" and "low." Computer languages tend to be complicated, and arranging them on any particular continuum tends to be useless. (One exception is grammar class , in which case C++ ranks towards the hairy end, being context-sensitive.) C++ (using a recent compiler) is one of the few languages that will let you embed inline assembly language code into a first-class, strongly-typed "lambda" function. That pretty well solidifies its position in both the low-level and high-level categories. I don't think many people would conclude that being both puts it in the middle, though.
