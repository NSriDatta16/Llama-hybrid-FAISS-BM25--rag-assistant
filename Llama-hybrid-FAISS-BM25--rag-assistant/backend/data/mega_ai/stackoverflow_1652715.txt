Each time your reader does a nextInt() or nextString(), it doesn't read the next line, it reads the next characters separated by whitespace (space or newline). The simplest way to fix your problem would be to remove the "name =", "experience =", and just put the unique data on each line. So your file would look like: 2 Dursley 15 20 10 3 1 Aragorn 45 40 30 20 10 And then your code will work as is.
