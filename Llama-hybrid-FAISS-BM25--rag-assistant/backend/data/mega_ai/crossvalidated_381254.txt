Although tuning hyper parameters is always worthwhile, with scores that low, I think you should consider other algorithms. I don't understand the nature of the data, but it could be very heterogeneous (high variance), making it near impossible for some algorithms. I don't see much feature engineering you can do for this specific data, even though that is always a good place to start when trying to get better performance. But ultimately, I can only advise you try some other algos before attempting tuning. Good luck!
