I'm not familiar with the various automation tools available specifically for multi-threading, so I won't comment on them. But on simple yet effective option is to log key events from the running program to a CSV file. You could log the final result (if it is a calculation type program) or log out at every instance in the program where some key state is changed or event occurs. Because it's a multi-threaded app you would have to pay attention to comparing the sequence of logged data, if you can not guarantee the relative ordering of the key events you expect to see then compare output using key-value type results. Either way, the idea would be to create test data files which you can use for automated comparison when back testing.
