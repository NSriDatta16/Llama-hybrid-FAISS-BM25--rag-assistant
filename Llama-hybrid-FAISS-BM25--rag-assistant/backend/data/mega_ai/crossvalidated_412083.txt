STEP 1 (addend) If a time series has level/step shifts they must be identified and the resultant used to identify the ARIMA model If a time series has pulses/spikes they must be identified and the resultant used to identify the ARIMA model If a time series has seasonal pulses they must be identified and the resultant used to identify the ARIMA model If a time series has multiple trends they must be identified and the resultant used to identify the ARIMA model STEP 4A Verify that the parameters of the ARIMA model are constant over time Verify that the variance of the errors from the ARIMA model are constant over time otherwise use GLS or a Box-Cox Power transform ARIMA models the non-deterministic component . Removing trend , differencing, demeaning (accounting for intercept changes) all have different effects seasonal arima structure is an integral part of the model and reflects the need for stochastic seasonal structure as contrasted to seasonal dummies Data would be stationary if one subtracts "trend and seasonal pattern" i.e. nothing gets injected BUT that is not true when you difference in a willy-nilly way as unwarranted differencing creates a non-stationary series. Perhaps you can pass these useful hints on to your not-so-thorough reference as they are very misleading in their presentation of the steps to identify and refine an arima model.
