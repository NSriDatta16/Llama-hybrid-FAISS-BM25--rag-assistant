Scaling the target variables for Neural Networks in Regression Problem

I am trying to implement a neural network on a regression problem. I have scaled the independent variables since this is a crucial step for neural networks. However, I see online that some people recommend scaling the target variable also, and at the same time, there are other opinions that don't recommend doing feature scaling on target variables for neural networks. This is confusing as I didn't find any clear guidelines for the problem of scaling the target variables for neural networks. So Please if someone illustrates what should I do exactly regarding scaling the target variables? Should I always scale the target variables ? or it depends on the case? Or I should never scale the target variables for neural networks in regression problems? Moreover, if feature scaling the target variable is possible, do I still use MSE after I return back the target variable to its old scale, or feature scaling the target variable will affect MSE in some way?
