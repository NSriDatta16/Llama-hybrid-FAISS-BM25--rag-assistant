Ordinal data is one of the levels in Stevens' theory of scale types , which also includes nominal, interval and ratio data. This scheme can be useful and is widely applied, but is not without its problems , and some prominent statisticians think it is misleading . Use ordered-logit for ordinal logistic regression, which is a type of regression that is applicable when the dependent variable is ordinal. Newer methods of regression may also apply penalization to reduce overfitting in linear models with ordinal predictors.
