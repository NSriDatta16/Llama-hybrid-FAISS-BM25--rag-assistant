Android App Widget: Data storage

I'm implementing a home screen app widget. I was wondering which is better to store/read data: SharedPreferences or a SQLite database? The data is accessed from an AppWidgetProvider (similar to a BroadcastReceiver), and any given instance of the widget displays different data based on appWidgetId. Is one way or the other frowned upon?
