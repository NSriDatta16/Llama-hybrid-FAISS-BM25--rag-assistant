Every input node can be connected to every output node, but that wouldn't account for non linearity of features and relationships amongst each other that are predictive. A neural network without any hidden layers, is just a regression. I think this is a great intro to deep learning. In answer to your 2nd question: The number of nodes and connectivity are hyperparameters that should be optimized. Also, people use dropout (ie dropping out nodes) as a form of regularization.
