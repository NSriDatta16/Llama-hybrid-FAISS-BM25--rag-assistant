Paging: Storing Search Results

What's the proper way to deal with a web page that returns results of a search that could have differing results from one moment to another? I.e. returning the query the first time could contain different results from when the user clicks on page 2, and running the query again. How do most people deal with this scenario? Generally I'm working with internal ASP.Net applications (where security/bandwidth aren't huge concerns), so I'll store the results in the ViewState, and on postbacks deal with that data opposed to querying the database. What's the proper methodology for external WWW use? My best guess is to store the results in a temporary database table (not literally a temp table; I guess 'staging' might be more accurate), but I would think that table would get hammered quite a bit with inserts/deletes/etc, and I would think you'd need a process to clean the table up, which doesn't seem like a very elegant solution. Am I anywhere close?
