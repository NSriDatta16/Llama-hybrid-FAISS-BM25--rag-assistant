If you have enough labeled data, go for supervised learning with CNNs. Try object detections such as YOLO . They give you the bounding box of the object, as well as the predicted class. Some pre-trained models are also available, which in the latest version (YOLO9000!) supports around 9k classes. But not sure if your classes can be found there. Maybe use the pre-trained models and then fine-tune it with your data. Another approach would be semantic segmentation, something like a U-net . This one will give you segmentation but it requires masks as labels. As I said, if you have the labels, there are multiple options depending on the amount of the labeled data you have, or the kind of data available. If you have no labeled data, there are some unsupervised image segmentation methods as well. Have a look at here for example.
