The ``kernel trick'' can easily be applied to any Generalised Linear Model to give a Generalised Kernel Machine, which includes Poisson regression, see my paper (with a colleague and Mrs Marsupial): G. C. Cawley, G. J. Janacek and N. L. C. Talbot, Generalised Kernel Machines, in Proceedings of the IEEE/INNS Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN'07), Orlando, Florida, U.S.A., August 12-17, 2007. ( www , pdf , MATLAB software ) This includes a virtual leave-one-out estimator (like Allen's PRESS) that can be used for tuning the hyper-parameters efficiently. IIRC there is a Poisson regression example in the paper. NB this is a fairly obvious idea, the paper is mostly just to "advertise" the MATLAB toolbox to anybody that might find it useful. It had one "fun" (to program) feature which is that it used the MATLAB symbolic maths toolbox to generate the code for different kinds of GKM.
