Featuretools is a recently released python library for automated feature engineering. It's based on an algorithm called Deep Feature Synthesis originally developed in 2015 MIT and tested on public data science competitions on Kaggle. Here is how it fits into the common data science process. The aim of the library is to not only help experts build better machine learning models faster, but to make the data science process less intimidating to people trying to learn. If you have event driven or relational data, I highly recommend you check it it out! Disclaimer: I am one of the developers on the project.
