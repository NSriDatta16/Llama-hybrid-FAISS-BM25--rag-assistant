Deterministic time-aggregation of principal component factors. Is it wrong?

I have estimated the first factor/score using PCA on a set of 190 monthly timeseries. For my analysis I also need the quarterly factor. Two choices come to mind: Take the 3-month average of the constructed monthly factor, Take the 3-month average of the 190 timeseries and then estimate the quarterly factor via PCA. Can you please give any reasons why to do one over the other? Thank you.
