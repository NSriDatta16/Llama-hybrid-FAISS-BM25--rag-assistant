A data scientist’s position these days has become much more generalized and broad-based to the degree that it could fully supersede Machine Learning. And yet, there are cases where a data scientist does not perform data analysis on the data itself. A data scientist’s roles can be multifarious. Manipulating, processing, and querying large volumes of concurrent data is now an incredibly skilled task in the age of ‘Big Data’ technologies. Thus, a data scientist’s main function may be, for example, to run and manage an architecture to absorb a wide range of data from various sources. Statistics differ greatly in terms of wages and future growth! But one thing is fore certain that t he number of positions for data scientists well outruns the number of jobs for engineers in machine learning. And it can be said confidently that these jobs will certainly not go anywhere, at least for the next 20 years, as the amount of data and its complexities will continue to increase significantly more. Have a look at the following machine learning vs data scientist comparison. A lot of Data Scientists’ job posting appeared and was flooding the market in the previous years. The same for the Machine Learning Engineer position is happening, it’s a fairly new one and is slowly evolving in areas where we have data specialists.
