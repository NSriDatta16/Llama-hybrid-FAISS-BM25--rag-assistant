Serialize DOM elements including all CSS properties

I am developing a online website design system like yola.com. I want to get a list of applied CSS properties with their values to any DOM element. For example, I have a h1 tag and its css changes randomly by jquery ui when resizing and dragging, also changes its text decoration and also the text contents by tinymce and so on. I have a save button in this page. When I click save, I want to save all these changes in to a database using php. Now my aim is to know only the css and inner text content of each element. How can I do this?
