Is there a term that refers to the distance of an object from the mean?

I am trying to rephrase this sentence: I will compare the difference between the deviation of the student's midterm exam mark in this class from the class average with the deviation of the marks given to his other midterm exams from their respective class averages. Is there an alternative_word that could be used to replace "the deviation of the student's midterm exam mark in this class from the class average"? My sentence would be less awkward if it read: I will compare the alternative_word of the student's mid-term exam mark with the alternative_word of his other mid-term exam marks.
