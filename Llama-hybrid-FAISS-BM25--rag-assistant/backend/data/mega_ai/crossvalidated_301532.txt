Is PCA optimization convex?

The objective function of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is minimizing the reconstruction error in L2 norm (see section 2.12 here . Another view is trying to maximize the variance on projection. We also have an excellent post here: What is the objective function of PCA? ). My question is that is PCA optimization convex? (I found some discussions here , but wish someone could provide a nice proof here on CV).
