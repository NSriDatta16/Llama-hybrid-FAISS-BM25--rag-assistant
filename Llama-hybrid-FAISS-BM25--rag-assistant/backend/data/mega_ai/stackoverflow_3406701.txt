Preview Handlers (Office 2007, Vista & Win7) - issue w/ reisize

Greetings, I'm working on a preview handler for Office 2007, Vista and Windows 7. I'm basing my code off the following MSDN article . The "guts" are done as it was pretty straight forward. I've been testing in Windows 7 (64-bit) Explorer. One thing I've noticed is the preview handler appears to "lock" the Explorer window and doesn't allow it to resize. My handler derives from FileBasedPreviewHandler , the Control from FileBasedPreviewHandlerControl . The #Load override simply does: MyViewer viewer = new MyViewer(); viewer.Dock = DockStyle.Fill; viewer.SetFile( file.FullName ); Controls.Add( viewer ); A couple things I've tried, a variety of times is to set, in the design view, the AutoSize and AutoSizeMode to true and GrowAndShrink Now, the funny thing, i swear it worked once. Now, I can't get it to work at all. If anyone has any input, that would be great. I think I posted all the relevant info, but if I missed something vital, let me know. I appreciate your attention to this question. -Cheers!
