I believe the most elegant solution, and what you want, is NSTimeInterval , that is the primitive type that NSDate is built on top. NSTimeInterval is a typedef for double , and is a measurement of time in seconds. This primitive time type do not have any concept of a reference date. What NSDate do is to add this concept of reference date and anchor the 0.0 time at 1 January 2001 GMT. There is nothing that stops you from inventing your own reference date or anchor , like for example "midnight of whatever day there is" . What you can do is to add two properties of the NSTimeInterval either as startTime and endTime and let them both use midnight as the reference. Or you could skip endTime and go for a startTime and duration combo.
