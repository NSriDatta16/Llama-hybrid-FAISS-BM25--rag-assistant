CSS psuedo-class first-line overrides first-letter

My problem is this, that I want to style the first line and first letter of every paragraph but the first-line attributes move on to the first-letter attributes even if I re-declare them in the declaration of first-letter. This is how the code looks: p:first-line { font-variant:small-caps; } p:first-letter { font:none; font-variant:none !important; font-family: firstLetterFont !important; font-size:200%; font-weight:bold; } The problem is that my custom font (firstLetterFont) is not being used for the first-letter, instead the default Times New Roman is used. I placed !important tags but to no avail. Anyone have any method of overriding the attributes of first-line?
