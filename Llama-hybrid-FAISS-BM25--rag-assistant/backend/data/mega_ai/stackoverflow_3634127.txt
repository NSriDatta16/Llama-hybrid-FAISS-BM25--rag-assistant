Autodeploy in Glassfish V3 and JNDI in sun-resources.xml problem

When I want to deploy my war in glassfish v3 (Hot deploy / autodeploy) an error raised. Because of I am using database resource in my project. It's JNDI is stored in the sun-resources.xml file so when I drag & drop the war to autodeploy I take the Error. But when I use of Netbeans deploy ant script all things happens properly. My question is how to deploy with autodeploy folder in Glassfish V3 if the project using JNDI in the sun-resources.xml? Thanks
