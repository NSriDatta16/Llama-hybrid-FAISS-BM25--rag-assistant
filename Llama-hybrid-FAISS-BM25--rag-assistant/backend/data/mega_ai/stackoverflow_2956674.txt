"Creating a branch" in svn is really just making a copy of some subset of your repository. In fact, the SVN Book chapter on branching says as much . If your directory structure looks like thisâ€¦ project trunk branches tags and your URL to trunk is: http://example.com/repos/project/trunk , you would: make a new branch named beta from HEAD like so: svn copy http://example.com/repos/project/trunk http://example.com/repos/project/branches/beta This will immediately create the new branch in the repository and doesn't do anything to your local copy. make a new branch named ancient from an older revision n like so: svn copy -r n http://example.com/repos/project/trunk http://example.com/repos/project/branches/ancient This is exactly the same as 1 , but uses the specific revision. make a branch named alpha from your local copy, assuming your current directory is trunk : cd ../ svn cp trunk branches/alpha This will make the copy you requested, but does it locally. According to the SVN book, this is discouraged because it takes a lot longer than making the copy on the repository server (where the copy operation is essentially free). There's also this caveat listed when you type svn help copy : WARNING: For compatibility with previous versions of Subversion, copies performed using two working copy paths (WC -> WC) will not contact the repository. As such, they may not, by default, be able to propagate merge tracking information from the source of the copy to the destination. In my experience, way 1 is typically used. 2 is used in some rare cases involving complicated patches to earlier branches, and 3 is never useful (and according to the documentation, slow and possibly dangerous). So stick with 1 unless you have a compelling reason to use one of the other two.
