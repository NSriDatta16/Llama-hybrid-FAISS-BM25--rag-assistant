You need a way to detect what has changed in the database since you last connected. SQL Server offers two frameworks for this: Change Tracking and the Change Data Capture . For a comparison of the two, see Comparing Change Data Capture and Change Tracking . These frameworks are leveraged by the .Net Sync Framework to automate data synchronization. Unfortunately, none of these are available in SQL Server 2005. They are all SQL Server 2008 features, so you would have to upgrade. With SQL Server 2005 you can only track the changes manually. There are several approaches, all imperfect, and they all revolve around either triggers and tracking tables, or around tracking row versions with a TIMESTAMP (the problem is always how to track deleted rows). While Core-Data has buil-in support for synchronization (see Syncing Core Data Applications ), it is not usable with your scenario.
