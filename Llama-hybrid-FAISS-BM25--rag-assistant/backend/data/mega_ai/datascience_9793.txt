Running examples from scikit-learn tutorials

I am new to scikit-learn. I went through the examples given in the docs and I downloaded the script for recognizing images of hand-written digits. When I made the script to run on my laptop, I got the following errors: Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Python34\plot_digits_classification.py", line 22, in from sklearn import datasets, svm, metrics File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\sklearn\__init__.py", line 57, in from .base import clone File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\sklearn\base.py", line 11, in from .utils.fixes import signature File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\sklearn\utils\__init__.py", line 11, in from .validation import (as_float_array, File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\sklearn\utils\validation.py", line 16, in from ..utils.fixes import signature File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\sklearn\utils\fixes.py", line 324, in from scipy.sparse.linalg import lsqr as sparse_lsqr File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\scipy\sparse\linalg\__init__.py", line 109, in from .isolve import * File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\scipy\sparse\linalg\isolve\__init__.py", line 6, in from .iterative import * File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\scipy\sparse\linalg\isolve\iterative.py", line 7, in from . import _iterative ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found. Please help me. Also, I want to know if I want to load data for prediction, how should I do that? For example, if I want to test a hand written digit that is stored somewhere on my disk, how to prepare that data for loading and passing into this model for prediction?
