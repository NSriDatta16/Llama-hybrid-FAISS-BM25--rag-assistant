Neural Network or Differentiable Graph Matching

Searching for: Neural Network solutions or implementations (learnable algorithm) for inexact graph matching. Graph matching: Given two graphs GM = (VM , EM) and GD = (VD, ED), with |VM| = |VD|, the problem is to find a one-to-one mapping f : VD → VM such that (u, v) ∈ ED iff (f(u), f(v)) ∈ EM . Inexact graph matching means that it is not possible to find an isomorphism between the two graphs to be matched. This is the case when the number of vertices is different in both the model and data graphs, as found in many imaging problems. I am aware of: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6702-differentiable-learning-of-submodular-models.pdf http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505936 Advice: On any papers, algorithms, prefarably implemented (GitHub) that deal with learnable graph matching. This is to be used in an optic flow Neural Network approach.
