What about using TempData? You'd need to put the value back into TempData between the confirmation and finalization actions, but at least it will be discarded with each request. Note that TempData uses the Session for storage so it's no more secure while it's being stored, but it does have the automatic removal feature. I, too, would resist storing the number on the page. I suspect that this violates the PCI rules. Another alternative would be to store the card info in a database. If you keep it at all in your application you're probably already subject to the PCI rules anyway. Storing it in the DB makes it easier as then you only need to put the billing card id in subsequent requests. This could easily be in a hidden field.
