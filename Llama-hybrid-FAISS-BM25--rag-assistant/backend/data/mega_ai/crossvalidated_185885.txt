crossvalidation for forecasting sales

My objective is to predict the sales 6 weeks in advance. I have data that from 01-Jan-2013 to 31-June-2015. I am supposed to predict the sales from 01-Aug-2015 to 17-Sept-2015 using machine learning. I was trying to develop a method to cross validate. this is the way I split the data: ----------------------------------------------- | | training | Testing | ----------------------------------------------- | fold | year | months | year | months | | 1 | 2013 | 4,5,6 | 2013 | 7,8 | | 2 | 2013 | 9,10,11 | 2014 | 12,1 | | 3 | 2014 | 2,3,4 | 2014 | 5,6 | | 4 | 2014 | 7,8,9 | 2014 | 10,11 | | 5 | 2015 | 12,1,2 | 2015 | 3,4 | ----------------------------------------------- Is this the proper way to do it?
