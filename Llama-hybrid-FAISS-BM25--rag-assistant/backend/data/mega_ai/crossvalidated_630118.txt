All answers given so far are correct in the sense that they will convert a distance $d \in [0, \infty]$ to a similarity $ s \in [0, 1]$ , such that: $(d \rightarrow 0) \Rightarrow (s \rightarrow 1)$ $(d \rightarrow \infty) \Rightarrow (s \rightarrow 0)$ However, a point that is not often addressed is the scale of $d$ . When working with similarity, we commonly want to use a threshold — say of $0.5$ — to decide whether two vectors are "similar enough". But unless vector distances are relatively short, most reciprocal-based conversion methods will rapidly approach zero, making it hard to find an adequate threshold. For example, imagine a domain where $d for "similar" vectors. Using the common reciprocal conversion: $$s = \frac{1}{1 + d}$$ The similarity between two vectors such that $d = 49$ will be $0.02$ — a rather counter-intuitive value for "close" similarity. An alternative in this case is to use a conversion method that takes into account the expected distance range. For example, given an empirical upper distance limit $d_{max}$ , we can calculate $s$ as: $$s = 1 - min \left ( \frac{d}{d_{max}} , 1 \right )$$ In the above case, setting $d_{max} = 200$ would lead to $s = 0.755$ , which is a much more intuitive result for two "similar" vectors. The question remains of how to choose $d_{max}$ . In the common scenario where we want to identify a vector's class by comparing it with an exemplar set, a simple procedure would be: Calculate the average vector for the exemplar set; Find the maximum distance $d^*$ between the average and the exemplar vectors; Decide on a suitable similarity $s^*$ for $d^*$ ; Calculate $d_{max}$ such that: $$d_{max} = \frac{d^*}{(1 - s^*)}$$ If we set $s^* = 0.9$ , that would make $d_{max}$ equal to ten times the maximum distance between the exemplar set average and its entries.
