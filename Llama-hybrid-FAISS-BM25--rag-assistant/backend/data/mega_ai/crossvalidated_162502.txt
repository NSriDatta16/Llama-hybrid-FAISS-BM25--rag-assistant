There exists an improper (sometimes called non-informative) prior that with Bayesian analysis will result in the exact same estimates as classical regression. Using a proper/informative prior will give different estimates, with the estimated slope being an "average" of the OLS estimate and the prior information. The interpretation also differs, the Bayesian analysis results in a posterior density estimation instead of classical confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. The Bayesian approach can also use a likelihood different from the normal distribution which can give more flexibility.
