I updated my useragent line to a different user agent and suddenly the .ASPXAUTH cookie was set correctly (and automatically) in the cookie file :) In otherwords I changed this line: curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/4.0 (Windows; MSIE 6.0; U; Windows NT 5.1)"); to this: curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)"); And now both cookies are set automatically by curl - no problem. Hooray!
