What is the conceptual difference between Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) and Residual Standard Error (RSE)?

I am very new to statistics and am currently using the Introduction to Statistical Learning with R book. I am having some issues understanding the difference between RSS and RSE. From my understanding, RSS is the sum of all the residual errors, that is to say it is a measure of how "off" our model is from the true relation. However, according to the book, RSE is the average amount that our response will deviate from the true regression line. What is the difference exactly or what am I misunderstanding? I have tried to reading online but most of the links I have found simply explain that you use the RSS to calculate the RSE. Any help is appreciated, Thanks!
