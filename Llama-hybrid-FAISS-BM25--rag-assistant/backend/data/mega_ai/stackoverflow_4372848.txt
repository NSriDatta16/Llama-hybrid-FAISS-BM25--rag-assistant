If you're going to be storing information that is unique to a user, across many pages, then Session is a good choice. A cookie is used to tie a user to a given Session, and Sessions will time out, which is something to keep in mind. ViewState is simply a hidden field in HTML, so this can be used to persist objects when a page posts back to itself. The drawback is you're serializing your data into a string and sending it to the client (it's validated upon post back, so tampering with it will throw exceptions). To answer your question, yes, ViewState is per user per page. If you need to store data that is accessed by all users of your site, Application storage or HttpContext.Cache are useful. That's just a quick summary, for a more detailed description of your options, check out ASP.NET State Management Overview .
