If you want only class="dra sta" and not all .sta elements, then you need to use both classes in the selector, you can do that by leaving no space between the .class selectors , like this: $('.dra').draggable({ addClasses: false, containment: 'window', zIndex: '9999', stack: '.dra.sta' }); If you don't have a space, it only matches elements with both classes. You need a specific selector here because it's not checking against the .dra elements only, but rather using that text literally as the selector, with no restriction (for example the above translates to $('.dra.sta') ), you can see the source here .
