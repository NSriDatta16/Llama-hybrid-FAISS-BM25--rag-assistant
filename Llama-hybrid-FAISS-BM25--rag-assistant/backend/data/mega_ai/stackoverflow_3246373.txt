Magento loop through pages

I found enough documenatation about how to loop through all available categories in Magento, only the thing i want is to loop trough available pages in Magento to include them in my global navigation. So im asking you guys, someone knows how to do this? I imagine myself it should look something like this foreach ($this->getPages() as $page) { echo ' getUrl().'">'.$page->getName().' '; } Your help is appreciated
