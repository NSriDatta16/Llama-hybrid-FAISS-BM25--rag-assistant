How to boost productivity in my Flex/Java stack?

I am embarking on a new RIA project with Java on the backend. I'm the only developer, and the app is a line-of-business application. My current stack looks like this: MySQL || Spring(JdbcTemplate for data access) || BlazeDS (remoting) || Flex(Cairngorm) My question is: what changes can I make to improve productivity? Manually coding SQL, server-side entity objects, client-side value objects and all the Cairngorm stuff is obviously a drag, but I'm not sure what higher-level frameworks to introduce. What Flex/Java stack has served you well?
