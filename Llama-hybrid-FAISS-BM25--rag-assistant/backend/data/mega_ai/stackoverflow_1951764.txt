I'm experimenting with XUI as well, looks promising, seems to follow JQuery-way of doing things. The same people also created ' lawnchair ' for persistant storage of data in json format, XUI+lawnchair looks like a great combination for cross-platform (as in at least iphone+android, maybe webos, symbian, blackberry and ms as well) mobile development.
