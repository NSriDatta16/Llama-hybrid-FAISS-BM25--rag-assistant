It really seems like a signal processing question first. A rapid google search give : Automatic detection of epileptogenic video content . The main work is about signal processing techniques to detect brutal intensity changes in the image. Basically they create a time series that represent the overall difference in intensity between consecutive frames and show that it is usually enough to detect epileptogenic content. They give an exemple where they are able to measure 4 flashes in less than a second, which is above the 3 flashes per second threshold defined in international recommendations (Recommendation ITU-R BT.1702 Geneva, International Telecommunication Union, 2005) : From other sources, it seems that the flash detection part can be improved (by fourrier analysis to detect spikes, by applying mask to remove low movement part of the images ... etc.). I am not sure the overall process (is this the best way to detect philogenetic content ? is the 3 flash threshold optimal ?) can be significantly improved using ML, as (1) detecting >X spikes in a small time windows seems easy and enough, (2) ML would require a significant collection of videos and (3) it might be quite difficult (and quite unethical) to collect ground truth about epilepsy induction. But this give you a starting point on how to build your feature if you want to go this way.
