Bayesian modelling of a variation of dice problem

I'll start with the normal case, finding the probability for each face of a dice: Start with uniform prior - Dirichlet distribution with all alphas 1 Roll the dice, and depending on the result, compute the posterior distribution The variation of the problem that I'm dealing with is: Choose a number randomly, say 2 Roll the dice You will only know if the result was 2 or not: true/false. If the dice threw 3, you will get false. If it was 2, you will get true as feedback An example: I ask for one throw of a dice, and ask if the face was '3'. The dice thrower will throw the dice once, and will only tell me if the face was '3' or not. How should I model this? I can start with the same uniform prior using Dirichlet distribution (with all alphas 1). I can update the prior if the dice result was true. But I'm unsure as to how to update the prior when the dice result is false.
