I have had this problem too, but my solution is different and may help someone. My problem was text blur after changing the size of a UIView object thru TouchesBegan and CGAffineTransformMakeScale , then back to CGAffineTransformIdentity in TouchesEnded . I tried both the varying text size and rounding of x and y center points but neither worked. The solution for my problem was to use even sizes for the width and height of my UIView !! Hope this helps ....
