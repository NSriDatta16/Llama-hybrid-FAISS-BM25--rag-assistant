What benefits does an AIR app have over a Flex browser app?

Please feel free to add multiple answers, each with a single point, to make the voting work well... and don't add something someone else already said. All I know about AIR is you can have local storage, but there must be more to it... offline access is another key one but then you can run a SWF locally if you save it to your PC.
