O(n^3) solution. Iterate the string recursively. For each letter establish every palindrome with this letter as the start of palindrome. Pay attention to odd and even numbered palindromes. Repeat until end of string. If at the end of string the palindrome count is minimal then remember how you got there. Don't iterate further if sum of current palindromes count and remaining letters in the string is larger than current palindrome count minimum. An optimization: when discovering palindromes start from the end of the string and search for occurrence of your current letter. Test the substring to "palindromness". Don't start from shortest palindromes, it's not optimal.
