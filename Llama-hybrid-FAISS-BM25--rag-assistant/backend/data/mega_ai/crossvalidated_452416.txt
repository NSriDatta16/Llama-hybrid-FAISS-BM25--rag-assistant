Is decision boundary of penalized logistic regression linear?

The decision boundary of SVM is a straight line. If we use e.g. RBF kernel, decision boundary is linear in hilbert space, but it the original space it is non-linear. I assume that the logistic regression has linear decision boundary. Is it linear also after using of penalty term, such as elastic net?
