Editing draggable after it's added to a sortable

Hey, I'm trying to work out what event I need to bind to and what property I need to use to get a reference to the DOM element for the dropped item (That is the item in the receiving list. Here's what I have so far... A B C $('#existing').sortable({ revert: true }); $('#toolbox li').draggable({ connectToSortable: '#existing', helper: 'clone', revert: 'invalid', }); My objective is to turn, for example, A into something else once it's dropped into the #existing ul (Anything else will suffice - the real implementation is far more complex. I just need to get my hands on that DOM element). I have tried the following as the receive for my sortable: function receive(ev, ui) { $(this).append(' this '); ui.sender.append(' sender '); ui.item.append(' item '); } But this appears to be the #existing UL, sender and item are both the li that was dragged in toolbox. What I'm looking for is the newly created li inside #existing. Is there a property or another event which will give me what I'm after?
