How is correlation done between identified PCA components?

I am very new to statistics on this level (PCA, Correlations etc.). I am currently writing a paper and following the methodology from another journal paper. In the journal paper a PCA is done on a set of Likert scale questions (1-5) with number of factors set to 5. Now the next step in the journal paper - after identifying the factors/components - is they have done a correlation (the table's name in the paper is Pearson bivariate correlation analysis) on the factors/components. My question is how were the identified components/factors merged to have the correlation done on them? Was the mean of each of the questions making up the factors/components used to create a new variable? This image might help explain my question better: https://i.stack.imgur.com/xAhlC.jpg I'm not sure if the answer is very obvious/simple that I am missing but I have looked and searched everywhere I just can't find anything on it. Maybe I'm using the wrong keywords.
