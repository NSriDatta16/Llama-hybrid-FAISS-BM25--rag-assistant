As far as I know, there are three major (modern) libraries for Bayesian Inference in Python - PyStan, PyMC3 and Edward. All 3 should be pretty fast, as PyStan compiles into C++, PyMC3 was built on top of Theano, and Edward on top of Tensorflow. Of the three, PyMC3 has the easiest-to-learn syntax, but is allegedly somewhat computationally unreliable at times. For PyStan you will have to learn a clunky language (the original Stan language), but it's very well documented. I personally like Edward best, but it requires knowledge of variational inference (thus making it harder to maintain from a commercial standpoint), as you will need to specify cavity distributions for inference. PyStan probably has the largest developer community within academia, PyMC3 has a pretty strong following too. Not too sure about the size of Edward community (since it's quite new), but its forum shows it's very active.
