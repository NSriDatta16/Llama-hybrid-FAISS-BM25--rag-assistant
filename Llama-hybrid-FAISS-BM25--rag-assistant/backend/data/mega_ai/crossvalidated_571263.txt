@ChristianHenning comments "Not knowing what the questions are and the aim of your study, I don't know whether it makes sense to define a single score...." That is the crux of the matter. Adding or averaging ordinal Likert scores to get an overall survey score is always controversial. However, in a later comment you mention several of the questions on the survey and I think averaging may be reasonable. You should look at several of these scores to see if you feel average scores are meaningful for your purposes. Perhaps you are averaging Likert-5 scores for the seven subjects, before and after the training. If so, you might have Before b and After a average survey scores as below. b; a [1] 0.4 3.1 2.8 3.4 1.8 3.0 1.0 [1] 0.9 3.9 3.1 4.5 3.5 3.9 2.0 In my fictitious data, every one of the seven participants had a somewhat larger average score After than Before. Also, as one would expect, there is a positive correlation in the scores. cor(a, b) [1] 0.9332438 On the scatterplot below, all seven points lie above the 45-degree line through the origin. plot(b,a) abline(0, 1, col="blue") A paired Wilcoxon signed rank test in R (essentially a one-sample test on the seven $b - a$ improvements) shows a significant improvement at the 2% level of significance (The P-value $0.01563 wilcox.test(b, a, pair=T) Wilcoxon signed rank test data: b and a V = 0, p-value = 0.01563 alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 Of course, your real data may give different results than the fictitious data I used for this illustration. Note: In case you are interested, my fictitious data were sampled in R as shown below: set.seed(2022) b = round(4*rbeta(7, 1, 2),1) i = round(2*rbeta(7, 1, 1),1) a = b + i
