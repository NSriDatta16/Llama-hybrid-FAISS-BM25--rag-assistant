The problem here is that MSXML states that createElement will always give you the default namespace (just as you are seeing). I think you'll need to switch to the more complex but more powerful XmlConfig. In this case, try using a document fragment to add the entire element with correct namespace instead of depending on MSXML to create it for you.
