Is there a use case for nested autonomous transactions?

I was trying to come up with a real life programming problem that could be best solved by using autonomous transactions within autonomous transactions but could not think of any. Can you give me any ideas? Edit: I mean something like this: PROCEDURE outer_procedure IS BEGIN -- some code auto_proc1; END; / PROCEDURE auto_proc1 IS PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION; BEGIN -- some code auto_proc2; END; / PROCEDURE auto_proc2 IS PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION; BEGIN -- some code NULL; END; /
