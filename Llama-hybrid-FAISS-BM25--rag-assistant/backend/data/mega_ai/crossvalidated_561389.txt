Ordinal logistic regression suign clmm function in R, random effect structure

I'm running an ordinal logistic regression in R. I have 3 independent categorical variables (each with two levels). I was wondering if there is a similar function to step from the lmerTest package for linear (mixed) models that can be used for determining the random and fixed effect structure when using cumulative link mixed models in R. So far, I've been using anovas to compare two models, whether the model which included a given random factor could explain the data better, but I would like to know if there is an "easier" and more systematic way to arrive at the best model structure when using a cumulative link mixed model ( clmm ). Is there a similar function to step analyzing ordinal data using clmm?
