Conditional posterior distribution of coefficient in logistic regression

I would like to derive the conditional distribution of β in a logistic regression where Y follows a Binomial distribution B(n,p) the probability model is given as: logit(p)=X'β +u+v ; u is spatial random effects and v is non spatial random effects β follows a priori a normal distribution The posterior distribution is given as: My question is, what do I have to replace by if I want to derive the conditional distribution of β ? Is it possible to get the mean and variance of logit(p)=X' β +u+v so that I can transform it by normal distribution.
