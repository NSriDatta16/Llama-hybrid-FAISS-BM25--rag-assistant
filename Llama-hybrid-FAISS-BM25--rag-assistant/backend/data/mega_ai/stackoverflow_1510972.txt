Venn Diagram from a list of sentences

I have a list of many sentences in Excel on each row in a column. I have like 3 or more columns with such sentences. There are some common sentences in these. Is it possible to create a script to create a Venn diagram and get the common ones between all. Example: These are sentences in a column. Similarly there are different columns. Blood lymphocytes from cancer Blood lymphocytes from patients Ovarian tumor_Grade III Peritoneum tumor_Grade IV Hormone resistant PCA Is it possible to write a script in python?
