I would replace packets of contiguous missing values with hourly averages around the missing values. If the values are not missing but are anomalous either manually adjust them or estimate what they should have been via Intervention Detection which is essentially a forward prediction/fitted value for an anomaly. Outliers represent effects/variables that are omitted from your model and if possible need to be identified and accounted for by adding additional/logical predictor series or worst case dummy indicators.
