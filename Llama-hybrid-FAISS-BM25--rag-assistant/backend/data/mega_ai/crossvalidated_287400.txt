Do we need to remove trend in dependent and independent variables in Multiple regression Analysis,

I have time series data and want to perform multiple regression. I have three time series independent variables that i want to include in the regression model. Before doing any analysis do I need to remove the trend from all data sets ( dependent and independent variables)?
