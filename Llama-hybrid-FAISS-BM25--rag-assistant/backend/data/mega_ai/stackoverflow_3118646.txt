Sort the points by some kind of proximity measure such that the average distance between adjacent points is small. Then store the difference between adjacent points. You might do even better if you manage to sort the points so that most differences are positive in both the x and y axes, but I can't say for sure. As an alternative to zlib, a family of compression techniques that works well when the probability distribution is skewed towards small numbers is universal codes . They would have to be tweaked for signed numbers (encode abs(x) ).
