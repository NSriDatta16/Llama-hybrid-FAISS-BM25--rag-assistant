Why can't we build virtualization that runs on several machines?

You're probably familiar with virtualization which takes a single host and is able to "emulate" many instances by sharing the resources among them all. You probably heard about XEN . Is it completely insane to imagine the "opposite" of XEN : a layer that would abstract several hosts in a single running instance ? I believe this would allow building apps which wouldn't need to really care much about a "clustering" layer themselves. I wonder what are the technical limits to this, because I'm pretty sure some people are already working on it somewhere :) The goal is NOT to achieve any kind of failure recovery. I believe this can (and should?) be handled at a higher level. For example, if someone is able to run a MySQL server on a gigantic instance (made of say 50 hosts), then one can easily use MySQL's replication features to replicate the database over a similar virtual instance.
