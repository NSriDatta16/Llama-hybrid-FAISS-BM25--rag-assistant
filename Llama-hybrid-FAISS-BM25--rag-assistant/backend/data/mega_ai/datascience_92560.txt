Notebook for data science

I'm searching for an online Jupiter notebook environment that allows collaborating in real-time. I've found that I've choice from two services Deepnote.com and DataLore by JetBrains. I have little experience with Deepnote and it starts to perform very poorly when you have a lot of cells in your notebook. If anyone has experience with two environments, does the DataLore suffer the same issue? What advantages and disadvantages do DeepNote and DataLore have relative over each other? Are there any other real-time collaboration environments?
