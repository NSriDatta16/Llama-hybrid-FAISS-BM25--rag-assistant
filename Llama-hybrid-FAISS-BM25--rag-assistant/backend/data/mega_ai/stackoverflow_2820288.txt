Make an XCode Project for you framework. In the 'Groups & Files' Panel > See the Blue Project Icon at the very top left? Drag and drop that into the 'Groups & Files' Panel of any other project you like. So, make an app project, and drag in the project icon from your framework project. CMD-i on your app target . Here you set your dependency on the framework and Link against it. A few points Linking multiple apps to one framework can be stressfull. You will either need to install your framework into /Library/Frameworks or equivalent or bundle up into each app. For development purposes, i find setting a custom, common build directory for each of the projects eases things. I set each project to build into /Code/Build/Debug . This means that framework search path for debug build can be $CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR. For your release builds you will still have some work todo with install paths, rpaths, etc. Pain in the Ass! XConfig files are your friends. The Open source google mac toolbox stuff is a good example of how to use them. You will probably need at least a Project_debug.xconfig , Project_release.xconfig , Target_framework.xconfig , Target_application.xconfig .
