Help interpreting "poisson process" calculations from a paper

I'm reviewing a paper. It records the number of deaths in a population of a country due to drug related causes. The authors have calculated 5 year moving averages to better examine trends. They then also calculated a confidence interval they call "Likely range of values around 5-year average". So one such 5 year average is 260 deaths (average of deaths from 1996 to 2000). The "likely range..." around this value is (228, 292) rounded. This appears to be 260 +- 1.96 sqrt(260). Is this a legitimate calculation? Is a moving average of a poisson process with high lambda normally distributed? The paper is found here: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/drug-related-deaths/15/drugs-related-deaths-2015.pdf Calculations are listed on page 43, an explanation is found on page 12.
