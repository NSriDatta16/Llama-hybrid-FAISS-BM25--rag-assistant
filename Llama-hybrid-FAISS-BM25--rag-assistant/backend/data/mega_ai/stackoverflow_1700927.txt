It is totally wrong to think of HTML 5 as the next incarnation of HTML 4, it's not. HTML 5 goes way beyond what HTML 4 is capable of. HTML 5 is designed to be a fully fledged web based application platform. So it's not just about how to display 'things' in a web browser. Web Workers Web Sockets Application Cache Global Storage etc.... It also spell the end of the era were we talked about web 'sites' needing to work without JavaScript. JavaScript is integral to HTML 5 and the future of the web. Of course it's up to you if you ever want to implement any of this stuff but my guess is that in the next few years everyone will be using this. Browser vendors with the exception of Microsoft are implementing these features at a frightening rate. So many HTML 5 API's can already be implemented.
