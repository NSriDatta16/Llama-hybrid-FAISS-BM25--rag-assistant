Read Tom Mitchell's Machine Learning. That is a good book that should get you started in the field of Machine Learning. One thing to be aware of: please note that the same algorithm may sometimes perform better or worse according to the scenario and parameters supplied and random chance. Do not get drawn into optimising parameters for your training data - this is a poor application of machine learning. There are plenty of techniques suitable for particular applications (but not all applications) and there is lots of theory that you can read to understand machine learning better. In order to be good at machine learning you need to make sure to know what you are doing as otherwise you cannot be sure whether your results will generalise well. Good luck.
