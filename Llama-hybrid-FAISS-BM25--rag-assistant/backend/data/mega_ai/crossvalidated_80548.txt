Explaining the beveridge nelson decomposition

Can someone explain how the Beveridge-Nelson Decomposition works? So far all I know is it estimates trend cycles in non stationary time series data. I looked at multiple journal articles and I am still confused on how it works http://research.economics.unsw.edu.au/jmorley/bn.pdf
