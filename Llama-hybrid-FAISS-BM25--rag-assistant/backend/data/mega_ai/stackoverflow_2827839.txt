How to transfer value from a DropDownList to a property of a serialized model object

I'm testing some concepts in ASP.NET MVC multisteps (Style Wizards) with a small application which allow me to records organizations in a database. To make things easier, I've a class OrganizationFormModelView that contains an object of class Organization and a property called ParentOrgList of SelectList type. The only purpose of the selectList property is to be used by a DropDownList. I've also serialize OrganizationFormModelView to get the multisteps Wizard effect. In my first view (or first step), I use a dropdownlist helper to assign a value to one of the the Organization's property called ParentOrganization , which draws data from the ParentOrgList . ... ... The first time the page loads, I'm able to make a choice. And, my choice is reflected in my object Model all along the wizard' steps(see Visual studio in debugging mode). But, when any time I'm redirected back to the first view (first step), I get the following error message: "The ViewData item with the key 'Organization.ParentOrganization' is of type 'System.String' but needs to be of type 'IEnumerable'." Thanks for helping
