There's always lzip . All kidding aside: Where compatibility is a concern, PKZIP ( DEFLATE algorithm) still wins. bzip2 is the best compromise between being enjoying a relatively broad install base and a rather good compression ratio, but requires a separate archiver. 7-Zip ( LZMA algorithm) compresses very well and is available for under the LGPL. Few operating systems ship with built-in support, however. rzip is a variant of bzip2 that in my opinion deserves more attention. It could be particularly interesting for huge log files that need long-term archiving. It also requires a separate archiver.
