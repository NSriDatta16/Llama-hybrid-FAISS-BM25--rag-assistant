You can think of string literals as being part of the code. They aren't dynamically allocated, they have so-called "static storage duration", which means they exist for the duration of the program, and they don't need to be freed (indeed, must not be freed). It is always wrong to delete[] something that wasn't created with new[] , so your second code snippet has undefined behavior.
