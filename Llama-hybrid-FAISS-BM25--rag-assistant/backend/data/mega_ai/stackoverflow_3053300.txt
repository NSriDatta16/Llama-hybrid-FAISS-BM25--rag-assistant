A Hello World example can be found here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists . You don't need a draggable at all, only a sortable . $(function() { $("#sortable1, #sortable2").sortable({ connectWith: '.connectedSortable' }).disableSelection(); }); If you want to disallow the sorting of items within one list, this may be a way to go. It's not the most beautiful UI though (the user is given false hope), and the user is also free to determine the drop position in a foreign list. $(function() { var sender; var recvok = false; $("#sortable1, #sortable2").sortable({ connectWith: '.connectedSortable', start: function() { sender = $(this); recvok = false; }, over: function() { recvok = ($(this).not(sender).length != 0); }, stop: function() { if (!recvok) $(this).sortable('cancel'); } }).disableSelection(); }); This is a really horrible function working around what I feel is an incompleteness in jQuery UI. It saves the sender on sortstart and takes down a flag allowing drop. When another receiver is entered, it checks if it's not the sender and puts the flag up. On sortstop the flag is checked. Warning: this function is ugly to the eye of both the user and the programmer, but it works.
