Use load : $('#tag_cloud').load(' #tag_cloud') (Note the leading space in the load parameter; this specifies an empty string [which evaluates to the current page] as the source, and "#tag_cloud" as the fragment to load) This will actually load #tag_cloud (including its outer html) into #tag_cloud, so you'll essentially get the following structure in your DOM: tag ... To fix this, just unwrap the children: $('#tag_cloud').load(' #tag_cloud', function(){$(this).children().unwrap()}) Oh, by the way... you can try this here on SO! Just paste the following into your Firebug console, and watch the sidebar auto-reload. You'll notice some scripting code poking through; that's jQ's HTML-safety filters disabling the elements for you (which can be annoying at times). $('#sidebar').load(' #sidebar', function(){$(this).children().unwrap()})
