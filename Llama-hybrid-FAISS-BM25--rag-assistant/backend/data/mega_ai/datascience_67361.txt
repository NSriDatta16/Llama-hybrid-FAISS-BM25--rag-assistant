Predicting the next occurrence based on binary

I have no experience in statistics or machine learning. I have a True/False binary array describing occupation of open public spaces +---------------------+ | index | Value | +---------------------+ | 0 | True | | 1 | True | | 2 | False | | 3 | False | | 4 | False | | 5 | True | | 6 | False | | 7 | False | | 8 | True | | ... | ... | +---------------------+ Without getting into dependent variables and domain specific heuristics, is there (or maybe more than one) a simple method to do infer the next False in python? Ideally in pure python or using packages written in pure python. My question is somewhat similar to this one , but I have more of a time series (i think).
