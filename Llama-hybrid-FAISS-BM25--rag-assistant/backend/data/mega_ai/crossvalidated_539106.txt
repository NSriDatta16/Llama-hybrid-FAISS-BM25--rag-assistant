A couple of points to note after reviewing your notebook: Your dataset is structured in 10-minute intervals. Given that the time period is so short, there is going to be a lot of random noise in the data and not enough meaningful patterns, i.e. signal. If the time series were longer, e.g. weekly or monthly data, then the patterns would be more meaningful. As a general rule, the longer the time period, the less noise. Therefore, I'm not sure that SARIMAX is the best choice, since any forecasts would be superficial given the noise in the data. Following on from this point, would it be possible for you to aggregate the data? e.g. sum up or get the average for CPRAVG per day/week/month, depending on the time period you are trying to forecast? e.g. if you are trying to forecast a week out, then working with 10-minute data doesn't make much sense. You might find that the ARIMA model shows a more credible prediction under these circumstances? You may not even need independent variables under this scenario, a basic ARIMA model will do. You have only generated a PACF, but I would recommend generating an ACF and investigating when does the correlation peak after the first dip. This will indicate where a seasonal pattern is likely to be present. Again, this depends on your time period. You are more likely to observe a seasonal pattern across weekly data as opposed to 10-minute intervals.
