It depends on you audience, doing HTML5 and CSS3 heavily is acceptable only when you are sure your users will use only modern browsers. ( never been so lucky yet ) For now, you can consider them only for progressive enhancements. That is, you make a site working fine in IE6, and then you add features like round borders/shadows , the tag or speeding up the site using local storage just as a bonus for the wiser users. I'm starting a big project in few weeks, and all I can do is to make it HTML5 ready using the right doctype, the new tags and the few lines of javascript that will make it compatible with the old browsers, but will not use any cool feature for now.
