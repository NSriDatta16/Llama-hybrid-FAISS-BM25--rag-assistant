Looks like you already have a decent start. If you only have icons, typically icons won't be able to expand much so you will want your left,bottom and right containers to be non-expanding. The center container (most likely a QStackedWidget in your case) will be expanding both horizontally and vertically. You will also need to add spacers at the bottom of left area and right area. The bottom area can also use spacers on both sides. In short Bottom area: sizePolicy: Preferred/Minimum, maximumSize: inf/40 Left area: sizePolicy: Minimum/Preferred, maximumSize: 40/inf Right area: sizePolicy: Minimum/Preferred, maximumSize: 40/inf Center area: sizePolicy: Preferred/Preferred, maximumSize: inf/inf Here is what you can do with drag and drop within QtDesigner Here is what it looks like Here is what it will look like expanded. Notice that although the main area is bigger, the buttons sides remain the same.
