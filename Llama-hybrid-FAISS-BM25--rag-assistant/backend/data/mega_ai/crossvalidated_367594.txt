One main use is forecasting . I have been feeding my family for over a decade now by forecasting how many units of a specific product a supermarket will sell tomorrow, so he can order enough stock, but not too much. There is money in this. Other forecasting use cases are given in publications like the International Journal of Forecasting or Foresight . (Full disclosure: I'm an Associate Editor of Foresight .) Yes, sometimes the prediction-interval s are huge. (I assume you mean PIs, not confidence-interval s. There is a difference. ) This simply means that the process is hard to forecast. Then you need to mitigate. In forecasting supermarket sales, this means you need a lot of safety stock. In forecasting sea level rises, this means you need to build higher levees. I would say that a large prediction interval does provide useful information. And for all forecasting use cases, time-series analyis is useful, though forecasting is a larger topic. You can often improve forecasts by taking the dependencies in your time series into account, so you need to understand them through analysis, which is more specific than just knowing dependencies are there. Plus, people are interested in time series even if they do not forecast. Econometricians like to detect change points in macroeconomic time series. Or assess the impact of an intervention, such as a change in tax laws, on GDP or something else. You may want to skim through your favorite econometrics journal for more inspiration.
