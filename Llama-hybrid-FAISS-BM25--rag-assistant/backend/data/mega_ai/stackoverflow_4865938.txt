I've seen people use the PHP interpreter to combine multiple JS source files before serving them to the client. That way the JS developers can benefit from having multiple files for more organized development but avoid sending multiple JS files (thus multiple HTTP requests) to the client. However, these days there are several build scripts just for JavaScript. Sprockets, for example, allows you to automate building JavaScript files. Before that I considered it best practice to "compile" the JavaScript dependencies before hand. I wrote a simple Python script, for example, that would look for @include comments in JS source and order includes by their order of need. Probably better than wasting server time in exchange for a slight development convenience. EDIT : Just take special care that you dump your variable data into the JavaScript properly. For example, if $foo is a string then you need to make sure that it's surrounded by double quotes. As is that code is going to go looking for a JavaScript variable called bar .
