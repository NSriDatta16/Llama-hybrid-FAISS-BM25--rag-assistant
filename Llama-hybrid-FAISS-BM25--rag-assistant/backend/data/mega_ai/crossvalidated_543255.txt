Significant variables with insignificant levels and vice versa in logistic regression

I hope all of us get well during the pandemic. I have conducted an analysis using binary logistic regression to investigate the interaction between gender (male, female) and official language efficiency (English, French, both English and French) with the outcome: youth's sense of belonging. However, I am unsure of two considerations that needed your comments. First, I found a significant contribution of the interaction between gender and official language efficiency with the outcome (e.g. youth' sense of belonging). Male, speaking English as the reference group. However, the results showed no significant differences among the variable's levels. In such a case, is it fine if we still report it as a significant result? Second, in the same situation, I found nonsignificant contributions to the entire interaction (visible minority status interacting with official language efficiency) with the outcome. However, I found a significant difference among its levels. For example, compared to youth not experiencing visible minority status speaking English (the reference group), youth with visibility status speaking French are more likely to have a strong sense of belonging. In this case, is it appropriate to report it? Interactions Sig.

I would like to add more detail here. My question is that experiencing multiple social locations (e.g., gender, official language, visible minority status, and religious affiliation) impacted the sense of belonging? Here is the excerption from SPSS output as my concern. For coding: male, English, not a visible minority status, not religious affiliation = baseline. So, the first and second interactions were found nonsignificant but significantly different in levels (p= .019 and = .30). For the third one, the entire interaction was significant, but its levels were found nonsignificant different.
