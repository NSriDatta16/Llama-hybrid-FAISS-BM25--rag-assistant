I kind of want to do (redo, actually) math

I want to redo my mathematics, since I honestly feel deprived. I'm a pre-final year Computer Engg (!) student in India. I eventually want to be a mathematically mature (yeah, that's how I wanna phrase it!) PROGRAMMER (in Machine Learning, NLP)! A Genuine request. An example of kind of maturity I expect will be clear by following example: Someone asks me to write a C program to calculate the sum of the squares of the first 100 odd natural numbers. Naturally my answer would go something like: for(i=0,sum=0;i BUT, one of my 'mathematically mature' friend came up with this (yeah this thing was actually asked!) ∑(2n+1)² = ∑ (4n² + 4n + 1)= ...SO ON. Came up with a formula & put 100 for n & he was done in a single C line. I couldn't think of such a thing, until he did. So, I think I've made things a little simpler for you to get my intention of asking this question.
