Using vector of floating points as labels for input data in a CVAE

The Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) (and other classification networks) I have come across use a one hot vector encoding for labeling categorial data sets. In my case, I do not have a categorial data set. I have 2 vectors states and costs which both contain floating point values. states has dim 4 and costs has dim 3. I want to train my CVAE in such a way that at test time I feed the decoder a states vector and it should output an approximate costs vector. In other words my decoder should return: p(costs|states,z) How should I train and organise my CVAE in this case? Should I simply concat both vectors?
