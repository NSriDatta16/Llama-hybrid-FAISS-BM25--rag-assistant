This work's like a charme: Organize the Content of a DIV div {width:80%;} div h4 {float:left;max-width:40%;} div div {float:right;max-width:40%;} This is working? Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Let's look at the CSS: {width:80%;} Dynamic width for the container h4 {float:left;max-width:40%;} Set's the at the left of the screen, and doesn't allow it to grow more that 40% of the container's width div {float:right;max-width:40%;} Set's the nested to be on the right of the screen,and doesn't allow it to grow more that 40% of the container's width This is a simple way to prevent the two nested element's from breaking... The 40% of max-width is just an example, could be 60~40 :) Hope that helps U!
