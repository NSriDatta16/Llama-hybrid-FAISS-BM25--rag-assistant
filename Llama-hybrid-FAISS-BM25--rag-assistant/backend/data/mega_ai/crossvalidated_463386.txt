Take the ratio of each regions estimate for the number of cases. This is now a hypothesis testing is to whether the average of the ratios is statistical different from one. However, it is more likely that ratio data is NOT normally distributed. One usually proceeds in this situation by taking the log of the ratios, and computing a confidence interval and determining if it includes zero (which corresponds to a test of the ratios are different from one). See details here on 'One Sample Test'. One could average the transformed (via log) of the column's data points and consider this a ratio test for two means using a log transform. In this case, see expanded discussion here detailing 'Tests for the Ratio of Two Means'.
