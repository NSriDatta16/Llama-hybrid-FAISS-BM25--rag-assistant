a general measure of data-set imbalance

I am working on thousands of datasets. Many of them are "unbalanced"; either a multi-class list with highly skewed distribution (For example, three categories with the ratio of 3500:300:4 samples) or a continuous number with skewed distribution. I am looking for some metric that can say " How badly unbalanced " the dataset is. Is there such a metric? Eventually, I want to score these datasets according to their balanced metric and provide a different balancing/ machine learning solution for each of them. I prefer a python solution if it exists.
