1) If $u$ has normal distribution i.e. $N(0,σ^2)$ then $Var(Y|X_2)=Var(β_1+β_2X_2)+Var(u)=0+σ^2=σ^2$, since $β_1+β_2X_2$ is not a random variable. 2) In the logistic regression, it is assumed that the errors follows a binomial distribution as mentioned here . It is better to write it as $Var(Y_j|X_j)=m_j.E[Y_j|X_j].(1-E[Y_j|X_j])=m_j\pi(X_j).(1-\pi(X_j))$, since those probabilities depend on $X_j$, as referenced here or in Applied Logistic Regression .
