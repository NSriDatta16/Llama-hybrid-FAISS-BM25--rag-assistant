Why don't you just avoid the evil eval function and use the ' call_user_func_array ' function? From what I understand about your code is that the $final_array parameter is an array of array's. $result = call_user_func_array('array_intersect', $final_array); No need for the eval function here. EDIT: Stupid me. I didn't read your first paragraph properly ;). Please ignore this.
