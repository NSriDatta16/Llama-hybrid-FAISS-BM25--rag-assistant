Lua vs. XML for data storage

Many of us have been indoctrinated in using XML for storing data. It's benefits and drawbacks are generally known, and I surely don't want to discuss them here. However in the project I'm writing in C++, I'm also using Lua. I've been very surprised how well Lua can be used to store and handle data. Yet, this aspect of Lua is less recognized, at least in the game programming world. I'm aware that XML has it's advantages in cases like sending data over the internet, and in places where safety comes into play (using data downloaded from the net for example, or loading user-editable configuration files) and finally in cases where the same data is being read by programs in different languages. However once I learned how nice and easy it is to handle data using Lua (especially having luabind to back you up!), I started to wonder is there any reason to use XML to store game data, if we already use Lua anyway? Blizzard, while using Lua for scripting the UI, still stores the layout in XML. Is the reason something that is only UI related? What are the drawbacks of using Lua as a data storage language?
