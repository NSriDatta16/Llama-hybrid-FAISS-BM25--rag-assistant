To troubleshoot the immediate problem, try logging the output of the ps command: processes=`ps -ef | grep [I]ntel` if [ -n "$processes" ] then echo `date` CURRENTLY RUNNING. "$processes" >> /Library/A_Intel_WATCHDOG/A_Intel_WatchLog.txt ... I suspect there's something else running (maybe even the script itself) matching Intel; this'll tell you in the log. However, I think this is irrelevant, because this script seems to be trying to solve a problem that's better solved elsewhere: launchd is entirely capable of monitoring and restarting the processes it manages (it's one of its significant features). Just add KeepAlive to /Library/LaunchAgents/com.Intel.plist, and launchd will restart the program itself. BTW, if you for some reason did need to manually restart a launchd-managed process, launchctl load is the wrong incantation -- you want launchd start .
