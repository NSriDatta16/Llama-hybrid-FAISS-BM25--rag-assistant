Test for coverage. Make sure that you're hitting all of your branches and all of your loops, exercising all your code and making sure that it works correctly or fails correctly. Depending on how important it is, try to achieve 100% MCDC Coverage (modified condition/decision coverage); for each conditional, determine all the permutations of inputs that factor into the result and make sure you test every permutation.
