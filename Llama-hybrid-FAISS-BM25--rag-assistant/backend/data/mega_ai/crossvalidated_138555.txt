Interpretation of a sinusoidal autocorrelation plot

This plot indicates the autocorrelation for a monthly time series of household gas consumption. This plot clearly shows a seasonality, I was wondering if the repetitive positive and negative autocorrelation also shows a pattern? moreover, what is saying the 6 lags difference between peaks and troughs?
