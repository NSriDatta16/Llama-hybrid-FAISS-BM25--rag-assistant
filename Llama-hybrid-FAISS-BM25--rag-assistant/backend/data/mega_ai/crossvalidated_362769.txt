The important thing to keep in mind about the mathematical proof pertaining to neural networks and the XOR problem is that the proof merely shows that a network exists that can solve the XOR problem, but it does not show that such a network is easy to learn. Tensor playground gives a nice interface into several toy neural networks problems, and an XOR-like problem is one of them. Using 1 hidden layer with 2 neurons shows that this is a pretty terrible approach with relus. But using a 4-2 relu network works really well! Try it out!
