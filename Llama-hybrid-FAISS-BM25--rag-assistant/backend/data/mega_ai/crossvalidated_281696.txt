Almost certainly the low performance of your CNN is due to insufficient data. A quick double-check in Keras using model.count_params() says your network has more than 10 million parameters -- which is not too much by modern standards but is quite a big bunch if you only have 1.5k images. Conventional wisdom in ML says that you should have at least a handful of thousands of images per class if you want to consider deep learning -- although in my experience I'd say it has to be quite a bit more unless you're willing to spend a long while fine tuning your model. If you want to go the neural net way, I would suggest you to make your network smaller and add some strong regularisation, potentially through heavy dropout or L2 regularisation. If you're serious about this you can even consider doing some data augmentation or transfer learning (potentially from MNIST). If you're just hacking around some ML for fun, I would recommend you to look into other classifiers that are more likely to work in your scenario. A couple of examples are Support Vector Machines and Random Forests .
