Drag image from scrollview to view without compromising its location

How can I make sure that the images that are within my scroller will be able to be dragged from the scroller to the imageview? I also would like to implement a 'wiggle'. When a user taps an image within the scroller the images wiggles and follows the touch of the user to the other view. I started with making a subview, however when the image displays itself on the normal view its location changes to be on top of the view instead of on the bottom. How can I make sure that when I touch an image: the image wiggles the images go to another view. the images follow my touch position (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.view]; image1.userInteractionEnabled = YES; [self.view addSubview:image1]; if([touch view] == image1){ image1.center = location; [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:nil]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.14]; [UIView setAnimationRepeatAutoreverses:YES]; [UIView setAnimationRepeatCount:1000000]; image1.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(69); image1.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(-69); [UIView commitAnimations]; image1.center = CGPointMake(30,870); } -(void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *) event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.view]; if([touch view] == image1){ image1.userInteractionEnabled = YES; [self.view addSubview:image1]; image1.center = location; [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:nil]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.14]; [UIView setAnimationRepeatAutoreverses:YES]; [UIView setAnimationRepeatCount:1000000]; image1.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(69); image1.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(-69); [UIView commitAnimations]; }
