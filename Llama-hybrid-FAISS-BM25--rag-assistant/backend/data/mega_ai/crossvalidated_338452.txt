Why do so many people claim that 'Classical Statistics' is 'wrong'?

I keep reading stuff about how Classical Statistics is 'wrong' or 'no longer relevant'. Some of them claim that machine learning will replace Classical Statistics, some of them claim that Bayesian Statistics is how Statistics should be done. Examples: http://www.stats.org.uk/statistical-inference/ http://hps.elte.hu/seminar/2004/May-June/classicalstats.pdf This makes Classical Statistics sounds extremely controversial and shouldn't be trusted at all. I am a beginning student of Statistics and I am concerned about studying the 'wrong' (or very irrelevant/outdated) things. I am reading 'Introduction to the Theory of Statistics' by Mood, Graybill, and Boes, how do I know if this book teaches 'good' statistics? How do I know which textbook teaches 'correct' Statistics?
