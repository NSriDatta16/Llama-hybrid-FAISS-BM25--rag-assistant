First and maybe simple thing that comes to my mind is - you could think of the payments from person $i$ to person $j$ as time series and try to forecast the next month. You could try a simple linear model regressing payment on month, or you could try for example models from the forecast package in R . So for instance you could try an ARIMA model where the previous payments from person $i$ to person $j$ are used as predictors but you could also try dynamic regression / regression with ARIMA errors where (if it makes sense of course) you could include "reverse" payments from person $j$ to person $i$ as additional predictors as well. hth.
