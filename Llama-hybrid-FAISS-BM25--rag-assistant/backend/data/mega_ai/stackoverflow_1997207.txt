Third-Party Storage Solution for a Website Application?

I'm building a website that stores a lot of community-generated multimedia. I originally wanted to store the data in my own SAN, but for scalability purposes I'm looking for a solution to store all the images outside my network and request them by HTTP request connectors. I also want a solution that will let me grow in space easily by clustering or by other way. I guess that there is a term for what I'm looking for, but I'm really not sure what it is. I'm not sure if this question belongs to SO or ServerFault. I'm asking from the perspective of a web developer, but maybe it qualifies best for a networking question. My apologies if I'm wrong. Best to all and wish you a happy new year.
