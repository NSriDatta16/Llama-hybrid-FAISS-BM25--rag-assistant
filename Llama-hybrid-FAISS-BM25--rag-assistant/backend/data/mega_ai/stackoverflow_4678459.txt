Here's a thread on the AWS developer forums with some suggestions: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=183672 Because you're using Auto Scaling, I assume that the NFS and syslog approaches wouldn't be high-availability enough to handle your log load. The consensus from that thread is that S3 is the best bet for guaranteeing storage. If you go that route, processing/searching your logs could become a bit of a chore. One creative option would be to create a MongoDB server/cluster, perhaps exposed via a simple webservice, to aggregate the massive influx of log entries from your n app servers. I've used MongoDB for storage and analysis of some pretty huge metrics/transactions data sets (in the tens to hundreds of millions of records per day), and it has performed admirably.
