Multiplying a Normal random variable by arbitrary random variable

I'm going through "Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction" by Murphy (2021), and currently trying to do Ex. 3.1 (p. 80), which states: Let $X \sim N(0, 1)$ and $Y = WX$ , where $p(W = 1) = p(W =-1) = .5$ . It is clear that X and Y are not independent, since Y is a function of X. a. Show $Y \sim N(0, 1)$ b. Show $Cov[X, Y] = 0$ Thus X and Y are uncorrelated but dependent, even though they are Gaussian. Hint: use the definition of covariance: $Cov[X,Y] = \mathbb{E}[XY]âˆ’\mathbb{E}[X]\mathbb{E}[Y]$ and $\mathbb{E}[XY ] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[XY |W]]$ a) Now, conceptually, I get that $\mathbb{E}[W] = 0$ and that $Y = WX$ should be distributed $N(0, 1)$ . But this is just because $W$ is such a simple distribution, and I would definitely be stuck if it were more complicated. So everything in between is done in my head because "it seems like it should be so", and not because I can derive it. b) I also get that $\mathbb{E}[XY]$ and $\mathbb{E}[X]\mathbb{E}[Y]$ should be 0, therefore $Cov[EX]=0$ , but also only on an abstract basis. Could someone please guide me through this? This is not a homework question or any assignment, just trying to plough through the book by myself. Thanks.
