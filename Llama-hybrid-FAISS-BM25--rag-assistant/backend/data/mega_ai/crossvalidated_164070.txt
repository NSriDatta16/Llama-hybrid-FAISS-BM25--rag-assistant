The only reason I am answering despite all the fine answers above is that no one has called attention to the #1 reason we use parametric tests (at least in particle physics data analysis). Because we know the parametrization of the data. Duh! That's such a big advantage. You're boiling down your hundreds, thousands or millions of data points into the few parameters that you care about and describe your distribution. These tell you the underlying physics (or whatever science gives you your data). Of course, if you don't have any idea of the underlying probability density then you have no choice: use non-parametric tests. Non-parametric tests do have the virtue of lacking any preconceived biases, but can be harder to implement - sometimes much harder.
