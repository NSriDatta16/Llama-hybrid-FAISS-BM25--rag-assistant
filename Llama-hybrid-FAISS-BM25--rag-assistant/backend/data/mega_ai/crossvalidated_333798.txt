How to interpret Hotelling T2 results

I've been presented with report that compares two items, each having over 400 data points. Because it's multivariate, the Hotelling T2 test was used and the result was the Hostelling ellipsoid with an explanation that because most of it overlapped, the two materials were not different. Would I be correct in asking for the p-value? I'm not that familiar with the test but it looks a lot like PCA, so does the same sort of matrix reduction occur?
