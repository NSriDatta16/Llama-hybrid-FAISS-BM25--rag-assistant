I think you could use a formula to dynamically retrieve a manufacturer name. This is not an elegant solution and personally I would prefer using a separate sql view mapped to a new entity (e.g. ProductExtra, etc.) where it would query just necessary columns but anyways. Here we go: Add the ManufacturerName property to the Product class Add a mapping line for that new property to your ProductMap: Table("Product"); Id(x => x.Id, "Id"); Map(x => x.ProductName, "ProductName"); Map(x => x.ManufacturerId, "ManufacturerId"); Map(x => x.ManufacturerName).Formula("(select m.ManufacturerName from Manufacturer m where m.Id = ManufacturerId)"); References(x => x.Manufacturer, "ManufacturerId"); Hope this helps.
