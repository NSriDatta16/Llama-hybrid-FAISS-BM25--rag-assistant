Here's a nice approach (from the main Wikipedia entry on pi ); it converges much faster than the simple formula discussed above, and is quite amenable to a recursive solution if your intent is to pursue recursion as a learning exercise. (Assuming that you're after the learning experience, I'm not giving any actual code.) The underlying formula is the same as above, but this approach averages the partial sums to accelerate the convergence. Define a two parameter function, pie(h, w), such that: pie(0,1) = 4/1 pie(0,2) = 4/1 - 4/3 pie(0,3) = 4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5 pie(0,4) = 4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 ... and so on So your first opportunity to explore recursion is to code that "horizontal" computation as the "width" parameter increases (for "height" of zero). Then add the second dimension with this formula: pie(h, w) = (pie(h-1,w) + pie(h-1,w+1)) / 2 which is used, of course, only for values of h greater than zero. The nice thing about this algorithm is that you can easily mock it up with a spreadsheet to check your code as you explore the results produced by progressively larger parameters. By the time you compute pie(10,10), you'll have an approximate value for pi that's good enough for most engineering purposes.
