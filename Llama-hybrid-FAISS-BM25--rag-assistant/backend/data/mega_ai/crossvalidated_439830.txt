Estimating treatment effect using propensity score matching

Suppose that we are estimating a treatment effect using propensity score matching. We assume selection-on-observable. What is an additional assumption such that ATE (average treatment effect) equals ATE1 (average treatment effect on the treated). I was thinking that the additional assumption would be that the propensity score is neither zero or one. Is that correct?
