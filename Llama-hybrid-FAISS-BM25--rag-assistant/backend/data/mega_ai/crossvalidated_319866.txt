The first delta value outputted by cv.glm is the mean squared error between your dependent variable Sex (dummy coded as 0 and 1 values) and the predicted probability that Sex $=1$, averaged over the validation set. Since your goal is to use the model to make decisions on the field, you may want to change the cost function to the prediction error rate (that is the average number of error you expect to make if you were to classify each observation according to the output of your model), which may be more straightforward to interpret. This can be done by setting the cost argument of the cv.glm function (taken from the examples in the cv.glm manual page): cost 0.5) cv.glm(my.data, model.full, cost, K=114) The second delta value is the same error after applying a correction for the bias that may be introduced if the K partitions are chosen randomly. The adjusted, bias-corrected error $\Delta _{aCV}$ is computed as $${\Delta _{aCV}} = {\Delta _{CV}} + \Delta _n^* - \sum\limits_{k = 1}^K {{p_k}} \Delta _k^*$$ where $\Delta _{CV}$ is the cross-validated error (first delta value), $\Delta _n^*$ is the training error (I used $^*$ to denote that the error is evaluated on the same observations used to fit the model, e.g. the error is measured on the training set ) when the model is fit to all the observations, $\Delta _k^*$ is the training error of the $k$-th partition, and $p_k$ is the proportion of observations included in the $k$-th partition (taken from Davison and Hinkley, 1997, Bootstrap Methods and Their Application ). But if you are doing leave-one-out cross-validation (K is equal to the number of observations in your dataset) then there should be no need to look at the adjusted error. About your second question, the error message seems due to the fact that in at least one of the K splits in the dataset, due to random sampling, there were no "cases", that is observations where Sex $=1$, in the test set. You could try to extend the code by doing a stratified sampling where each of the K splits contains approximately the same proportion of observations where Sex $=1$ and Sex $=0$.
