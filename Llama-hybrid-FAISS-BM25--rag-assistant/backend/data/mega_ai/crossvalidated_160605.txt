How does the convolution work for a simple example 1D and its relation to the true mathematical convolution?

I was trying to pin point precisely mathematically what the convolution does for a simple 1D example (i.e. $x \in \mathbb{R}^D$ as opposed to an image $x \in \mathbb{R}^{D_1 \times D_2}$). The precise mathematical definition of the convolution (as expressed by Y.Bengio's book ) is: $$ s(i) = (I * K)(i) = \sum^{\infty}_{a = - \infty} I[a] K[i - a]$$ So I was trying to apply that equation to a simple example of a convolution of a CNN. So I had the simple example where the kernel (filter/template) was the function as follows: $ k(x) = \begin{cases} \begin{array}{cc} k_{-3} & x = -3 \\ k_{-2} & x = -2 \\ k_{-3} & x = -1 \\ 0 & otherwise \end{array} \end{cases} $ Say that we have a 1D image $ I \in \mathbb{R}^D$. We could just graph its values as the y axis in a graph and the indices as the x-axis. So mathematically, s(1) would be: $$s(1) = \sum^{\infty}_{a = - \infty} I[a] K[1 - a] $$ $$s(1) = I[2]K[-1] + I[3]K[-2] + I[4]K[-3] = I[2]k_{-3} + I[3]k_{-2} + I[4]k_{-1} $$ Which makes sense to me when the kernel and the vector are visualized as function on the real line. However, what I have a hard time interpreting is what $K[i -a]$ means when we are trying to convolve a vector with another vector $I[a]$. Usually, if we imagine them in the real line it makes sense, but $K$ having negative indexes makes no sense to me. Usually $K[i-a]$ means to "reflect" the values around the y-axis and then translate to the right by i units. However, that doesn't quite make sense to me in the discrete case. What particularly confuses me is how the "real" convolution (I described in this simple example) relates to the convolution expressed in the Stanford tutorial with the following gif: Can someone explain that to me? How does the reflection work with discrete indices? Is it just reversing the array? Also, how would that explain what the offset/translation is suppose to mean in this context? What is the deal with negative indices?
