#pragma once vs include guards?

I'm working on a codebase that is known to only run on windows and be compiled under Visual Studio (it integrates tightly with excel so it's not going anywhere). I'm wondering if I should go with the traditional include guards or use #pragma once for our code. I would think letting the compiler deal with #pragma once will yield faster compiles and is less error prone when copying and pasting. It is also slightly less ugly ;) Note: to get the faster compile times we could use Redundant Include Guards but that adds a tight coupling between the included file and the including file. Usually it's ok because the guard should be based on the file name and would only change if you needed to change in the include name anyways.
