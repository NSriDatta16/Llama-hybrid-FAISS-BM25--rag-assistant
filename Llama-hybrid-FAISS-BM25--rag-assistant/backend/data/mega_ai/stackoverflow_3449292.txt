Hibernate: Does a thread block while waiting for the database to insert a batch?

I'm trying to find the optimal batch size for some operations we perform in bulk (persisting collections). If insert is going to block a thread, I think I'm going to want to make the batch size ~ the average size of the collection we are going to persist. If that isn't the case, it might make more sense to find a smaller batch size to use. Thanks in advance!
