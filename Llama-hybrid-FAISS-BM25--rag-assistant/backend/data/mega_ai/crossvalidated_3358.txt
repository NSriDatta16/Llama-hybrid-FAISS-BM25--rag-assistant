Repeated comment from above: i'm not sure that a proper analytical solution to this problem even exists. I've looked at some additional literature, but this problem is elegantly overlooked everywhere. I've also noticed that Yucel & Demirtas (in the article i mentioned, page 798) write: These multiply imputed datasets were used to estimate the model [â€¦] using the R package lme4 leading to 10 sets of (beta, se(beta)), (sigma_b, se(sigma_b)) which were then combined using the MI combining rules defined by Rubin. It seems they used some kind of shortcut to estimate the SE of the variance component (which is, of course, inappropriate, since the CI is asymmetrical) and then applied the classic formula.
