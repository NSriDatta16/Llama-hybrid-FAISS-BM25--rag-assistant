We've always used the MS P&P Enterprise Library Logging Application Block. It's not particulary cool or elegant, but it is pretty flexible and well designed. Main reason I think we use it is that we use a lot of the other components from the EL, and they of course all have dependencies on the logging module. More Info Here.
