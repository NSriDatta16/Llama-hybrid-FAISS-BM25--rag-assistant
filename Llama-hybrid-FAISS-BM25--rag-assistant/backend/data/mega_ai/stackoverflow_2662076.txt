Google GWT cross-browser support: is it BS?

I developed a browser-deployed full-text search app in FlashBuilder which communicates RESTfully with a remote web-server. The software fits into a tiny niche--it is for use with ancient languages not modern ones, and there's no way I'm going to make any money on it but I did spend a lot of time on it. Now that Apple won't allow Flash on the iPad, I'm looking for a 100% javascript solution and was led to consider GWT. It looked promising, but one of the apps being "showcased" as a stellar example of what can be done with GWT has this disclaimer on their website (names {removed} to protect the possibly innocent) : Your current web browser (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/4.1.249.1045 Safari/532.5) is not officially supported by {company and product name were here}. If you experience any problems using this site please install either Microsoft Internet Explorer 6+ or Mozilla Firefox 3.5+ before contacting {product name was here} Support. What gives when GWT apps aren't "officially" supported on Chrome? What grade (A, B, C, D, F) would you give to GWT for cross-browser support? For folks who don't get these kinds of letter grades, A is "excellent" and "F" is failure, and "C" is average. Thanks for your opinions.
