Caret feature selection with customized random forest classifier

I'm following the Caret package tutorial for constructing customized functions for a recursive feature elimination . I can reproduce the provided example which is a random forest regression. However, when I modify the code to deal with classification, I receive an odd error: library(caret) library(mlbench) library(Hmisc) library(randomForest) n 12] The error is: Error in {: task 1 failed - "argument 1 is not a vector" My question is how should one go about defining rfRFE for random forest models with binary response variables?
