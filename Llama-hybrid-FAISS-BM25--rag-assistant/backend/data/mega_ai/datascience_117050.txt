How to interpret differences between 2D and 3D T-SNE visualization of similar words from Word2Vec embedding?

I have created a Word2Vec model based on the transcript of the Office. I am now trying to visualize the embedding space for the top similar words of an input word with t-SNE in 2D and 3D. I additionally color the similarity value of a word to the input word (colored in red). When I plot the t-SNE output the similar words seem to be clustered/laying around near the input word (paper in this case), which makes sense. However, when I use t-SNE again for a 3D plot the similarity is not as well visible anymore. Why are the words that are close in the 2D plot and of high similarity not also very close in the 3D plot? Thanks already for the help!
