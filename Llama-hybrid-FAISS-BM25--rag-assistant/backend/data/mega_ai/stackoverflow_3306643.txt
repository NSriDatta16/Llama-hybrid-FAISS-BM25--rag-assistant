Is Ironpython suitable for value calculation?

I want to allow the users to define a formula based on two variables. Say I have a Quantity and Value and I want to allow the users of my app to write something like Quantity*20+Value*0,005 in a textbox and pass the result back to the C# app. I thought of embedding the IronPython interpreter in my app, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort. Is this the way to go or should I consider another option? Update To clarify, users may also write more complex formulae like: if Value > 10000: return Value*0,05 elif Value > 1000: return Value*0,02 else return 0
