I was tackling the exact same problem in my previous project. In this case, it is a food ordering company, so the data is clickstream and the target variable is ordered/not ordered . So, these are some techniques which were used and have been proven effective: Tree-based models : As tree-based models are non-parametric in nature, they can be used for such problems. The approach can be scaled up to using random forests also. Market Basket Analysis : This takes into account the entire journey of the user till they make the order, and till a time threshold for the ones who didn't. These models are notoriously popular to be not scalable, as they do full data scans every computation, and multiple computations are needed to model these. The faster version is the 'FP-growth' algorithm. Here is a very related post from the DataScience SE site, which has more models and experiences from other users.
