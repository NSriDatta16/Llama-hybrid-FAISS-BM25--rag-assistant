Advise for parsing Apache-logs to display

I was just wondering what would be the better way to show a graph of '# of visitors' per month/week. 1: Write a few functions that go off and parse apaches logs then returns an array and converts it into a graph. 2: cronjobs run at night and insert the log files into a mysql db then when the 'client' requests to see a graph of the visitors per month/week, sends query to mysql and returns and graphs. With #1 I first thought this would be a good idea but then began to think about the toll on the server plus it seems that if a user refreshed the page the whole process would start over when the data would more-or-less be the same(Wasting processor/memory time) With #2, I think this is the better idea or the two but was wondering if anyone else did something similar and if so how did it go. Any advise would be appreciated. Thanks.
