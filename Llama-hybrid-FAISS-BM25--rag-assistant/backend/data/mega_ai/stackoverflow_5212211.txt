Trying to create a dynamic cascading list

So I have this data for a client ( see below ) and I want to create a bulleted list that can have any number of tiers. I also want it to be dynamic in the aspect that items can be listed more than once. The CMS is set up so a TAG will claim its parents. Wherever a TAG claims its parents, its children should replicate beneath. Not sure how to tackle this with XSLT, but a simple example should end up looking something like this.. Missions Kampala, Uganda Lima, Peru If Kampala, Uganda also claimed something else as a parent, it would appear multiple times. If Kampala, Uganda had other TAGS that claimed it as a parent, these children would cascade beneath Kampala, Uganda in each instance. Tags Meetings Bible studies Missions Brazil Ministry Children's ministry Ministry College and Career ministry The Islands of Vanuatu Fanafo Christian Fellowship Ministry High School ministry Missions Holsbybrunn, Sweden Home Israel Ministry Junior High ministry Missions Kampala, Uganda Missions Lima, Peru Meetings Ministry Menâ€™s ministry Ministry Missions The Islands of Vanuatu Natanara Christian Fellowship Missions Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso Missions The Islands of Vanuatu Missions Villahermosa, Mexico Ministry Women's ministry Meetings Worship
