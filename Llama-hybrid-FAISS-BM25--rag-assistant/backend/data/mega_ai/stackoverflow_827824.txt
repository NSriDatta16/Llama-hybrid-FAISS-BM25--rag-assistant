If you are prohibited from using the features of the data access API to allow a query to last more than 30 seconds, then we need to see the SQL. The performance gains to be made by optimizing the use of ADO.NET are slight in comparison to the gains of optimizing the SQL. And you already are using the most efficient method of executing SQL. Other techniques would be mind numbingly slower (although, if you did a quick retrieval of your rows and some really slow client side processing using DataSets, you might be able to get the initial retrieval down to less than 30 seconds, but I doubt it.) If we knew if you were doing inserts, then maybe you should be using bulk insert. But we don't know the content of your sql.
