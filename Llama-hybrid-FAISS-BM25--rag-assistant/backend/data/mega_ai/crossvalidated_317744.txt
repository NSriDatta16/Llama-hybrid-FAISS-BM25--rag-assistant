The issue of manifold fracturing is mentioned in this set of lecture notes by Hinton: University of Toronto Computer Science CSC 2535: 2013 Lecture 11 Non-linear dimensionality reduction Geoffrey Hinton See slides 73-79 https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/csc2535/notes/lec11new.pdf Synopsis of slides 73-79: Unlike PCA, nonlinear autoencoders can potentially fracture a manifold into many different domains, leading to very different codes in the embedding layer for nearby data points in the original space. Hinton offers Stochastic Neighbor Embedding as a regularizer that would make it costly to fracture the manifold: "Its like putting springs between the codes to prevent the codes for similar datapoints from being too far apart."
