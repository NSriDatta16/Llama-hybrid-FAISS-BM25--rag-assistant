The suggestion you found is a great way to reference content. As far as Design View goes, don't sacrifice the elegance of your code just to get Design View. Learn to love Code View. Preview in a browser. In my experience, that workflow really has no major downsides (once you get used to it). (As an aside, I think most of the developers who like ASP.NET MVC do not use "Design View" in Visual Studio. One of the reasons I love MVC is that it allows me to be picky about the markup. Any kind of designer lies outside that kind of thinking.)
