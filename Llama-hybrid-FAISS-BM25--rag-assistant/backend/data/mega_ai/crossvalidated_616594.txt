How can we obtain the noise variable values without knowing the structural equations? The short answer is we cannot obtain them, at least not without further assumptions. The paper on counterfactual explanations gives structural equations for their experiments (section 6), and they do seem to assume additive noise as you suggest. The VACA paper tries to tackle exactly your question empirically. They design their VAE in a way that the latent space should hopefully be something like the latent noise variables and give empirical evidence to support this. It's not theoretical work, instead they test their method on a handful of synthetic datasets. Although their approach seems sophisticated, their results can hardly be seen as conclusive evidence on the question. In summary, I'd say your question is an open one. There may be some suitable assumptions under which we can determine or at least bound the noise variables, and there may be some ways to achieve good empirical results on important real-world datasets. Time will tell, but for now computing counterfactuals given the structure but without the equations is not really a thing as far as I can tell.
