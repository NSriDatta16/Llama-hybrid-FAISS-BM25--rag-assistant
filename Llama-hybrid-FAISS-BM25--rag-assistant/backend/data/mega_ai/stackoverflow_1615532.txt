luvieere is right -- if you want that same "delete" metaphor, you want to keep it at the red button that Apple provides. Why change it? Its globally recognizable as the standard for delete buttons. Although, if you want something like Tweetie, where you completely change the behavior of swiping, you could use something like ABTableViewCell where you just draw in your own view. Make a custom table view, override -touchesBegan:withEvent:, and check for touches. Calculate the delta of the two touches (in touchesMoved:withEvent:) and move your own view around.
