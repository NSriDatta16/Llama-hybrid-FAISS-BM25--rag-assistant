When it comes to correlation, there are several types in the realm of time series analysis. Cross correlation is only one measure - which is referring to the correlation of one signal with another. However, remember that a time series can also be autocorrelated , i.e. a signal for a particular time period can be correlated with the one previous. So, correlation is not necessarily time independent as you have said. When you say one signal is delayed relative to the other, you are referring to the time period for which one signal is expected to follow another. e.g. during a thunderstorm, you will first see light and then hear thunder X seconds later. However, cross-correlation of a signal does not necessarily imply Granger Causality, i.e. that one causes the other, so this would still have to be investigated separately: Cross Correlation Does Not Imply Granger Causation Your question is somewhat broad, but hopefully this clears up some of the main points for you.
