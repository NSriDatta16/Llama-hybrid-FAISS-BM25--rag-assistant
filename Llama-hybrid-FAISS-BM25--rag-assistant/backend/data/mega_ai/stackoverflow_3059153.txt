Organize array in PHP from mysql

Hi i have a social networking website. what i want it to do is pull out my friends status updates. basically what it does is i have a mysql query that pulls out all of my friends and in that while loop there is another mysql query that pulls out the status's from my friends. i want it to be in order of date but since its one while loop in another what it does is pull out all status's from friend 1 then 2 then 3 and not in order by date. i even tried ORDER BY DATE but that just ordered it by date within the friend.. my thought is that i could putt it all in an array and friends is one thing and the values is the stats. then just sort by values would this work and how could i do it. the friend and stats are in two differants tables THANKS SO MUCH CODE: $friendssql = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM friends WHERE sender='$id'"); while($row = mysql_fetch_object($friendssql)) { $friendid = $row-> accepter; $frsql = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM myMembers WHERE id='$friendid'"); while($rowa = mysql_fetch_object($frsql)) { $ufirstname = $rowa-> firstname; $ulastname = $rowa-> lastname; } $blabsql = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM blabbing WHERE mem_id='$friendid' ORDER BY blab_date DESC"); while($rowb = mysql_fetch_object($blabsql)) { $blab = $rowb-> the_blab; $blabd =$rowb-> blab_date; $ucheck_pic = "members/$friendid/image01.jpg"; $udefault_pic = "members/0/image01.jpg"; if (file_exists($ucheck_pic)) { $blabber_pic = " "; // forces picture to be 100px wide and no more } else { $blabber_pic = " "; // forces default picture to be 100px wide and no more }
