I've never seen Rubin, Little, or Schafer explicitly address pooling of standard deviations. I would tend to agree with Jeremy that it's probably ok, though one possible approach that I'm sure one could support would be to estimate variances, average them, and take the square root. You could actually do this using the MIXED procedure with just a fixed intercept. The residual variance is the variance measure of interest, and you would get a pooled value for this. Right. See the equations in the statistical algorithms for multiple imputation pooling for the precise formulas. The MULTIPLE IMPUTATION procedure won't work on data that's already got imputations (if the Imputation_ variable exists, it draws an error). I'm also not sure why you didn't do the full estimation at once, as that would be the typical way to do this.
