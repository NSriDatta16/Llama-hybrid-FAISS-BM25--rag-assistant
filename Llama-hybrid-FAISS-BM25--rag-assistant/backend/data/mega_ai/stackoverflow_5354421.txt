I wrote this batch file after a coworker asked for help with deleting all the files EXCEPT for those of certain types from a folder and all subfolders, while maintaining the directory structure. I would recommend backing up your folder before attempting this. Just open up notepad and paste the following, save it as a .bat instead of a .txt Good luck! ~Carolyn REM Use at your own risk, it does a mass DELETE of everything! SET /p ExcludeFiles=What file type should be kept (NOT deleted)? Type the file name(s) inside parantheses. example: (pdf) or (shp dbf shx) SET /p MapDrive=What drive letter is the folder in? example: c or n SET /p Directory=Drag the folder you would like to modify into this command prompt then press ENTER. %MapDrive%: cd %Directory% attrib +a *.* /s echo %date% for %%i in %ExcludeFiles% do attrib -a *.%%i /s echo %date% del %Directory%\*.* /s /a:a /q echo %date% attrib +a %Directory%\*.* /s echo %date%
