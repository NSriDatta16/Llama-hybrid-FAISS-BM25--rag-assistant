Some thoughts as you have requested. First, you have already performed extensive data examination, which is appropriate to formulate a hypothetical relation for new (or, out-of-sample) data. Next, if this is econometric-based data, for example, explore the underlying error generating process as suggested by those with a fundamental understanding of the field in question (aka, talk to an economist). There is also the point of why a model with essentially a mean focus? For example, here is a source discussing various areas of applications of quantile regression: Quantile Regression Models and Their Applications: A Review . To quote from the abstract: Quantile regression (QR) has received increasing attention in recent years and applied to wide areas such as investment, finance, economics, medicine and engineering. Compared with conventional mean regression, QR can characterize the entire conditional distribution of the outcome variable, may be more robust to outliers and misspecification of error distribution, and provides more comprehensive statistical modeling than traditional mean regression. QR models could not only be used to detect heterogeneous effects of covariates at different quantiles of the outcome, but also offer more robust and complete estimates compared to the mean regression, when the normality assumption violated or outliers and long tails exist. These advantages make QR attractive and are extended to apply for different types of data, including independent data, time-to-event data and longitudinal data. So, perhaps a few different avenues of investigation to further explore.
