How do I check wether a time series is weakly dependent?

If I understood correctly weak dependence is one of the assumptions that has to be met when estimating a linear regression model for time series data by Ordinary Least Squares . There are tests and techniques to check wether the other assumptions, such as stationarity or no perfect multicollinearity, are met. For some reason, I did not come across any concrete method to check wether a time series is weakly dependent or not. Furthermore, none of the scientific papers I have read touches this topic (econometric models for electricity prices/electricity consumption etc.) At most the authors seem to test for things like multicollinearity. I am just an undergrad student writing his bachelor thesis now, so I probably have a rather limited understanding of the topic, but sometimes authors do not even seem to care about certain conditions as specific models are misspecified/do not meet certain assumptions in such an obvious way. Anyhow, to conclude - I would like to test wether a time series is weakly dependent or not and I did not find any statistical method to do this. An intuitive idea of mine was to just look at the a utocorrelation function of the given time series. If the function seems to decline and eventually hits zero, I would assume the time series is weakly dependent. Is this approach correct? Thank you in advance. Stack Exchange has been of great help so far! Glad I have come across this website.
