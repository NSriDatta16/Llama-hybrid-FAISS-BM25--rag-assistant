Stability of cross-validation in Bayesian models

I'm fitting a Bayesian HLM in JAGS using k-fold cross-validation (k=5). I'd like to know whether estimates of parameter $\beta$ are stable across all folds. What's the best way to do this? One idea is to find the differences of the posteriors of $\beta$ and to see if 0 is in the 95% CI of the difference. In other words, is 0 in the 95% interval of $\beta_{k=1}-\beta_{k=2}$ (and then repeat for all pairs of folds). Another idea is to treat the posteriors from each fold as different MCMC chains, and to compute Gelman's $\hat{R}$ (Potential Scale Reduction Factor) across these pseudo-chains. Is one of these preferable, and are there alternatives?
