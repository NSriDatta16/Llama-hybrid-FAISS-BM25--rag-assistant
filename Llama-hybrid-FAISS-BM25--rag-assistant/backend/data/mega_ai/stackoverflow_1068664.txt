If you need to display tabs (tabulator characters), use a PRE element (or any element with the white-space: pre; CSS applied to it). Test pre { white-space: pre; } This is a normal paragraph, blah blah blah. This is preformatted text contained within a PRE element. Oh, and here are some tab characters, each of which are displayed between two arrows: ← → ← → ← → ← → You can also use the HTML entity &#x09; instead of the actual tab character.
