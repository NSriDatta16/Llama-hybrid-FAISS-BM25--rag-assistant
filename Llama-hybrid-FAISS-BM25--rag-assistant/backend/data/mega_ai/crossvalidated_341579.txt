Thanks for the above comment. I have found the answer to this question by the author of the book himself: Bakpropagation refers to the whole process of training an artificial neural network using multiple backpropagation steps, each of which computes gradients and uses them to perform a Gradient Descent step. In contrast, reverse-mode auto diff is simply a technique used to compute gradients efficiently and it happens to be used by backpropagation.
