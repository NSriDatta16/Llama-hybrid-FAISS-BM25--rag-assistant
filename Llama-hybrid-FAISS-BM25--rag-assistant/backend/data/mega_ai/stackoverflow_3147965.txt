Got the answer from the Android dev mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_frm/thread/f7d11237744fe5fa/0e92cb2905632408#0e92cb2905632408 Apps on SD card are stored in an encrypted container for platform security purposes -- so that other applications can not modify or corrupt them. When mounting the SD card, these containers are mounted so that they can be accessed in the same way as apps stored in internal storage. Thanks to Dianne Hackborn/hackbod
