What's the best way to organize this project?

I'm currently trying to find out the best way to organize a project I'm currently working on. It's going to be an SDK that people can use. However, I'm a little bit strugling with organizing the project. I'm having a few namespaces and a few projects. These projects compile into different DLL's. When I compile all I have the following assemblies: Application Application.Entities Application.DataAccess However, in those assemblies are still a few different namespaces, like Application.DataAccess.SourceProviders Application.DataAccess.SourceParser So as you can see I'm not being very consistent with this. I'm not creating a different assembly for every namespace, because I feel it adds no value having 10+ dll's. But I have a few questions about this here so I can make a decision on how I'm going to do it. What are the advantages of using different assemblies for different parts of the application, in stead of using just 1 DLL that contains ALL. Is it a good idea to seperate the DAL from the logic, by using a different project (cq assembly/dll). Do you perhaps have some sources of information about project organisation in VisualStudio or SDK design. Cheers, Timo
