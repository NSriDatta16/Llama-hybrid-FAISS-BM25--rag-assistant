Chief Executive Officer summary The history is much longer and more complicated than many people think it is. Executive summary The history of what Tukey called box plots is tangled up with that of what are now often called dot or strip plots (dozens of other names) and with representations of the empirical quantile function. Box plots in widely current forms are best known through the work of John Wilder Tukey (1970, 1972, 1977). But the idea of showing the median and quartiles as basic summaries -- together often but not always with dots showing all values -- goes back at least to the dispersion diagrams (many variant names) introduced by the geographer Percy Robert Crowe (1933). These were staple fare for geographers and used in many textbooks as well as research papers from the late 1930s on. Bibby (1986, pp.56, 59) gave even earlier references to similar ideas taught by Arthur Lyon Bowley (later Sir Arthur) in his lectures about 1897 and to his recommendation (Bowley, 1910, p.62; 1952, p.73) to use minimum and maximum and 10, 25, 50, 75 and 90% points as a basis for graphical summary. Range bars showing extremes and quartiles are often attributed to Mary Eleanor Spear (1952) but in my reading fewer people cite Kenneth W. Haemer (1948). Haemer's articles on statistical graphics in the American Statistician around 1950 were inventive and have critical bite and remain well worth re-reading. (Many readers will be able to access them through jstor.org.) In contrast Spear's books (Spear 1969 is a rehash) were accessible and sensible but deliberately introductory rather than innovative or scholarly. Variants of box plots in which whiskers extend to selected percentiles are commoner than many people seem to think. Again, equivalent plots were used by geographers from the 1930s on. What is most original in Tukey's version of box plots are first of all criteria for identifying points in the tails to be plotted separately and identified as deserving detailed consideration -- and as often flagging that a variable should be analysed on a transformed scale. His 1.5 IQR rule of thumb emerged only after much experimentation. It has mutated in some hands to a hard rule for deleting data points, which was never Tukey's intent. A punchy, memorable name -- box plot -- did no harm in ensuring much wider impact of these ideas. Dispersion diagram in contrast is rather a dull and dreary term. The fairly long list of references here is, possibly contrary to appearances, not intended to be exhaustive. The aim is just to provide documentation for some precursors and alternatives of the box plot. Specific references may be helpful for detailed queries or if they are in to close to your field. Conversely, learning about practices in other fields can be salutary. The graphical -- not just cartographical -- expertise of geographers has often been underestimated. More details Hybrid dot-box plots were used by Crowe (1933, 1936), Matthews (1936), Hogg (1948), Monkhouse and Wilkinson (1952), Farmer (1956), Gregory (1963), Hammond and McCullagh (1974), Lewis (1975), Matthews (1981), Wilkinson (1992, 2005), Ellison (1993, 2001), Wild and Seber (2000), Quinn and Keough (2002), Young et al. (2006) and Hendry and Nielsen (2007) and many others. See also Miller (1953, 1964). Drawing whiskers to particular percentiles, rather than to data points within so many IQR of the quartiles, was emphasised by Cleveland (1985), but anticipated by Matthews (1936) and Grove (1956) who plotted the interoctile range, meaning between the first and seventh octiles, as well as the range and interquartile range. Dury (1963), Johnson (1975), Harris (1999), Myatt (2007), Myatt and Johnson (2009, 2011) and Davino et al. (2014) showed means as well as minimum, quartiles, median and maximum. Schmid (1954) showed summary graphs with median, quartiles and 5 and 95% points. Bentley (1985, 1988), Davis (2002), Spence (2007, 2014) and Motulsky (2010, 2014, 2018) plotted whiskers to 5 and 95% points. Morgan and Henrion (1990, pp.221, 241), Spence (2001, p.36), and Gotelli and Ellison (2004, 2013, pp.72, 110, 213, 416) plotted whiskers to 10% and 90% points. Harris (1999) showed examples of both 5 and 95% and 10 and 90% points. Altman (1991, pp.34, 63) and Greenacre (2016) plotted whiskers to 2.5% and 97.5% points. Reimann et al. (2008, pp.46-47) plotted whiskers to 5% and 95% and 2% and 98% points. Parzen (1979a, 1979b, 1982) hybridised box and quantile plots as quantile-box plots. See also (e.g.) Shera (1991), Militký and Meloun (1993), Meloun and Militký (1994). Note, however, that the quantile box plot of Keen (2010) is just a box plot with whiskers extending to the extremes. In contrast, the quantile box plots of JMP are evidently box plots with marks at 0.5%, 2.5%, 10%, 90%, 97.5%, 99.5%: see Sall et al. (2014, pp.143-4). Here are some notes on variants of quantile-box plots. (A) The box-percentile plot of Esty and Banfield (2003) plots the same information differently, plotting data as continuous lines and producing a symmetric display in which the vertical axis shows quantiles and the horizontal axis shows not plotting position $p$ , but both min( $p, 1 - p$ ) and its mirror image $-$ min( $p, 1 - p$ ). Minor detail: in their paper plotting positions are misdescribed as "percentiles". See also Martinez et al. (2011, 2017), which perpetuates that confusion. The idea of plotting min( $p, 1 - p$ ) (or its percent equivalent) appears independently in (B) "mountain plots" (Krouwer 1992; Monti 1995; Krouwer and Monti 1995; Goldstein 1996) and in (C) plots of the "flipped empirical distribution function" (Huh 1995). See also Xue and Titterington (2011) for a detailed analysis of folding a distribution function at any quantile. From literature seen by me, it seems that none of these threads -- quantile-box plots or the later variants (A) (B) (C) -- cites each other. !!! as at 3 October 2018 details for some references need to be supplied in the next edit.
