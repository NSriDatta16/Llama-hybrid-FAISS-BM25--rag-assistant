Why don't we update when exploring (making non-greedy moves)?

I was reading Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction and came upon a method for solving tic-tac-toe. During this method, the computer trying to learn usually takes the greedy move (the move it thinks will make it most likely to win). When the computer does not take the greedy move (otherwise known as "exploring"), the authors recommend not having the computer update completely based on the response (it only updates back to that exploration move and no further). But, in this project a student found they got better results when using full updating on each move, regardless if it was greedy or exploratory. The authors leave it as an exercise that I do not know the answer to. Why is it that we don't update fully when exploring? What good does it do?
