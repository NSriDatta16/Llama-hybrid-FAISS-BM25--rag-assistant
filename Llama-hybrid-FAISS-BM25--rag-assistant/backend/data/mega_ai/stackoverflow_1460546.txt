How to validate certification path against url

WARNNING: Total certificate newbie I have a certificate that is used for server authentication and I want to check if that certificate is validate for the url that the server is publish on. for example: if the certificate is for *.myserver.com then any url that its host part ends with myserver.com is valid. What I would like is something like this: bool IsValid(string certificateHash, string url) Is there any sample or api that will give me that? I'm working on Windows and I have to use the Windows API. P.S. I'm not interested in checking the validity of the issuer, time stemps, etc, only the Certification Path (Not sure I'm using the right term here).
