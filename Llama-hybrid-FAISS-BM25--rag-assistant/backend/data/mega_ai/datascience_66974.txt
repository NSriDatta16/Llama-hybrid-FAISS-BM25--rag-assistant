I did something similar a while ago. We wanted to classify several types of pdf. We first extracted the text of the documents. We created NLP features with the text Then added pdf metadata: size of the file, number of pages, name of the document... We then built a classification model with a few samples and did Active Learning I guess that you could also do unsupervised learning but I like it more when you can do supervised learning.
