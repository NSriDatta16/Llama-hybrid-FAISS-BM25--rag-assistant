A couple of ways come to mind: .page { float: right; margin-left: 100px; } or possibly this would work better: .page { float: right; margin-right: -100px; } or maybe, if there is a tag surrounding the actual paragraphs, p { position: relative; } .page { position: absolute; right: -100px; top: 0; } It's hard to be sure what will work best given the document you have, but those are a few ideas to get you started.
