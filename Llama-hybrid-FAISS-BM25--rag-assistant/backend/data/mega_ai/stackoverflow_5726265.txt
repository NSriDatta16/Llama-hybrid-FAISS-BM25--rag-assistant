Media files are different from parts of your system that contain application logic in that serving media files is an I/O intensive task, whereas app logic usually requires some combination of I/O and CPU (the exact balance is very app-dependent). This is why it indeed makes sense to use a dedicated media-serving system that is optimized for disk and network throughput. Some general guidelines if you use your own dedicated server: Invest in lots of RAM and use caching for your most commonly-consumed content. The idea is to save on disk access-time (RAM is roughly 100 times faster in theory). Memcache is the most popular solution nowadays afaik. Invest in fast disk IO, install multiple disks and use RAID (striping) to improve throughput. When selecting a hosting provider for your dedicated / co-lo server(s), focus on bandwidth. If possible, you want to locate the files close to their consumers in order to improve network latencies. So for example media files in Brazilian Portuguese would benefit if stored on a server in South America. A good CDN can solve practically all of the above. In my own experience, it reduced the load on our own servers by ~85%. We use Cotendo and Akamai. Other providers you can look at ottomh: CDNetworks, Limelight, Level3. If you're just starting out then your best bet imo is using S3 to store your files, with CloudFront as your CDN. In my own experience, its a very simple solution to set up, and quite cost-effective when starting out - as costs grow linearly with the amount of data and usage. Beyond a certain threshold though it makes sense to start looking at managing your own dedicated storage racks and use some other CDN.
