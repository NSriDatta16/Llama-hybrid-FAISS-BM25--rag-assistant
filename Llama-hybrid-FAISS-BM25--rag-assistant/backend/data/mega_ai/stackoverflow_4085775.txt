LDAP - FInd the "base" directory

i am currently setting up a PBX System at my work. IÂ´m having trouble figurung out how to connect to the Exchange LDAP Server. To be more specific, how do find out what the LDAP base directory is? I have to enter something like o=foo,... I think I saw a command once to run on the Server running Exchange which would show me the base directory and all the other Organizational Units present on the Exchange server. thx for your help.
