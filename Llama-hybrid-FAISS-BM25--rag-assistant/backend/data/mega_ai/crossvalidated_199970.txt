Understanding specifics of glm() model in R

I have been provided a sample logistic regression as follows: glm(formula = output ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5 + X1:term + term:X5 - 1, family="binomial", data=mydata) There are a few things I'm confused by here: 1) What is going on with the X1:term + term:X5 terms? What do they mean in the context of glm()? 2) There does not seem to be an intercept term in the output under Coefficients . Could this be for any other reason than there simply not being an intercept term? 3) The AIC for the model is 50000. How should I interpret this? Can I interpret this without more models to compare to? If it is not useful, what else should I be looking for instead?
