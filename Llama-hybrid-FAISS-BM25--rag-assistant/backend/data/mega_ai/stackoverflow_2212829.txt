Joe, the solution you are looking for typically rely on: either acquiring on lease (similar to a lock, but with an expiration) on a specific blob using the Blob Storage as a synchronization point between your role instances. or queuing / dequeuing a message from the Queue Storage, which is usually the suggested pattern to delay long running operations such as sending an email. Either ways, you need to go through the Azure Storage to make it work. I suggest to have a look at Lokad.Cloud , as we have designed this open-source framework precisely to handle this sort of situations.
