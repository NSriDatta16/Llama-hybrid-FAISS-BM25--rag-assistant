Bayesian estimators

I have a model $f(x|\theta)$ ($\theta$ is a vector) for which I want to specify a prior $\pi(\theta)$. I only know that $\theta$ is in some interval. There are ways to specify an ignorance prior (Jeffery's, transformation group, reference prior etc.). Not knowing how to choose, I have simulated $f(x|\theta=\theta_0)$ many times and tried to estimate with each prior candidate, so that I have a distribution $D(\hat{\theta_0}|prior)$. Based on these distributions, I could choose the "optimal prior" using some criterion (e.g. MSE). Is it reasonable at all to proceed this way?
