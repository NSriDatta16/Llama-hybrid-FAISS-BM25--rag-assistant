How do I pan the contents of a div when the right mouse button is dragged?

I need a cross browser way of capturing the right mouse click, preventing the default context menu and making it where when the user drags the mouse they can pan the contents of a div. This is largely similar to Google maps in that they will grip the contents and drag to see what they want. No external libraries please. I am already capturing the events, and know that this will prevent default actions: if (evt.preventDefault) { evt.preventDefault(); } else { evt.returnValue = false; } But this doesn't prevent the context menu AFAIK. Edit: I really am unsure about how to prevent the context menu and what the best way to manipulate the scroll bars would be? examples would be great
