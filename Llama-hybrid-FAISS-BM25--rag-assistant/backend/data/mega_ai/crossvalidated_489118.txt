Extract trend of time series with less than two periods

I understand that a time series decomposition won't work if I have a univariate time series (daily frequency) with only one period (e.g., 1-Jan-2019 till 1-Aug-2020). But won't it be possible to extract just the trend for such a series? What are the methods that can help in this regard? and if the function exists within the R paradigm. Thanks
