You do not have to have a conjugate prior and indeed, you should not have a conjugate prior unless it fits your prior knowledge. Many conjugate prior distributions are good approximations of actual knowledge. Some can be problematic, like the inverse Wishart, when used in a way that is not representative of information or as a diffuse prior. Conjugate priors permit fast Bayesian updating, which can be valuable in high dimension problems. Conjugacy only exists for a fraction of likelihood functions. You cannot always use one.
