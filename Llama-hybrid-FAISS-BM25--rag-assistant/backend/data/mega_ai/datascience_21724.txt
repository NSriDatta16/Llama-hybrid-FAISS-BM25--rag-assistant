Normalizing the vectors maps them all down to a unit sphere. That definitely changes their Euclidean distances (not cosine distances though), so, no I don't think that's valid, nor does it help the dimensionality. Clustering in high dimensions is indeed problematic and I agree with @Emre that t-SNE is an option to get more meaningful clusters out for visualization purposes. Simple PCA followed by clustering might be effective too.
