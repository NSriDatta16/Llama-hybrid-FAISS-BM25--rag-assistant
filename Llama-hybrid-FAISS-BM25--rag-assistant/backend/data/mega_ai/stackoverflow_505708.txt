I've created a partial Ant script for the build process. I can tell that it's actually compiling the JavaFX classes and Jaring them up. However, I think I'm missing an Ant task where I create the JNLP object that is needed in the Applet that I'm also missing (but managed to fake). Since I didn't explicitly state it, I did not get this to a working state, so don't expect to get there just by doing what I did ;) This Ant script is as far as I've gotten. I've left out everything but the important parts for brevity... ... ... ... ... ... Also, my "faked" Applet... ... javafx( { archive: "RABfx.jar", width: 440, height: 560, code: "TicTacToe.Main", name: "TicTacToe" } ); ...
