Calculating Integral Using MCMC

Consider the integral $\int_{\Theta}f(\theta|\mathbf{x}) \Pi(\theta)d\theta$ ,where $\theta$ is a univariate parameter and $\Theta$ is the support of $\Pi(\theta)$ . I need to evaluate the value of this integral numerically. I understand that I need to draw random sample from the Prior and aggregate the value of the likelihood function but my prior is not proper so generating from it is not possible. In such cases how can I evaluate this integral?
