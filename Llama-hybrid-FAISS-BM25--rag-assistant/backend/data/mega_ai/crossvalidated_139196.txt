What does it mean for Latent Dirichlet Allocation results to be "good"?

In most paper, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used for clustering, and the value of $K$ is trained manually (e.g. http://astro.temple.edu/~tua95067/grbovic_cikm.pdf ). They claim that this value has a good balance between total and individual coverage. I don't know how to define the "total coverage" and "individual coverage". Is there a good method to train the value of K, not manually?
