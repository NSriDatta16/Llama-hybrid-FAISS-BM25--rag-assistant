Couple of things to check: Does this happen only on that specific user's machine? Can he try it from another machine? - it might be a client configuration problem. Can you capture the actual string that this specific user runs and run it from an ASP page? It might be that user executes the SP in a way that generates either a loop or a massive load of data. Finally, if you're using an intra-organization application, it might be that your particular user's permissions are different than the others. You can compare them at the Active Directory level. Now, I can recommend a commercial software that will definitely solve your issue. It records end-to-end transactions, and analyzes particular failures. But I do not want to advertise in this forum. If you'd like, drop me a note and I'll explain more.
