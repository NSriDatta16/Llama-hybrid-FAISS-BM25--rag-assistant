Looking here , it shows this code to set the user agent string in Firefox: FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile(); profile.addAdditionalPreference("general.useragent.override", "some UA string"); WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(profile); Converting to Ruby, it would look like this: require 'selenium-webdriver' profile = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Profile.new profile['general.useragent.override'] = 'some UA string' driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox, :profile => profile Adding a line to the end of that to navigate to http://whatsmyuseragent.com indicates that it works as expected. However, Selenium 2 comes with drivers for both iPhones and Android applications. I haven't tried them yet, but it looks like they both run either in the simulators or in the real device. Is there a reason that these wouldn't work for you? They might give a better view of how things are really going to look on the device.
