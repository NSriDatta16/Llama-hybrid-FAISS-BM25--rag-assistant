I'm becoming a strong believer in Command/Query Separation (the Greg Young version) so I would say if you want to display data to the user (Query) you should definitely not be using your domain model. Getters are quite often an anti pattern when it comes to a good domain. My currently preferred process is to use screen specific DTOs populated by NHibernate. These work best when driven off a separate table but you can use NHibernates AliasToBeanTransformer to populate from your domain table.
