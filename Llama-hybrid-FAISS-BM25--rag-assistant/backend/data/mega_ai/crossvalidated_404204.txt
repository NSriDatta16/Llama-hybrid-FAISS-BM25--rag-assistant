How can we call likelihood function a joint PDF when the individual terms do not represent Probabilty

My understanding of the Probabilty Density Function is that they evaluate to 0 at a particular point . So if we have some i.i.d points $x_{n}$ from a Normal distribution and we write : \begin{equation} N(x|\mu,\sigma^{2}) = \frac{\exp\left(\frac{-(x-\mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right)}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}} \end{equation} Then $P(x_{n}) = 0$ . Now i am reading this book "Pattern Recogniton and Machine Learning -Bishop ". In the book the author talks of a data set of observations $x=(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$ which are i.i.d .He then says the we can theresfore write the $\textbf{Probability}$ of the data set , given $\mu$ and $\sigma^{2}$ in the form : \begin{equation} p(X|\mu,\sigma^{2}) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} N(x_{n}|\mu,\sigma^{2}) \end{equation} $\textbf{My Question : }$ If i expand the product $\prod$ , the individual terms dont look like a probability to me but indeed the value of the function ( Normal Density function) evaluated at points $x_{i}$ . So how can we say that the expression : \begin{equation} \prod_{n=1}^{N} N(x_{n}|\mu,\sigma^{2}) \end{equation} represents the Probability of the data set/joint P.D.F of $x_{i}, i \in [1,n]$
