What is the easiest way to do inter-process communication (IPC) in C#?

I have two C# applications and I want one of them send two integers to the other one (this doesn't have to be fast since it's invoked only once every few seconds). What's the easiest way to do this? (It doesn't have to be the most elegant one.)
