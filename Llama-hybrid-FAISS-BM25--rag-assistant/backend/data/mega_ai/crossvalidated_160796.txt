Correct Unit Root Testing

I have a few time series of variables with each 40 monthly observations. Now I want to test each variable for Unit Root (non-stationarity). My Question: How to choose the optimal lag length when testing for unit root (lags=x)? Do I just go ahead with the urca package and ur.df(table$variable1, type = c("const"), selectlags = c("AIC"))? I realize that some of the variables then have a really long lag length chosen by AIC or BIC. Is it better to apply VARselect(table$variable1,lag=6,type="const") first and go with the indicators returned here? In this case, lag=6 is chosen as some sources say 4 or 6 lags would be a good value for monthly data of this observation size. Cheers, Chris PS: Found the same question unanswered here: Link
