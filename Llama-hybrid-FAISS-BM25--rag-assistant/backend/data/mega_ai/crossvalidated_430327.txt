Random forest out of bag, what difference does this make to computing the proximity matrix

In the R documentation for random forest here it says, for the parameter oob.prox : oob.prox Should proximity be calculated only on ``out-of-bag'' data? My question is, what does 'out-of-bag' data mean here, and what difference does this parameter make to the computation of the proximity matrix?
