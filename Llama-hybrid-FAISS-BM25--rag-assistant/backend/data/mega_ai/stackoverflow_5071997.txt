PHP/MySql clusters

I am currently planing a web application and I want to plan it to eventually run on a cluster later. The cluster would be made of a php web cluster and a mysql cluster and a standalone storage unit (maybe a cluster of it I really don't know how that works :s) I want to know if the code will be different than when php and mysql are on the same machine and what would be different?
