This isn't actually a deliberate feature of C, but a consequence of two other features: Assignment returns the assigned value This is useful for performing multiple assignments, like a = b = 0 , or loops like while ((n = getchar()) != EOF) . Numbers and pointers have truth values C originally didn't have a bool type until the 1999 standard , so it used int to represent Boolean values. Backwards compatibility requires C and C++ to allow non- bool expressions in if , while , and for . So, if a = b has a value and if is lenient about what values it accepts, then if (a = b) works. But I'd recommend using if ((a = b) != 0) instead to discourage anyone from "fixing" it.
