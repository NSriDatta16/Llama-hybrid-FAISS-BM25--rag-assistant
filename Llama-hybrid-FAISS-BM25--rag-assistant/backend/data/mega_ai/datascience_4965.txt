I would suggest to consider using latent variable modeling (LVM) or similar structural equation modeling (SEM) as an approach to this problem. Using this approach is based on recognizing and analyzing latent variables - constructs ( factors ), measured not directly, but through sets of measured variables ( indicators ). Note that a closely related term latent feature is frequently used within the machine learning domain. It seems to me that latent variables resemble what you call "combinations/subsets/segments of the IVs". By hypothesizing - usually, based on theory or domain knowledge - the latent structure of factors, LVM or SEM are able to automatically confirm or decline those hypotheses. This is done by using a combination of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (see my answer ). While EFA is frequently performed independently (and maybe that's enough for your purposes), doing it along with CFA represents a large part of LVM/SEM methodology, which is usually completed by performing path analysis , which is concerned about relationships between latent variables. The R ecosystem offers a variety of packages for performing LVM/SEM in its entirety or for performing EFA, CFA and path analysis. The most popular ones for EFA are psych , GPArotation and Hmisc . The most popular packages for CFA, path analysis and LVM are sem (the first R package for SEM), lavaan , OpenMx , semPLS , plspm . Various supplementary SEM-focused packages are also available .
