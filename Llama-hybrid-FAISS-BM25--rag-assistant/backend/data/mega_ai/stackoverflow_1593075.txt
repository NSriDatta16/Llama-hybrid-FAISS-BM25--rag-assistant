One of the answers may be to not program with office - if you can use the Office 2007 file formats (and given the existence of the Office Compatability pack there's no fundamental reason why you shouldn't although there may be issues within a specific environment) then you can use .NET code, System.IO.Packaging and the Open XML Format SDK 1.0 - that's .NET 3.0 which is just libraries and therefore useable from VS2005. More pragmatically, don't be so keen (at least in the first instance) to do away with the intermediate steps - something I need to remind myself at regular intervals. If you start with the following: 1) Load the data from the source 2) Process the data from the source 3) Write the result out to the destination Then you'll be able to demonstrate at steps 1 and 2 that you have what you want, and step 3 becomes more manageable in that you're just trying to move known data from app to file. Hmm, that's more "thoughts" than "answer" - but I hope it helps.
