how to "sort" polygons 3d?

I am still working on my "javascript 3d engine" ( link inside stackoverflow ). at First, all my polygons were faces of cubes, so sorting them by average Z was working fine. but now I've "evolved" and I want to draw my polygons (which may contain more than 4 vertices) in the right order, namely, those who are close to the camera will be drawn last. basically, I know how to rotate them and "perspective"-ize them into 2D, but don't know how to draw them in the right order. just to clarify: //my 3d shape = array of polygons //polygon = array of vertices //vertex = point with x,y,z //rotation is around (0,0,0) and my view point is (0,0,something) I guess. can anyone help? p.s: some "catch phrases" I came up with, looking for the solution: z-buffering, ray casting (?!), plane equations, view vector, and so on - guess I need a simple to understand answer so that's why I asked this one. thanks. p.s2: i don't mind too much about overlapping or intersecting polygons... so maybe the painter's algorthm indeed might be good. but: what is it exactly? how do I decide the distance of a polygon?? a polygon has many points.
