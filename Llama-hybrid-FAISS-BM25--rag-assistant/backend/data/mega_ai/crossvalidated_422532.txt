The statistician sounds like a frequentist, and he's correct if we view things in terms of measures of evidence. In particular, at this point we have no direct evidence in regards to the effectiveness of the surgeon's effectiveness. Maybe surprising to most statisticians, the surgeon is taking more of a Bayesian perspective. That is, because of his advanced knowledge of medicine, he is very strongly convinced that his procedures are helping his patients. He's human, so he must realize that he does know exactly how effective his treatments are, but he also is so confident that it's positive that the long-term benefit is better for him to treat every patient than it is to collect controls, who will with very high probability be worse off than if they were treated only to collect data that confirms what he already knows. So while collecting data on controls may be informative, it is dangerous to the controls and not likely to make any differences in future decisions. Therefore, it is quite logical for him to not use controls. Who's correct? Well, the statistician is certainly correct that we don't have any data that demonstrates that the surgeon's methods are effective. But the lack of evidence doesn't mean the surgeon is wrong! Assuming the surgeon is not over-confident , the surgeon is also correct that collecting data on controls is not the ethical thing to do. What it all comes down to is: do you trust the surgeon's confidence?
