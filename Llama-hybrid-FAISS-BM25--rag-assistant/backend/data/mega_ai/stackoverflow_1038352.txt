What's the fastest way to check if a web site is up in Perl or C?

I'm trying to check if a web site is up and running. I'm currently doing this with UserAgent library in Perl with timeout 1. However, it is still too slow for me. I call the script every five minutes from cron. There are lots of links to check and the script takes more than five minutes to complete execution. So, I need a more efficient way to do this. It can even be a solution in C.
