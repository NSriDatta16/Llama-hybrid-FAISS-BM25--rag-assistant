How to leverage concurrency checking with EF 4.0 POCO Self Tracking Entities in a N-Tier scenario?

I'm using VS1010RC with the POCO self tracking T4 templates. In my WCF update service method I am using something similar to the following: using (var context = new MyContext()) { context.MyObjects.ApplyChanges(myObject); context.SaveChanges(); } This works fine until I set ConcurrencyMode=Fixed on the entity and then I get an exception. It appears as if the context does not know about the previous values as the SQL statement is using the changed entities value in the WHERE clause. What is the correct approach when using ConcurrencyMode=Fixed?
