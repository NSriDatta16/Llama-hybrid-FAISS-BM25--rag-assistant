Wireshark has custom filters for chat protocols like yahoo or to filter for all HTTP traffic. I don't know why you would want to filter only IE, its not the most common browser but you could probably filter by user agent. Wireshark can be invoked on the commandline and you can tap into these pre-built filters. You should use python's subprocess module to execute Wireshark.
