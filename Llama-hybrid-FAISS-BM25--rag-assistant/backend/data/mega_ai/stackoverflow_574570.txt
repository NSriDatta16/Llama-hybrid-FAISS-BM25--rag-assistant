Add fields to ActiveRecord model dynamically in Rails 2.2.2?

Say I wanted to allow an administrative user to add a field to an ActiveRecord Model via an interface in the Rails app. I believe the normal ActiveRecord::Migration code would be adequate for modifying the AR Model's table structure (something that would not be wise for many applications - I know). Of course, only certain types of fields could be added...in theory. Obviously, the forms that add (or edit) records to this newly modified ActiveRecord Model would need to be build dynamically at run-time. A common form_for approach won't do. This discussion suggests this can only be accomplished with JavaScript. http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/fc0b55fd4b2438a5 I've used Ruby in the past to query an object for it's available methods. I seem to remember it was insanely slow. I'm too green with Ruby and Rails to know an elegant way to approach this. I hope someone here may. I'm also open to entirely different approaches to this problem that don't involve modifying the database.
