WPF Custom Control Design Patterns. MVVM?

I am creating a custom control in WPF, it is the highly unoriginal example of a stock ticker that I am deriving from the Control type. My question is: Are there any recommnded design patterns for controls themselves (as opposed to the app)? I am using MVVM for the application as a whole but just wandered if it is good or bad practice to use such a design pattern with the control itself. My reasons for thinking of using MVVM for the control is that: It is a relatively complex control, in that it has a graphing ability and Dependency Properties of Midprice, Average etc etc To have a ViewMOdel as part of it would make unit testing it easier (or even possible) Makes the entire coding process easier, especially as I have a bespoke ObservableCollection of point types. Any thought on the matter would be brilliant. I just don't know if this is good practice or not. Many thanks
