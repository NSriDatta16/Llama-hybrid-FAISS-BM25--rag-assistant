In PCA, why do we assume that the covariance matrix is always diagonalizable?

In Principal Component Analysis, what is the justification for the assumption that the covariance matrix is always a diagonalizable matrix? What happens when the covariance matrix is not diagonalizable, i.e. its eigenvectors do not span the complete vector space?
