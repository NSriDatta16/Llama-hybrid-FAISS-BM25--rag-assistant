This is a difficult problem, but I know of two ways you might proceed: 1) Attempt a Bayesian approach. That is, specify a prior for $a$ and $b$ and any other parameters, and determine the posterior distribution of those given the data (you will probably have to use a Monte Carlo technique to do that.) 2) Penalised regression. Attach a penalty to the size of $a$ and $b$ to stop them diverging in the fitting process. You might be able to modify LASSO to suit your needs.
