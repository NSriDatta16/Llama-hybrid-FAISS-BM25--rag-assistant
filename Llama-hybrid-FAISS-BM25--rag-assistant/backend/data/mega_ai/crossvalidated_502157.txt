Propose a model for this time series

I'm analyzing the time series DAX (I call Z ) from the dataset EuStockMarket . Could you please verify if my analysis makes sense? Thank you so much for your help! First, I plot Z . It's from the plot that Z does not have constant mean and thus is not stationary. Then, I plot its ACF This plot suggests strong correlation at even big lags. This means no pattern of moving average term. Then I plot its PACF This pattern indicates an autoregressive term of order 1. I differentiate Z to get diff1Z The plot suggests diff1Z has constant mean of $0$ . Then I plot its ACF and PACF. It seems that diff1Z 's PACF vanishes after $23$ lags and its ACF vanishes after $20$ lags. As such, I propose $\texttt{Z} \sim \operatorname{ARMA}(23, 1, 20)$ . Update: I have taken the log-differences of the data and plot the series as well as its ACF and PACF. T Both ACF and PACF vanish after $11$ lags.
