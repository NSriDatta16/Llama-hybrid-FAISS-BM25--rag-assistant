What is the advantages and disadvantages of using services over components?

From past few months I am working on projects in latest dot net frameworks. I feel that in latest dot net versions "services" are encouraged over components. Is that correct? I have seen in silver light (I am a beginner in silver light) all the DB layer operations are exposed as services. I don't know right now component programs also are available? What is the advantages? What about the performance if all the layers are exposed as services instead of DLLS? Please through some light on this subject that where should I begin to understand this concept correctly? Thanks SC
