Predict peaks within a time series

I'm looking for a different approach to linear regression, but I don't know how to model and implement my data. I would like to predict spikes in CPU consumption in a time series using LSTM or newelm . Something like, but with histograms colored by the peak intensity: However I would like to divide my test data into parts due to using a high frequency in the interval (minutes), something like: trainA = interval 15min trainB = interval 30min trainC = interval 45min trainD = interval 60min A visual example of the original data would be something like: And the tests are performed on these pieces of the data set, something like: trainA ---> trainC trainB ---> trainD trainA ---> trainD trainB ---> trainA and so on... I am a beginner in the world of data and forecasting, I would like suggestions on how to do this, if it is feasible to do so, what would be the best way and some examples of code. A visual example of what the exit would be: Thank you very much in advance.
