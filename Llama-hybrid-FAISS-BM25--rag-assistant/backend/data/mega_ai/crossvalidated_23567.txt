I'm not sure about FPCA, but one thing to remember, is that in extremely high dimensions, there is a lot more "space", and points within the space start to look uniformly distributed (i.e. everything is far from everything else). At this point the covariance matrix will start to look essentially uniform, and will be very highly sensitive to noise. It therefore becomes a bad estimate of the "true" covariance. Perhaps FPCA gets round this somehow, but I'm not sure.
