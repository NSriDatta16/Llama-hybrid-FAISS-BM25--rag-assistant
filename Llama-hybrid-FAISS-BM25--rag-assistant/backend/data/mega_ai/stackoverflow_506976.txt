How do you remember/organise Rails information to prevent wheel reinvention?

I love working with Rails but I keep tripping up against my own inefficiency: I'll spend time implementing some "useful" function only to discover subsequently that it was already in the framework, had I but known it! Particular areas of wheel reinvention for me are helpers and built-in class extensions recently-released features that may not yet have lodged in my brain plugins (a taxonomy of Rails plugins, if such a thing makes sense, would be a boon) migration options less-frequently used rake tasks the options hash on just about everything Obviously (?) we can't all remember all this stuff all the time. There are "cheat sheets", but unless they're up-to-date they can potentially compound the problem by appearing authoritative when they're really targeted at older versions. What do you do to minimize this excise? Can anything be done? I wondered if a set of Big Visible Charts might help, although goodness knows where I'd stick them in an open-plan office.
