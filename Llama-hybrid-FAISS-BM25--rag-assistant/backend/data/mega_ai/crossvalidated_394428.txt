How to interpret/deal with low precision confusion matrix?

I am developing a fraud detection model with unbalanced data set , I used Random Forests Algorithm. The confusion matrix showed that model has good sensitivity(recall) but low precision(Pos Pred Value). my question is How to deal with low precision confusion matrix? do I need to try different Algorithm or try different tuning parameters?
