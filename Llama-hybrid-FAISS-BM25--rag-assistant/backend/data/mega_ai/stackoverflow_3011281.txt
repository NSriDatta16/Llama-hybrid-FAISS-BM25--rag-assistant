Some people would ask "why should I use RIA Services when it breaks MVVM?" :-) I'm not enough of a RIA Services expert to answer your precise questions about IsBusy and retaining the easy edit functionality with MVVM, but keep in mind that both MVVM and RIA Services are sky high on the hype rollercoaster right now, and pretty much any blog or dev site will try to convince you why they're the best things since sliced bread. If you don't see the need for a technology or a pattern, don't use it. That said: In my opinion, what RIA Services is really meant to do is let you slap a DataGrid on a page and let you look into a database with it. That's why pretty much all the samples out there do just that, and most of them don't bother with MVVM because it gets in the way of the slick wizards and drag-and-drop development, which is where RIA really shines. If that's what you're doing, RIA without MVVM probably makes more sense than vice-versa.
