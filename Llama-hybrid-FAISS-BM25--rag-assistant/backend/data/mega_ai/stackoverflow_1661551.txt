Maybe. Your first issue is going to be to find a Java compiler which offers you an AST. Try the Eclipse compiler; here, you'll just have to map all the types to the ones expected by the Groovy AST transformer. Duck typing is going to help but only if the two ASTs contain compatible information (which I doubt). After that, you need to find a way to get the AST from the compiler before the bytecode is generated and then a way to inject the modified AST into the compiler again to get bytecode. All in all, probably not impossible but it will take some work.
