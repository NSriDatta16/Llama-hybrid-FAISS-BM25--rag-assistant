This is what Procmail is for. Set Sendmail up to use procmail as the mail delivery agent (MDA), or set up your .forward to pipe stuff through procmail. (See the man page.) Then you can write your .procmailrc to do all sorts of things along these lines. This filter predates gmail. Still useful if you're running a mail server.
