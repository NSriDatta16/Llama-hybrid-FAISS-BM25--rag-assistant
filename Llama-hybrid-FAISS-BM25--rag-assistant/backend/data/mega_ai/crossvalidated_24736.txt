Is there a reliable recursive formula for a simple moving average (moving mean)?

I've tried some recursive moving average formulae (to reuse a previous output instead of summing the whole n -long set for every i ) I've managed to find but none of them produces the same results as a bare moving mean does. Is there a reliable recursive formula which would produce exactly (or almost exactly) the same output as a bare moving mean?
