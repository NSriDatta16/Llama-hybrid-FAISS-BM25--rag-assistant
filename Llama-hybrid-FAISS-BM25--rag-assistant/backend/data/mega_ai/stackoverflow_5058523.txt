calculating the average download time

Can You help me in understanding the following? Thanks in advance! :) Given T=F/C.----(1) where T is the average download time, F is the file size and C is the average service capacity. The average capacity that the downloading peer expects from the network is (100 +150)/2 = 125kbps. If the Ô¨Åle size F is 1MB, we predict that the average download time is 64 seconds from (1). plzzzzzzzz explain this ....
