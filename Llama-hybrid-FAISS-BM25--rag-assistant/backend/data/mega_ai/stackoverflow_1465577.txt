How to view a file in a new window in TextMate?

I am giving TextMate a try for some quick editing of a few script files. I would like to be able to view two files side by side while working on them instead of having to switch between tabs. I can't figure out how to display a file in a new window. I tried dragging the tab off the window (tear off), looking through the menu options, and a quick Google search, but didn't find anything. I ran across a suggestion for this feature from 2005 which isn't encouraging. I feel like I must be missing something. Is there a way to do this?
