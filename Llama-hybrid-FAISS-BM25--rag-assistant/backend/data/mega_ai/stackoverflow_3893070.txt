I like to have a "Helpers" folder that contains things like this for cross-controller re-used functions. If it's only used in one controller, I like to put the functions at the bottom of the controller and mark them private so that they can't be actions. i don't know if either of these are proper, but they keep they code pretty tidy and organized and keep things together nicely.
