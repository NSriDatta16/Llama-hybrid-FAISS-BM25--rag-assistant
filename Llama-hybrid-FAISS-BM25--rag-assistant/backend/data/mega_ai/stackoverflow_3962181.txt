Lucene.NET highlighter plugin highlighting strangely

I'm trying to add the Lucene.NET Highlighter to my search, however it's doing some really strange highlighting, what am I doing wrong? Here's the highlighting code: // stuff here to get scoreDocs var content = doc.GetField("content").StringValue(); // content = "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been" var highlighter = new Highlighter(new StrongFormatter(), new HtmlEncoder(), new QueryScorer(query.Rewrite(indexSearcher.GetIndexReader()))); highlighter.SetTextFragmenter(new SimpleFragmenter(100)); var tokenStream = analyzer.TokenStream("content", new StringReader(content)); var bestFragment = highlighter.GetBestFragment(tokenStream, content); Searching for "lorem" gives me this bestFragment value: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry . Lorem Ipsum has been As you can see, its highlighted much more than just "Lorem" . Why? How do I make this behave sensibly? I'm using a StandardAnalyzer and my query looks like "content:lorem" Edit: I'm using Lucene.NET 2.9.2
