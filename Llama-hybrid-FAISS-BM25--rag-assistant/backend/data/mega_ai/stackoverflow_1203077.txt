You could also use HttpCachePolicy.AddValidationCallback() . The general idea is that when the page is rendered and inserted into the cache, this callback is inserted along with the page. Upon page retrieval from the cache, the callback is invoked and makes the final determination as to whether the cached page is stale (and should be booted) or valid (and should be served). See the AuthorizeAttribute source for an example. If a page becoming stale is really rare, though, you may be better served by the RemoveOutputCacheItem() method as mentioned in the other response.
