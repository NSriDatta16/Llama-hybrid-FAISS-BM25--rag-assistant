How is k-means implemented in CNN?

I am new to CNN and want to try implementing YOLOv4 with a custom dataset for vehicles. As I understand it, k-means clustering is done to give labels to a set of data. I was going through some papers like Article 1 and I am confused by why they are using k-means clustering when they are using a public dataset that has already been labeled.
