The largest differences I've been noticing in the past year are: Machine learning experts do not spend enough time on fundamentals, and many of them do not understand optimal decision making and proper accuracy scoring rules. They do not understand that predictive methods that make no assumptions require larger sample sizes than those that do. We statisticians spend too little time learning good programming practice and new computational languages. We are too slow to change when it comes to computing and adopting new methods from the statistical literature.
