If you have a custom annotationView (which sounds like you already have) you can try adding this: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self.superview bringSubviewToFront:self]; [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } A side-effect is that each time a marker is touched it also pops to the front of the z-order, which actually is sensible since that's what the user is focusing on.
