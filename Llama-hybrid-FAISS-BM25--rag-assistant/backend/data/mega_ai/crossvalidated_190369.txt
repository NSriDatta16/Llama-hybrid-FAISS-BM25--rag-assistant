Probability distribution of rare condition count

A population of t =310M experiences an environmental change that causes one in s =112M of them to acquire a particular condition c , each one independent of the others. What is the probability p that exactly n members of the population will have the condition? ( Here, M = million, n is any integer >=0, with special attention to very low integers. ) I am attempting to demonstrate what efforts I've taken to try to find an answer on my own, with multiple approaches below. Clearly, at least one is wrong. A right answer, with good explanation about why it's right (especially if it explains why the others are wrong), would be helpful. Thanks!
