One is to use a Cochran Armitage trend test . There is an implementation in R. I suppose you are interested in event vs non-event, so you need to flip your matrix: library(DescTools) m Since you have two groups, and you know the average score in event is higher, you can also test the difference of the scores using a wilcoxon: event_scores = rep(1:3,m[1,]) noevent_scores = rep(1:3,m[2,]) wilcox.test(event_scores,noevent_scores) Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction data: event_scores and noevent_scores W = 618058, p-value
