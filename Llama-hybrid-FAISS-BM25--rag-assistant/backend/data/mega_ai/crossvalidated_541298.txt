Why test.modmed (mediation package - moderated mediation) does not find covariate?

I am trying to do a moderated mediation analysis in R with the mediation package, test.modmed function. In summary, my dataset consists in: Y = cell_size (continuous); X = body_size (continuous); Mediator = organ_size (continuous); Moderator = sex (factor: Female and Male). I've followed the authors paper (link below) to build this model such as: model_fitM model_fitY model_MedMod test.modmed(model_MedMod , covariates.1 = list(Sex = Female), covariates.2 = list(Sex = Male)) This model does not recognize Sex = Male, regardless of being the covariate.1 or covariate.2. The error is "Error in test.modmed.mediate(model_MedMod, covariates.1 = list(Sex = Female), : object 'Male' not found". However, if I run a separate mediation model for each sex, it has no problem with it. Am I doing something fundamentally wrong with this model? Does anybody know why it doesn't find Sex = Male? Thank you! https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2017-02-04/web/packages/mediation/mediation.pdf
