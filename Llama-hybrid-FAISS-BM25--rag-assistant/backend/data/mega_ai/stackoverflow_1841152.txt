Modern browsers ( read: not IE ) have the querySelector method in Element API. You can use that to get and element by id within a DocumentFragment. jQuery uses sizzle.js What it does on DocumentFragments is: deeply loop through all the elements in the fragment checking if an element's attribute( in your case 'id' ) is the one you're looking for. To my knowledge, sizzle.js uses querySelector too, if available, to speed things up. If you're looking for cross browser compatibility, which you probably are, you will need to write your own method, or check for the querySelector method.
