compare neighbourhood value with the mean value across all neighbourhoods in the city

I have a dataset with all neighbourhoods in a city and their poverty rates. I would like to be able to create a vizualization that enables the user to select individual neighbourhoods and find out whether the poverty rate of that neighbourhood is significantly higher or lower than the city average across all neighbourhoods. I am not sure what test to apply to achieve this. Thank you very much!
