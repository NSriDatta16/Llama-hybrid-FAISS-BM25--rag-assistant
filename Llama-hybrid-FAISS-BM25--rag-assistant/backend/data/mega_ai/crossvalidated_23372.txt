@tdc. All and many more issues which you have mentioned here regarding the analysis of neuroscience data including: Dimensionality reduction, Within/between subjects classification, signal-to-noise ratio, etc. etc. are being handle by the EEGLAB toolbox, which were specifically designed for handling those kind of neuroscience data : EEGLAB is an interactive Matlab toolbox for processing continuous and event-related EEG, MEG and other electrophysiological data incorporating independent component analysis (ICA), time/frequency analysis, artifact rejection, event-related statistics, and several useful modes of visualization of the averaged and single-trial data. Thus, with regard to your question "What is the most likely strategy to succeed, without spending endless amounts of researcher time" I would like to encourage you to watch the EEGLAB on line workshop , and to continue from there... Update: for more ML stuff take a look on the (new) BCILAB model
