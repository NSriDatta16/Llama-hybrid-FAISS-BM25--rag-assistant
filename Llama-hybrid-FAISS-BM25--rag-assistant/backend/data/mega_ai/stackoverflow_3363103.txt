The page will refresh if any part of the URL before the fragment (#) changes. So if you go form foo.com#a to foo.com/?bar=baz#a, a page refresh will be triggered. The best way to get around this is just to never change anything before the fragment. Change foo.com/?bar=baz to foo.com/#bar=baz (or some variant) and have your GWT app listen for History changes by calling History.addHistoryListener(...) . Then, when you hear a history change, parse the fragment in the URL and update your app accordingly. Some libraries like gwt-platform provide a wrapper around this functionality and let you describe Place s which will get triggered when the fragment updates to match them. If you end up doing a lot of complicated things with the fragment, it would be a good idea to look into places. But if you're just passing a few parameters around, you can get away with just listening for History changes.
