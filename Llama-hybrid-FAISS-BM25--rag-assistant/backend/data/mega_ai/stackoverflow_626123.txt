Question on using realloc implementation in C++ code

Friends In our C++ , Iam current using realloc method to resize the memory allocated by malloc. realloc() usage is done as below my_Struct *strPtr =(my_struct*)malloc(sizeof(my_Struct)); /* an later */ strPtr = (my_struct*)realloc(strPtr,sizeof(my_Struct)*NBR); now wikipeadia (_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc)says that If instead one did void *p = malloc(orig_size); /* and later... */ p = realloc(p, big_size); then in case it is not possible to obtain big_size bytes of memory, p will have value NULL and we no longer have a pointer to the memory previously allocated for p, creating a memory leak And it also says that the correct way to rectify the above error is void *p = malloc(orig_size); /* and later... */ void *tmp = realloc(p, big_size); if (tmp != NULL) { p = tmp; /* OK, assign new, larger storage to p */ } else { /* handle the problem somehow */ } Can you tell me which is the best way to use realloc() also once I have pointer to a structure and then while using realloc later can i use pointer to a void ??? Many Thanks
