For the record, I recently found the ALGLIB library which, whilst not having much documentation, has some very useful functions such as the linear regression which is one of the things I was after. Sample code (this is old and unverified, just a basic example of how I was using it). I was using the linear regression on time series with 3 entries (called 3min/2min/1min) and then the finishing value (Final). public void Foo(List samples) { int nAttributes = 3; // 3min, 2min, 1min int nSamples = samples.Count; double[,] tsData = new double[nSamples, nAttributes]; double[] resultData = new double[nSamples]; for (int i = 0; i labelsAndWeights = new Dictionary (); labelsAndWeights.Add("1min", weights[0]); labelsAndWeights.Add("2min", weights[1]); labelsAndWeights.Add("3min", weights[2]); }
