Adding numbers with asymmetric uncertainties

I need to add a series of numbers with asymmetric standard deviations, such as $$5_{-2}^{+1} \,+ \,3_{-3}^{+1}.$$ Although I know it's common to add the upper errors ($\sigma_{\scriptsize{+}}$) and the lower errors ($\sigma_{\scriptsize{-}}$) separately in quadrature, I also know that this is not correct. I don't know the underlying probability distribution, but reading this note by Barlow (2004) , it seems that a Gaussian whose width depends on the value of $x$ is acceptable for a range of PDFs, at least in the case where one is interested in the average of the two numbers obtained for the same experiment ("combination of results"). That is, assuming that the variation in standard deviation is linear $$\sigma(x) = \sigma + \sigma'(x-\hat{x}),$$ with $$\sigma = \frac{2\sigma_{\scriptsize{+}}\sigma_{\scriptsize{-}}}{\sigma_{\scriptsize{+}} + \sigma_{\scriptsize{-}}} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \mathrm{and}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \sigma' = \frac{\sigma_{\scriptsize{+}} - \sigma_{\scriptsize{-}}}{\sigma_{\scriptsize{+}} + \sigma_{\scriptsize{-}}},$$ the likelihood of the distribution is given by $$\ln L(\hat{x};x) = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\hat{x}-x}{\sigma(x)}\right)^2.$$ This can also be done taking the variance, rather than the std. dev., as linear. In reality the numbers that I need to add are probably more evenly distributed in log space than in linear space, but I don't know if that makes any difference. In addition to the 68% confidence interval, I'm also interested in the higher C.I. values for the results, i.e. the 95%, 99%, etc., but I don't know if that's possible given that I have only the 68% C.I. for the numbers. I should say that I'm not very good at statistics, so please keep answers at a not-too-high level, if possible.
