Most of programming job interview questions are pointless. Especially those figured out by programmers. It is a common case, at least according to my & my friends experience, where a puffed up programmer, asks you some tricky wtf he spent weeks googling for. The funny thing about that is, you get home and google it within a minute. It's like they often try to beat you up with their sophisticated weapons , instead of checking if you'd be a comprehensive, pragmatic team player to work with. Similar stupidity IMO is when you're being asked for highly accessible fundamentals, like: "Oh wait, let me see if you can pseudo-code that insert_name_here -algorithm on a sheet of paper (sic!)". Do I really need to remember it while applying for a high-level programming job? Should I efficiently solve problems or puzzles?
