Which stocks fell first after some event?

I have a panel of daily stock prices $\{Y_{it}\}$, $t \in \{1,...,1000\}$ and some event that occurs at $t=700$ which causes the average stock price to decrease by about 10% over the next 15 days. How do I answer the question "which stocks fell first"? I want to know of the characteristics of stocks that tended to be correlated with very early falls (like, first 1 or 2 days). I have many ideas for sub-sample analysis but none that I want to use involving econometrics. Broad econometric-based ideas welcome. Can survival analysis be used here? Note; I did make an earlier post on this issue that was answered, but I constrained the question way too much and didn't get what I wanted. EDIT: Please don't absolutely answer the question (up to model specification). I just want ideas/suggestions of areas that might be good and a very general approach/suggestion. Then I want to develop it all myself from there.
