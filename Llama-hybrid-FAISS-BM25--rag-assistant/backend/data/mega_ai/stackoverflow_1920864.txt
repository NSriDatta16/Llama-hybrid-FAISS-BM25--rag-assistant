When does a dictionary throw an IndexOutOfRangeException on Add or ContainsKey?

On a busy ASP .NET website, I have a Dictionary, which acts as a cache, basically storing key/value pairs for later retrieval. On high load, the Dictionary some times get into a state, where it always throws an IndexOutOfRangeException whenever i call the ContainsKey or Add method. The exception happens inside the private FindEntry method. I am suspecting that this might be due to a synchronization issue, but I am not sure. Can anyone tell me under which circumstances this can happen ? My goal is to gather enough information so that I can reproduce the issue in the dev environment.
