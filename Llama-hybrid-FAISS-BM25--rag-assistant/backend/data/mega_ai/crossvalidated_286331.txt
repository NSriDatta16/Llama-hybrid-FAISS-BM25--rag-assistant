Here's my attempt. Let's assume that the number of invitees (excluding you) to the party, $N$, is Poisson distributed with parameter $\lambda$: $$N\sim \text{POI}(\lambda)$$ Let's further assume that all those invited actually attend the party. Moreover, let the arrival time of you and all other party attendees be uniformly distributed: $$T_{i}\sim U(0,1)$$ where $i=1,2,\ldots,(N+1)$. Given that all the arrival times are independent and identically distributed, each attendee must equally share the probability of being the $i$th to arrive. Therefore, the probability of being the $i$th attendee, given $N$, is: $$\text{Pr}(X=i\,|\,N=n)=\frac{1}{n+1}$$ where $i=1,2,\ldots,(n+1)$. Now, this is the conditional distribution. From here we can calculate the joint distribution: $$\begin{align} \text{Pr}(X=i,\,N=n)&=\text{Pr}(X=i\,|\,N=n)\cdot\text{Pr}(N=n)\notag\\ &=\bigg(\frac{1}{1+n}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{\lambda^{n}e^{-\lambda}}{n!}\bigg) \end{align}$$ To arrive at the marginal distribution for $X$ we need to sum across all values for $N$: $$\begin{align} \text{Pr}(X=i)&=\sum_{n=i}^{\infty}\text{Pr}(X=i,\,\,N=n)\notag\\ &=\sum_{n=i}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{1}{1+n}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{\lambda^{n}e^{-\lambda}}{n!}\bigg) \end{align}$$ Note that the lower bound of the summation is that way because in order for you to have an $i$th placing, $n$ has to be larger than or equal to $i$. This is the answer to your second question . Finally, we can calculate the expected value of your arrival rank relative to the other attendees: $$\begin{align} E[X]&=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=i}^{\infty}\text{Pr}(X=i,\,\,N=n)\cdot i\notag\\ &=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=i}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{1}{1+n}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{\lambda^{n}e^{-\lambda}}{n!}\bigg)\cdot i \end{align}$$ Now the above expression may not seem very tractable. But due to the independent and identical distribution of the arrival times we can state the expected number of arrivals after you is the same as the expected number of arrivals before you. Therefore, by symmetry, the expected value of your rank relative to the other attendees can be reasoned as follows: If $\lambda=0$, then you would expect on average to be the first attendee i.e. $E[X]=1$. If $\lambda=1$, then you would expect on average be the first attendee half the time and the second attendee the other half i.e. $E[X]=1.5$. If $\lambda=2$, then you would expect on average be the first attendee a third of the time and the second attendee a third of the time and the third attendee a third of the time i.e. $E[X]=2$. And so on...Thus you arrive at: $$\begin{align} E[X]&=\frac{\lambda}{2}+1 \end{align}$$ Interestingly, you verify this expression by evaluating the previously derived expression: $$\begin{align} E[X]&=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=i}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{1}{1+n}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{\lambda^{n}e^{-\lambda}}{n!}\bigg)\cdot i\\ &=\frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=i}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\lambda^{n+1}e^{-\lambda}}{(n+1)!}\bigg)\cdot i\\ &=\frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{i=0}^{n}\bigg(\frac{\lambda^{n+1}e^{-\lambda}}{(n+1)!}\bigg)\cdot i\\ &=\frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\bigg(\frac{\lambda^{n+1}e^{-\lambda}}{(n+1)!}\bigg)\\ &=\frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{n^{2}+n}{2}\bigg(\frac{\lambda^{n+1}e^{-\lambda}}{(n+1)!}\bigg) \end{align}$$ Now, we use a change of variables: $$M=N+1$$ and $$m=n+1$$ Leading to: $$\begin{align} E[X]&=\frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{(m-1)^{2}+(m-1)}{2}\bigg(\frac{\lambda^{m}e^{-\lambda}}{m!}\bigg)\\ &=\frac{1}{2\lambda}\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\big(m^2-m\big)\bigg(\frac{\lambda^{m}e^{-\lambda}}{m!}\bigg)\\ &=\frac{1}{2\lambda}\Big(E[M^2]-E[M]\Big)\\ &=\frac{1}{2\lambda}\Big(\text{Var}(M)+E[M]^{2}-E[M]\Big)\\ &=\frac{1}{2\lambda}\big(\lambda^{2}+2\lambda\big)\\ &=\frac{\lambda}{2}+1 \end{align}$$ Note, the answer to your first question regarding the expected number of people who arrive before you is simply: $$E[X]-1=\frac{\lambda}{2}$$ Therefore with $\lambda=10$, you expect $$\frac{\lambda}{2}=5$$ people to arrive before you. Furthermore, the probability of being the $i$th person to arrive can be shown graphically as (shown below for various $\lambda$):
