I doubt that even simple transformation rules are possible to be generated automatically. For example take the XML Paul Maria Paul and the target Paul which should be a quite common combination. I could not even manually decide (without help from the one wanting the transformation) from which tag the target > has been created, from > or > so I doubt that an application would produce something sane here. Update: If some sort of drag&drop-XSLT-generation would be ok for you, there are some commercial products available, but they cannot produce XSLT from a target file. But drag&drop should be at least a better solution than writing it completely by hand: WYSIWYG XSLT Designer Tiger XSLT Mapper (not officially available anymore)
