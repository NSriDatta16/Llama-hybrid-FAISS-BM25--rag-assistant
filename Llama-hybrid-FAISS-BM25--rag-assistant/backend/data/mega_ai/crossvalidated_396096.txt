What is the formula for calculation of `R_ij` in `numpy.corrcoef(x, y, rowvar = False)`?

The manual does not provide the formula if we pass x and y . I do not understand the matrix I get. Here is my code: import numpy as np from sklearn import datasets from sklearn.decomposition import PCA iris = datasets.load_iris() data = iris.data centered_data = data - np.mean(data, axis = 0) model = PCA() transformed_data = model.fit_transform(centered_data) centered_transformed_data = transformed_data - np.mean(transformed_data, axis = 0) corr = np.corrcoef(centered_data, centered_transformed_data, rowvar = False) print(corr.round(2)) centered_data.shape = (150, 4), transformed_data.shape = (150, 4) corr.shape = (8, 8) Please explain what an element of the correlation matrix means. I would like clarify what I am doing. I need to find a correlation matrix between the initial sample of the data and the transformed sample of data. Then, I need to find for each feature the principal component that has the highest correlation with.
