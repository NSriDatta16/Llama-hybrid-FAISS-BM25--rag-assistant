How report an average confidence interval when width varies along a gradient?

I used Ben Bolker's easyPredCI function to generate standard errors and confidence intervals from a GLMM (this function creates population-level predictions by ignoring the random effect). When I plot the predicted responses (abundance) and confidence intervals along a gradient of one of my explanatory variables (proportion cover of grasses, 0 to 1) while holding others constant, it looks like this: I want to interpret these results in a simple manner by reporting something like: "for every 10% increase in grass cover, abundance decreases by X%." That part is easy enough, but I'd like to include a confidence interval in that statement, and I'm not sure how to do that considering that the width varies along the gradient. I could use the mean of the width along the entire gradient, but I'm guessing there might be a better way. Any suggestions? I can simplify some code, if needed, but it seems like this question is general enough that it wouldn't be needed. Thanks!
