Forecasting sales using Neural Network with just 6 data points?

I have 6 data points which represent 6 months of sales of a new product. Can I use machine learning methods, like a neural network, to forecast the sales of this product over the next year? Specifically, I want to forecast the cumulative sales volume a year into the future (or at month 18), and project what the sales trend would look like from month 7 to month 18. If possible, I'd like forecast this trend in R.
