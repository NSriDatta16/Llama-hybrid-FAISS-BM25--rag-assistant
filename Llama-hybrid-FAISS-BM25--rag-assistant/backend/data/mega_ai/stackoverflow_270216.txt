This issue ended up being due to not usind sudo to install rails. I ended up blowing away ruby completely and reinstalling it. I also paid closer attention to the output of the various gems i needed to install to make sure they downloaded and ran. I was surprised to see that many of them would fail to download and had to be run a second, or even third time before they would install. regarding Orion's suggestion, I had checked the RAILS_GEM_VERSION and it was 2.1.1 or greater. That's what was causing the most confusion with this issue since it was saying what version was needed, and then gem -v would show me the right version.
