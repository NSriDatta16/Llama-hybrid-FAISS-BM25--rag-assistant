Your JSONP format is not correct. The file contains JSON data, not JSONP data. The error message you get is because the browser is trying to run the object as code. You need to put a function call around the JSON data: callback({ "message": "This is coming from staging." }); As the text file can't use the query string with the function name that is sent to it, you have to specify the function name using the jsonpCallback property instead: $.ajax({ type: "GET", dataType: 'jsonp', jsonpCallback: 'callback', url: "http://www.topshop.com/aboutus/show.txt", success: returnedMessage });
