Granted you've given your gridview a css class called 'myGridView' you could do the following: $(document).ready(function () { $('.myGridView tr').each(function () { var number = $(this).children('td:eq(1)').text(); if (number == '1') { $(this).children('td').css('background', 'red'); } }) }); where 'td:eq(1)' refers to the second cell in a row. This of course will depend on what cell in your row contains this magic number. I'm certain it's not the most elegant use of jQuery, but you could refactor it as you wish
