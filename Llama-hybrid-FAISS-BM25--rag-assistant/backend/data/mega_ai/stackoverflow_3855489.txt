Can't optimize innoDB table

As my first message here, i don't know if i have to answer or post a new message. I have the same problem as here and the one and only given answer doesn't help me (except if the documentation is incorrect). "You can make OPTIMIZE TABLE work on other storage engines", but my engine is InnoDB. I thank you for your help. S.
