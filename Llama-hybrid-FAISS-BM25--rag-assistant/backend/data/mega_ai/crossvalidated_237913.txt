Time series clustering: diss.AR.MAH, p-value interpretation problem

I'm trying to learn to use tsclust package, namely diss.AR.MAH . However, I'm having an annoying problem. diss.AR.MAH is supposed to test two series, say X and Y, if they come from the same ARMA model. It gives two outputs: statistic and p-value . My problem is that, when I generate two vectors from the same ARIMA models, P-value is large, say, 0.93. However, when I generate a vector from normal distribution, when I test for p-values, p-value is again large, with 0.47. What am I missing, I guess, when comparing against normal random variates, I shoul have had a low p-value. I m clearly missing something but I don'n know what. Here is my sample code: x with output: $statistic [,1] [1,] 0.1429621 $p_value [,1] [1,] 0.9310139 and when I do it for, x with the ouutput: $statistic [,1] [1,] 0.4993418 $p_value [,1] [1,] 0.479789
