Is there a book on applied linear algebra

I am trying to work through a book on linear algebra by Serge Lang. I see a whole bunch of rules, formulae, theorems but I don't understand how each of these things are applied in a real world context. I am studying linear algebra only because I wish to learn machine learning topics. Is there a book that deals with something akin to 'Applied linear algebra' ? For example , that will explain why exactly we need complicated techniques to decompose and factorize a matrix?
