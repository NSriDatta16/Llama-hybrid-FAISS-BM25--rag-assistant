There are a few things that you could want to do. The following discusses some plausible scenarios. Comment on Log transforming z-scores In order to log transform z-scores, you would need to add a constant to the z-score, in order to ensure that the values of the z-score are all greater than zero. See my answer to this question on log transforming z-scores . It is unlikely that this is what you want to do. Creating overall rating averaged across conditions log transform all ratings compute z-score for each condition, but use the mean and standard deviation of all groups combined but each condition separately. get the mean of each condition z-score. This would provide one way of looking at differences between groups where in some sense each condition is weighted equally in the composite. z-scores to aid interpretation of group * condition effects Alternatively, if you wanted to look at effect of condition, then I imagine the z-score would be purely a tool to make the metric of the dependent variable a little more interpretable. In that case the procedure might look like: log transform all ratings Compute z-score for all ratings using means and standard deviations of all groups combined and for all conditions combined.
