How to find a trusted average for a given population?

I am working on the following table: Weight (W) Rating Weighted Score (WS) 0.10 3 0,30 0.11 4 0,44 0.10 3 0,30 0.12 3 0,36 0.07 2 0,14 0.11 2 0,22 0.08 1 0,08 0.12 1 0,12 0.10 2 0,20 0.09 2 0,18 1.00 - 2,34 The WS is calculated by multiplying Rating with W. In the last line, the total sum of W's is 1.00 , while for WS is 2,34 . What I am willing to know, is how can I evaluate if 2,34 is good or bad, in other words if it is above or below average? I was told that an average value for WS would be 2.5 but not why. Is there any other statistic measure, such as Standard Deviation, Standard Error, Confidence Intervals, that can help me make sense of the data, or to determine which average should I trust?
