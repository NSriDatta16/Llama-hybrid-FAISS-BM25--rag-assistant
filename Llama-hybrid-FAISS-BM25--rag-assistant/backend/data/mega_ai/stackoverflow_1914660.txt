I'm not sure what you're really planning to do here but it seems you are trying to append the content of the "ITEM" classes inside your droppable class. I said that because that is what your code is actually doing right now. If that is that case, you should put a "float:left" property on your "item" class. This will neatly stack them horizontally side by side starting on the left (You may also want to put a little right margin with each item to prevent their edges from touching each other). If the size for new item is less than the available horizontal space it will wrap down to the left edge of your droppable. If you want the "clone" of your items to "stay in place" where you dropped them, you can use the "ui.position" property to save their position relative to the droppable. If you want the actual draggables to "stick" to your droppable, remove these lines: var dropElemId = ui.draggable.attr("id"); var dropElem = ui.draggable.html(); $(this).append(dropElem); And it's done! You may also want to remove the draggable property of the item to "fix" the item inside your shirt. Hope that helps! ;-)
