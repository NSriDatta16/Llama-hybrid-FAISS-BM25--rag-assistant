I normally prefer vb.net, but C#'s iterator blocks are slowly winning me over: public static IEnumerable SkimFile(string FileName) { long delta = new FileInfo(FileName).Length / 100; long position = 0; using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(FileName)) { while (position Put it in a class library project and use it from vb like this: Dim isMatch as Boolean = False For Each s As String in SkimFile("FileName.txt") If (RequestedDate - CDate(s.SubString(3,11))).Minutes > 2 Then isMatch = True Exit For End If Next s (I took some liberties with you criteria (assumed fixed-width values rather than delimited) to make the example easier)
