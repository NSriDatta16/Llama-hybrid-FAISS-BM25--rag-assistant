I agree with St3fan that an normal TextField should never cause an action by tapping. I will assume for the moment that you have a special UITextField that can be made uneditable and then looks like a UILabel , formatted to look like a hyperlink. Such a UI could be correct. Tapping a text field that looks like it's editable but actually makes a phone call would of course be incorrect. You could implement the UITextFieldDelegate protocol and watch for textFieldShouldBeginEditing: . Since this text field is not editable, obviously you should return NO. You could add a "call" button inside of the text field using its overlay views ( leftView or rightView ; read the docs on the correct UE for these). You could subclass UITextField to override touchesBegan:withEvent , touchesEnded:withEvent: and touchesCancelled:withEvent: to handle the touch yourself. Remember: you must receive a touchesBegan and touchesEnded without a touchesCancelled between them in order to consider it a touch. Never fire an action based only on touchesBegan .
