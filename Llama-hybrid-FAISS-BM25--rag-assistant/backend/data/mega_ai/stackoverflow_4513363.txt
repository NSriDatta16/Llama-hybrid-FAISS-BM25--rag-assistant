Pagination improvements in ASP.NET 2.0 Grids

I currently have a datagrid bound to a table with tens of thousands of records. I display the datagrid using the existing asp.net 2.0. I show ten records at a time. My problem is whenever I try to access the next page, I gets all the records again from the database and then displays the ones that are required. This is slowing down the app. Is there feature within .net 2.0 which will help me optimize this issue? I cant use third party controls or ajax. UPDATE I cant use SQL to get 10 records at a time as well. Without changing any existing business logic or data retrieval, I want to do this.
