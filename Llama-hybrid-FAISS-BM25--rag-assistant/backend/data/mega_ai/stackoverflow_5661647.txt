How to handle my JSON data in jQuery Ajax success callback?

If I have a ajax call: $.ajax({ url: url, dataType: 'json', data: data, success: function(json_data){ //What's the efficient way to extract the JSON data and get the value } }); Server returned to my js the following JSON data {"contact":[{"address":[{"city":"Shanghai","street":"Long Hua Street"},{"city":"Shanghai","street":"Dong Quan Street"}],"id":"huangyim","name":"Huang Yi Ming"}]} In my jQuery AJAX success callback function, how to extract the value of " name ", value of " address " (which is a list of object ) elegantly? I am not experienced with jQuery and JSON data handling in javascript. So, I would like to ask some suggestions on how to handle this data efficiently. Thanks.
