How to loop through all items in the Magento cart?

Okay, I have no idea how to do this simple thing. All I need is to loop through the 3 items that I have currently in the cart, so I can get item information about each one - like product category, item name, blah blah blah. I have googled this for an hour already, and have not found anything on what seems to be such a simple task. Getting quote, and then getAllItems() returns nothing for me. Anybody have any ideas / links? Thanks.
