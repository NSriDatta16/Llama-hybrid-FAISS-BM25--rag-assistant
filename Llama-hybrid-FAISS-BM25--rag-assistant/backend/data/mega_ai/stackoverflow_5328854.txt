For retrieving remote pages, the time depends mostly on the connection speed, latency and the remote server. There is not much you can do about these things, and using an alternative HTTP retrieval method will help only inmeasurably. If however the remote page is quite large then it makes sense to fetch it only partially. Instead of file_get_contents to download the complete page, try: $page = fread(fopen($url, "r"), 2048); // first 2KB For extraction use this rather than your substr method: preg_match('# (.*?) #', $page, $match); $meta["title"] = $match[1];
