Representing experimental data by unconstrained ordination: PCA, PCoA, or NMDS?

I have a dataset composed by presence of different bacterial families in function at different pesticide treatment. I need to find a good representation of my data but I don't know which method ( Principal Component analysis or Principal Coordinate analysis or Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling ) is better for species' abundance data.
