Determine the number of trials and variations of an MDP for analysis

Given a simple grid world problem, if asked to compare and analyze several algorithms, it makes sense to run multiple trials due to stochasticity. Does it also make sense to vary the state of the MDP in question, or does that make it a different MDP? This is a question about definitions. If I change the size of the grid in a grid world, the location of terminal states, or any other environment attribute, is it still the same MDP? And is there any reason to expect a solution to an MDP to generalize to another configuration of the same problem? In other words, will the Q-learner, for example, generalize to solving a finite grid world different from the one it solved? Do a typical separation of training and testing phases make sense when evaluating MDPs? Is the only variation the stochasticity in state transitions?
