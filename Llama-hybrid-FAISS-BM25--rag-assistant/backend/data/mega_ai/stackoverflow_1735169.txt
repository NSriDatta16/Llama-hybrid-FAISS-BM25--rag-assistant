Not really programming, but I can't stand css only layouts just for the sake of it. It's counter productive, frustrating, and makes maintenance a nightmare of floats and margins where changing the position of a single element can throw the entire page out of whack. It's definitely not a popular opinion, but i'm done with my table layout in 20 minutes while the css gurus spend hours tweaking line-height, margins, padding and floats just to do something as basic as vertically centering a paragraph.
