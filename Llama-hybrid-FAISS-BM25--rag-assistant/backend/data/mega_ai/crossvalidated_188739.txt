This is a Beta negative binomial distribution , with parameter $r=1$ in your case, using the Wikipedia notation. It also named Beta-Pascal distribution when $r$ is an integer. As you noted in a comment, this is a predictive distribution in the Bayesian negative binomial model with a conjugate Beta prior on the success probability. Thus you can sample it by sampling a $\text{Beta}(\alpha,\beta)$ variable $u$ and then sampling a negative binomial variable $\text{NB}(r,u)$ (with $r=1$ in your case, that is to say a geometric distribution). This distribution is implemented in the R package brr . The sampler has name rbeta_nbinom , the pmf has name dbeta_nbinom , etc. The notations are $a=r$, $c=\alpha$, $d=\beta$. Check: > Alpha a all.equal(brr::dbeta_nbinom(0:10, a, Alpha, Beta), beta(Alpha+a, Beta+0:10)/beta(Alpha,Beta)) [1] TRUE Looking at the code, one can see it actually calls the ghyper (generalized hypergeometric) family of distributions of the SuppDists package: brr::rbeta_nbinom function(n, a, c, d){ rghyper(n, -d, -a, c-1) } Ineed, the BNB distribution is known as a type IV generalized hypergeometric distribution. See the help of ghyper in the SuppDists package. I believe this can also be found in Johnson & al's book Univariate Discrete Distributions .
