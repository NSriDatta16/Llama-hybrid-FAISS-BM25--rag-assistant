Call the number of training inputs $n$ and their dimension $d$. Linear SVMs will typically be solved in the primal, so that a model is represented by a vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and an offset $b \in \mathbb R$. Prediction is done as $$ \hat y = \mathrm{sign}(w^T x + b) $$ which happens in $O(d)$ time, independent of $n$. Training time depends on the algorithm used, but the typical linear SVM solvers (e.g. LIBLINEAR) are linear in $n$. For example, see Thorsten Joachims. Training Linear SVMs in Linear Time. KDD 2016. ( author's pdf , doi ) Kernel SVM solvers (e.g. LIBSVM) are somewhat harder to quantify but take time more like $n^3$.
