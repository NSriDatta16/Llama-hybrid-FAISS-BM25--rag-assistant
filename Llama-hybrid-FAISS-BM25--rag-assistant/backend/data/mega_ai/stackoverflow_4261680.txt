Let's say that we have a form where we submit a form with a name field. name was used in a variable, $Name. You then run this query: INSERT INTO Students VALUES ( '$Name' ) It will be translated into: INSERT INTO Students VALUES ( 'Robert' ); DROP TABLE STUDENTS; --') The -- is a comment delimiter. After that everything will be ignored. The ' is used to delimit string literals. To use hex chars in an attack has some reasons. One of the is the obfuscation, other one to bypass some naive security measures.
