The nonlinearity of neural nets comes from the activation function(s) used, not so much from embedding in higher dimensional space and cutting there. Most modern image-classification nets though are convolutional, and the first layer will have many more nodes: each filter has (almost, depending on padding) as many individual nodes as the input has pixels, and you will have several filters.
