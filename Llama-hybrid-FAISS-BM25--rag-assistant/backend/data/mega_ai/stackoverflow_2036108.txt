convert Class object to bytes

If I have a Class instance at runtime, can I get its byte[] representation? The bytes I'm interested in would be in the Class file format , such that they'd be valid input to [ClassLoader.defineClass][3]. [3]: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html#defineClass(java.lang.String , byte[], int, int) EDIT: I've accepted a getResourceAsStream answer, because it's very simple and will work most of the time. ClassFileTransformer seems like a more robust solution because it doesn't require that classes be loaded from .class files; it would handle network-loaded classes for example. There's a few hoops to jump through with that approach, but I'll keep in in mind. Thanks all!
