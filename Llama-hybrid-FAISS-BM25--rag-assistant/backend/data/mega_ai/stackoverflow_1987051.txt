Let's see if I get your question: You want to calculate the TF/IDF similarity between the two documents: Doc A: cat dog and Doc B: dog sparrow I take it that this is your whole corpus. Therefore |D| = 2 Tfs are indeed 0.5 for all words. To calculate the IDF of 'dog', take log(|D|/|d:dog in d| = log(2/2) = 0 Similarly, the IDFs of 'cat' and 'sparrow' are log(2/1) = log(2) =1 (I use 2 as the log base to make this easier). Therefore, the TF/IDF values for 'dog' will be 0.5*0 = 0 the TF/IDF value for 'cat' and 'sparrow' will be 0.5*1 = 0.5 To measure the similarity between the two documents, you should calculate the cosine between the vectors in the (cat, sparrow, dog) space: (0.5, 0 , 0) and (0, 0.5, 0) and get the result 0. To sum it up: You have an error in the IDF calculations. This error creates wrong TF/IDF values. The Wikipedia article does not explain the use of TF/IDF for similarity well enough. I like Manning, Raghavan & Sch√ºtze's explanation much better.
