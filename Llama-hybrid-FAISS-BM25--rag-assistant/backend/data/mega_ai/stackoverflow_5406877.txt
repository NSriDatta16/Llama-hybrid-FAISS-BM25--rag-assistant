Lync Server Deploy Certificate Verification Failed

Just got my Lync server deployed on Windows Server 2008 R2 and am trying to connect via Lync client on a different machine. When attempting to sign in, the client throws an error saying "Cannot sign in to Lync: There was a problem verifying the certificate from the server.". Looking deeper, into the client box's event viewer, I see the following error "The certificate received from the remote serer was issued by an untrusted certificate authority. Because of this, none of the data contained in the certificate can be validated. The SSL connection request has failed. The attached data contains the server certificate. .... My organization has an internal CA, which is in charge of issuing all required certificates to the Lync server. My client box has installed the internal CA (root) as a trusted CA provider. To me, this should cause any certificates that issues, including the Lync certificates, to be trusted. I installed Lync client on the same box that Lync server is hoted, and am able to log in fine. My error only occurs when connecting from a different box. Can anyone shed some light? Thanks!
