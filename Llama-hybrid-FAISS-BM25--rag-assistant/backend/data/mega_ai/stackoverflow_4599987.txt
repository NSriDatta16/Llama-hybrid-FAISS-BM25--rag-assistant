Is there some way to intercept and modify the html output stream in asp.net, to combine the javascript?

Is there some way to intercept the HTML output stream in asp.net and make modifications? Eg using httpmodules or something? I know this is possible using java servlets and assume there must be an elegant way to do this with asp.net. My purpose is to combine the many javascript files into one composite script which has been minified/packed, to make the page load faster. Eg, if my page normally outputs the following in the page head: I want to replace that with the following: (also i realise i'll have to create all.js somehow). Thanks!
