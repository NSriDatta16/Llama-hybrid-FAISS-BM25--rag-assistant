Stratification is used to balance treatments within important subgroups. By "important" I mean related to the primary outcome. Trial site (centre) is often thought to be important because patients at different centres are likely to differ in severity of illness or socio-economic background, and so may well have different average risks of poor outcome. However, you should consider whether this is likely to be the case in your trial before automatically stratifying by centre. The most popular method of balancing treatments within strata is random permuted blocks . This is easy to understand and you can create stratified blocked lists yourself so you don't need to trust a "black box" like RANDI3.
