Assigning new data point to cluster after pca

I have a large dataset with a lot of features, I applied PCA on it and then run it through clustering algorithm. I have another large dataset with the same features from different area and I want to check to which cluster each point fit sepreatly. How I do it? Do I need to apply PCA to the new dataset?
