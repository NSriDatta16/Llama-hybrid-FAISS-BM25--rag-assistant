While platform independence are great to strive for I would say Java and .net are commonly used as there are a large number frameworks available which make it so much easier to develop enterprise level applications. This is especially true with java, where you have an incredible choice of high quality technologies most of which are flexible enough to meet the needs of most projects, allowing you to focus on your application's functionality. Also, without no intent to start a flame war, Java and .net have better development tool support and are easier/quicker to develop with for your average programmer.
