Taken as single statements, it doesn't matter. Little can be said without more context. There are a few effects in favor of the stack which are negligible virtually all of the time. the stack is likely in the cache already, a freshly allocated heap block likely is not. However, this is a first execution penalty only. For significant amounts of data, you'd thrash the cache anyway Stack allocation itself is a bit cheaper than heap allocation, because the allocation is simpler Long term, the main problem of a heap is usually fragmentation, an "accumulated cost" that (usually) cannot be attributed to single allocations, but may significantly increase the cost of further allocations Measuring these effects is tricky at least. Recommendation : performance is not the decider here. Portability and Scalability recommend using the heap for all but very small amount of data.
