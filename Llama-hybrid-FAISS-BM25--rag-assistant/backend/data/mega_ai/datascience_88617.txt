Had a similar issue in a project where the model would become strictly dependent on immediately previous temporal data. I imagine this issue is prevalent when dealing with time series, and problems such as predicting something will happen in $T$ time ahead based on data from $T_1$ time behind. The issue with this is that the model can always predict the same as the closest point in time and receive a "good" score. Check this article's header "Time delayed predictions and autocorrelations" . The author wrote a follow-up that I also recommend looking at. My memory notwithstanding, I believe this bias was considerably improved in my project by reshaping the temporal area we trained on to not use a measured value at that point in time, but rather deltas from relevant data's temporal spaces. E.g. if attempting to predict 1 day ahead and you know the pattern is somewhere in the past 1-10 days, create a training set tailored to that. (deltas or sliding deltas from data in that temporal area).
