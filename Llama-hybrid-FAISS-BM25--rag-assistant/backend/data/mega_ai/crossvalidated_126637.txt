Plotting decision boundary of Logistic Regression (liblinear)

I have liblinear model file for a classifier learned using logistic regression. In the file, they say, the weight vector and intercept term. But when I simply plot it as $$w^Tx + b$$ on the original data, it does not seems like the proper decision boundary. But in case of SVM, plotting $$w^Tx+b$$ seems to be the correct way. Is there any difference in case of Logistic Regression with liblinear ?
