Create an NSTextFieldCell instance and match its font/size/etc. to that of your column's data cell. Ask it for the -cellSizeForBounds: , passing in a rect of the desired width for the column, with a large height (FLT_MAX?). The result should be an NSSize whose height you can use. It gets trickier if you have more than one multi-line text column because you'll need to consider all the cells in that row, taking the largest as your row height. If you expect a lot of rows on average, you'll probably want to cache this work, updating it as necessary, then simply referencing it when the row height delegate method is called.
