A few points: First, as the comment thread reveals, this is not nonlinear regression. Second, I asked in the comments whether you centered age before squaring it. This is usually recommended. Third, I think you are over-relying on significance tests. Why did you look at a age-squared in the first place? Do you suspect, on theoretical grounds, that the relationship between the dependent variable and age would be curved? It is entirely permissible to include nonsignificant terms in your model (although some PHBs will argue). (PHB = Pointy Haired Boss, from Dilbert. It could be a manager, a committee, an editor ...) Fourth, when a relationship is complicated, I often find it useful to look at a spline relation. It's also helpful to look at a scatterplot of the DV and age.
