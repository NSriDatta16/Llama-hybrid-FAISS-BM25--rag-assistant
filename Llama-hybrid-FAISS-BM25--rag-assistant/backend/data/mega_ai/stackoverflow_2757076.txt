ASP.NET MVC Html Helper Extensions and Rendering Their Required "include"s

I have build a custom Html Helper extension as follows: public static string DatePicker(this HtmlHelper helper, string name, string value) { return string.Format(@" $(document).ready(function(){{ $('#{0}').datepicker({{ changeMonth: true, changeYear:true, dateFormat: 'd-M-yy', firstDay: 1, showButtonPanel: true, showWeek: true }}); }}); ", name, value); } The problem is that this now requires the page to "include" the following: And a few other items. The questions are as follows: Is there a serious processing overhead if I were to include these items in EVERY page (like in the Site.Master for example) thus negating the need for the HtmlHelper to organise the "includes" - considering there would end up being about 20 includes for all the different types of jQuery UI widgets used throughout the site. If the HtmlHelper sorts out the "includes", it will add one every time this DatePicker is used (often there are two on a page) Does anyone have a way of determining whether or not the user has already rendered the same type of control on the page, thus not re-including the same jquery libraries when multiple instances of the DatePicker (for example) are used?
