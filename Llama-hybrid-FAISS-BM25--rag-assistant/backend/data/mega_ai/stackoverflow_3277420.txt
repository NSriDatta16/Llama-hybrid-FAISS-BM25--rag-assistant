Web application architecture design

I am starting a new project trying to create a web application for an electronic programme guide for TV. This is not going to be a large scale project, but just something that I can use to learn web application programming. I am going to be using PHP for this. Before beginning coding for the application, there is a crucial question that is bugging me. Since the application would involve large use of database and/or XML files for data storage, I am confused how to implement the architecture for the application. Please bear with me for this beginner question. How should I be implementing the architecture of the application? For example, there are going to be around 50 channels with (50 * N) number of shows. What I am thinking is: Put the show description in an XML file. Put the channel names in a table in the database. Put the show names and IDs in another tables and fetch show description from the XML document. What the above architecture lacks is how to actually implement the time-tracking. I mean I know when a particular show starts and ends but where do I "best" store that information? In the database or in the XML file? And how do I "best" display the information? Do you have a better suggestion than the above architecture?
