I'm getting the warning: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, etc... (Help!)

I'm building a webpage and I'm getting the following warning (and the page loads but when I change of section it never loads and displays the warning). The warning: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-Type: text/html Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.0 X-Powered-By: ASP.NET Date: Wed, 10 Mar 2010 12:04:11 GMT Content-Length: 4022 I think it didn't happen in my computer at home. The problem seems to happen just few times (apparently random). I'm using cookies and sessions (php) in this web page. This is getting very strange, I just came back to my house and the problem disappeared (it was because in the another computer I was using Vista?). Is this a problem with the webpage or the server?
