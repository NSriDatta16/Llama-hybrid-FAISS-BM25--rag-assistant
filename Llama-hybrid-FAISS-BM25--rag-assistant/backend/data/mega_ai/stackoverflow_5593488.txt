If some *.cpp includes "State.h" without "Global.h" somewhere before it then you will have the error that you've posted. Because when "State.h" includes "Global.h" then "Global.h" does not include "State.h" (because of #pragma once ) but it includes "PlayState.h" so in the end you have "PlayState.h" included before class State is defined. Just don't make such weird circular inclusions.
