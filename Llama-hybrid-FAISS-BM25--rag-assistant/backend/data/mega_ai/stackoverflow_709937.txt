Backslashes being added into my cookie in Python

I am working with Python's SimpleCookie and I ran into this problem and I am not sure if it is something with my syntax or what. Also, this is classwork for my Python class so it is meant to teach about Python so this is far from the way I would do this in the real world. Anyway, so basically I am keeping information input into a form in a cookie. I am attempting to append to the previous cookie with the new information entered. But for some reason on the third entry of data the cookie suddenly gets "\" in it. I am not sure where they are coming from though. This is the type of output I am getting: "\"\\"\\\\"test:more\\\\":rttre\\":more\":and more" #!/usr/local/bin/python import cgi,os,time,Cookie #error checking import cgitb cgitb.enable() if 'HTTP_COOKIE' in os.environ: cookies = os.environ['HTTP_COOKIE'] cookies = cookies.split('; ') for myCookie in cookies: myCookie = myCookie.split('=') name = myCookie[0] value = myCookie[1] if name == 'critter' : hideMe = value #import critterClass #get info from form form = cgi.FieldStorage() critterName = form.getvalue('input') input2 = form.getvalue('input2') hiddenCookie = form.getvalue('hiddenCookie') hiddenVar = form.getvalue('hiddenVar') #make cookie cookie = Cookie.SimpleCookie() #set critter Cookie if critterName is not None: cookie['critter'] = critterName #If already named else: #if action asked, append cookie if input2 is not None: cookie['critter'] = hideMe+":"+input2 else: cookie['critter'] = "default" print cookie print "Content-type: text/html\n\n" if ((critterName is None) and (input2 is None)): print """ Name your pet: """ else: formTwo =""" %s wants to: [name,play,feed,mood,levels,end] """ print formTwo % (critterName,critterName) if 'HTTP_COOKIE' in os.environ: cookies = os.environ['HTTP_COOKIE'] cookies = cookies.split('; ') for myCookie in cookies: myCookie = myCookie.split('=') name = myCookie[0] value = myCookie[1] if name == 'critter' : print "name"+name print "value"+value
