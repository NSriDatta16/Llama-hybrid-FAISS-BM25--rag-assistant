Is there anything like Project Sprouts but implemented in Python?

Since our entire build system is written in Python, I'm wondering if there is anything like Sprouts that I could leverage to integrate Flex builds / development into our codebase? Sprouts looks nice and all, but I don't want to introduce another build-time dependency to our projects (namely Ruby). Thanks
