Monte Carlo / Nonparametric confidence intervals for mean estimate

I have 2x2 design with n = 3 (averages) for each group ( see here ). I am not sure that my data follows any particular distribution, but I would like to use confidence intervals as error bars in a dot plot. Thus I can't really use sd, se or bootstrapping from a distribution. The approach I am after is described in this article . My initial feeling is that I should use boot package . I have 3 replicates, which consist of different number of measurements. I would like to use averages of these replicates to calculate the confidence intervals. Something like: x1 The help file for boot() function says "For the nonparametric bootstrap, possible resampling methods are the ordinary bootstrap, the balanced bootstrap, antithetic resampling, and permutation". Without background in statistics, I am having hard time understanding what do these different options do and what would be the most suitable for this case. boot.ci() function gives 5 different answers, which all seem to differ considerably. I am pretty confused. Could anyone clarify following related questions: Is this a right approach? Which combination should I use in this case? Why so many options?
