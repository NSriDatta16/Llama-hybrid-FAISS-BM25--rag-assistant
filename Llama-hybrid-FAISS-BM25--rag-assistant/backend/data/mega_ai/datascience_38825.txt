Applicable method for the clustering of time-series consisting of multiple events

I'm currently dealing with a time-series clustering problem at work and I need help with picking/suggesting the right methodology. The problem is similar to clustering of users on a website based on their actions. Each user is uniquely identified by his IP (oversimplification) and is represented by a time series of actions. An action could be anything from going to homepage, adding an item into his shopping cart, sending a form. An action has other features - e.g. time at which it was done, or what items were added into the shopping cart. One time series could therefore look like this: User receives goes to https://www.example.com, from there he goes into https://www.example.com/categories, https://www.example.com/some-product and he adds this product into the cart. Each action was separated by 5-10 seconds. The behaviour pattern is completely different from a crawler, which would look like this: Homepage, Category1, Category2, Category3 ... CategoryN , each with exactly 2 seconds between any two events. Is there a unsupervised learning method which could be used for clustering users into N groups, depending on the characteristics of their behaviour? The closest I got so far are the self-organizing maps, though they do not really put much emphasis on time. Thanks, any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
