Retrieving the "snapped to" element using jQuery UI draggable with snap enabled

I'm using jQuery UI's draggable, with 'snap' enabled and set to select a class of elements. This means that the draggable snaps to the edges of (for example) a class called .general . When the draggable is snapping to an element of class .general , is it possible to find or select that exact 'snapped to' element?
