Dictionary , definitely. Two reasons: Dictionary uses a hash table, making retrieval O(1) (i.e. constant time), compared to O(log n ) in a skip list. Dictionary already exists and is well-tested and optimised, whereas a skip list class doesnâ€™t exist to my knowledge, so you would have to implement your own, which takes effort to get it right and test it thoroughly. Memory consumption is about the same for both (certainly the same complexity, namely O( n )).
