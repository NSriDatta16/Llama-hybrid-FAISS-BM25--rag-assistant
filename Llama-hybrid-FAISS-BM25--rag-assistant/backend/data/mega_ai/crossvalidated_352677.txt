How to exploit strong features but they cover only 10% of data in machine learning models?

Assume we want to develop a machine learning application, for example using XGBoost model, or RandomForest to predict the houses' prices in some states. We have a set of features such that there are no missing values at those features for all data points. In addition, we have one more very strong feature. It correlates 90% with the output (houses' price) but only ten percent of data ( true for training and testing data) have information of that feature. We do not have information of that feature for the remaining 90% data point. We should not discard that feature in XGBoost because 90% of data is missing. If we decide to use that feature, what is the smartest choice to exploit that feature with XGBoost ? Thanks
