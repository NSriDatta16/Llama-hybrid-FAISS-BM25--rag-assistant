JQuery SimpleModal crashing on close in windows w/ safari

I'm leveraging SimpleModal on a small thing I'm working on to open an iFrame and later close it. Says to post here if having issues so here I am. I'm having issues with the simple modal plug-in for jquery when I go to close the popup, but only on windows with safari. It works in IE/FF/Chrome/Opera on window and works in FF/Safari on Mac, and I have tested this on multiple mac and multiple windows boxes. after calling "$.modal.close()" and entering the close function it will reach and crash the moment it hits... "s.d.data.hide().remove();" if I remove the .remove() statement making it "s.d.data.hide()//.remove();" it will continue on and then crash the moment it hits the end of the close function where there are 3 more lines with .remove(). s.d.container.hide();//.remove(); s.d.overlay.hide();//.remove(); s.d.iframe && s.d.iframe.hide();//.remove(); Commenting them out as I did above works alright temporarily but JS not being my strongest language I'm not sure what side effects there are by not having the remove statements in place.
