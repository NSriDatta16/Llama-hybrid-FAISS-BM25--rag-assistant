Highly recommended reading includes : The Agile Manifesto and The Pragmatic Programmer. Subsequently, you'll probably want to get familiar with Scrum software development, or Test-Driven Development. At the very least you should have: Source Control repository Bug tracking system Standard set of tools for communication (A wiki tends to be popular for documentation, these days), IDE Testing framework A lot of things will depend on the skills of your team and the application domain that you're seeking to go into. Get yourselves familiar with some methodologies, then practice them. Have 15 minute standing meetings at the start of the day. Develop code incrementally with a write a failing test, make it pass, repeat mindset. Etc etc.
