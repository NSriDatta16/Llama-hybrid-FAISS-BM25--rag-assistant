Classifying encrypted images

I know this question is rather broad but hopefully on topic. Are there useful references on classifying encrypted images. For example classifying cat/no cat on encrypted images. Is there efficient and accurate software for this task? Thank you! EDIT for clarification: What I mean is the following: We have an encryption method E. A classifier is trained on encrypted images with their labels. Then at run time an image is sent in encrypted form from the client to the server and classified. This is similar to: ML Confidential: Machine Learning on Encrypted Data https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/323.pdf
