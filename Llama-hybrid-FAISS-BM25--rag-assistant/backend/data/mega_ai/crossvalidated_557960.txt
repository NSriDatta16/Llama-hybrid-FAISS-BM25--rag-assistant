We want to be able to quantify how accurate our estimate is of the true population. "We are 95.. 99% confident that the true proportion is "x/y" +/- x%. From my research, confidence intervals cannot be interpreted in such a way. You are correct. Our confidence (or belief) is undefined unless we start with a Bayesian prior belief. In that case, we can update to a posterior belief based on the experiment. But the posterior will depend on the prior. For example, suppose our prior belief is the proportion is about 50%. And suppose our confidence interval is [30%, 40%]. We still might not believe the true parameter is in that low range. Instead we believe the experiment is a fluke. The confidence-interval approach avoids making any claims about what we should believe post-hoc. However, it does give a useful guarantee: no matter what the true proportion is, with 95% probability (or 99.9%, etc), it will be in the confidence interval. In other words, if you make a claim "the true proportion is in this interval", that claim will only be wrong with probability 5% (or 0.1%, etc). But when you see the actual interval resulting from your experiment, you might use prior knowledge to decide whether the 5% event (or 0.1%, etc) happened or not. That would be a Bayesian approach as I mentioned above.
