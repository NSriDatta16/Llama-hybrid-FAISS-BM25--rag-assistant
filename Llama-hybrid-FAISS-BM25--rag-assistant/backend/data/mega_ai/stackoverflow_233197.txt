regarding the problem of passing a structure, this thing is safe as long as you align your structure such as: #pragma pack(push,4) typedef myStruct { int a; char b; float c; }myStruct; #pragma pack(pop) You can put this declaration in a header file and include it in both projects. This way you will not have any problem while passing structures. Also, make sure you link statically with the runtime libraries and do not try thing such as allocating memory (ptr=malloc(1024)) in a module and then releasing that memory in another module (free(ptr)).
