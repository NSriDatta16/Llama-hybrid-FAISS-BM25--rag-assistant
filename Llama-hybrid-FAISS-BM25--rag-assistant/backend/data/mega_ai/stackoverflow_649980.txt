How do I find out the code coverage of the JDK caused by my tests?

I am currently using Emma as the code coverage tool for my project. I know how to get the code coverage analysis of running a sample Java test case. This will give me the code coverage details of the Java test case code, but, what I want to know is how much JDK code was covered in running the sample Java test case. For example, if my test case is: public class TestCase{ public static void main(String[] args){ System.out.println("Hello world!"); } } I want to know how much JDK code was executed to execute the above test case.
