Can I make a UIControl take ownership of "disposable" event targets?

In my view controller I'm programmatically creating N buttons in my UIView . Each button needs to do something different, so I've made a custom handler class, which I create N instances of, each initialized with custom data. I create them in the body of a for loop and add them as targets, after which I don't need them anymore. However, because UIControl s don't take ownership of their event targets, I need to hang on to these custom handlers myself (in the controller), introducing an extra ivar and the necessary release code. Is there a more elegant way to handle this problem?
