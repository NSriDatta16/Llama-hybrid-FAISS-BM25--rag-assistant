How to take a negative ranged prior using pymc package?

I was trying to fit bayesian linear regression using pymc package. But for certain model coefficients I need to choose the prior as a negative ranged distribution (for example negative halfnormal) so that I get always negative estimates for those coefficients and the hdi range should also lie in the negative range. with pm.Model() as model: mu = pm.HalfNormal('mu',1) mean = pm.Deterministic('mean', -mu) sigma = pm.HalfNormal('sigma', 1) likelihood = pm.Normal('likelihood', mu=mean, sigma=sigma, observed=data) trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000) print(pm.summary(trace)) I tried the above code but it is only converting the positive signs of mean into negative signs rather than sampling randomly from a negative ranged distribution. How can I modify my code.
