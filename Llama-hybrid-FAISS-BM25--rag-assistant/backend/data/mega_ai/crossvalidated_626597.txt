Is there a justification for the Bernoulli deviance in the R stats package?

Using the standard glm(...) function in R for Bernoulli regression, it appears that the residual deviance has the same value as the binomial deviance where each observation is calculated with $n_i=1$ [1]. Is there a reason for this formula? Should it improve any properties? For example, the actual Bernoulli deviance should not be used as a goodness-of-fit measure in logistic regression [2]. However, I cannot see how this would address the problem. Thanks a lot! [1] Unfortunately, I could not open the source code for .Call(C_binomial_dev_resids, y, mu, wt) used in the binomial() function, but found this question ( understanding deviance residual ) where a formula is presented for the package binomTools . The result of the deviance did also coincide with the tests I did on glm(...) for Bernoulli regression. [2] Dunn, P.K., Smyth, G.K. (2018).
