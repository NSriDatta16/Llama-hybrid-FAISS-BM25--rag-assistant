Is it possible to test the converse of the null and alternative hypotheses?

Consider a simple t-test. Traditionally, $H_{0} : \mu_{1}=\mu_{2}$ $H_{1} : \mu_{1}\ne\mu_{2}$ Is it possible to instead assume: $H_{0} : \mu_{1}\ne\mu_{2}$ and test if: $H_{1} : \mu_{1}=\mu_{2}$ ? Random example: a guinea pigs and giraffes are different heights. But a shrink ray can make them the same size. Does the shrink ray make every organism significantly the same size?
