How to define the features that bring more variance?

I have a dataset with 10 column, that are my features, and 1732 row that are my registrations. This registration are divided in 15 classes, so I have several registration for every class in my dataset. My goal is to define what is the most important feature, the one that brings more variance between classes. I'm trying to use PCA, but because of the several registration for every classes it's difficult to find the right way of use oof this method. Is there another method that can I use?
