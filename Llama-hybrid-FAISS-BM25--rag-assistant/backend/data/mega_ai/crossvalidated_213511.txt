If $x_t$ is a series of logarithmic returns, the standard GARCH(1,1) model for it takes the form $$ \begin{aligned} x_t &= \sigma_t \varepsilon_t, \\ \sigma_t^2 &= \omega + \alpha_1 x_{t-1}^2 + \beta_1 \sigma_{t-1}^2, \end{aligned} $$ where $\varepsilon_t$ is $i.i.d.(0,1)$ random variable. (It is straightforward to extend the model order to obtain GARCH($p$,$q$).) If you care about the volatility (measured by standard deviation or variance) of the returns, no absolute values get involved. A GARCH model that involves absolute values is absolute value GARCH (AVGARCH or TS-GARCH) due to Taylor and Schwert (Bollerslev, 2009, p. 30) and is formulated as follows: $$ \begin{aligned} x_t &= \sigma_t \varepsilon_t, \\ \sigma_t &= \omega + \alpha_1 |x_{t-1}| + \beta_1 \sigma_{t-1}. \end{aligned} $$ The model is less sensitive to large errors as compared to the regular GARCH model.
