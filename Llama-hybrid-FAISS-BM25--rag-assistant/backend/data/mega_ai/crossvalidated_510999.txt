Is a time series which is a deterministic linear trend + white noise considered an ARIMA model?

This is, I guess, just a question of standard vocabulary. All definitions I have seen for an ARIMA series just state that it is a series which becomes ARMA after differencing some number of times. If you difference a time series model with linear trend $$X_t = a + bt + w_t,$$ where $w_t$ is a white noise series, you get a stationary model $$Y_t = b + (w_t - w_{t-1})$$ This would not be an ARMA model because of the nonzero mean, I guess, so $X_t$ doesn't fit the definition of ARIMA(0,1,1) I have seen. If you difference again, you get $$Z_t = w_t -2 w_{t-1} + w_{t-2}$$ Thus, the series $X_t$ fits the definition I have seen of an ARIMA(0,2,2) model. Yet I see lots of websites and books informally suggest an ARIMA model should have only stochastic trends. So my question is, do practitioners call a series like $X_t$ with a deterministic trend a type of ARIMA model, as would comport with the definitions I have seen? Or do the definitions I have seen need some revision to remove such series from consideration? Also, would practitioners view the extra difference I applied to be a case of overdifferencing? I would think so, since a constant mean should be easy to deal with after that first difference.
