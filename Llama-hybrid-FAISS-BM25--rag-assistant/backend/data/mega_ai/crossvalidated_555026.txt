You have a bunch of values and want to find the lower third, middle third, and top third. This is exactly what quantiles do. The bottom third of the points are below quantile $1/3\approx 0.33$ . The top third of points are above quantile $2/3\approx0.67$ . The middle third of points are between quantiles $1/3$ and $2/3$ . In R code, the function is quantile . If you call your data x , the correct command would be quantile(x, c(1/3, 2/3)) . Other software packages like Python will have their own variants of this. The documentation for the R function explains how the quantiles are calculated, since there might not be a convenient number of distinct points that are easy to split into thirds. As discussed in the comments, however, such binning is discouraged and literally destroys information. For example, a colleague is $50$ years old and read about the risks of COVID-19 to people in their $50$ s. "But I'm more like a $49$ -year-old than a $59$ -year old," he protested.
