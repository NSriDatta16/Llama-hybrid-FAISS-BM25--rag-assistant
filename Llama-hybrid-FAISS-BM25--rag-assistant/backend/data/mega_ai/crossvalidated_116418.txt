usage of libsvm-matlab version

Based on the readme file in the libsvm package. The svmpredict matlab version function is used in the following way: [predicted_label, accuracy, decision_values/prob_estimates] = svmpredict(testing_label_vector, testing_instance_matrix, model [, 'libsvm_options']); The return value "accuracy" is always a three dimension vector. The first element in the vector is the classification accuracy. What are the other two? Can I use the decision_values as the confidence score? Or prob_estimates? Thanks so much.
