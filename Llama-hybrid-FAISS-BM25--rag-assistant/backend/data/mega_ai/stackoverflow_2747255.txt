Add something to print the exception you are catching and you'll see that you're receiving a 403 Forbidden from Google . There are a lot of Java bots out there and sites have started blocking requests with "java" in the User-agent field. Google will let you get their home page, but won't let you search unless you override the User-agent field. Start your jvm with -Dhttp.agent=myappname/1.0 where myappname is the name of your application.
