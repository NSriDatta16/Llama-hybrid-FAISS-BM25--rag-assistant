How to test if 2 proportions from the same sample are significantly different

I asked a random group of people from an organisation a question. I then have a proportion of favorable responses (e.g. 80% of 100 participants gave favorable responses). 6 months later, I asked another random group of people from the same organisation, the same question. I then have a proportion of favorable responses (e.g. 85% of 120 participants gave favorable responses). The question (e.g. the organisation was a good place to work in) was in likert scale: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree. Favorable responses are number of responses to agree and strongly agree. How do I know if the difference between the first time point and second time point on the same question is significantly different? What test can I use for it? I tied calculating z-score for 2 Population Proportions but am not too sure if it is the right stats to use.
