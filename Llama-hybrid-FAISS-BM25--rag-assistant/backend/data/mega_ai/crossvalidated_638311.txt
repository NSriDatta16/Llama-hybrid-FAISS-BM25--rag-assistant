My aim is to identify if education has an effect on the outcome. If that is the case, then you should do a likelihood ratio test between a model with education and a model without it. That is agnostic to coding and will give the same p-value regardless of coding. It also answers your research question directly with a single test. To to characterize what the effect of education on your outcome is, you should use a post-estimation procedure like computing and comparing average adjusted predictions (e.g., using marginaleffects ) rather than trying to engineer your model to provide interpretable coefficients. Such approaches are agnostic to how the variable is coded and which is the reference category. Choosing the reference category is only important if you want to interpret the model coefficients, in which case it makes to choose the reference category based on the research question you want to answer. In your case, it seems that your research question does not have to involve regression coefficients and you can and should use methods that are agnostic to coding.
