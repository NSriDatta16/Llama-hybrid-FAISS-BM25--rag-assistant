If the classes are defined in computers.py , say, you can do import computers getattr( computers, "Laptop" )( ) to instantiate a computers.Laptop . If they are defined in the same file that you are running the code in (so that they are global variables), you can do globals()[ "Laptop" ] but this is less elegant; it would be nicer to put them in a separate scope. Alternatively, if you want a more powerful mapping (say you want "Nettop", "Lapbook", and "Laptop" all to instantiate Laptop ), you could maintain a mapping of strings to their corresponding constructor and use that: mapping = { "Laptop": Laptop, "Nettop": Laptop, ... } mapping[ "Laptop" ]()
