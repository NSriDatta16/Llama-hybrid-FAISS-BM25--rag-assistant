How is the intercept computed in the GLM fit?

I have been reading the code used by R to fit a generalized linear model (GLM), since the source-code of R is freely available. The algorithm used is called iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), which is a fairly documented algorithm. For each iteration, there is a call to a Fortran function to solve the weighted least squares problem. From the end-user's viewpoint, for a logistic regression for instance, a call in R looks just like this: y And if you do not want to use a intercept , either of these calls is okay: glm(y~x-1, family=binomial)$coefficients glm(y~x+0, family=binomial)$coefficients However, I cannot manage to understand how the formula , i.e. y~x or y~x-1 , is making sense in the code and being understood as for whether to use an intercept or not. I was looking for a part of the code where a column of ones would be bound to x , but it seems there is none. As far as I have read, the boolean intercept which appears in the function called glm.fit is not the same as the intercept which I am referring to. And it is the same for the offset . The documentation about glm and glm.fit is here .
