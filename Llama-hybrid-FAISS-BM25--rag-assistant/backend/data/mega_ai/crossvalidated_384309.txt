As Mark notes, how accurate you can be depends on the data. For example, if a stock market index is really a random walk, you aren't going to be able to predict it well. I took this data set and let it run for 30 minutes in an automated program that searches through a bunch of models. Even after that time, the crossvalidation accuracy was 72.5% (27.5% incorrect). That's not much better than Naive Bayes. Because running the data through a fully automated procedure is not likely to be what you Machine Learning instructor wants, I'm going to skip the details. In general, I've found Random Forests to work better than Naive Bayes, but there are certainly exceptions. Methods that never work better tend to disappear; methods that are still used tend to work well in some set of circumstances.
