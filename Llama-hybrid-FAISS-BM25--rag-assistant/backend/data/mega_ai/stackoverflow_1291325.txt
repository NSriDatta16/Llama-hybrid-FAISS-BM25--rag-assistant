Drag/drop problem (draggable in position:relative parent)

Here's the scenario, I'm using prototype and scriptaculous, but I believe jquery would have the same issue. I have a list draggable images in a relatively positioned div. The problem is I can't drag the images out of the parent div... well... you can, they're just not visible. If you remove the position:relative on the parent div, it works just fine, I can drag items out of the div perfectly. However because of this little IE7 bug: http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/position_relative_overflow_ie/ that position:relative is required. IS there another work around to this bug that does not require setting position? I've tried playing with z-index and everything I can think of to no avail. Here's the CSS for the box: #products{ width: 680px; height: 400px; border: 1px solid gray; /*background-color: #66FF00;*/ overflow-y: scroll; overflow-x: hidden; font-family:"Helvetica Neue","Helvetica"; font-size:12px; font-weight:bold; position: relative; } If you would like to see this bug in action, you can visit it here: http://twinmed-dev.com/template_add.php . Try searching for an item like "gloves" then adding it to the cart below. Thanks for any help.
