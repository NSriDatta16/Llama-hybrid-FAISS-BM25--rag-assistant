Login Wpf ...is it right?

i have a WPF Application with a LoginWindow to access,so i create a Splash Screen for this Login window as follow : - in App.xaml - in App.xaml.cs: private void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e) { Login login = new Login(); login.Show(); } - and in Login.xaml.cs if the log in is succesful : PrimaryWindow mainWindow= new PrimaryWindow (); Application.Current.MainWindow = mainWindow; this.Close(); mainWindow.Show(); .This code is right but sincerely with my poor knowledge i don't know that's a good method to apply for a Login Window or not and i don't know if this method can be "dangerous" for my application that store data from a database and has many features , so i ask you if my way is good or not and if you have a better way can you suggest or show me that? Thanks for your attention. Have a lucky day.
