For categorical columns, you have two options : Entity Embeddings One Hot Vector For a column with 145 values, I would use one hot encoding and Embedding for ~3k values. This decision might change depending on overall number of features. Embeddings map feature values into a 1D vector so that model knows NYC, Paris, London are similar cities in one aspect (size) and very different in other aspects. So, instead of using ~3k column of features, model will have ~50 columns of vector representation.
