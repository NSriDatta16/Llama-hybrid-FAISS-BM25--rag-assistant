I imagine that your ImagePanel extends JPanel. You don't "change" this into a JTabbedPane, and in fact you can't, but rather you put it into a JTabbedPane. Please check out the tutorial on tabbed panes that will show you how to do this: How to use Tabbed Panes One caveat: if you are using NetBeans drag-and-drop GUI creation tools to generate your Swing code, I advise you not to do this but rather to go through the Swing tutorials (one is linked to above) and learn to code Swing by hand. You won't regret this, and the extra knowledge gained can be used if later you need to create gui's with the NetBeans tool.
