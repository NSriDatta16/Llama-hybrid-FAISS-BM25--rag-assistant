how do I determine the position of a LI in a jquery sortable list?

After I move (sort) one of my list items I would like to know which position it just got dropped into. I'm pretty sure this is impossible to calculate off of ui.position/offset since I have been able to drop onto the same pixel and have the item go in two different slots, depending on which direction I dragged the element from. I suppose I can do some traversing and counting after the object is dropped but I was hoping that there was some direct way of getting this piece of info. Thanks
