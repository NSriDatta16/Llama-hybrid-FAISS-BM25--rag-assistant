Actions happen after constructors. The value doesn't exist (hasn't been bound) in a constructor. The route data might be known in the constructor, but the action data binding certainly will not have happened yet. You can't get this value with certainty until the action has been invoked. Route data can be accessed inside the controller via: ControllerContext.RouteData.Values However, it is incorrect to suppose that agentID can only be bound to route data. In fact, it could come from a server variable, a form field, a query string parameter, etc. My advice would be to pass it explicitly wherever it is needed. If nothing else, it makes your unit tests better.
