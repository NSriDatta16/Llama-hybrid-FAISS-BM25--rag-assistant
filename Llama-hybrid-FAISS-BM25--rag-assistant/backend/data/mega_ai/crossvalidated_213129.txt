Likert-type data in Logistic Regression

I have Likert-type data (ranked as 1 least important to 7 most important) for both dependent and independent variables. Can I use multinomial logistic regression? My second question is, if the dependent variable is binary and all independent variables are ordinal (Likert-type), would that make a difference in using a model for both type of these variables?
