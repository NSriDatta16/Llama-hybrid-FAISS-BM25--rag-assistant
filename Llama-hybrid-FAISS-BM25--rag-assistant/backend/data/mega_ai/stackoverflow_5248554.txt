Off the top of my head here are some things to check: Go into the organisier check the provisioning profile, check it hasn't expired and that the app identifier is generic (or matches your app) Check the keychain. It should have your developer certificate attached with your private key Open up the target in XCode, check the code signing identity. (make sure it has a specific name not just "iPhone Developer")
