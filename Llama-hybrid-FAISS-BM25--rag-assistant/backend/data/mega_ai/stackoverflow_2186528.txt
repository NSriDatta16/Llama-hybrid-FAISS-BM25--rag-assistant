Open a file directly to emacs (by double-clicking)

How would I go about setting all .rb files or all .py files to open in emacs if I double-click them; say, from the desktop? I'm on OS X 10.6.2. I have the script: on open of finderObjects repeat with currFile in finderObjects set unixPath to POSIX path of currFile set base to do shell script "dirname " & unixPath set fname to do shell script "basename " & unixPath do shell script "cd '" & base & "';" & " emacs " & fname end repeat end open But if I drag a file (text.py - just prints a line) on it, I get: emacs: standard input is not a tty And I'm unsure of how to solve this. Thanks! EDIT: Solved with link: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031027142625782 set filecount to 0 on open filelist repeat with i in filelist set filecount to 1 tell application "Terminal" set filename to do shell script Â¬ "perl -e \"print quotemeta ('" & POSIX path of i & "');\"" do script "emacs " & filename & "; exit" end tell end repeat end open if filecount
