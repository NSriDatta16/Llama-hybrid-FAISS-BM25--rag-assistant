The locality of your data will be improved with your key_name scheme ( ref, see slide 40 ) - since your key_name is prefixed with the corresponding article's ID, comments for a given article should be stored near each other. The key_name you proposed doesn't seem like it would be too long. I don't think you'll see too much difference between that and shorter keys in terms of storage space or serialization/deserialization time. I expect that the size of the Comment entity will be dominated by the rest of the entity.
