Having trouble with Generics in this .NET code

i'm trying to make a mixed collection of Types. I know the types at the start.. but I can't seem to figure out the syntax to make the collection, etc. eg. .... // I leave the typo there, for embarrassment :( Initialize(new []{ typeof(Cat), typeof(Dog), typeof(JohnSkeet) }); ... public Foo Initialize(IEnumerable types) { // for each type, set up the inmemory storage. foreach(var type in types) { // ???? // Create an empty list, which will only contain this 'type' // I'm guessing, an IDictionary >().. thingy ? } } public ICollection SomeTypeData(Type type) { // Return the collection, for this type. } Does this mane sense? Is this possible?
