This piece serves to partly answer the original question and some of the questions raised in comments to @JonEgil's answer. Financial (logarithmic) returns* are approximately $i.i.d.$ (although there is often some conditional heteroskedasticity) -- while prices are approximately random walks. Under the assumption of $i.i.d.$ observations, principal component analysis would directly generalize from sample to population (i.e. the sample principal components would be estimating the population principal components), but this might not hold under non-$i.i.d.$ observations -- see this thread . This is why it makes sense to run PCA on (logarithmic) returns rather than prices. Ruey S. Tsay has argued for running PCA on residuals from econometric models of financial time series, since residuals are normally assumed to be $i.i.d.$ I think that this idea might be included some place in his "Multivariate Time Series Analysis with R and Financial Applications" textbook (he explained the idea to me in person, so I am not sure where it is written). * Logarithmic return on price $P_t$ is defined as $r:=\text{log}(P_t)-\text{log}(P_{t-1})=\text{log}\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}$. Logarithmic returns are used for convenience in place of percentage returns $r':=\frac{P_t-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$. The convenient feature of logarithmic returns is that you may sum up $h$ individual logarithmic returns to get the total logarithmic return over $h$ periods, while this does not hold for percentage returns. For relatively small percentage returns (which is common in finance), logarithmic returns approximately equal percentage returns as the logarithm has approximately unit slope around one.
