Most classifiers will deal with hierarchical data just fine. The exact way structures like this turn out depends on the classifier, but a random forest classifier for example, will sometimes select the service column, and somethimes the fraud column, and things will work out. So -as far as I am aware- specific tricks for taking advantage of hierarchical structure in your data are not common in typical classifiers such as support vector machines, random forests or gradient boosted trees. It is usually not a good idea to create separate classifiers for different parts of your data, unless the rows have really nothing in common, but that is definitely not the case here. If you are talking about creating a generative model for this data, so a generalized linear model or something similar, with a hierarchical structure, then it is on the other hand very common to explicitly model this hierarchy. In which case I recommend learning about those from a tutorial of choice, and I recommend the book or the video series from http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/ , allthough it will take a while to reach the hierarchical models through that route. It may help you to know that these models are known under a lot of different names, such as mixed-effect models, varying effects, random effects, hierarchical models, or multilevel models.
