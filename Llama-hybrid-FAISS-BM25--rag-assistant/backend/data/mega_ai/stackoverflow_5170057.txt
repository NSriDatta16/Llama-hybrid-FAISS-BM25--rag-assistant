Passing a string from a form in html-file to a python-script respecting utf-8 encoding

I have this form in a index.html file. And I am trying to pass the text input to a pyton script as argument by embedding the following php code into the index.html file: I have put the add_author.py file into the same folder where index.html lays. It works fine with any string. But if I try to use strings which contains ä ö é it does not work. The python file looks like this. import sys import codecs if __name__ == '__main__': wFile = codecs.open("test.txt", "w", "utf8") wFile.write(" ".join(sys.argv[1:])) wFile.close() By the way: The index.html has this line in it. I would love to hear from a better approach of managing my task or a correction of my approach. Thank you!
