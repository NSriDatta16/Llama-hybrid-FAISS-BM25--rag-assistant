Two cookies of the same name being saved but with different values

I have a cookie I am setting when a user clicks a button on a form with the following "OnClick" handler... This works great but I've noticed some strange behavior with it when I display the contents of document.cookie and when I have changed the value of "LanguageReference" multiple times. The "LanguageReference" cookie will show up multiple times under document.cookie with different values. This is what I get... LanguageReference=en;LanguageReference=fr;... bunch of other cookies ... This doesn't appear to be affecting retrieval of the cookie oddly enough which is great. I always get back what I want. But I fear there may be an underlying issue I'm not fully understanding which is going to bite me down the road.
