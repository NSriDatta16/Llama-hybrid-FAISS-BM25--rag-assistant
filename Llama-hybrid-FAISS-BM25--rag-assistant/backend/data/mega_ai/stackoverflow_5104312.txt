LINQ without IEqualityComparer implementation

I have 2 collection with different classes. MyClass1 - Name,Age,etc MyClass2 - Nick, Age, etc I want to find except of this collections. Something like list1.Exept(list2, (l1,l2) => l1.Name==l2.Nick); But i cannt write this code and need to implement my own comparer class with IEqualityComparer interface and it's looking very overhead for this small task. Is there any elegant solution?
