RavenDB ASP.NET session provider?

A little background: I currently make use of Memcached Providers for managing session state in my ASP.NET application. It provides facilities for using SQL Server as a fallback storage mechanism (when sessions need to be purged from the memcached cache). I'd like to look at creating a provider for RavenDB as it would be much more performant for this sort of task. My question is, has anyone implemented such a thing? (or something similar?) - I'd hate to re-invent the wheel. Google does not yield any helpful results (other than my question about this in the RavenDB group itself), so I thought I'd take this question directly to the Stack Overflow community.
