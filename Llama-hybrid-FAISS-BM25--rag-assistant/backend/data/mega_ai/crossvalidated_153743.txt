Both of them try to find a lower dimensionality embedding of your data. However, there are different minimization problems. More specifically, an autoencoder tries to minimize the reconstruction error, while t-SNE tries to find a lower dimensional space and at the same time it tries to preserve the neighborhood distances. As a result of this attribute, t-SNE is usually preferred for plots and visualizations.
