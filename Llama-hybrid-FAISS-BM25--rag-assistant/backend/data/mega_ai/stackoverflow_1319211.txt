I've gotten in that position on many jobs and contracts in the past, so I've finally gotten discouraged and embraced the darkness by advocating Development Driven Development . I've found that when most managers embrace XP, they're embracing throwing out the documentation, not really doing TDD. Programmers on most teams are rewarded for quick hacks that get the defect out of their queue, and it's one manager in about ten who has the guts to stand up to senior management as an advocate of the overall quality of the product as opposed to the bottom-line-for-this-quarter way of doing business. After all, most software jobs that pay anything are corporate sponsored, and Freud proved that corporations are insane. Or at least, he should have.
