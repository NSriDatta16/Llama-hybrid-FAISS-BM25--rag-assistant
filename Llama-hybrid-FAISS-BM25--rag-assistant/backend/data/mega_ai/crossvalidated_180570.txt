how to determine the relationship of two time series?

The relationship here means: the occurrence of one time series increase(boost) or decrease(suppress) the values of another time series. Is there any statistical model or method that can do this kind of task? Specifically, I have two time series, which is the number of retweets of two different memes (hashtags) at different time. I want to know if the existence of one meme has some influence on the other meme? The influence can be promoting the other one or suppressing. I did find a model in ecology, which is the Lotkaâ€“Volterra equations . But it seems it does not provide a effective algorithm to determine this types of relationship.
