Following on from @Tim's (+1) Answer, it is OK to use prior opinion or data to arrive at what you believe is a reasonable prior distribution for a proposed new experiment. Beta distributions have support $(0,1),$ so they are natural prior distributions for Bernoulli success probability $p.$ Suppose you begin with no idea at all about the success probability. Then you might use a flat or non-informative prior distribution such as $\mathsf{Beta}(1,1)\equiv\mathsf{Unif}(0,1)$ or the Jeffreys prior $\mathsf{Beta}(.5, .5).$ Suppose a preliminary experiment showed $7$ successes in $20$ trials. Then by Bayes' Theorem the posterior distribution from the uniform prior and that small experiment would be $\mathsf{Beta}(1+7,\, 1+13)\equiv\mathsf{Beta}(8,14).$ This (preliminary) posterior has mean $\mu = $ $8/(8+14) = $ $8/22 = 0.3636$ and it puts 95% probability in the (Bayesian credible) interval $(0.181, 0.570).$ as computed in R below. qbeta(c(.025,.975), 8, 14) [1] 0.1810716 0.5696755 Subsequently, if you decide to do more extensive experimentation to obtain results from $500$ additional trials, then you can use the posterior distribution from the preliminary experiment as the prior distribution for the more extensive one (provided, of course, you are still using the same--or very similar--coin or process). If you get $x$ successes in these $n = 500$ additional trials, then your updated posterior distribution is $\mathsf{Beta}(8+x, 14 + n - x).$ and you can use R as above to get a 95% Bayesian credible interval based on all the information you have.
