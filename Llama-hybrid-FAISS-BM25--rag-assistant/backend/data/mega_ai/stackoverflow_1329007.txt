Your IIS logfiles (usu. in c:\windows\system32\logfiles ...), will show you when the spiders have crawled your site. Just be sure you've enabled logging and that you log the browser/user agent. The browser agent is a string that contains, among other things, the name of the web browser/bot/whatever that requested the page. Most entries are obvious on visual inspection (e.g., googlebot contains the string "googlebot"). If you want to be notified, I'd have a task that runs every fifteen or twenty minutes, scans through your the log entries since the last scan, and emails you on a pattern match, as the previous respondent has suggested.
