browser game map storage and implementation

I'm writing a simple browser based game with a 2d tile map. I'm implementing this map as an HTML table (ok, you can yell at me for using tables later, but it works) with background images. The map could be very very large, but it won't change much, if at all. I could eventually make more maps though. The map cells will not only have a background image, but properties like what's on them, items or special events, town entrances, etc. I'd like to ask what might be the best way to store this data. I'm leaning against a database because of how unchanging the map would be. Only things on top of the cells would be in the database. But how should I store the background then? As huge PHP arrays that get loaded in pieces? Any additional tips on beginning such a system, things that I can't yet anticipate, would be greatly appreciated.
