First of all, your code only reads the first line of your input. If you want to iterate through all the lines of your input, you should use this: while($str = ) { chomp $str; } Assuming your input is well formated, and the href attribute always comes after the 'a' tag, and the src attribute always follows 'img' tag, and you don't have spaces in your URL's, and you don't have more than one strong tag per line, then you could use the following: open(FILENAME, 'sr.txt') || die "$!\n"; while($str = ) { chomp $str; if( $str =~ / (.*) / ) { print "$1\n"; } } This code is quite ugly, but it does what you want. Parsing with XPath, as suggested by ptomli would be easier, and more elegant.
