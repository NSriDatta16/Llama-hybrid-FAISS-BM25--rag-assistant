in wins hands-down, not just in elegance (and not being deprecated;-) but also in performance, e.g.: $ python -mtimeit -s'd=dict.fromkeys(range(99))' '12 in d' 10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0983 usec per loop $ python -mtimeit -s'd=dict.fromkeys(range(99))' 'd.has_key(12)' 1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.21 usec per loop While the following observation is not always true, you'll notice that usually , in Python, the faster solution is more elegant and Pythonic; that's why -mtimeit is SO helpful -- it's not just about saving a hundred nanoseconds here and there!-)
