Binary trees in C++ using references

I wish to implement a binary tree using references instead of using pointers (which is generally what you tend to find in every book and every website on the internet). I tried the following code: class tree_node { private: tree_node& left; tree_node& right; data_type data; public: void set_left(tree_node&); // ... other functions here }; void tree_node::set_left(tree_node& new_left) { this.left = new_left; } I get the following error: error C2582: 'operator =' function is unavailable in 'tree_node'. I know I can easily implement it using pointers but I would like to keep my solution elegant and free of pointers. Can you tell me where I am going wrong?
