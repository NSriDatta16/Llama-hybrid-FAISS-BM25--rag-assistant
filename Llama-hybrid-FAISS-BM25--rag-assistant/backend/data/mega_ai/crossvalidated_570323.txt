Limit of $\frac{\lambda}{\chi _{2Y}^{2}}$ as $Y \sim \textrm{Poisson}(n\lambda)$ and $\lambda\to\infty.$

There are the following lines in Casella & Berger on page 438, before the equation (9.2.22): ..., write $$\lambda = \frac{\lambda}{\chi _{2Y}^{2}}\chi _{2Y}^{2}$$ where $\chi _{2Y}^{2}$ is a chi squared random variable with $2Y$ degrees of freedom, and $Y \sim \textrm{Poisson}(n\lambda)$ . Then, as $\lambda \to \infty $ , $\frac{\lambda}{\chi _{2Y}^{2}} \to \frac{1}{2n}$ , and ... . Can anyone please explain how exactly $\frac{\lambda}{\chi _{2Y}^{2}} \to \frac{1}{2n}$ as $\lambda \to \infty $ ? EDIT: Here, the purpose is to illustrate how the coverage probability of the credible set which was constructed using the posterior distribution of $\lambda$ , $\textrm{gamma}\left(a+\sum x,[n+\frac{1}{b}]^{-1}\right)$ behaves as $\lambda \to \infty$ . Here is the screenshot of the passage from the book from google books.
