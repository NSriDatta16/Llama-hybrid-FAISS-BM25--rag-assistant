Ljung-Box and Breusch-Godfrey for univariate time series

I am testing autocorrelation of a raw time series, not the residuals with Ljung-Box and Breusch-Godfrey tests. The problem is that I am getting contradicting p-value results for some series: Ljung-Box > x lb lb [1] 3.185489e-07 Breusch-Godfrey: > xlag bg1 bg1 [1] 0.4321826 What am I doing wrong?
