Eigenvector centrality relates to a random walk of infinite length, in which each next node is chosen uniformly at random from the set of neighbours of the current node (in an unweighted network; in a weighted network, the next node is chosen with a probability proportional to the edge weight). The eigenvector centrality of a node is proportional to the frequency with which that node is visited during such a walk (corresponding to the stationary distribution of a Markov chain). IMO, the key attribute of this walk is "random", not "infinite" (a random walk with a long but finite length usually comes pretty close to approximate the eigenvector centrality).
