How do you define "the most specific category possible"? One way could be to run several classifiers on different levels of granularity. The outcome of many classifiers, like logistic regression, is actually a number between 0 and 1 which can be interpreted as a degree of certainty with which a data point belongs to a class (according to the regression). Having classifications of several degrees of granularity for each point, you could choose the one with the highest certainty (or highest outcome from logistic regression/whatever classifier).
