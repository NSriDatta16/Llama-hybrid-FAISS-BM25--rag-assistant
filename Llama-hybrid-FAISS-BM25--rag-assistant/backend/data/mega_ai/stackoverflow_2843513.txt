Comparing 2 linq applications: Unexpected result

I drafted 2 ASP.NET applications using LINQ . One connects to MS SQL Server , another to some proprietary memory structure . Both applications work with tables of 3 int fields , having 500 000 records (the memory structure is identical to SQL Server table). The controls used are regular: GridView and ObjectDataSource . In the applications I calculate the average time needed for each paging click processing. LINQ + MS SQL application demands 0.1 sec per page change. LINQ + Memory Structure demands 0.8 sec per page change. This Is shocking result. Why the application handling data in memory works 8 times slower than the application using hard drive? Can anybody tell me why that happens?
