Your option of having 2 separate controls is actually my first choice. This has the advantage of allowing you to thoroughly, easily test both of your controls. You can easily use triggers to switch which control is visible based on any criteria in your DataContext. It's clean, simple, and reasonably elegant. That being said, there are other options, if you want to avoid this. For example, you could use a ContentPresenter for that "box" area, and bind it's content to a property in your DataContext that is simply defined as "object". You could then, at runtime, set it to a separate type when it's authenticated vs. non-authenticated. By specifying a DataTemplate for each of the types, WPF will automatically wire up the appropriate control for you. (This is basically a ViewModel-first MVVM style approach.)
