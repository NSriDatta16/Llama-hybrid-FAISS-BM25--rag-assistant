There's a genre of things called key-value stores that do exactly what you want. BerkeleyDB and Tokyo Cabinet / Tokyo Tyrant are good examples. They're simpler and faster than relational databases. The keys they store things under are arbitrary byte strings, so you can use filesystem-like paths. If you use a B-tree organisation, you can do prefix queries, to implement something like a directory listing. You mention needing access from multiple processes: I'm not sure how well BerkeleyDB handles that, but Tokyo Tyrant does it fine.
