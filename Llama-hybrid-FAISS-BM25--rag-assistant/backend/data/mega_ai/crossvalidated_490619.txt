Link functions and interpreting credible intervals

I am pretty new to statistics, and was trying to interpret credible intervals from a bayesian analysis I had preformed. Some of my models are glms, and so have a link function. I know that to correctly interpret my parameter estimates on the scale of my question I need to transform them appropriately. Let's say though as part of your criteria for interpreting whether or not a parameter influences an outcome you have a credible interval threshold (say does not include 0 at .95CI). Do you base this judgement on transformed CIs, or untransformed CIs if you've included a link function in your model?
