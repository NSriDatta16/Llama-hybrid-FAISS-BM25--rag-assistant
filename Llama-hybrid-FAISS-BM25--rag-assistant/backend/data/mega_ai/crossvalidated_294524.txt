You are looking for forecasting . You may want to look at previous questions in that tag. I like to recommend Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos , a free online forecasting textbook. The best parts for you would be the chapters on Exponential Smoothing and the one on ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) processes - what you describe is an autoregressive thing. Classical forecasting algorithms presuppose regularly sampled data, but I'd expect them to work reasonably well in your case, too.
