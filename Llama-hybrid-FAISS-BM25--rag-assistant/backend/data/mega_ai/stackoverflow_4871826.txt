drawing an animated line that erases itself

Can someone advise what method is used to for the following scenario: user touches the screen then drags their finger away from this point and a line is drawn, but as they move their finger up and down the line follows their finger as a straight line. example is like the centre of a clock where the minute hand is fixed at the centre and the user drags the other end around the clock. The minute hand glides around as a permanent straight line not erasing the detail beneath it.... hope I explained that right? thanks for some pointers
