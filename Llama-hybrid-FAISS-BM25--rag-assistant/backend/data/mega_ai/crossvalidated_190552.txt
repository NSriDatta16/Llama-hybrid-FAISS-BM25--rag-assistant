When to use RBF networks instead of multilayer perceptron?

I understand that a radial basis function neural network (RBF) usually has 1 hidden layer, and it differs from a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) via its activation and combination functions among other things, but how do I decide when a data set/problem is better suited to an RBF instead of an MLP? Do I have to try both and compare the results every time?
