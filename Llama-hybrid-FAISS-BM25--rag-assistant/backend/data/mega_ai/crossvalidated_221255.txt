Estimating the mean of a random variable from greater than/less than answers

Let $X_1,\dots,X_n$ be $n$ i.i.d. samples from a certain probability distribution (e.g, a normal distribution). Your goal is to estimate the mean of the distribution. However, you are not allowed to see the samples themselves. You are allowed, in each time-step $t$, to select a number $Y_t$. Then, you are told whether $X_t>Y_t$ or $X_t How would you select the numbers $Y_t$? And how would you use the answers to estimate the mean? (As a practical application, consider a person who sells a certain item and wants to estimate the average value of this item in the eyes of potential buyers. The real values are the $X_t$, but the seller cannot see them directly. In each time-step, the seller sets the price of the product to $Y_t$. Then, a buyer comes. If $X_t>Y_t$ then the buyer buys the item, otherwise the buyer just says "it's too expensive for me" and walks away. So the seller wants to estimate the average value based on this yes/no information).
