What is the density of a markov chain when its transition probabilities have densities with respect to different measures?

I have a homogenous, discrete time Markov process, $(X_n)_{n\geq 0}$, with state space $\mathbb R_+$. Its transition probabilities have a density, $f(x_n\mid x_{n-1})$, with respect to the measure $\lambda+\delta_{x_{n-1}}$, where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure and $\delta_{x_{n-1}}$ is the Dirac measure that puts all the weight on the previous point, namely $x_{n-1}$. Does there exist a measure, $\mu$, such that $(X_1, \dots, X_m)$ has density with respect to $\mu$? How do I calculate such density?
