Extra output layer in a neural network (Decimal to binary)

I'm working through a question from the online book . I can understand that if the additional output layer is of 5 output neurons, I could probably set bias at 0.5 and weight of 0.5 each for the previous layer. But the question now ask for a new layer of four output neurons - which is more than enough to represent 10 possible outputs at $2^{4}$ . Can someone walk me through the steps involved in understanding and solving this problem? The exercise question: There is a way of determining the bitwise representation of a digit by adding an extra layer to the three-layer network above. The extra layer converts the output from the previous layer into a binary representation, as illustrated in the figure below. Find a set of weights and biases for the new output layer. Assume that the first 3 layers of neurons are such that the correct output in the third layer (i.e., the old output layer) has activation at least 0.99, and incorrect outputs have activation less than 0.01.
