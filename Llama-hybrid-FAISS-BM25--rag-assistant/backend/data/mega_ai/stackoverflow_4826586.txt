It's not possible only with continue statement. Continue and break statement affect only the the most inner loop that their are nested. You can set a variable and check it in the outer loop. Or reorganize the IF statement and the break condition in the for statement. while (..) { for (...; ...;...) { for(...;...;...) if ( ) { ... skipLoop = true } if (skipLoop) continue; } } Hope this helps!
