You could try some kind of permutation test, where you compare observed average distance within/between clusters with the value you get if you permute the labels. The permutations are used to build a distribution of expected distances - based on your chart, your observed average distance will fall well outside the expected distribution. Try looking up MRPP - multi response permutation procedure - for some ideas. There are other permutation-based methods that will work too.
