Bootstrap bias correction was invented to adjusted for bias in the estimation of $f(Z)$ (my $Z$ is your $X-Y$). The idea is very simple: create $B$ bootstrap resamples from your data, and calculate $f_b=f(Z_b)$ for each one of them. Then the bootrstrap estimate of the bias is $\bar{f_b}-f(Z)$, where $\bar{f_b}$ is the average of $f_b$'s. Finally, subtract this bias from $f(Z)$ do get the bias corrected estimate $2f(Z) - \bar{f}_b$. This estimate is unbiased, but has much more variance then the uncorrected estimate. The reference for bootstrap methods including this bias correction is: Efron, Tibshirani 'An introduction to the bootstrap' (1993), Chapman & Hall.
