What post-hoc test should be used for a glmer model with a binary response, and a continuous and categorical predictor?

I'm a bit of a newbie with stats and R, so need a bit of direction to find a suitable post-hoc test for my glmer model. I'm trying to find if presence is affected by environmental factors for each species. 24 surveys were completed at each site. The model has a binary dependent variable (absent/present) and the predictor variables are interactive terms between a multiple continuous variables(eg temp and pH) and a categorical variable (species, n=3). The random effect is the survey site ID data was collected from. Only interactive terms, rather than the continuous factor in isolation, produce significant results when an anova is run on the model. Species by itself has a large effect because one species is much rarer than the others. I'm trying to tease apart how the presence of these species varies across pH and between species. I've tried lsmeans test with Tukey, and Firth's Bias-Reduced Logistic Regression, emmeans based on some other posts I read where people had similar questions. I ran the effects function on the interactive terms, so had a rough expectation of what a post hoc could show, but the results logistf (firth's) have produced I was not expecting. Emmeans and tukey both gave the same results and ignored the continuous variable I assume because it's not a factor. When I run firth's regression it produces chi-squared and p values that are either infinity for chi values, some with infinite degrees of freedom, or the p values astronomically small, even though what I saw through effects suggested no significant difference. I can't tell with the interactive term if there truly is an effect of the environmental variable or if the significant effect is because of the difference in species. If I wasn't clear enough about something please let me know and if anyone has any suggestions or advice, they would be massively appreciated. Thanks! Glmer code, anova output and the logistf and effects output for pH are below. Based on effects, I was not expecting significant difference but there was one in logistif. ###glmer model > Large anova(Large) Analysis of Variance Table npar Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Species:Q.Depth 3 234.904 78.301 78.3014 Species:Conductivity 3 32.991 10.997 10.9970 Species:Temp 3 39.001 13.000 13.0004 Species:pH 3 25.369 8.456 8.4562 Species:DO.P 3 34.930 11.643 11.6434 ####logistf run on pH > Lp Lp logistf(formula = Abs.Pres ~ Species:pH, data = Stacked_Pref, contrasts.arg = list(pH = "contr.treatment", Species = "contr.sum")) Model fitted by Penalized ML Confidence intervals and p-values by Profile Likelihood coef se(coef) lower 0.95 upper 0.95 Chisq p (Intercept) 1.9711411 0.57309880 0.8552342 3.1015114 12.09107 5.066380e-04 SpeciesGoby:pH -0.3393185 0.07146049 -0.4804047 -0.2003108 23.31954 1.371993e-06 SpeciesMosquito:pH -0.3001385 0.07127771 -0.4408186 -0.1614419 18.24981 1.937453e-05 SpeciesRFBE:pH -0.4771393 0.07232469 -0.6200179 -0.3365343 45.73750 1.352096e-11 Likelihood ratio test=267.0212 on 3 df, p=0, n=3945 ###effect function output on pH > SpE summary(SpE) Species*pH effect pH Species 7 7.7 8.5 9.3 10 Goby 0.22239538 0.23898961 0.25896972 0.2800056 0.29924424 Mosquito 0.36689425 0.34004541 0.31057990 0.2825744 0.25936811 RFBE 0.09393222 0.09413637 0.09437017 0.0946045 0.09480996 Lower 95 Percent Confidence Limits pH Species 7 7.7 8.5 9.3 10 Goby 0.13722030 0.16103685 0.1753282 0.17341519 0.16408392 Mosquito 0.24476920 0.23994376 0.2148559 0.17474573 0.13820850 RFBE 0.05387189 0.05905686 0.0588516 0.05251263 0.04504883 Upper 95 Percent Confidence Limits pH Species 7 7.7 8.5 9.3 10 Goby 0.3396283 0.339411 0.3648593 0.4189090 0.4815962 Mosquito 0.5088941 0.456809 0.4258216 0.4228475 0.4333341 RFBE 0.1587829 0.146802 0.1479552 0.1645751 0.1886773 ```
