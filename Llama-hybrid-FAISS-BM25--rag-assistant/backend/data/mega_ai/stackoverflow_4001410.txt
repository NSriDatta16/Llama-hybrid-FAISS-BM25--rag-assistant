Is it a bad idea to have a TeamCity webserver instance also act as a build agent?

I'm building an Amazon EC-2 cloud-based build server for my personal development projects using Team City Professional. I only intend to use it of an evening and my project builds are going to be quite small. At this stage, is there a good reason why I should go for two servers: one hosting the Team City website another configured as the build agent
