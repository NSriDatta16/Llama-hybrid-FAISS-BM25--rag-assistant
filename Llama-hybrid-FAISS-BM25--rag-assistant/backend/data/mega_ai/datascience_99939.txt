Credit scorecard model

Could anyone point me to a blog or content that talks about creating credit scorecards without logistic regression models? Instead, if we use an ensemble technique, such as random forest, how can we create scorecards? Essentially, how do we create a scorecard model through a classifier which is difficult to interpret like random forest? Thanks in advance.
