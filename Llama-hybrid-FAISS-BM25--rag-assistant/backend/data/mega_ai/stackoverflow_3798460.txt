Get live market quotes on global indices

I need to connect to some sort of web service and get live data regarding global indices ( the DOW index, the S&P/TSX in Canada, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong and so on ). I need to display this data on my website. I was wondering whether any of you know any organization that provides such stock/market/index information. I do not mind paying a monthly fee for such information. Regards, HideYourLoveWay
