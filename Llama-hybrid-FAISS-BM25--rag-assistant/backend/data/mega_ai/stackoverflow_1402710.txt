If you're already using jQuery, you can use its data() method for this. This allows you to assign complex objects to the element if you want or you can leverage that method to hold a reference to an object (or some other data) at the very least. It's worth noting that, under the hood, jQuery implements data() in precisely the way that bobince described in his answer , so you always use that directly, whether or not you're using jQuery.
