You could post snippets with comments to the project forum, bug tracker or mailing list. Each project manages communications and reporting in a different manner. Example: I've heard Mozilla devs tends to ignore the comments on Bugzilla, so that's maybe not a good place to comment about Firefox changes. If you want to write a very long piece on it, you might be better off blogging about it and then linking to that. I'd be careful about the tone of your words. Things may be that way for good reasons. Try to understand where they are going with the project and their schedule. Perhaps ask why things are that way, and clearly state what the issue might be and who might be impacted. Making patches for changes is considered to be good practice and encourages people to accept your inputs. If you are not actively creating patches for projects is it often not as quick to turnaround a patch for something like this, but it might give you more influence . My personal opinion is that this is a good thing. It separates the wheat from the chaff in terms of submissions and people need to be persistent.
