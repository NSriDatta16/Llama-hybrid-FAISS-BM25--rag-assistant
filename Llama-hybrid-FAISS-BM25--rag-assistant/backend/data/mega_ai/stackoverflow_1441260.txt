From my experience with Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal: It seems that you need a lot of flexibility for this kind of site. I think Drupal wins hands down here with Views/CCK (AFAIK Joomla and Wordpress only support it on a low database-access level) Worpress has an excellent admin interface, I agree. I think it's the winner here - although I haven't seen how it scales to larger sites. All three have a lot of plugins. The only thing I can say here that Joomla's plugin ecosystem kinda annoyed me, because most of the good (or even acceptable) ones cost money, and many free ones have that fishy-'90s-freeware feel to them. Aside from that - it's a draw. Drupal has a very flexible, and in my opinion, relatively elegant API (even though it's not OOP). However, it's pretty big, so it's not 100% trivial to learn. Wordpress has a pretty small API, so I guess it's... easy? But kinda lacking. Joomla has a new (from the time I've used it) OOP framework, that I haven't used - but it looks like it's as complex as drupal but doesn't (?) have some nice features like Drupal's fine-grained templating and template inheritance or an easy way to change plugin/core cms forms/html without changing the actual plugins/core cms files. The winner for me - Drupal. Sub-themes, theme functions, form_alter... etc. When it comes to quality of code - in the main package, all three seem pretty solid. The documentation for Joomla and Drupal is lacking IMHO. It's all over the place, and most of the time you'll probably use their code browsers to figure out the important things. Wordpress has an advantage of having a small enough API to fit in a couple of pages (that are pretty easy to use to boot). As I said earlier - Drupal's main advantage is CCK/Views and a flexible API. With those, you're not as limited to specific plugins' functionality as you are in other CMSes. As you can clearly see, my current favorite is Drupal, and it seems to be a very common opinion on Stack Overflow. But! In my opinion, if the site is sufficiently big/complex, and the site you've linked to certainly is, it's better to go with some nice framework (Django, RoR, or if you're only know PHP - Kohana or something) instead of a CMS. At some point, trying to make the CMS do what you want, becomes more of a bother than writing it "from scratch" (in quotes because good web frameworks does a lot of the work for you). Just thinking about making in.com's front page in one of those CMSes makes my brain hurt.
