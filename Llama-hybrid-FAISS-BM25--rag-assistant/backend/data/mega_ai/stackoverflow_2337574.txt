Searching through an array and "speed is very important" don't really go together. Unless if your array will be very small then searching through an array will never be quick. This is the equivalent of a full table scan in a database, performance no matter how you go about it will be poor. The key to finding things quickly is to use an indexed structure. You can still have an array if you absolutely need it but the searching should be done using another data structure. Check out a Hash or Tree based collection since they organize data in a way that make it very fast to retrieve. TreeSet, TreeMap, HashSet, HashMap, etc. Hashes index data on a hashed key, Trees are similar but also store their data in a sorted order.
