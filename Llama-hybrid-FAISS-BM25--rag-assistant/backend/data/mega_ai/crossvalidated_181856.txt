As suggested by context in this BURLAP tutorial , it is a planning algorithm. (BURLAP is a library for reinforcement learning.) However, to give a better sense of how to use the more fundamental parts of a planning algorithm in BURLAP, we will instead write our VI algorithm from scratch without using the DynamicProgramming class. To make the distinction clear, contrast this with Q-learning , a learning algorithm in which an agent acts on the basis of a current, possibly assumed $Q$ function, and then updates this function using value iteration after observing a reward.
