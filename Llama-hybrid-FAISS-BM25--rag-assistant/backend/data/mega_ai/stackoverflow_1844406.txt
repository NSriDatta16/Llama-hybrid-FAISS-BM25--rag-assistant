Best way to trace a letter on iPhone

Want to create an app where a child would trace a letter with their finger as they learn to write the letter. I would show a letter on the screen say "b" and at the top of the "b" there would be a small arrow which the child drags top to bottom and along the curve on the right. As the tracing occurs, the color of the letter changes from blue to yellow for example. The question is this: Is it possible to draw a letter on the screen and get the boundaries of the letter?
