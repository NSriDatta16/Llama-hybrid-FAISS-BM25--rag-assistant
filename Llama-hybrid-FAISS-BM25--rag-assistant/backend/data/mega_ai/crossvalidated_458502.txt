Great question; I've often wondered about that. A somewhat related idea is explained in our paper Dynamical attraction to stable processes, Ann. Inst. H. Poincar√© Probab. Statist. Volume 48, Number 2, 2012, pp 551-578 (Albert Fisher and Marina Talet) see https://www.ime.usp.br/~afisher/ The idea is to turn Levy's probability notion of "domain of attraction" for stable processes (including Gaussian) into actual dynamics. We do this for the full stable process, rather than just for the stable distribution, because there the scaling property of these self-similar processes has a dynamical interpretation: it's a Bernoulli flow of infinite entropy. Then a random walk with increments in the domain of attraction converges to this in the sense that a walk path is a.s. a generic point for this flow. We don't use a contraction mapping per se but it is an interesting question to see if something like that might be useful. (Our theorem proves an a.s.i.p. in log density; the regularly varying case is especially tricky and there we have to apply an appropriate time change). See also the related papers on the above web page. The advantage of working with processes is that one has an actual flow. For the Gaussian distribution, this is not only a fixed point for the Fourier Transform, but for the convolution operator (suitably rescaled). The first is intriguing but there's no way that iteration helps, because it's an involution: applying it twice brings you back. The convolution really makes sense as that's just the distribution of a random walk. However, it's a semigroup action which is less sweet from the dynamical point of view than a flow.
