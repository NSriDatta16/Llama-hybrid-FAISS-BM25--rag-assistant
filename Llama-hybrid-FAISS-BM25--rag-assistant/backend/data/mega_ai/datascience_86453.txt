Purpose of PCA is to find directions that maximizes the variance. If variance of one variable is higher than others we make the pca components biased in that direction. So, best thing to do is make the variance of all variables the same. One way of doing this is by standardizing all the variables. Normalization does not make all variables to have the same variance.
