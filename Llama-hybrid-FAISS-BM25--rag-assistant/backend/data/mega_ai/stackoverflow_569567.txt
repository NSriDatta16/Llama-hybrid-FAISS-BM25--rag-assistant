You can't. And as most people here I'd tell you to not do it even if you could... However, I could imagine something like this for very specific cases like the page of some artist, or for a game cursor, or a sort of 3D-like map with the cursor pointing down. Now if you really need a special cursor for a media oriented site, as opposed to an information site, I'd hide the cursor, with a blank cursor file and use some Javascript to attach a floating image over the cursor so it "looks like" the hot spot is someplace else. Of course your sites usability and compatibility will go way down, but the solution above is if you really need to take the creative liberty, and your users are open minded to this sort of stuff.
