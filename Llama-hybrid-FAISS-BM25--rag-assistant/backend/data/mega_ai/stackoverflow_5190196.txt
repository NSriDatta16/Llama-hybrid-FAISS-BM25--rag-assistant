How to pass credentials to httpwebrequest for accessing SharePoint Library

I'm trying to read files from a SharePoint document library using HttpWebRequest . In order to do that I have to pass some credentials. I'm using the below request: HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url); request.Method = "GET"; request.ContentType = "application/msexcel"; request.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+5.01;+Windows+NT+5.0"; request.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(UserName, PassWord); Is this the correct way to pass credentials?
