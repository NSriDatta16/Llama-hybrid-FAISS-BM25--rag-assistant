How can I efficiently find the most important subset of a machine learning training set and rank the set elements by importance

Suppose I cluster a set of records. I now wish to know which records in the set would maximise the disruption to the clusters if they were removed and the data reclustered. I also require the same with decision trees. If I build a decision tree from a set of records, how can I establish the records to leave out to maximise the change in prediction over the entire set. Obviously I want to minimise the number of records removed in both cases. So removing all the records is not a valid solution.
