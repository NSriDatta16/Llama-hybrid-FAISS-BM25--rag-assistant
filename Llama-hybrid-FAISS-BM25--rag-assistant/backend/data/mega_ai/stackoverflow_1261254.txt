Something you can consider is an object counter. This way you don't need to change every place you allocate but just implementation definition. It's an alternative to the factory solution. Consider pros/cons. An elegant way to do that is to use the CRTP : Curiously recurring template pattern . The main example is such a counter :) This way you just have to add in your concrete class implementation : class X; // your interface class MyConcreteX : public counter { // whatever }; Of course, it is not applicable if you use external implementations you do not master. EDIT: To handle the exact problem you need to have a counter that count only the first instance. my 2 cents
