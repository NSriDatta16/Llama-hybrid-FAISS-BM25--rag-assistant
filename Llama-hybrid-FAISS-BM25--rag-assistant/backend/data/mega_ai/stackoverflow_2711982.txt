You're using "new", but feld isn't an array of pointers, it's an array of objects. Two choices - Make it an array of pointers. feld * spielfeld[10][10] Beware that if you do this, you've now got to worry about deleting the objects which are created by 'new'. Or, leave it as an array of objects (no wories about 'delete#) and initialize them differently. spielfeld[i][n] = feld(land, i, n); // uses assignment operator This isn't the most efficient or elegant way as intermediate feld items get constructed and deleted, but it should work. Depending on what values feld contains you might need to write an assignment operator....
