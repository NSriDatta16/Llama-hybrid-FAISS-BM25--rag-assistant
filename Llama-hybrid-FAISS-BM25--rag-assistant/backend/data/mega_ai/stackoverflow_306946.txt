How, where to store objects within different scopes in Asp.net 2.0

need ask you about some help. I have web app running in Net 2.0. I wanna ask what storage (cache, session, file) I should use for my objects as they have different scope of using. Can be divide into several groups: 1) objects related directly to visitor (e.g. details about visitor that are received after authentication) 2) objects that are used for every visitor, so its scope of application (some init data, common data) Most of these objects get data from web service, which is expensive. So what's my best choices considering speed, memory, accessibility and what else I should look out. Any help most welcome. Thanks, X.
