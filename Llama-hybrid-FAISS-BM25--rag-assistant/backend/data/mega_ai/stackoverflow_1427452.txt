TeamCity is a very good CI server. (and the "Professional" edition is free) I've been using it for over a year for building .NET projects, and I must say it's way better than CC.NET IMHO. Strong points are: Very easy to configure (web based GUI) Distributed system (you can have several build agents on multiple machines to distribute the build process) Built-in support for many source control systems ... check the website. The product is awesome ...
