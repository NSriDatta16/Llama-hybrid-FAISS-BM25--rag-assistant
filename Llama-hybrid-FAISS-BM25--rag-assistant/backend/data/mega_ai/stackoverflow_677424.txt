Add and remove the UserControl dynamically

I have UserControl that holds Infragistics Graph control. On the TreeView sub node's right click, I have context menu as "Create Graph". This will create the new graph. This is about what i going to do. I have confusion about what layout to use. Whether FlowLayoutPanel or TableLayoutPanel or anything else. If only one graph is add --> graph has to occupy the full form. If two graph are added --> two graph's has to split the space and so on.This is only in the format of one after another. ie First graph at top, second is below to first ..so on. If UserControl is manually changed it should not affect the size where we displaying. This is the WinForm. Currently i using FlowLayoutPanel, i creating panel with the constant size and added the UserControl with DockStyle.Fill. Then i added the Panel to the FlowLayoutPanel. GraphUserControl usr = new GraphUserControl(); usr.Dock = DockStyle.Fill; Panel pnl = new Panel(); pnl.Controls.Add(usr); flowLayoutpnl.Controls.Add(pnl); What is the best approach to do this?.
