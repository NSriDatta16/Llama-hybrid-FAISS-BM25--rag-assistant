le locations, CAIR has created an AI-based Air Defense Control and Reporting System. To guarantee smooth data exchange between field units and command centers, XXXIII Corps tested AI-enabled sensors with secure communication networks during Exercise Divya Drishti in July 2025. A sensor-to-shooter link was successfully established by the Indian Army, allowing for a quicker and more efficient reaction time. On September 10, 2025, the Indian Army received a patent for its AI-powered Automatic Target Classifying System. Using real-time data, such as images or radar signals, it can automatically recognize and categorize targets on radar by comparing them to a database of recorded data. It is useful for guiding missiles. Space MOI-TD, India's first AI lab in space, is being built by TakeMe2Space. AI's potential utility in space will be demonstrated with the MOI-TD mission. In order to foresee natural disasters and comprehend climate change, the MOI-TD will assist with environmental monitoring, weather pattern analysis, and Earth's surface change tracking. The lab will process the data in real time, allowing for analysis of the information at the time of collection. The MOI-TD mission showed that it was possible to run external code on the satellite, securely downlink encrypted data, and uplink huge AI models from a ground station through OrbitLab, a web-based console. It effectively validated key subsystems, including computer infrastructure (Zero Cube AI Accelerator, POEM Adapter Board), actuators (MagnetoTorquers, AirTorquers, Reaction Wheel), and sensors (Sun Sensor, Horizon Sensor, Solar Cell, IMUs). The foundation for space-based computing is laid by MOI-TD. The creation of space-based data centers will be facilitated by the upcoming MOI-1 AI Lab mission. Support for the project came from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center. One study by the University of Southampton on TakeMe2Space's AI lab used a low-power AI system to lessen motion blur in satellite imagery. Healthcare During the COVID-19 pandemic, Qure.ai's AI chest X-ray reporting tool, qXR, was used to identify patients for high, medium, or low risk so that RT-PCR testing could be performed. It can identify pulmonary consolidation, ground-glass opacity, and other signs of COVID-19. The tool provides measurements like the proportion of lung size and volume impacted by the anomalies. The Computational and Data Sciences Collaborative Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence in Medical and Healthcare Imaging was established by Wipro GE HealthCare at IISc in September 2020. Its goal is to develop advanced diagnostic and medical image-reconstruction techniques and protocols for quicker and better imaging by utilizing deep learning, AI, and future-ready digital interfaces. With an emphasis on neurological disease diagnosis and population-level clinical impact analysis, Siemens Healthineers established the Computational Data Sciences Collaborative Laboratory for AI in Precision Medicine at IISc in 2024 to create open-source AI tools to automate the segmentation of pathological findings in neuroimaging data. As part of the Interdisciplinary Group for Advanced Research on Birth Outcomes â€“ DBT India Initiative (GARBH-Ini) program, IIT Madras and Translational Health Science and Technology Institute in 2024 created India's first AI model, Garbhini-GA2, which will accurately estimate the age of the fetus in pregnant women in the second and third trimesters. In contrast to the current methods of determining a fetus's age in India, which use the Hadlock model developed using pregnancy data from Western countries or the more recent INTERGROWTH-21st model, the Garbhini-GA2, which is specific to the Indian population, uses genetic algorithm-based methods for estimating gestational age. This model reduces the error by nearly three times. The study was carried out in collaboration with Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences, Christian Medical College Vellore, Safdarj
