Ideally you should not store documents in the database, instead store the path to the document in the database, which then points to the physical document on the web server itself (or some other storage, CDN, etc). However, if you must store it in SQL Server (and seeing as though your on SQL 2008), you should be using FILESTREAM . And it is supported by EF4 (i believe). It maps to binary . As i said though, i'm not sure how well this will perform, run some benchmarks - and if it's not performing too well, try using regular ADO.NET/FileStream API. I still think you should put it on the file system, not in the database (my opinion of course)
