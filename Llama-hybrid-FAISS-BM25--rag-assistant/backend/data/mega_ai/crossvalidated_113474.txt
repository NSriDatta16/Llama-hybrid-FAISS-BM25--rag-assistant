Determining Relative Weights

I am looking for some recommendations and more specifics about how to do the following: Objective: To determine the weights of a number of stock valuation metrics. I am looking at doing this across 10 different industry sectors as I expect that each sector will merit a different weighting scheme. The data I have are: Monthly average metrics for each sector over approximately 20 years. I also have return data for each sector on a monthly basis. I am looking to do this in R Studio. Thank you for your help on this.
