As far as programming solutions go, you'd need OpenSSL or GNU TLS . Out of those two the latter is a lot more cleanly written (OpenSSL has many pitfalls). For a really elegant solution one would use OpenSSL via boost::asio , but that solution is probably suitable only if you're starting a new project. In terms of user-space solutions, if you could set up both programs to run as a specified user, you could probably setup an SSL tunnel for them, but that highly depends on how you want connections to be established.
