The lag $0$ autocorrelation ( $cor(Y_t, Y_t)$ ) will always be $1$ ( $Y_t$ is perfectly correlated with itself) and then lag $1$ autocorrelation $cor(Y_t, Y_{t-1})$ will in general be non-zero but potentially quite small. In your plot the lag $1$ autocorrelation appears to be non-significant which does indeed suggest that $Y_{t-1}$ is not useful for predicting $Y_{t}$ . Another way to verify this is to plot $Y_t$ against $Y_{t-1}$ . Any clear relationship between the two suggests that $Y_{t-1}$ is useful in predicting $Y_{t}$ . It would also be useful to see the raw time series so other stackexchange users can see use their experiences to help out
