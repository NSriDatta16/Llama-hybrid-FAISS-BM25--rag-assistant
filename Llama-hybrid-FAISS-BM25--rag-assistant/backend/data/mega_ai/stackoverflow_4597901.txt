Presumably the deferred allocation of backing for the addresses is the goal, rather than necessarily specifically committing on first use? If so, it looks as if Windows will do that for you automatically! http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366803(v=vs.85).aspx Relevant-looking quotation: As an alternative to dynamic allocation, the process can simply commit the entire region instead of only reserving it. Both methods result in the same physical memory usage because committed pages do not consume any physical storage until they are first accessed. As for new pages being reset to zero, I believe this is a security feature and can't be avoided. (The system has a special thread that zeros pages when there is some dead time, so with any luck there will always be a zeroed page immediately ready for use when necessary.)
