It isn't! I'm no expert here, but i'll give my two cents. In general when you have a hierarchical model, say $y|\Theta_{1} \sim \text{N}(X\Theta_{1},\sigma^2)$ $\Theta_{1}|\Theta_{2} \sim\text{N}(W\Theta_{2},\sigma^2)$ We make conditional independence assumptions, i.e., conditional on $\Theta_{2}$, the $\Theta_{1}$ are exchangeable. If the second level is not exchangeable, than you can incluce another level that makes it exchangeable. But even in the case that you can't make an assumption of exchaganbelity, the model may still be a good fit to your data at the first level. Last, but not least, exchangeability is important only if you wanna think in terms of De Finetti's representation theorem. You might just think that priors are regularization tools that help you to fit your model. In this case, the exchangeability assumption is as good as it is your model fit to the data. In other words, if you think of Bayesian hierarchical model as way to get abetter fit to your data, then exchangeability is not essential in any sense.
