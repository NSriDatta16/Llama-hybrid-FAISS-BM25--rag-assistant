You are on the right track with calculating the distances to the group centers. In general, you are looking for a multivariate version of the test for the homogenity of variance (with $H_0$: "Variances are equal across the two groups", which would allow you to reject that the variances are equal). Since you haven't mentioned any assumptions you are allowed to make (like the normality assumption) I will assume the two distributions aren't normal. The vegan package in R has a function betadispers , which as far as I understand should be exactly what you are looking for, a multivariate version of the Levene's test. The procedure behind the test was developed by M.J. Anderson and is described here . Last detail, you will have to calculate the distance of your gene observations that are stored as matrices. So you will have to concatenate both of them into two vectors of length (2e7 = 500x40000). Which makes me wonder, is there any particular reason why they were stored as matrices in the first place? Is there perhaps some spatial structure that would get lost during concatenation, which would be potentially important for the variance comparison? If the structure isn't a problem concatenate ahead!
