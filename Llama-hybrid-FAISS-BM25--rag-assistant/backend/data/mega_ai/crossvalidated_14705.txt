How to forecast CPU demand from a time series?

I have some real data from the past. The data show application demand (for example cpu demand) at a certain time slot. The data looks like this for example: 3,2,1,5,7,8,9,1,3,12,4,5 These 12 values show the application demand of cpu in first 12 hours of a day respectively: 3 was the demand between 00:00 and 01:00m, 2 the demand between 01:00 - 02:00 etc... So what I have is a bunch of values and what I would like to do with this is a forecasting or estimation of application demand in the future. Say I have 120 values showing the demand of 10 days of 12 hours each. Based on these data, I want to estimate with which probability the demand values will be more or less than the previous ones. How can I achieve this with R? I think this question is not directly related to R, but thought there are people with great knowledge in general who can give me some concrete ideas. Thanks for your precious time!
