When do we use an even size kernel in convolutional neural network and why?

Recently, I've been seeing more and more code/paper using even size kernels in ConvNets, which is quite counter-intuitive to me. I wish someone could shed some light on the reasoning behind it: When is an even-size kernel preferred, and why? How does an even-size kernel is placed on an image since it doesn't have a specific center point as an odd-size kernel? An example of even-size kernels applied to ConvNet: https://github.com/rtqichen/beta-tcvae Thanks in advance.
