To do a query to the database table you don't need to write string commands and call the ExecuteQuery method - it is only for specific database tasks that you can't do with LINQ. What you can do with LINQ is write queries like: var query = from c in db.myTable where c.Id > 5 select c; foreach ( var c in query ) Console.WriteLine( c ); This code take all entities from myTable that have the Id greater than 5 ( SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE Id > 5 in SQL ) and write them all to the console. But to make it work you need to create right DataContext for your database. The simpliest way to do it in Visual Studio is to Add New Item... -> LINQ to SQL Classes . Then you need to connect to your database in Server Explorer , expand Tables and drag needed tables to designer window. Visual Studio automatically generates new class derived from DataContext that usefull for you database (for example has properties like myTable ). MSDN page for LINQ to SQL
