IE7 does it well but IE8 does not load the javascript gallery script - whats wrong?

I have a javascript galleria which does work in every modern browser, even in IE7. But in IE8 if its load.. it does not show the gallery.. BUT if I press Ctrl + F5 it does a hard reload, it erase the cache and finally the galleria appears.. If I just reload the page.. or if I go to another page with the same galleria script, the problem comes again.. so I need a hard reload script for IE8. Pseudo Code: On Document Load If user agent IE8 { erase website cache } do normally continue webpage loading..
