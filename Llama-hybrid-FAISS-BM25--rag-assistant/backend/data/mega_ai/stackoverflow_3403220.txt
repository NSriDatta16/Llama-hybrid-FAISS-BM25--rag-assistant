The first three lines of your first code sample are called XML processing instructions (PI). So if you are creating your output XML with XmlDocument , you can use XmlDocument.CreateProcessingInstruction method to add the required PI. If you are serializing into XML, you can also use XmlTextWriter.WriteProcessingInstruction just before serializing the object. If for some reasons, you cannot do that, you can also save the file, open it and insert two PI after the first line break, but I highly discourage you to do that, since it will make your code difficult to maintain in future, and slow things down.
