It's not clear exactly what you're asking for help with. But let's start with this: Start Visual Studio 2008. Select New Project->Visual C#->Windows->Empty Project. Right click on the project in Solution Explorer->Add New Item->Visual C# Items->Data->LINQ to SQL classes. Double click the newly added dbml file to open it in the main window. View->Server Explorer->Right click Data Connections->Add Connection. Key in the connection parameters to your database. In Server Explorer expand the server you just added->expand tables->left click and drag one of your database tables to the main window (the designer surface). Presto, you have now created your first LINQ to SQL-enalbed DataContext .
