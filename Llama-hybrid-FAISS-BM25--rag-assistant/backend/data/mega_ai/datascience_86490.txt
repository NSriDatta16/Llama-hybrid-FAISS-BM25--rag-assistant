Just to complement the available answer, a recent trend in time series forecasting is what is called Global forecasting. Here a global model is build through all the products but predicts each one separately (different than the multi-output forecasting model). The goal is to use available data from similar products to infer predictions in cases where data is scarce. You can also pre-process your data by clustering the products.
