Reference case-control sampling

I have to use a case-control sampling design to apply logistic regression. I'm looking for a reference that explains which are the advantages and disadvantages of using a high case-control ratio rather than a lower case-control ratio. I need it to justify the choice to make since I read here in a discussion that does not exist an optimal case-control ratio. Could someone suggest a clear and detailed reference?
