For any computer vision task a convolutional neural network (even a simple one) will beat any kind of SVM. This already happened in 2012 when a ConvNet cut the error rate of previous state of the art in half (see papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-w ). Furthermore, there's many efficient implementations of ConvNets. Perhaps github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks can serve as an overview. There's also lots of implementations focused on efficient usage on mobile phones.
