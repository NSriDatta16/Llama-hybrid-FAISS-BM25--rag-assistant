I think the legacy angle can be a big one for the following reason. An organisation hires a person, call them person X. They are a computing guru/wizard/etc. They build awesome SAS programs/tools/etc. They are so good that other people in the organisation don't feel like they need to understand how the programs work. They make it so easy to just push a button, and everything just works (the magic black boxes). Person X leaves the organisation. Unfortunately, the knowledge that person X has leaves the organisation (documentation and knowledge management was not prioritised, working programs was instead). They are replaced by person Y. Person Y is great with R but has no idea about SAS, and hence has no idea about how the SAS programs actually work. There is a huge learning curve to even figure out what needs to be translated into R. For example, person Y can not tell if a data transformation has been done to enable a proc to be called, or for merging with other data, etc. The transformations needed are probably different in R, because the functions are different, and the defaults are different (e.g. treatment of categorical variables in proc glm vs the lm()) So, you are now faced with a unequal cost trade off. Say the cost of re-writing / translating from SAS to R is $C_T$ . We then need the (small?) efficiency gain from moving to R (I say small based on my experience with optimising SAS code and optimising R code for logistic regression predictions). This also needs to be compared to the license costs for SAS. It is likely that $C_T$ is significantly higher than a single year license for SAS. I expect that SAS would be doing some analysis of this trade off, and letting this influence how it sets the licence fee (well, I would if I worked at SAS). Also notice how SAS plotting procedures are way better than a decade or so ago (eg proc sgplot vs proc plot). coincidence that R did good plotting first? I think not! This effectively reduces the efficiency from switching because plotting is not so different anymore - R is still better, but not by enough to switch...
