Conditional random forest :: saving models efficiently

I'm working on a regression problem involving multiple independent learning tasks. I'm using conditional random forest as the learner (see Hothorn et al. 2006) as they are quite robust. The problem I'm having is saving the models. Multiple learning tasks means many big models. How can I save a subset of each model without taking too much disk/memory space without compromising the usability of my models for predictions?
