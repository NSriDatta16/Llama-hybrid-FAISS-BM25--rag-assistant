First, please use the File constructor that takes a File for your directory and a String for your desired subdirectory. Beyond that, most likely you are attempting to create a directory where you are not allowed, either because: currentDirectory does not exist, or currentDirectory points to a place on the on-board flash storage where you are not allowed to write, or currentDirectory points to a place on the external storage and you lack the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission
