Rather than trying to modify the top element, why not keep that one just in an int variable. When you see an opening brace, push your "count so far" onto the stack, and set the count to 0. When you see a letter, increment your "count so far" When you see a closing brace, do whatever you need to with the count, and pop the stack to get the new "count so far" value EDIT: If you wanted to keep all the state in the stack itself, you can always think of the top element as a variable, which is changed by performing pop-increment-push. At that point, the operations are: Opening brace: push 0 Letter: pop-increment-push CLosing brace: pop, use value however you want to before it vanishes forever This is likely to be very slightly less efficient, but I think it's actually more elegant.
