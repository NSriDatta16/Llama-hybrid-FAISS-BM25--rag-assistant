Let's say the name was used in a variable, $Name . You then run this query: INSERT INTO Students VALUES ( '$Name' ) The code is mistakenly placing anything the user supplied as the variable. You wanted the SQL to be: INSERT INTO Students VALUES ( ' Robert Tables ` ) But a clever user can supply whatever they want: INSERT INTO Students VALUES ( ' Robert'); DROP TABLE Students; -- ' ) What you get is: INSERT INTO Students VALUES ( 'Robert' ); DROP TABLE STUDENTS; --' ) The -- only comments the remainder of the line.
