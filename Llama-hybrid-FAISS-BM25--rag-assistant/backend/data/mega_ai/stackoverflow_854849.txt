EvanK's suggestion of working with a CSS framework is a great idea, and personally I would recommend Compass , which to my mind really represents a new way to think about CSS and is generally very elegant. Blueprint has been mentioned by a number of other posters. Compass actually uses Blueprint (or another framework of your choice) and abstracts it even further allowing you to dynamically generate new grid templates. Essentially it gives you a more programmatic framework for working with Blueprint and SASS . Before you look into a framework however, getting your head around some fundamentals is essential. W3Schools is a good place to start, followed by some good design blogs like A List Apart . In terms of minimising cross browser problems a CSS reset is essential, which is the approach Yahoo takes.
