You can't rely on for (v in someObject) ... to return things in a predictable order, no. Depending on your specific situation, you could just use an array to hold the keys, and just iterate through that: private var keys:Array = ["Type", "Kind", "Stone", "Stone Color", "Metal", "Brand"]; private function iterate():void { for each (var k:String in keys) { trace(_propsList[k]); } } Maybe a bit obvious or non-elegant, but it'd get the job done. :)
