Darknet is mainly for Object Detection, and have different architecture, features than other deep learning frameworks. It is faster than many other NN architectures and approaches like FasterRCNN etc. You have to be in C if you need speed, and most of the deep nn frameworks are written in c. I would say Tensorflow has a broader scope, but Darknet architecture & YOLO is a specialized framework, and they are on top of their game in speed and accuracy. YOLO can run on CPU but you get 500 times more speed on GPU as it leverages CUDA and cuDNN.
