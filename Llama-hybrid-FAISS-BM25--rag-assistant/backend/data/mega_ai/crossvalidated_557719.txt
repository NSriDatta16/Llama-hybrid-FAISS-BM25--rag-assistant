I don't know which package the influence function is from, however if it's intended use is for linear regression then it is not suitable for logistic regression. Given that you mention influence points and leverage I assume your goal is to find "outliers" in your predictors (X) and not necessarily your Y. "Outliers" in your Y can be identified by looking at the residuals plot, however identifying "outliers" in X is a little more complicated, especially if you have high-dimensional data. Note: I use the term "outlier" to refer to unusual (or as I've recently begun to call them, extreme) values either in your Y variable or your X variables, as I see no distinction between the two. For ex. Wikipedia defines an outlier as a data point that differs significantly from other observations . Anyway, for logistic regression there exists Pregibon leverage, which can be used to detect outliers in your predictors (in a similar fashion to linear regression), while you can use Pearson and/or deviance residuals to check for Y outliers. See also: Using the Hat Matrix to detect influential observations in logistic regression Information out of the hat matrix for logistic regression How to calculate the hat matrix for logistic regression in R? Edit: I've tried to answer your question on how to detect "outliers", and not how to remove them, as you should probably not do that.
