GWT compiles Java to JavaScript. It optimizes using techniques similar to a C++ compiler, so performance of applications will be comparable to native JavaScript applications. It does encourage the generation of large programs because it makes including new code simpler for Java developers. I would be interested to see benchmarks comparing GWT performance with native JavaScript performance, but my view is that GWT compiled apps run at an adequate speed on the Android browser.
