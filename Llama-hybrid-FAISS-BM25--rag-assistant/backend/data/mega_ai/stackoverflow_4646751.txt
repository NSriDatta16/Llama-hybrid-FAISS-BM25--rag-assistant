Multi Drag Drop in WPF -- Example/Sample/Tutorial?

I am looking for an example or any ready made solution which I can integrate in my existing application and use the multi drag and drop functionality. Most of the solutions I found on internet doesn't work well when it comes to dragging and dropping of multiple items from a control like ListBox to another ListBox. Can anyone point me to a solution? I am using WPF - C# - MVVM Thanks,
