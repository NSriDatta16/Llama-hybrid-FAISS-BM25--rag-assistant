There are a ton of answers and suggestions here but I honestly don't see any of them "prettier" or "more elegant" than the original method. If you had dozens or HUNDREDS of iterations to check then I could easily see going to some for loop but honestly, for the handful of comparisons you had, stick with the if's and move on. It's not that ugly.
