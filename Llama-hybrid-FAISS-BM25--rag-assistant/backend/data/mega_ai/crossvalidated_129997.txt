Dimensionality reduction when number of samples is much larger than number of features

I was wondering what happens when the number of samples is much larger (e.g. $\times 200\:000$ times more) than the number of features? Is there any recommended way of reducing the samples' dimensionality? If the number of features is much more than the samples, this is known as the curse of dimensionality, we use PCA or any other form of dimensionality reduction to improve the results. What happens when we have the opposite situation?
