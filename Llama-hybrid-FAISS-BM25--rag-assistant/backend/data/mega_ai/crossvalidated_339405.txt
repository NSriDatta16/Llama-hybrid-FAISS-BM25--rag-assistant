"This test has a probability of 0.5 for a false negative and 0.5 for a false positive." No it does not; that would add up to 100% false, which would be an AUC of zero. This paragraph is so misleading that it likely has provided a reason for closing the question. "2) That the AUC-value corresponds to the probability of correctly classifying two randomly individuals, one from each group (e.g. a person who has the disease a person who does not have the disease). For the matter of this post, the explanation that the value corresponds to the probability of assigning a higher test score to an ex-ante determined group, say the one with a positive outcome than to other, is identical in this regard." This should read "When using normalized units, the area under the curve (often referred to as simply the AUC) is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one (assuming 'positive' ranks higher than 'negative')." EDIT following OP edit I think I know what the conceptual problem is. False positives ($FP$) are not the false positive rate. The false positive rate is ${\frac {FP}{N}}={\frac {FP}{FP+TN}}$. Let me speak here of outcomes. The false positive fraction of outcomes is $\frac{FP}{total\; outcomes}$. For an unbiased coin, when we guess all heads and 50% of the total outcomes are false positives, that is a 100% false positive rate. The inversion of 0.5 for a false negative fraction and 0.5 for a false positive fraction is 50% true positives and 50% true negatives, which, counting heads, and unless you have trouble adjudicating a coin toss while you are looking straight at it, is what you would expect for absolute certainty for 100% of the tosses. What the $x=y$ line represents is, for example, being blindfolded and guessing what the coin toss outcomes are. So if half the time, you guess heads and half the time you guess tails, and you are right half the time in which case $\frac{1}{4}$ are true positives, $\frac{1}{4}$ are true negatives, $\frac{1}{4}$ are false positives, and $\frac{1}{4}$ are false negatives. Now if you jigger this and guess more heads than tails, your false positives increase, e.g. to $\frac{1}{3}$, false negatives decrease, e.g., to $\frac{1}{6}$, true positives increase and true negatives decrease, but you are still only right at $\frac{1}{2}$ true or false, i.e., $\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}$. In this way, if you guessed heads all the time, you would have no false negatives and 50% false positives. So, by varying the percentage of guesses that are heads you could plot out the entire ROC $y=x$ curve, with an AUC of 50%, and THAT is what it means. Note that an AUC of 50% is an exactly useless test, and irredeemably so. One would be better off misunderstanding a test to obtain an AUC of $\frac{1}{3}$, because then, as here, all one has to do is flip the understanding $180^{\circ}$ to obtain an AUC of $\frac{2}{3}$, i.e., useful knowledge.
