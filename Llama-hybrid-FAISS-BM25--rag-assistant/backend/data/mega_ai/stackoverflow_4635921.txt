embdedding flv and xml

i am working on a project where i am trying to embed a flv file and it's corresponding xml file(this has some info regarding the flv movie). I would like to know if there is any player that i can use to embed this with xml. I will be creating a page and that will list all these videos like 1) video1 dec 25 2010 2) video 2 jan 1st 2011 clicking on the "video1" should either open a new page and play the video there and show the xml file contents too. Or like how 5min.com plays the video just in the popup...can any one please let me know if there is any tutorial on embedding these flv's? flash is new to me but i can do php part of it. thanks
