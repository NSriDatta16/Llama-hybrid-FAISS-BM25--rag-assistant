Access the database as few times as possible. If you end up discarding data retrieved from the database, your query needs to be reworked and made more specific. The script is responsible for manipulating the data, unless an index exists that makes it easier for the database. The database should be able to exist without a script. Cron jobs are nice, but a database should be able to survive if a script doesn't execute at a specific time. Never put a query in a loop. There is always a way to produce the same result in one query (aka join). The database just exists to hold and retrieve raw data as fast as possible. Leave any formatting or math for the script. To conclude, stress the database as few times as possible. Use as few queries as possible related only to data insertion and retrieval. Make the script carry more of the load, and make sure that the database isn't the first to go down.
