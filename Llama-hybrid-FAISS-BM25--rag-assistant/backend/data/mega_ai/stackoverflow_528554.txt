Summarizing lets look at the options under consideration for storing product information: 1) some xml format in the database 2) similar to the post above about having x number of type defined columns (sharepoint approach) 3) via generic table with name and type definitions stored in lookup table and values in secondary table with columns id, propertyid, value (similar to #2 however this approach would provide unlimited property information 4) some hybrid of the above option where product table would have x common columns (for storage of properties common with all products) with y user defined columns (this could be m of integer type and n of varchar types). This may be taking the best of #2 and a normalzied structure as if you knew all the properties of all products. You would be getting the best sql performance for the properties that you use the most (probably those that are common across all products) while still allowing custom columns for specific properties with each product. Are there other options? In my opinion I would consider 4 above as the best hybrid of the combinations. dave
