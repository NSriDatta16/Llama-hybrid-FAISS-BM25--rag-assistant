How to combine multiple php/mysql database connections?

When building dynamic websites I use a php include to make my connections to the database. The included file is very basic: mysql_connect($hostname = 'host', $username = 'user', $password = 'password'); mysql_select_db('database'); This works fine. In some places I use an AJAX system to create drag-and-drop reordering of database records which updates the database at the same time, it is adapted from something I found on the internet. This uses its own connection code: class SortableExample { protected $conn; protected $user = 'user'; protected $pass = 'password'; protected $dbname = 'database'; protected $host = 'host'; public function __construct() { $this->conn = mysql_connect($this->host, $this->user, $this->pass); mysql_select_db($this->dbname,$this->conn); } This also woks fine. What it means, however, is that I have to add the username, password, host and database to two separate files. Sometimes the second one is forgotten and causes the website to fail. My question is, how can I either combine both connection files into one, OR how can I get the second block of code to accept external variables so that I only have to enter the actual values in one place?
