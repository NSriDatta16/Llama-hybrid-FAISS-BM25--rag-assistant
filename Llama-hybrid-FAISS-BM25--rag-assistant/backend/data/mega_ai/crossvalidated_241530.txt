After the network is trained, we can throw away the loss layer. Actually the facenet (and many other networks for facial recognition) is trained for extracting features, that is to represent the image by a fixed length vector (embedding). The triplet loss basically says, the distance between feature vectors of the same person should be small, and the distance between different persons should be large. After training, for each given image, we take the output of the second last layer as its feature vector . Thereafter we can do verification (to tell whether two images are of the same person) or clustering based on the features and some distance function (e.g. Euclidean distance).
