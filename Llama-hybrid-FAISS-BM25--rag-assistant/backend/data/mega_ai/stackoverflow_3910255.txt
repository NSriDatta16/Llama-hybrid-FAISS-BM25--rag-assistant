Memcache clustering for php sessions?

Here's a little background, currently i have 3 web servers one db server which also host memcache for php sessions for the 3 web servers. I have the php configs on the 3 servers to point to the memcache server for sessions. It was working fine until alot of connections were being produced for reads etc, which then caused connection timeouts. So I'm currently looking at clustering the memcache on each web server for sessions, my only concern is how to go about making sure that memcache on all the servers have the same information for sessions. Someone guided me to http://github.com/trs21219/Memcached-Library because i am using codeigniter but how do i converge my php sessions onto this since memcache seems as a key-value store? Thanks in advance. Has anyone checked out http://repcached.sourceforge.net/ and does it work?
