There's a new plugin called Formidable I use and like better than others I've tried. Its drag-and-drop interface makes it so easy to use that I can let clients set up their own forms. The free version is sufficient for most needs, and if you're willing to upgrade to the paid version ($35 for a single install, $97 for infinite) you get reporting and a number of additional fields.
