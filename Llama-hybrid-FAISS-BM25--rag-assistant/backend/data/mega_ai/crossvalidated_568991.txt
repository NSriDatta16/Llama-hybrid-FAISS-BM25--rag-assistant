Interpreting Scaled Continuous Variables' and Unscaled Dummy Variables' Regression Co-efficient

I have regression coefficients, Logistic Regression to be precise, of 7 continuous and 2 binary (1 or 0) flag variables. The continuous variables are scaled using just the standard deviation of the individual variables to interpret them as the change in the probability of the response variable with 1 std. dev. change from their respective mean. And the coefficient magnitude of these continuous variables will tell which one will have more effect on the response than the other. Now, I'm struggling to bring the unscaled binary flag variables into the mix. How should I be interpreting their coefficients? and How do their coefficients compare with the coefficients of the scaled continuous variables? For instance, let's say that the coefficient of one of the binary flag variables (A) is 1.34 and the coefficient of one of the continuous variables (B) is 0.56. Is it right to interpret that as A is has a bigger impact on the response than B? I'll very much appreciate your take on this. I have come across plenty of questions on scaling and unscaling the dummy variables but nothing on their interpretability.
