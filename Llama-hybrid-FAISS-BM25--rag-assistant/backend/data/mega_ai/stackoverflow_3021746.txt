For VS 2005 (or 2008, for that matter) you can use the free nCover 1.5.8 version to get line coverage information. Apart from that, real coverage tools for .net seem to be premium content (where they haven't been abandoned entirely like Clover.net); only do line coverage using the profiling APIs for pre-.net 4 (nCover free, PartCover); or rely on rewriting the IL with what are in effect trace statements one per code-point.
