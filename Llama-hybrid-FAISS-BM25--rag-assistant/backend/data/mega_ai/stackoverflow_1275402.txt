Scaling on Amazon EC2

I have several newbie questions about EC2, thanks for your attention, 1) why EC2 instances come with specific memory/storage quotas? In the cloud environment, can't we just request the amount of memory/storage as we require, and the amazon infrastructure take care of the allocation? I understand an pre-determined allocation of memory/storage is required to setup a VM image, however, is this indeed necessary ? In Google app engine, I don't see any limit on the memory, and the storage is charged in a pay-as-you-go manner. 2) Related to the first. If amazon allows instances created with a dynamic memory/storage quote, do we still need to create multiple instances and take care of load balancing, e.g. Or, we can just create a powerful instance, and leave other scaling issues to Amazon. 3) The performance of EC2 instance, do you have experience to tell how it compares to a physical machine with similar configuration (memory/CPU)
