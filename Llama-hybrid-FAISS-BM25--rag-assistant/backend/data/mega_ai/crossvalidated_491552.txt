I wouldn’t say it was “derived”, but rather designed . In generalized linear models $$C(Y|X)=E(Y|X)=X\beta$$ $C$ is a link function. For linear regression its inverse, $C^{-1}$ , is an identity function; for logistic regression it’s the logit function . $Y$ is assumed to follow a Bernoulli distinction parametrized by probability of success $p$ , that is also its mean. Since probability is bounded between zero and one, we need to transform it to such a range: logit function is one such transformation, probit is another, and there are some other possible choices. I don’t have the book to hand, but would say it should be $$ E[Y|X] = C^{-1}(X\beta) $$ and $$ C(Y|X) = X\beta $$
