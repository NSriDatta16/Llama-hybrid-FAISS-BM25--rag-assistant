Ordinary Linear Regression with One Independent Variable

I am currently undertaking a project where I aim to explore the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable. I have five questions that are answered on a 5-Point Likert scale by each respondent, representing a specific concept, i.e. $X$ . I also have a corresponding metric for each respondent, which serves as my dependent variable, hypothetically representing an outcome, i.e. $Y$ . Here's what I plan to do with the data: Calculate the average of the four Likert scale responses to create a single composite score for each participant's score for concept $X$ . Perform a simple OLS regression analysis to determine if there is a significant linear relationship between the composite score of $X$ (independent variable) and the outcome $Y$ (dependent variable). Examine the $R^2$ value to assess how much variance in $Y$ is explained by $X$ . Look at the $F$ -statistic and its associated $p$ -value to determine the overall model fit. Does that sound reasonable or is there anything further that I could do?
