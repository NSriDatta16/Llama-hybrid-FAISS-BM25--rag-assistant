Regarding the error messages (I'm assuming these are the messages that show up in LogCat): I've found that analysing the error messages and working your way up the list until you reach code that is yours is the most effective way to work. Frequently (for me at least) the emulator will crash and break somewhere in the OS code (which you probably don't have the source for) but you can follow the LogCat messages back to your code and start to see where the problem is. The crash may appear to happen in the OS code, but the original cause is typically you passing something wrong to the OS. Regarding going backwards in code: nope, at least not with the my Eclipse Ganymede install Regarding skipping code: When your in debug mode under the Run menu you can select "Step Over" (skips going into a method) , "Step Return" to exit a method and "Run to Line" in addition to setting Breakpoints by right clicking. This causes the code to run, but you aren't single stepping through it. Otherwise the only way to "skip" lines of code is to comment it out. I believe you can also change the value of variables in the debugger, but I've never tried personally. This may give you the desired effect.
