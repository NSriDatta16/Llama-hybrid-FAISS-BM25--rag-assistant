It is absolutely not clear, obvious, or agreed-upon what " intelligence " is in humans (or, for that matter, in nonhuman animals). What is clear is that people's performance on a variety of tasks involving mental processes (a very general term) is highly correlated. If you speak five languages, then chances are that your performance on standard matrix tests is also above average. The probably currently best accepted "theory of intelligence" essentially boils down to performing a PCA on the result of multiple tests of mental processes and calling the first principal component the g factor . After you have done this, you start arguing with other psychologists about what precisely you are measuring, whether there truly is an underlying trait "intelligence", and what later principal components are measuring. This construction gets more interesting and relevant as artificial intelligence (or, cough, not ) gets better and better.
