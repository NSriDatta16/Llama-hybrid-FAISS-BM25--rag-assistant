What is the size of udp packets if I send 0 payload data in c#?

I have figured out the maximum data before fragmentation between 2 endpoints using udp is 1472(other endpoints may vary). This states that mtu is 1500bytes and header overhead per packet is 28bytes. Is it safe to assume that if I send 0 bytes data (payload), the actual data being transferred is 28bytes? I am doing some benchmark, so it is crucial for me to know, what happens in the channel.
