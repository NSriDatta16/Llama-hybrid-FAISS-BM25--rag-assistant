If you were before seeing the data interested only in a one-sided alternative like "mean of group B is larger than mean of group A" (for example because the situation is so that there is no good reason why it should be the other way round, or because you were specifically interested in something supposedly good that has been done to group B), you need a one-sided test. If you went into this open minded, thinking that anything may happen, and anything may be of interest, two-sided. I'd say "There's strong evidence in the data that job satisfaction in group B is on average higher than job satisfaction in group A." I wouldn't use "statistically significant" in the wording, because far more wars about the concept (of which there are many) are framed in terms of significance than in terms of strength of evidence. Note that the validity of this relies on model assumptions, random sampling of a sample representative of the population to which you want to generalise, and valid measurement.
