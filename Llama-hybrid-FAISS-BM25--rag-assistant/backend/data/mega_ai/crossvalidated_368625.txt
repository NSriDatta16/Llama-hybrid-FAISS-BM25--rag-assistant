Do the parameters that arise in de Finetti`s representation theorem follow the rules of probability?

I recently stumbled upon de Finetti`s (pretty cool) representation theorem ( What is so cool about de Finetti's representation theorem? ). I wondered whether the RV $\Theta$ that arises in this context follows the rules of the probability calculus. Or framed differently: I am pretty sure that it does and I am looking for a reference where I can look up this topic. An example for what I have in mind: if we have an exchangeable sequence of throws with a die, we can create the following (exchangeble sequences): $$X:=(X_1,X_2, ...): (\Omega,A)\to \in ({\{0,1\}^\infty}, 2^{\{0,1\}^\infty})$$ , where $X_i(\omega)= 1$ if the outcome is even and $X_i(\omega)=0 $ otherwise. Furthermore we could define $$Y:=(Y_1, Y_2, ...): (\Omega,A)\to ({\{0,1\}^\infty}, 2^{\{0,1\}^\infty})$$ where $Y_i(\omega)=1$ if the outcome is 3, and $Y_i(\omega)=0$ otherwise. Now we could form the new sequence: $$Z:=(Z_1, Z_2, ...):=(Y_{\phi(1)}, Y_{\phi(2)}, ...)$$ where $\phi(n)$ indicates whether the $n$ th die-throw was uneven. Now it seems to me that it should hold that $\Theta_Z=\frac{\Theta_Y}{\Theta_X} \quad a.s.$ Now as I already said I am looking for a reference that covers the relationship between this parameter that arises in Bayesian exchangeability modelling and the rules of the probability calculus
