That's an interesting dilemma, binford and I certainly wasn't aware until now that the SPSite object was implicity disposing of any SPWebs tied to it. If what you're saying is so, then the only reason I could think you might still want to explicitly handle the SPWeb might be when the scenario is more complex, for example using two or more SPWebs where the time to construct and destruct them thus becomes a more important consideration. For example, imagine you had 7 SPWeb instantiations inside your SPSite using block, each performing a series of long-running and complex operations before disposing -- you'd want to be closing and disposing of these objects as soon as possible to maximise memory resources and garbage collect efficiently. That said, in the most basic of cases (1 SPSite, 1 SPWeb as you have detailed above), I am beginning to wonder if the SPWeb explicit dispose is at all necessary. More research and opinions needed I think, but thank you for alerting my attention to this.
