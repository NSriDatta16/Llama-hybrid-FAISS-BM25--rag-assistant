with plain POST (no ajax) you need to store the result of your process (image order id retrieval) in an form field: in your function, you can set the value to this field after the orderString is populated: document.getElementsByName('imagesorder')[0].value = orderString; then submit the form, you can do this by replacing your with on the server side you will then get the value in the post collection (I'm not php dev) $_POST['imagesorder']
