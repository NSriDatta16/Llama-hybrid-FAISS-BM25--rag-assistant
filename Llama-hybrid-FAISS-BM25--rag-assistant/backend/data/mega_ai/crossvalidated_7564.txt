Self-organizing maps: fuzzy input?

I would like to know if there are SOM implementations (preferably R) available that accept fuzzy input. That is, I have data in which some nominal features are spread out between a number of categories. For example: feature 1 has 5 categories and an observation might have the values (which are actually probabilities) [0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0].
