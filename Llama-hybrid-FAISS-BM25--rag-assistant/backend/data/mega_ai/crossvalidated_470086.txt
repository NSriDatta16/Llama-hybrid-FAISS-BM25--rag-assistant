Poisson regression model in R

I am working on a uni assessment with COVID-19 topic and trying to work out a poisson regression for COVID 19 pandemic. My predictor is the number of confimred cases as count, my predictors in the poisson regression is outbreak_days, apple_drivingmobility, country. Then model comes with a gigantic AIC and also deviance. Is that because my confimred cases are culmulatives which wont follow poisson distribution? instead, should I use new cases each day? Or this is entirely not suitable to use poisson. glm(formula = confirmed_deaths ~ outbreak_days + Apple_DrivingMobility + country, family = poisson(link = log), data = df_cleaned_driving_level) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -131.981 -9.773 -0.863 3.798 87.411 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.726e+00 1.795e-02 96.183
