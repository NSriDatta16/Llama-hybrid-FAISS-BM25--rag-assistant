If you call reloadData on a UITableview object and you're it's dataSource then this method should be called called. Are you sure that you have assigned your table view to your property (i.e. dragged it across in interface builder?) I suspect that you have only made your controller the dataSource of your table view (hence the first time it loads it gets the value). After that your calls to reloadData won't work because the property in your view controller is still nil. You can test this by putting an NSLog just before you call reloadData - if it outputs nil then you've not connected it. NSLog(@"%@", myTable); [myTable reloadData];
