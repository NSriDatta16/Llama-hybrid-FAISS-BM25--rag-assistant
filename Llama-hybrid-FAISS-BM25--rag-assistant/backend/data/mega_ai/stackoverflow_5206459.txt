tar create rename directories

I have a directory named dir with files file1 file2 file3 in it and I want to create a gzipped tar directory from it called dir.tar.gz but with the hierarchy as: anotherdir/file1 anotherdir/file2 anotherdir/file3 There's always the option of writing a shell script to rename dir to anotherdir then tar it, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution.
