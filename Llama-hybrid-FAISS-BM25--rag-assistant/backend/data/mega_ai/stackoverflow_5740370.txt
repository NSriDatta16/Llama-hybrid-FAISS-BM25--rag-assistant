How to prevent jQuery Droppable from accepting certain Draggable?

I'm creating a page with "groups" of droppable widgets, and each draggable can only be dropped on one group of droppables. I was able to achieve this by the following code: $("div.droppable").droppable({ //accept: ".draggable", accept: function (draggable) { if ($(this).attr("question_id") != null) { if ($(this).attr("question_id") == draggable.attr("question_id")) return true; } return false; }); However, now I'm having a little trouble. After dropping, I was not able to move the draggable around droppables in the same group as I could before. I could drop it on a droppable once, move it to another, but I couldn't move it back to the first droppable. Does anyone know what could have happened? Any input would be appreciated.
