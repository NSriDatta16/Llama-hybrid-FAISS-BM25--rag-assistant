As far as I can see with both the GEE or a mixed model for repeated binary observations, you will have the problem that the model will assign a positive probability for a ‘0’ after the first ‘1’ has been observed. In any case, given that you want to get estimates from a mixed effects logistic regression that will have the same interpretation as in the GEE (see here for more info), you could fit the model using the mixed_model() function from the GLMMadaptive package, and then use marginal_coefs() . For an example, see here .
