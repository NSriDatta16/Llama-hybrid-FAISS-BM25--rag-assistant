The answer is in the definitions of the terms. Essentially with the transitiveties term you count ties for which adjacent nodes have at least one partner in common (that's the two-path part in the definition). In contrast, the ttriple term counts triangles . What leads to degeneracy is the fact that a single flip of a dyad (one MCMC step) can create a big change in graph ttriple statistic: adding one tie to the network can create a whole lot of triangles removing one tie can destroy a lot of triangles All of this leads to a bimodal distribution that is concentrated on networks which are almost complete (full) or almost empty. The transitiveties does not suffer from that problem that much.
