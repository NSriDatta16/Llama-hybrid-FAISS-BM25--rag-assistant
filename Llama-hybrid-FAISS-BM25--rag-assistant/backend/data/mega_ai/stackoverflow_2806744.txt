I would suggest you implement your own. You can't rely on the IE cache remaining consistent, or not being cleared by the user, or anything else. Unless you're actually embedding the IE browser in a control in your app, I see no reason to use it. Also, using your own cache allows you to create one that could be more fit for purpose (e.g. if you need to store thumbs, or extra metadata, or anything else).
