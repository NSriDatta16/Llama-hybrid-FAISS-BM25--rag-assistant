select * from table_name is the simplest, easiest and fastest way to read a whole table. Let me explain why your results lead to wrong conclusions. Copying a whole table is an optimized operation that merely requires cloning the old binary data into the new one (at most you can perform a file copy operation, according to storage mechanism). Writing is buffered . DBMS says the record was written but it's actually not yet done, unless you work with transactions. Disk operations are generally delayed. Querying a table also requires (unlike cloning) adapting data from the binary-stored layout/format to a driver-dependant format that is ultimately readable by your client. This takes time.
