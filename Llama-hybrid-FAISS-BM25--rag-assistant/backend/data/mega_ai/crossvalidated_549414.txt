Hypothesis tests are still used because they are motivated by a different need in statistical inference than interval estimators are motivated by. The purpose of a hypothesis test is to make a decision as to whether there is evidence for the alternative hypothesis' expression of the population parameter. Confidence intervals serve a different purpose: they provide a plausible range of estimates of a population parameter. All the technical details about estimation (exact vs approximate, bootstrap vs non-probabilistic closed-form estimators, intervals, test statistics and p values, etc.) aside, the above represent fundamentally different motivations in statistical inference. Aside: sometimes confidence interval coverage has a pretty direct correspondence to a hypothesis tests ( a la does it cover the null or not), but this is not always the case, and habitually using confidence intervals for that purpose, in my opinion, obscures the above distinction between "let's make a decision about evidence for the alternative hypothesis" and "let's estimate a plausible range of values for a parameter."
