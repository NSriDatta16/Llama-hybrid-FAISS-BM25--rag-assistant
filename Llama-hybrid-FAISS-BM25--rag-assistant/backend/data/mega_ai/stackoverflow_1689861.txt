Browser Detection Python / mod_python?

I want to keep some statistics about users and locations in a database. For instance, I would like to store "Mozilla","Firefox","Safari","Chrome","IE", etc... as well as the versions, and possibly the operating system. What I am trying to locate from Python is this string; Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.14) Gecko/2009090216 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.14 Is there an efficient way to use Python or mod_python to detect the http user agent/browser?
