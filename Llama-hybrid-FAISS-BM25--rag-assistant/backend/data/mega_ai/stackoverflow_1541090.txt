I agree with most of the posts on here, however I would add this: There is a primary priority to test public interfaces, then protected, then private. Usually public and protected interfaces are a summary of a combination of private and protected interfaces. Personally: You should test everything. Given a strong testing set for smaller functions, you will be given a higher confidence that that hidden methods work. Also I agree with another person's comment about refactoring. Code coverage will help you determine where the extra bits of code are and to refactor those out if necessary.
