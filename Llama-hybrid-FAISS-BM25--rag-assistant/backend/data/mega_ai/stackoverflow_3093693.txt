In terms of working with XML (or HTML) and Apache, if you're doing simple enough things such as inserting a comment to a particular place in the document, it will probably be more efficient to work with XSL. This natively deals with XML-style documents, of which HTML and XHTML are a subset, without needing to convert them into some other format to work more easily with other programming languages. DOM and SAX parsing, on the other hand, each consider the XML doc in a fashion that is easier to deal with, either by converting it to a native object in your particular language, or registering "events" that your code can handle, respectively. For a little bit more about XSL, take a look at http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/ . An additional thought - if you really are doing something basic like adding a comment to the head, it would be more efficient to use SAX parsing than DOM parsing, as a simply edit shouldn't require parsing the entire document. It would rather be more elegantly handled by waiting for the proper event of reaching the "head" element and then adding whatever you desired to it.
