Under the assumption of normality it is straightforward to see that maximizing the log-likelihood $$\ell(\alpha, \beta, \sigma^2; y)=-\frac{T-1}{2}\log(2\pi)-\frac{T-1}{2}\log(\sigma^2)-\sum_{t=2}^T\frac{(y_t-\alpha-\beta_1y_{t-1})^2}{2\sigma^2}$$ w.r.t. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is equivalent to minimizing $$\sum_{t=2}^T(y_t-\alpha-\beta_1y_{t-1})^2$$ w.r.t. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the OLS problem. As such it suffices to show consistency of the OLS estimates which is quite standard. Standard references for this are e.g. Hamilton's Time Series Analysis or Econometric Theory and Methods by Davidson and MacKinnon.
