You are right that it would be inappropriate to use all 360 observations as they were independent. You could run a logistic regression on the 135 first treatments though. Of course this would lose information. There are models for logistic random effects regression that can model dependence within a patient, see for example here: Li et al. (2011) Logistic random effects regression models: a comparison of statistical packages for binary and ordinal outcomes. BMC Medical Research Methodology . However I'm very skeptical about whether these would be appropriate here, because they make very restrictive assumptions about how within patients dependence looks like (the standard random effect just adds a patientwise constant to the linear predictor; I doubt that this is what goes on in your case). I would probably first produce some visualisations in order to have a better idea about how within-patient dependence actually plays out before doing any modelling of it (actually, running a logistic regression with all data points in an exploratory manner for the sake of looking at how fits and residuals depend within-patient but not to be trusted as final result could be worthwhile). Also whatever you do should be informed by prior knowledge about what reasons may lead to performing the treatment several times, and what implications this has regarding all involved variables.
