TFS: how to change custom field allowed values

I have my custom field of string type with predefined set of values: "1 - Cool", "2 - Good", "3 - Average",... Now it is necessary to remove "2 - Good" value and rename "3 - Average" into "2 - Average". I see easy solution: just delete 2 existing "2 - Good" and "3 - Average" and create the new "2 - Average". Question: Q1: What will happens with issues that contain values to be deleted? Probably, system won't accept such work item change? Q2: What is a good approach to do what I need? Thanks a lot! Any thoughts are welcome!
