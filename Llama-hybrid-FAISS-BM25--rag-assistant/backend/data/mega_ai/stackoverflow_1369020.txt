Is there an alternative to rail's auto_link helper method?

I'm using the auto_link method in Rails to turn urls in plain text to clickable links. It works pretty good most of the time. but google.com doesn't create a link Is there something else out there that provides better coverage of urls? Or is there anyway I can easily modify the Rails code to include .coms and .net without a http or www start string?
