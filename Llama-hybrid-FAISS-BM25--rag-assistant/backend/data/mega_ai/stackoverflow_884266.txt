Mixing libraries from different C++ compilers

I am working on redhat 5.2 on a project which spans several disparate organizations. Each organization delivers libraries which have been compiled with various versions of g++. Currently, these versions include 4.1.1, 4.1.2 and 4.3.1. I am trying to link all the libraries together into an executable using 4.1.2. What, if any, problems may I expect by doing this? As an aside, is there a way to tell which ABI each compiler version builds to?
