Difference between the Out-of-Bag error and the predicted error

library(randomForest) library(caret) library(e1071) > rand.forest = randomForest(Y~., data = trainset) > print(rand.forest) Call: randomForest(formula = Y ~ ., data = trainset) Type of random forest: classification Number of trees: 500 No. of variables tried at each split: 23 OOB estimate of error rate: 4.24% Confusion matrix: 0 1 class.error 0 19234 53 0.0001245 1 2432 10 0.9221 > p = predict(rand.forest, trainset) > confusionMatrix(p, trainset$Y) Confusion Matrix and Statistics Reference Prediction 0 1 0 12564 742 1 11 15 Accuracy : 0.931 Can someone explain, why I get different confusion matrices, even I've used the same training set? What is the theoretical reason for this?
