Joe Hewitt recently committed some code to Three20 that utilizes the 3.0 shake event. Seems like you just need to implement some simple code within -motionBegan:withEvent: inside of your UIResponder . - (void)motionBegan:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (event.type == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake) { ... } }
