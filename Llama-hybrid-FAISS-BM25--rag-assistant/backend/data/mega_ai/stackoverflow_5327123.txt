Replacing our existing computer inventory system

We've been using OCS-NG to gather our computer inventory for the past 2 years. About 6 months ago, AVG Antivirus started picking up on the agent it uses to gather computer information as a "potentially harmful program". We've placed that in our ignore list, but the agent no longer appears to be updating our database. After much consideration and frustration trying to diagnose, I've decided to move away from OCS-NG as well as GLPI (with which it interfaces nicely). I'm looking for a replacement for both of these applications, but primarily OCS-NG. My requirements are: Open Source (preferably free) Windows/Linux inventory agents I would like it if the system was able to be integrated with a helpdesk system such as OTRS or the like. Thanks
