xts problem with dynlm

I am trying to use xts as much as possible in my time series work as it seems to be the suggested way of doing things. However, I have getting a strange error. CPI.NSA and INT are xts objects. library(dynlm) CPI.NSA.x dynlm(CPI.NSA.z ~ INT.z + L(CPI.NSA.z, 1)) Time series regression with "zoo" data: Start = 1953-02-01, End = 1971-06-01 Call: dynlm(formula = CPI.NSA.z ~ INT.z + L(CPI.NSA.z, 1)) Coefficients: (Intercept) INT.z L(CPI.NSA.z, 1) -0.0006795 1.0440174 -0.0869050 > dynlm(CPI.NSA.x ~ INT.x + L(CPI.NSA.x, 1)) Error in `[.xts`(a, match0(indexes, attr(a, "index")), , drop = FALSE) : i is out of range It was my understanding that whenever I have a function that takes zoo, I can pass it an xts and it should just work, but clearly that is not the case here. What's going on? Thanks for the help.
