Several logistic regressions vs multinomial regression

Is it viable to do several binary logistic regressions instead of doing a multinomial regression? From this question: Multinomial logistic regression vs one-vs-rest binary logistic regression I see that the multinomial regression might have lower standard errors. However, the package I would like to utilize has not been generalized to multinomial regression ( ncvreg : http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ncvreg/ncvreg.pdf ) and so I was wondering if I could simply do several binary logistic regressions instead.
