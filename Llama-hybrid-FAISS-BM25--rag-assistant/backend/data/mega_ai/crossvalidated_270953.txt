How to visualize biometric performance (authentication) involving a multi-part dataset?

The problem pertains to gait authentication using the CASIA-B dataset and its specification is as follows. The dataset is composed of the gait of 124 subjects over three covariate conditions: A, B and C, each taken over 11 simultaneous angles. An authentication algorithm is applied to this dataset and is evaluated. The performance is measured in FRR, FAR$_1$ and FAR$_2$ where FRR is the false rejection rate FAR$_1$ is the false acceptance rate of intruders unknown to the system FAR$_2$ is the false acceptance rate of intruders known to the system There is no EER (equal error rate) AER can be calculated as $AER=\frac{FRR}{2}+\frac{FAR_1 + FAR_2}{4}$ So we have the above measures (FRR, FAR$_1$, FAR$_2$) for each of the three covariates for each of the 11 angles. How to visualize this performance? I was thinking of a bar-chart with 11 groups each having 3 bars for the AER (average error rate) of covariates A, B, C. However the variance in the performance is very small (~1 to 4%) and some values are zero. Also, since this is not a threshold-based verification, the ROC curve cannot be applied to this problem. Any help would be appreciated.
