purtest and psacf: How to test it in R?

I am working with balanced panel data (annual country level data: 37 countries and 11 years) and would like to test stationarity. I am using fixed effects for both country and year. Now, I am checking if there's the issue of non-stationarity. However, I'm quite unsure how to do this in R. Since I have 11 years, I entered lag.max = 11 . I've entered the following code and got the following results: #Auto- and Cross- Covariance and -Correlation Function Estimation for Panel-Series. psacf(output, GDPcapitaPPP ~ countryIdentifier, ~year, lag.max = 11, plot = TRUE) psacf is from package collapse . From this plot, I get the idea that there is a time trend going on. Then, I ran purtest (from R package plm ) and got the following results. However, I have to say that I don't understand which options I should use after exo and test . #unit root test for panel data. H0: no stationarity, H1: stationarity. Low p-value speaks in favour of H1. library(plm) outputpanel The results from purtest suggest that my panel data is stationary. How can it be? This would be a contradiction to the plot above, right?
