The length restriction is probably due to a storage space concern, but it might be a really bad anti-scripting measure. I'd be a lot more confident if my bank told me my password was too short, rather than too long. Whenever I'm told my password is too short, or "special" characters are not allowed I think, "Oh, they must not have found my password in their dictionary... facepalm ." Any characters should be allowed. Pass phrases should be encouraged, not discouraged. They're much easier to remember than cryptic passwords and much harder to crack since they won't be in a lookup table.
