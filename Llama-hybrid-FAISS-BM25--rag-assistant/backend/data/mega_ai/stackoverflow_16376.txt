Yes, drag and drop is different in AIR. I HATE that! It takes a lot of playing around to figure out how to get things to work the same as custom dnd that was built in flex. As for the coordinates, maybe play around with localToContent, and localToGlobal methods. They may help in translating the coordinates to something useful. Good luck. I will let you know if I think of anything else.
