ASP.NET MVC2 Not replacing underscores with dashes in HtmlAttributes

I've heard from a couple of different sources that when using HTML helpers in ASP.NET MVC2, one can create custom attributes with dashes in them (e.g. ) by using an underscore in place of the dash, and when the HTML is written to the page the underscores will be replaced by dashes. So, something like this: should render as Row Name But... it's not. I think that maybe this feature is only enabled in the MVC3 Beta preview (as it's mentioned in the MVC3 preview release notes), but this thread is about the same thing, and it's regarding MVC2. I know I can use the other solution presented in that thread, but I'd rather not have to resort to using the dictionary if a more elegant solution exists. Anyone know if there's something simple I can do to get this particular thing working?
