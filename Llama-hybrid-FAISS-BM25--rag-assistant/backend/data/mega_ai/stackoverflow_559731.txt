For the password storing part, you may want to have a look at this question asked recently. This was my answer: You could/should use the DPAPI , the Data Protection API that provides storage encryption. It's there just for this type of problem. Encryption of the storage is based on either: the user account, so only the logged-in user can access the data. This makes the data transferable to another PC with the exact same user credentials. the machine, making the data only accessible on that particular machine setup and not transferable to another PC. There is a dnrTV show with Karl Franklin showing exactly what's needed to implement this, and other encryption functions. The source code from the show is also available on the page. There are, of course, lots of other articles on that subject.
