I'd use stored procedures but not for any speed reasons (I doubt that it will make any difference). It is much easier to refactor your database if you know all your calling code is in stored procedures and not buried in rdl files. From what I remember about reporting services the rendering step itself can be quite consuming and it can time out on the rendering rather than the data retrieval. Have you tried using SQL Profiler whilst viewing the report to see how long the gap is between the statement getting the data showing as completed and the report being rendered?
