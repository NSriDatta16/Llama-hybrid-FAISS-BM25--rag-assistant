dependent observations for logistic regression

I am trying to set up a logistic regression model for inventory units and sales. My binary response variable (sales) is 1 if overall sales are up over last year and 0 if they are not. I have about 30 independent variables which are a count of inventory units by category (30 categories). The goal is to rank categories based on how influential their inventory levels are to whether sales are up. My data is set up as follows with about 300 rows: Week Cat1. Cat2. Cat3. Cat4. ... Catn Sales My problem is that inventory in week 2 is dependent on inventory in week 1 and so on, so I fail the independence assumption. How can I overcome this issue?
