Go here and scan the page for the string "Initial:". Then you find any initial values the spec defines for text rendering. For font-family it states however: 'font-family' Value: [[ | ],]* [ | ] | inherit Initial: depends on user agent Applies to: text content elements Inherited: yes Percentages: N/A Media: visual Animatable: yes That means, the user agent may decide, which font family to use, if none is given, or if it cannot access a font with the given name. Overall initial values: The spec defines initial values in every case, where you can write an attribute as CSS declaration (like fill: red; ). In this case the behaviour is like the one CSS defines . In some of the other cases there are fallbacks defined, but it depends on the case.
