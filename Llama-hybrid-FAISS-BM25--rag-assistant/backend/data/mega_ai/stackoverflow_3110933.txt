The APK doesn't need to be installed in this process, but if it did, I wouldn't want there to be any user interaction. Is this possible? Automating the install? Yes. No user interaction? No. The user will get the normal installation and permissions screens. And it will be flat-out impossible (at the moment) on AT&T-specific phones (e.g., BACKFLIP, Aria), which prohibit this sort of thing. Are there any alternative ways to do this? If there is, it's a security hole, as you suggest. Also, your very issue seems flawed. SD card access is certainly available with the device plugged into USB -- just don't mount the storage.
