Another reason to consider developing novel approaches to constructive neural networks (such as the CC algorithm @alto mentioned) is in applications outside of statistics . In particular, in theoretical neuroscience and cognitive science, constructive neural networks are often used because of a metaphorical similarity to development and neurogenesis. For an example of heavy use of cascade-correlation for this, take a look at publications of Thomas R. Shultz . Unfortunately, the cascade correlation approach is biological unrealistic and if you have a neuroscience bend it is worth to consider how new NNs with adjustable architecture could be used as better models of development and/or neurogenesis.
