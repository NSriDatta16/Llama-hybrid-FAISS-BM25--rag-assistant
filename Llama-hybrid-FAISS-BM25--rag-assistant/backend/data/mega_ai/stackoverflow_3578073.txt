One of my apps has five tabs as well (but only three table view controllers), and it starts up in aobut 6 seconds (as you're trying to achieve). I've noticed that only the contents of the first tab are loaded on startup. The remaining ones are loaded when you touche the tab for the first time. So the clue could be to make sure your tabs are initialized lazily, and I'm guessing this is not yet the case with your app. My app has 6 XIB files, one for the main window and 5 for the contents of each tab. Is your UI organized the same way? Assuming your UI is not loaded lazily, you could set breakpoints in the viewDidLoad: methods of your tab contents and see who is loading them so early.
