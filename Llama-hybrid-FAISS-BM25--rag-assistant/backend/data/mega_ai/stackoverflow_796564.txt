My solution is to do everything in the join model. I think this works correctly on the client transitions to or from zero associations, always guaranteeing a primary contact is designated if there is any existing association. I'd be interested to hear anyone's feedback. I'm new here, so cannot comment on FranÃ§ois below. I can only edit my own entry. His solution presumes user to client is one to many, whereas my solution presumes many to many. I was thinking the user model represented an "agent" or "rep" perhaps, and would surely manage multiple clients. The question is ambiguous in this regard. class User true has_many :clients, :through => :user_client end class UserClient true has_many :users, :through => :user_client end
