Restrict LINQ Subquery when databound to a grid

I want to limit the number of child elements I get back. In this example Order.CustomerID "VINET" has 3 Order Details. I only want to see the record that has a unit price of 14. I do NOT want to see the Order Details where the unit price equals 9.8 or 43.8 In the end I want to do this in a dynamic where query or with a predicate, but the simple example should show my problem. I tried this a couple of different ways including the two i have shown below. I realize the problem is in the fact that LINQ is automatically running its own queries when I expand, but does anyone have a good solution? private void btnJoinProblem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { NorthwindDataContext db = new NorthwindDataContext(); var tempQ2 = (from od in db.Order_Details join o in db.Orders on od.OrderID equals o.OrderID where od.UnitPrice == 14 select o).Distinct(); } Also brings back too many subrecords at the Order Detail level NorthwindDataContext db = new NorthwindDataContext(); var tempQ = from o in db.Orders where o.Order_Details.Any(od => od.UnitPrice == 14) select o; var bindingSource = new BindingSource(); bindingSource.DataSource = tempQ; ultraGrid1.DataSource = bindingSource;
