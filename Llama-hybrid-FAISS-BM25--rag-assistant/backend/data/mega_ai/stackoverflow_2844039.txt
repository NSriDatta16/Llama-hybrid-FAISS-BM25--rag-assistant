Using version control to maintain multiple streams of development is generally a bad idea. It'll require continual merging activity, which is error-prone and burdensome. You should organise your product stratas without reference to the version control system. Perhaps this could entail a single code base that has the entire extended version, with a build system that supports three different build targets. Each build target includes different subsets of the full product.
