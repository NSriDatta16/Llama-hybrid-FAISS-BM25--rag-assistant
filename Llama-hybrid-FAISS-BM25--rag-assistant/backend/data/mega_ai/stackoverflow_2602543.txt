Why does this crash with access violation to 0xcccccc...?

I have a random piece of code, I use for reading from CSV files... and it's fine... until after about 2000 reads... then the getline line fails with an access violation to 0xcccccc... which I assume means that the input stream (file) has been cleared... Not that I know why :) int CCSVManager::ReadCSVLine ( fstream * fsInputFile, vector * recordData ) { string s; getline ( *fsInputFile, s ); stringstream iss( s ); for ( unsigned int i = 0; i Any ideas why?
