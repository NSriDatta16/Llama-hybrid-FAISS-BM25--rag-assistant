Why doesn't the object show up in the scene?

I am using the following code to load .md2 model in a scene using Papervision3D 2.1.932. _md2.load(MD2_FILE ,new BitmapFileMaterial("./assets/dragon.png")); scene.addChild(_md2); By looking at the trace log, the texture is successfully loaded and so is the mesh. INFO: BitmapFileMaterial: Loading bitmap from ./assets/dragon.png INFO: Parsed MD2: assets/dragon.md2 vertices:294 texture vertices:262 faces:582 frames: 200 I can't understand why the object isn't visible in the scene. Can anyone help me out ?
