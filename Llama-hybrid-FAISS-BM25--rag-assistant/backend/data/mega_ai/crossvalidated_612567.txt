Extrapolate Principal Components Factors with other variables in the components

Hi StackExchange Community, I am performing a Principal Components Analyses (PCA). I would like to know how to extrapolate some PCA components with other variables that were not considered in the PCA function. I have a nutritional survey with 60 questions that was applied to 420 people. The frequency of consumption was measured in servings and It is standardized for each type of food. I have a clearly Components identified using the following criteria: a. Selected components by eigen-value >1.5 b. Varimax rotation loadings >0.2 for variable . The Results of PCA+varimax rotation: ... PC1: Orange, Apple, Watermelon PC2: Homemade fries, Mayonesa, Pizza PC3: Eggs, Walnuts, Hazelnuts PC4: Witefish , fatty fish small, fatty fish big ... Then, I want to know if it is possible to carry out post-PCA statistical analysis with the standardized scores of the Varimax rotation of each subject in the component and cross-check that information with other confounding variables such as sex, age, education level, etc. This table illustrates that I want to compute: https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-016-0353-2/tables/4 Other studies where similar approach was applied: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/1/70#app1-nutrients-13-00070 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/comparison-of-cluster-and-principal-component-analysis-techniques-to-derive-dietary-patterns-in-irish-adults/2130E0404EA1C0AC9CF4382839DE3498 Can I recover the position of the subjects in the components? I tried to do something using info of this link but I'm not sure if it's correct. I think that with this step I could compute an ANAVOA test or Chi-Square to confounding variables such as sex, education, diet calories etc How to compute varimax-rotated principal components in R? #Code for RStudio library(factoextra) #PCA prc 1.5 #Varimax and loadings varimax_df = varimax ( prc $rotation [, 1:4] ) varimax_df$ loadings varimax_df$rotmat #Scaling component to row. Standarized scores for each row newData Thanks!
