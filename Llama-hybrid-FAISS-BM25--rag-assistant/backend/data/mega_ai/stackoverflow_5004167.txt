Getting Uncommitted Transactions Sqlite With System.Data.Sqlite

I am trying to get a count of uncommitted records in a SQLite database using the System.Data.Sqlite library. My research thus far has pointed towards using the PRAGMA read_committed, but I always get a count of 0 until records are committed. Any tips? using (SQLiteConnection conn = new SQLiteConnection("Data Source=" + this.Path)) { conn.Open(); using (SQLiteCommand cmd = new SQLiteCommand(conn)) { cmd.CommandText = "PRAGMA read_uncommitted = true;"; cmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); cmd.CommandText = "SELECT Count() FROM Tiles WHERE TileLayerId = " + tileLayerId; return Convert.ToInt32(cmd.ExecuteScalar()); } }
