What is Bsum in (meta-)regression and how do you test for its significance?

I received a reviewer report on a meta-analysis that I submitted which stated that a multivariate regression that I performed should instead be "a backward stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis since Bsum is insignificant". Ignoring the fact that every source I know says that stepwise procedures should be avoided, what is Bsum and how do you test for it? I suppose it is the sum of coefficients, but I don't seem to find anything about it. And how did the reviewer find out it was not significant since they don't have access to the dataset itself to compute the model themselves?
