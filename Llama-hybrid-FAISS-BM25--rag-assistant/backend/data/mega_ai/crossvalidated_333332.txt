Is it possible to merge acceptance probability with proposal distribution in Metropolis Hastings algorithm?

For an ergodic Markov chain, it doesn't necessarily have to be $Detailed\ Balanced $ when it converges to stationary distribution, which means that: $\pi(\theta)\ P(\theta^{\prime}|\theta) \neq \pi(\theta^{\prime})\ P(\theta|\theta^{\prime})$ ; In the MH algorithm, however, by multiplying the acceptance rate $\alpha$ for both sides of the equation above, we can get a detailed balanced equation: $\pi(\theta)\ P(\theta^{\prime}|\theta)\ \alpha(\theta^{\prime}|\theta) = \pi(\theta^{\prime})\ P(\theta|\theta^{\prime})\ \alpha(\theta|\theta^{\prime})$ ; By forcing one of the $\alpha$ equal to 1, for instance, the one of RHS, we can derive the acceptance probability as: $\alpha(\theta^{\prime}|\theta) = min\{1, \frac{\pi(\theta^{\prime})\ P(\theta|\theta^{\prime})}{\pi(\theta)\ P(\theta^{\prime}|\theta)}\}$; So my questions are: Can I interpret the $\alpha$ as the "transition probability", for the posterior probability distribution, from $P(\theta|x)$ to $P(\theta^{\prime}|x)$? Is it possible to join the product of $\ P(\theta^{\prime}|\theta)\ \alpha(\theta^{\prime}|\theta)$ to make them one probability like $Q(\theta^{\prime}|\theta)$. So all we need to compute is $Q(\theta^{\prime}|\theta) =min\{1, \frac{\pi(\theta^{\prime})}{\pi(\theta)}\}$, without worrying about the proposal distribution? Besides, I think $Q(\theta^{\prime}|\theta)$ is more intuitively acceptable as a "transition probability".
