I don't think there's a good way built in to nunit, but it's not a hard problem to resolve. Just wrap your tests in a try/catch block, catch any exceptions, and save them (and the test name) to a private member variable in your test class. Then you've got access from your TearDown method. Not particularly elegant, but it works.
