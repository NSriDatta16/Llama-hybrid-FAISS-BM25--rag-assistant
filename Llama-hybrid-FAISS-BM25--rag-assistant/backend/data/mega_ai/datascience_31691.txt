Best way to extract information from text description and match it with set of words

I have 10k records of data, each record represents a unique product(10k class labels) and its description. For example, "Coffee Maker, this product takes coffee beans and brew it, to make tasty cofe". Description can be little bigger and smaller. Most of the data also mentions acronyms in the description to refer the product or some other related product and yeah there spelling mistakes too. So what is the best approach to solve this problem, im open for using Machine Learning/Deep Learning. Please help me on how to build a model, that takes a small description like three or four words or more as a input and suggest a list of products that closely represent those words.
