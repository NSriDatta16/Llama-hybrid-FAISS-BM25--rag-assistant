Every answer accepts your reason for the UPDATE. However, let me question that decision with extension to Col. Srapnel's suggestion from comments. Updating can be seen as a waste of resources since you can calculate it on the run with in memory date comparison (which is orders of magnitude faster then I/O to storage). There are two approaches to this: query/view can do this (and the cost should really be neglible) actually doing this on php side after results are retrieved (consider it a formatting/presentation task) it could even be done on the client side, which if possible, performance wise would be the best solutions (this might lead to maintenance/security issues) Of course, there could be valid reasons for ignoring these solutions, but I think the performance by itself is not enough (most DBs are I/O bound).
