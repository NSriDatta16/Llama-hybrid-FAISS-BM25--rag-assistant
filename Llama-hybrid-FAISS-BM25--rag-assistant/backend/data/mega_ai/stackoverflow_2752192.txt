Array of function pointers in Java

I have read this question and I'm still not sure whether it is possible to keep pointers to methods in an array in Java. If anyone knows if this is possible (or not), it would be a real help. I'm trying to find an elegant solution of keeping a list of String s and associated functions without writing a mess of hundreds of if statements. Cheers
