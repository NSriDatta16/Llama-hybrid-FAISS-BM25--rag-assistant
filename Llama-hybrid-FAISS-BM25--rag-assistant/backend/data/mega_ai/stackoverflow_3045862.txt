Adding Navigation Bar items to secondary view in IB

I work on an application that presents a UINavigationController-based interface with a root view and a secondary view. On the root view, I have configured the left and right buttons to two toolbar buttons. I would like to configure the navigation bar items on the secondary view in a similar way. I know that it can be done with some coding (and so I have done...), but my question is if it is possible to do in Interface Builder? I tried to drag items to the simulated Navigation bar, but it does not work (the items are simply rejected).
