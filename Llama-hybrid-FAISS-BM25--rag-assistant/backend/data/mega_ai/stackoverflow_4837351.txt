In most API's the standard redirect implementation does a 302 which is indeed per definition GET. As per your question history you're familiar with ASP.NET, I'll however add examples for Java Servlets as well. ASP.NET: Response.Redirect("http://google.com"); Servlet: response.sendRedirect("http://google.com"); It implicitly sets the response status to 302 and the Location header to the given URL. When the current request is a POST request and you want to redirect with POST, then you need a 307 redirect. This is not provided by the standard API, but it's usually just a matter of setting the appropriate response status and header. ASP.NET: Response.Status = "307 Temporary Redirect"; Response.AddHeader("Location", "http://google.com"); Servlet: response.setStatus(307); response.setHeader("Location", "http://google.com"); Note that this will issue a security/confirmation warning on the average client which requests the enduser for confirmation to send the POST data to another location.
