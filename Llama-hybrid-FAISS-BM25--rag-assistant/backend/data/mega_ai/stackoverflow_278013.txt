The Garbage Collector doesn't automatically free memory when it releases objects, it holds on to that memory to help minimise the expense of future mallocs. When a low memory condition is triggered that memory will be returned to the OS and you will see more available memory when looking through task manager. This will normally happen about the 2GB mark, or 3GB if you use the relevant switch . By setting objects to null when they are dead you can encourage the GC to reuse the memory consumed by those objects, this limiting the growing consumption of memory. But which objects should you set to null? Big objects, large collections, frequently created objects. EDIT : There is evidence to support the value of setting objects to null. See this for detail. Of course there is no need to set objects to null, the point is does it help memory management in any way? EDIT : We need a recent benchmark if such a thing exists rather than continuing to opine.
