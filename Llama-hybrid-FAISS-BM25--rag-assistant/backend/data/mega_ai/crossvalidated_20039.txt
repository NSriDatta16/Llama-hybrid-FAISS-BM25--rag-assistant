Effect of moving average parameter on variability and variance of demand

Consider an MA(1) process, $d_{t}=e_{t}-\Theta e_{t-1}$, when $d_t$ is the demand at time $t$ and $e_t$ is error term and $\Theta$ is moving average parameter. Now if $\Theta$ equal to zero so we have a white noise process, if $\Theta$ gets positive values, process is more irregular than white noise, and when the is negative, process is more smoother than white noise. I have two questions:. How can we explain the variability of the process by changing the $\Theta$ parameter from zero toward +1 and -1? Why for positive and negative $\Theta$, the variance of demand is increasing while we said for positive value of Theta the process is irregular than white noise and for negative values the process is more smoother than white noise.
