You may perhaps not like this answer, but I think citations in headings is a bad style. I would rather recommend that you use another heading and then throw your citation references in the paragraphs following it. I've read quite some papers and none of those I recall used references in headings. In the same vein, may I recommend using bibTex and bibtool for managing your bibliography database. Bibtool can normalize the citation keys so you can just drop other peoples bibtex references, run bibtool, and then you have standardized keys.
