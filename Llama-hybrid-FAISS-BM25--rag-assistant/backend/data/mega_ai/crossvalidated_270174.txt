Artificial Neural Network with continuous and binary variables

I have a dataset with numerical (continuous) and categorical variables. I want to fit an artificial neural network. To do so, I have transformed my categorical variables by using the 1-of-k method, so I now have a bunch of binary variables. I am using the Neuralnet package in R to fit my ANN model. From a theoretical point of view: is there any problem by mixing the continuous and binary variables in the same model? 1-of-k method is explained below: The dat set [1] Sweden [2] India becomes Sweden India [1] 1 0 [2] 0 1
