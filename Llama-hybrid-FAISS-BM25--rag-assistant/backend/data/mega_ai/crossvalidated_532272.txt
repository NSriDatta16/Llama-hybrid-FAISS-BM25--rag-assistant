Autocorrelation Here is a counterexample. Suppose the data generating process is either exactly an invertible MA( $1$ ) model or well approximated by one. If you wanted to approximate it by a time series regression about as well, you would need an AR( $\infty$ ) model. This is not feasible, so you would end up with an AR( $p$ ) with some large $p$ . Estimating the $p+2$ parameters* of the AR( $p$ ) model will make it have high variance and thus perform poorly in forecasting. Meanwhile, you could use an MA( $1$ ) model instead. It has only 1+2 parameters* and thus much lower variance and better forecast accuracy. Seasonality Here is another counterexample. Consider a parsimonious SARIMA model as a data generating process or its close approximation. The seasonality generated by a SARIMA model cannot be modelled by dummy variables (flags as you called them). Moreover, approximating it with a time series regression might take a lot of variables and bring in a lot of unnecessary estimation variance. Even in the very simplest instance of SARIMA(1,0,0)(1,0,0), the SARIMA model will have 2+2 parameters* to be estimated while an equivalent autoregression (which you can consider as a time series regression) will have 3+2 parameters. This way you would be estimating one superfluous parameter and thereby increasing the variance of the model. If we were to add some moving average terms, this would get significantly worse. Extrapolation If by that you mean forecasting into the future (beyond the available data), then the above two points apply. Otherwise I agree that there are challenges to both approaches. Regarding including additional variables , regression with ARMA errors (as already suggested by David Veitch) is always an option. But these additional variables typically also need to be forecast, which brings us to vector autoregressions (VAR) and VARMA models. In conclusion , it is good to know both time series regression and ARIMA-type time series models. There will be situations where the former is more natural or more effective, and there will be situations where the opposite is the case. You can then only benefit from having both tools under your belt and being able to use whichever one works better at the given task. *+2 comes from the intercept and the error variance.
