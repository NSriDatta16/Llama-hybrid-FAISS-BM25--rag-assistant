I would normally just recommend people NOT to build yet another commerce site when there are popular ones that you can leverage such as Amazon or eBay etc. That way your customer's don't need yet another account etc. Your client would just be able to focus on their business of selling their stuff rather than maintaining yet another e-commerce site which has a lot of maintenance to deal with not to mention having to ensure availability. That being said though, you should still have a web site that does showcase your products, but as far as managing the commerce and shopping portion, it's best to leave it to the pros rather than dealing with the APIs themselves. Mind you, your product line can grow to the point that you'd want to take over the shopping and commerce portion, by then you could use PayPal or Google Checkout to do your commerce portion. There are many catalog applications out there as well.
