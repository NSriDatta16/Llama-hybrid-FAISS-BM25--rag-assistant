You could try this formula: factor - a number in the range 1..N which is used to scale down the steering angle. maxSpeed - the value of the expected maximum speed at which the maximum factor is applied to reduce the steering angle. requestedAngle - the currently required steering angle . float factor; float maxSpeed; float requestedAngle; float Speed; float SteeringAngle = requestedAngle/( (Speed * factor / maxSpeed) + 1); There are many possible formulas. I would suggest you try to plot graphs of speeds and angles
