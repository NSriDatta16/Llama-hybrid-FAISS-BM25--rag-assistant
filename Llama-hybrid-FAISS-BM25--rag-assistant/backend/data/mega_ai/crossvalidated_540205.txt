In VAE, why are we approximating p(z|x) using q(z) and not q(z|x)

I am watching this lecture on VAE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaqyVS9-rM&t=1507s and at 26:00, it is stated that the goal is the minimize the KL div. between the distribution we are trying to find - p(z|x) by approximating it with another distribution: q(z). but why aren't we using q(z|x)?
