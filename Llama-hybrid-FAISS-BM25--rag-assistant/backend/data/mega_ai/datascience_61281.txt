Erwan nailed it (+1). But I think my addition is a little too long for a comment. You seem to be well ahead of where I was when I landed my DS job. I was in pure math, a couple of postdocs in, and had only a short time of self-study when I was applying for industry data science. On the other hand, I had actuarial exams in my undergrad, which probably helped me get into the fintech space. When applying, emphasize what you already know, and acknowledge what you will need to be learning in your first few months (stronger programming? using git? ...). (Also, you didn't mention tree-based models in your ML course: I'd guess that was just an omission, but those seem to be the most important model to understand unless you're trying to get into industries where neural nets are the norm.)
