Java: Finding how many words appear in BOTH data sources?

I'm trying to figure out if there is an easy way to count the number of words that appear in small paragraph (#1) and small paragraph (#2). Generally, Im determining how much overlap there is in these paragraphs on a word by word basis. So if (#1) contains the word "happy" and (#2) contains the word "happy" that would be like a +1 value. I know that I could use a String.contains() for each word in (#1) applied to (#2). But I was wondering if there is something more efficient that I could use
