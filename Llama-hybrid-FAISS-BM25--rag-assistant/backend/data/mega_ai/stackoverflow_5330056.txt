@Hmthur: Yeah the file size is fine because it only considers the XIBs and Resources. All the coding and plist are compressed in the target. So don't worry about the file size. It is just fine. As MacMade as mentioned dSym is Debug Symbols. So you don't need to compress it and submit it along with the binary. You can also submit the binary app via Organizer or using Application Loader. So you can use whichever way you find convnient. Hope this helps you.
