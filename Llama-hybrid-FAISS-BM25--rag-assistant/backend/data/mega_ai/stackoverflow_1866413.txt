It is my experience that such layout (figure spanning more than one, but not all of the columns on the page) is difficult to obtain with latex. The best solution that I'm aware of is the flowfram package . The package lets you define the page layout (where should certain boxes be placed) before writing the contents of the document. A small code example is given below. It is a restructuring of the poster example that comes with the flowfram package. \documentclass[a4wide]{article} \usepackage{color} \usepackage{helvet} \usepackage{flowfram} \setlength{\columnsep}{0.3cm} % Base the page layout on 3 column with static header. \NcolumnStop{3}{1 cm} % give the static frame a label to make it easier to keep track of \setstaticframe{\value{maxstatic}}{label={title},backcolor=[cmyk]{0.64,0,0.95,0.40},textcolor=white} % On the first page, replace last two columns with % 2 columns and a static above \setflowframe{2,3}{pages={>1}} \computeflowframearea{2,3} \twocolumnStopinarea[1]{0.3\ffareaheight}{\ffareawidth}{\ffareaheight}{\ffareax}{\ffareay} \setstaticframe{\value{maxstatic}}{label={info},backcolor=[cmyk]{0.26,0,0.76,0},clear} \setallflowframes{backcolor=[cmyk]{0.15,0,0.69,0}} \raggedright \setlength{\parindent}{15pt} \begin{document} \begin{staticcontents*}{title} \begin{center} \bfseries\Large Creating stuff in \LaTeX\par \end{center} \end{staticcontents*} \pagestyle{empty} \begin{staticcontents*}{info} \begin{staticfigure} The {flowfram} package is designed to enable you to create frames in a document such that the contents of the {document} environment flow from one frame to the next in the order that they were defined. This is useful for creating posters or magazines or any other form of document that does not conform to the standard one or two column layout. \vfill \caption{The commands used to define the frames for this document g.} \protect\label{fig:thisdoc} \end{staticfigure} \end{staticcontents*} This is a modified version of the manual for the {flowfram} package. It is intended to illustrated what can be done. See the full manual (ffuserguide.pdf) for a comprehensive description, as this may now be out of date. The commands used to define the frames for this document are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:thisdoc}. If the columns are very narrow, it may be better to use {raggedright}, otherwise \TeX\ may have a problem working out the line breaks. \section{Introduction} The {flowfram} package is designed to enable you to create frames in a document such that the contents of the {document} environment flow from one frame to the next in the order that they were defined. This is useful for creating posters or magazines or any other form of document that does not conform to the standard one or two column layout. \section{Setting up Frames} The {flowfram} package provides three types of frame: {flow frames}, {static frames} and {dynamic frames}. \subsection{Flow Frames} The flow frame is the principle type of frame. The text of the {document} environment will flow from one frame to the next in order of definition. Each flow frame has an associated width, height, position on the page, and optionally a border. It is recommended that all the flow frames in a document have the same width, otherwise problems may occur when a paragraph spans to flow frames of unequal widths. This is because \TeX's output routine does not register the change in {hsize} until it reaches a paragraph break. If it is absolutely necessary for flow frames to have unequal widths, judicious use of {framebreak} is required. \end{document}
