Part of it is the F-statistic is well-known. I had a professor who pounded into our heads that any formulation/manipulation of the data was valid and met the criteria of being a 'statistic'. But the challenge was using (or coming up) with ones with known distributions for confidence testing. Because that statistic is distributed with known parameters as an F(-) distribution, it means you can readily rely on tables, papers, software, and theories. But nothing stops you from doing your own, provided the lead somewhere. Imagine if you wanted to measure the height of the average Dutch person. You could measure every person arriving from Holland on a randomly-chosen with a Dutch passport. Or, you could measure the first person off the plane that meets the criteria. Both are reasonable, and indeed unbiased, estimators. But one has a lot more theory and practice around it. You are free to do as you choose in statistics. But you must make it work - and most people stick to proven formulae.
