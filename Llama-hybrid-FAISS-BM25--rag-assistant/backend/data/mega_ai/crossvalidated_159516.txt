Your requirement that "the latency will not exceed some upper limit within the stated confidence value" could mean several different things. I'm going to assume you mean that the latency should be above the limit only 5% of the time. The simplest approach is to model the distribution of latencies with some probability distribution. If you have enough data that you can get a good fit (e.g. there is very little uncertainty about the parameters of the distribution, and it explains the data well) then you just need to look at what proportion of the fitted distribution is above the limit. For example, if your latencies look normally-distributed, you can fit a Gaussian's parameters (mean and standard deviation) to your data. As long as there is very little "wiggle-room" in this fit, then you just need to look at how much of the Gaussian is above the threshold (1 minus the cumulative density function) and show that it is less than 5%. As you alluded to, you could alternatively find the point that is above 95% of the probability mass, and show that this is above your limit. If you don't have enough data to get a good fit, or none of the standard probability distributions are a good match to the shape of your data (Gaussian, Exponential, Gamma, etc.) then you get in a somewhat trickier situation. You could use Bayesian analysis to quantify the "wiggle room" in your fits, to show that even with this uncertainty you don't expect more than 5% of above-threshold latencies. You might just have to collect a large amount of data (~1000 trials) and then just compute the fraction above the limit. If the data are "cyclic," then none of this will apply exactly - this all assumes that every sample you're getting is independent. You may want to try to make the samples as independent as possible, e.g. only keeping every 10th trial, or conducting the experiments in different situations (like different times of day).
