Derivative of the Backshift Operator?

Is there any meaningful sense in which the backshift operator can be said to have a derivative? Here's my attempt at constructing one. Based on some helpful threads on this site, I represent the backshift operator $B$ as a matrix (showed here for an example time series of length $3$ ): $$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} y_1\\ y_2\\ y_3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0\\ y_1\\ y_2 \end{pmatrix}\ . $$ I can take the derivative of the above equation with respect to $y_1$ and $y_2$ to obtain the vectors $(0, 1, 0)$ and $(0, 0, 1)$ respectively (the derivative w.r.t $y_3$ is undefined.) Extrapolating, and wishing to obtain an operator (instead of a vector) from the differentiation process, I conclude that the derivative of the backshift operator is a type of "shifted" indicator function $I_{t}$ which has a straightforward matrix representation. For example, I would write $$ \frac{\partial B}{\partial y_1} = I_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0\\ 1/y_1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\ . $$ Does this calculation have any meaning, or are there some operator-space/common-sense rules which forbid some steps? References would be appreciated.
