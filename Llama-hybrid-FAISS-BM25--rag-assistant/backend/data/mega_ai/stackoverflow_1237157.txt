A glitch in dragging sortable by handle in jquery ui

The problem I have is that whenever I try to drag and drop with a handle, in the process of drag and drop, the body text will not stay aligned with the text, which is illustrated in the code attached at the end. The reason why I prefer not to put the handle in the tags, as some of the examples on the web shows, is that i would like to allow user to in place edit the stuff between the p tags, therefore i don't want to go and do a lot of pre processing (i may add more stuff around the p tags) before displaying the form. If anyone can shed some light on this matter, it would be greatly appreciated! Code, using Google CDN, so it should just work: #container{ width:500; } .handle{ float:left; } . $(function(){ $('#container').sortable({ revert:true, handle:'.handle', }); }); HH Some text here asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asd fasd fsa dfsa df asdf sadf sa dfa sdf sadf asd fsa df sadf asdf asdf asd fas df asdf as HH Some text here asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asd fasd fsa dfsa df asdf sadf sa dfa sdf sadf asd fsa df sadf asdf asdf asd fas df asdf as
