With flat priors, the posterior is identical to the likelihood up to a constant. Thus MLE (estimated with an optimizer) should be identical to the MAP (maximum a posteriori value = multivariate mode of the posterior, estimated with MCMC). If you don't get the same value, you have a problem with your sampler or optimiser. For complex models, it is very common that the marginal modes are different from the MAP. This happens, for example, if correlations between parameters are nonlinear. This is perfectly fine, but marginal modes should therefore not be interpreted as the points of highest posterior density, and not be compared to the MLE. In your specific case, however, I suspect that the posterior runs against the prior boundary. In this case, the posterior will be strongly asymmetric, and it doesn't make sense to interpret it in terms of mean, sd. There is no principle problem with this situation, but in practice it often hints towards model misspecification, or poorly chosen priors.
