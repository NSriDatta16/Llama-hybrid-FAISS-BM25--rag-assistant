If your 3rd Party tool also 'works' like NLB by itself having an additional IP and then randomly picking one of the clustered IPs then the below article should help: http://devproj20.blogspot.com/2007/04/load-balancing-msmq.html (Note that if you are using private$ queues then only one of the servers will actually receive the message, which should be correct) Alternatively, you might look at using a (single) remote queue on a server and then find another way to manage the redundancy of the MSMQ storage? HTH!
