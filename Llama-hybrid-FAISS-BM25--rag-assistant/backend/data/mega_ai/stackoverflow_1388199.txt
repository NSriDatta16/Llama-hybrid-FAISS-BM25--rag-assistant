If your data contains no surprises, you can just replace all instances of \n\n with , followed by replacing all \n with . Then bracket the result with and , and you're done. This doesn't deal with edge cases (for example, three newlines separating paragraphs) but it is pretty simple, and quicker than writing a state machine! Update: Obviously, if you have \n\n\n , \n\n\n\n etc. then you can also replace those with starting with the longer sequences first.
