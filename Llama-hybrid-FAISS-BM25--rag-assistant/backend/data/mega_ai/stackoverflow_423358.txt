I think you need to be pragmatic about it. I'm working on a project that consists of a StatsController. The number of actions is continuously growing (RandomStat, MostPopular, MostViewed, MostVoted, etc...) the list goes on and on. These actions are simple to satisfy since the StatsController's dependencies don't change. I'm using an IoC to satisfy what my Controllers need and when I start to see my Controllers needing references to new objects, this is a signal that they need to be broken apart. If your LoginController, PasswordController, and ProfileController all rely on the same objects, why break them apart?
