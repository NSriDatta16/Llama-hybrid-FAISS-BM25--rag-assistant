How calculate the conditional probabilities for Bayesian hypothesis test?

Suppose that I obtain a sample $S=(S_1,\dots,S_n)$ from my research. The null hypothesis $H_0$ says that all $S_i$ are drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The alternative hypothesis $H_1$ says that $S$ is a sample from a normal distribution with mean 3 and standard deviation 1. Now the Bayes factor is defined by $$\frac{P(S|H_0)}{P(S|H_1)}.$$ How do I calculate $P(S|H_0)$ and $P(S|H_1)$ ? If there are multiple ways, which is best in which situation?
