PHP Caching (HTML + PHP)

I have made a framework for a project. The project does a medium amount of query requests (but the traffic it will be getting will make it more per user). The views are mixed HTML and PHP. Just looking for the best minimalist ways on how I should go about caching my view files (the controller uses output buffering so maybe I can leverage that?) and cache my queries. I've looked around but only could find big/bloated libraries or very crude methods on doing these things, something I'm not interested in. Thanks for the help!
