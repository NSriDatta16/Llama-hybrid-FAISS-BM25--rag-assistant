t-test analysis is different from t-test of that variable in regression

When I run following commands: set.seed(1) y Y variable's average value with respect to x1's 0 and 1 value is not significantly different, but when I include x1 along with other variable, it become significant. Could you please tell me the reason behind it. http://rextester.com/QUD34609
