Is it important in R to convert “integer” variables (with 0 or 1 values) to factors?

I am working on a high-dimensional dataset (1776 variables). When I read the csv file, R loads variables (with 0 or 1 values) as class of "integer". Is it important to convert these variables to factors before building predictive models (e.g gbm, randomForest, SVM, etc.)? What if I want to use PCA to reduce the dimension, is it correct to keep these variables as "integer"? (since PCA does not work with factor variables).
