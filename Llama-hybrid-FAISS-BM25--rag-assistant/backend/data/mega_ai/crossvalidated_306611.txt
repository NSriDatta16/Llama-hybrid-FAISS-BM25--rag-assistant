I would say not--PCA is useful if you want a low dimensional projection, but it sounds like what you want is to find a small number of your original features that give you a predictive variable set. For this you want to look into a sparse approach, either at the model level (something with L1 regularization) or at the pre-processing level, by using something like factor analysis. In a purely mathematical sense this must be true -- if one of the linear combinations has 99% of its magnitude in one original dimension then clearly that dimension accounts for the majority of its projected space. However I don't really see what looking at the loadings give you -- unless your PCA vectors have most of their magnitudes concentrated in a single dimension, you can't say much at all. To look at your example, what you should do -- I would say -- is just compute the variance explained by each of your variables to begin with and don't bother with the PCA.
