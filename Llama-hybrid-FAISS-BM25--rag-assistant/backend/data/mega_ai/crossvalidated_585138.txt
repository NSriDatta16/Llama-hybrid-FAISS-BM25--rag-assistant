Learning stochastic pattern using RNN

I have a pattern of count time series of vehicle demand as shown below.The time series is generated as follows: Categorical Random Variable, x = {0,1,2} and p(x) = {0.6,0.3,0.1} low vehicles = 1 + x , every 4 hours high vehicles = 6 + x , every 8 hours Is it possible for the RNN to learn the categorical distribution of high vehicles every 8 hours? and is it possible for the RNN to learn the categorical distribution of low vehicles every 4 hours? Can the state information capture the proportion of different vehicle counts in the past time steps and also use the vehicle counts in the current time steps to predict (sample out) the correct vehicle count in the next time step after having learnt the vehicle count distribution from the training data? How should I design the layers and number of neurons? I have already tried one layer of keras simpleRNN (72 units) and one dense (linear) output layer but it can only the two periods of 4 hours and 8 hours but not the vehicle count distribution. It is shown below.
