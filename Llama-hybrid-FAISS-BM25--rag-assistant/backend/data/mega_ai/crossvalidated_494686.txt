Variability and profitability are different things. Profits and losses are only realized when you make a sale; that might or might not coincide with a share experiencing price fluctuations. Volatility is one of the easiest statistics to characterize how quickly a price moves. It's just the standard deviation of the price. $$ \hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_i (x_i - \hat{\mu})^2 $$ (The Investopedia article neglects the Bessel correction ; I assume this is because for large $n$ the difference is small and they want an explanation which is accessible to a layman.) There are lots of variations on the idea of volatility, but this should get you started.
