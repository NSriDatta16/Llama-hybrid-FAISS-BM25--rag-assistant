Confused about the different aspects in Machine Learning

After reading different articles about ML and algorithms, scientist tends to use different words when describing the different aspects in ML. So now I'm a bit confused myself and I hope you can correct me if I'm wrong. 1) So to my understanding supervised/unsupervised learning are different categories of machine learning algorithms. Each category contains different algorithms such as Neural Networks and Bayesian? 2) Regression, Classification and Clustering are types of models? 3) A model is the result of a trained algorithm? I hope that I'm not completely wrong, thanks! :)
