A solution for end user to design business process using Windows Workflow Foundation

I want to design a solution using WF, where an end user can design workflows based on their business needs. I want to make the solution as much as flexible where the user does not need to do any code. here are some thoughts - I need to create Custom Activities based on business process. The end user will use a designer(VS 2008) to drag and drop activities to design a workflow. If the end user wants to use EventDrivenActivity to call external methods, then there is a need of an interface which derives from ExternalDataExchange. and events which will be invoked..How this is possible using custom activities. A workflow needs a host to drive the instance of workflow. In my case its a web service. Everytime a new workflow is added, the webservice, which starts the worklfow runtime needs to know the "type" and "parameters" to create and start the workflow instance. This , I think will be the job of a developer to attach it in program. Or is there a way to achieve this declaratively, Say Web service is up on IIS, and a new workflow type is added in the config (I am not sure, just guess..) I want to know, if i am on right track to achieve this solution or missed some . Experts please guide. Thanks.
