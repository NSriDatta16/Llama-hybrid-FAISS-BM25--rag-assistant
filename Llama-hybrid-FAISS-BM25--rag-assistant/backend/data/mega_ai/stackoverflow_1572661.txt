How can I make Zenoss recognize skin changes?

I'm writing a ZenPack for Zenoss which includes a new DataSource. The DataSource has a ToOne relationship with another persistent object and I'm trying to construct the user interface to allow a user to specify the value of this relationship. I've given the DataSource a factory_type_information attribute with an "immediate_view" key mapped to the name of a skin/template - "viewAgentScriptDataSource". In my ZenPack's skins directory, I created viewAgentScriptDataSource.pt. Zenoss seems to have liked this and now when I view an instance of the DataSource, I see a page based on viewAgentScriptDataSource.pt. However, after this first success, any edits I make to the skin/template file are ignored. I tried replacing the dummy content of the file with something more realistic and reloading the data source view. The dummy content still appears. I tried restarting Zenoss and reloading the view. The dummy content still appears. I tried deleting my ZenPack and re-installing it. The dummy content still appears. How do I get Zenoss to load the new contents of the skin file?
