What steps should you take to protect your innovative look and feel?

I have been looking at stacked and it seems that it is marginalizing the heavy financial and intellectual investments made by the creators of Stackoverflow itself. I have been beaten down pretty heavily for bringing up this topic but I think it is an important question programmers, designers, and investors need to consider. I really want to download stacked and roll it out but I cannot think it is the right thing to do. What legal steps should you take to protect your products from open source ripoff? I belive that much of Stackoverflow is innovative and non-obvious to people having skill in the art of programming. Would you pursue patents or different means of protecting your investment? What steps would you take to discourage this practice?
