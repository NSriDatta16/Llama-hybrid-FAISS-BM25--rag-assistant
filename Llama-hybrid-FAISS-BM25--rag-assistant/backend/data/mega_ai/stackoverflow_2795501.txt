I had the same problem. I found this line of code being called while handling the request that I couldn't cache: Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Commenting this out made Output caching start working again. I would have guessed that the line above would only affect Headers sent to the client/browser. Make sure nothing like this is being executed at any point in the page life-cycle.
