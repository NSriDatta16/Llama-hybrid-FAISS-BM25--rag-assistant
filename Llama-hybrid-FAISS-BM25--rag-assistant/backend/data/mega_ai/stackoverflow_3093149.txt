configure tidy to escape the unknown xml tags

I am using tidy to make HTML entered by the user well-formed and i have configured tidy to accept only few html tags. Is there a way i can tell tidy to escape sequence the xml tags that are not known. Example input and the expected output are given below- Input:: this is a paragraph text in unknown tag Expected out:: this is a paragraph &lt;***unknown-tag* &gt; text in unknown tag &lt; /unknown-tag &gt;** Best Regards, Keshav
