I wouldn't call it a screw up unless: It was known how much traffic or performance requirements would grow. And You deliberately designed the system to under-perform. And You deliberately designed the system to be rigid and non adaptable to change. A screw up would have been to over-engineer a highly complex system costing more than what the scale at the time demanded. In fact it is good practice to only invest as much as can currently be leveraged by the business, using growth to fund further investment in scalability, should it be required. It is simple risk management. Surely as the business has grown over time, presumably with the help of your software, they have also set aside something for the next level up. They should be thanking you for helping grow their business beyond expectations, and throwing money at you so you can help them carry through to the next level of growth. All of those three options could be good. Which one is the best depends on cost benefits analysis, ROI etc. It is partially a technical decision but mostly a business one. Congratulations on helping build a growing business up til now, and on to the future.
