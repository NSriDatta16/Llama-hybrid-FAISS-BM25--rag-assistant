There is really no way to address your problem in Taylor's (2003) context. The best you could do is use a lag of 30, which is "roughly" equal to 365.25/12 (at least it's closer than either 29 or 31), and hope that small changes between month lengths average out. However, I'd recommend that you look at De Livera, Hyndman & Snyder (2011) , who propose modeling complex seasonality through Fourier series in their TBATS model (the "T" stands for "trigonometric"). This works with non-integer lags, e.g. 365.25/12, and it requires setting far fewer initial states than Taylor (2003). They implement their method in the tbats() function in the forecast package in R. This recent question , as well as this other recent question on daily forecasting may be helpful.
