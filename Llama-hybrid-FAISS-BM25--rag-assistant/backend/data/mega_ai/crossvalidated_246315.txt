Markov Random Fields vs Hidden Markov Model

I'm kinda new to these topics, I wanted to know if there are any relations between those two topics, Markov Random Fields and Hidden Markov Models (Markov Chains). I feel like they are completely different from each other, though in some sources people tend to say they are related. Thanks in advance!
