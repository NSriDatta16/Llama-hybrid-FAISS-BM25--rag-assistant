Java Swing: Set member which is displayed in JListBox

Is there a comparable mechanism to the .NET "set DisplayMember" for the JListBox Swing component? Overriding the toString() method is not sufficient because I also want to be able to change the display member at runtime. I also looked into implementing my own ListCellRenderer , but found it not very convenient. Ist there a easier or more elegant approach? Thanks for your time.
