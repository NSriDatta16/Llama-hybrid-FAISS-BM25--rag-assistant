I agree with @Sean Owen's above answer. Best Result or best accuracy cant be decided from the validation set because sometimes there may be a possibility that datapoints come in validation set has been seen during training so obviously it will have good accuracy score. Best way to calculate benchmark on test or holdout set. Another way might be one can take an average of all cross-validation score and see model progress.
