What you are trying to do won't work in Java. In Java, attributes declared in a parent class are not overridden in a child class. If you want polymorphic behavior, then you need to declare the attributes private, and declare corresponding getter methods in the parent class that you can override in the child class. Alternatively: class Child extends Parent { public Child() { name = "Child"; doStuff(); } } though @shoebox639's answer does this in a more elegant way that allows you to declare the attribute as final . (Mutable public attributes are not a good idea ...)
