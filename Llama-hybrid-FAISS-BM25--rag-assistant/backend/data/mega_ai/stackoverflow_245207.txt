Not to discourage your project, but if you just want a free and open source alternative to MATLAB , have you looked at the Octave project? Contributing there might be more productive than building your own MATLAB alternative. If your project requires the functionality of MATLAB's Symbolic then take a look at http://wiki.octave.org/wiki.pl?CategorySymbolic From my quick Google search I didn't find anything comparable to MATLAB's Simulink. Also, Python and SciPy do have most of the functionality of MATLAB, and I guess Scilab's conversion utility would be useful in porting your own M-Files into Scilab code. Your question seems to imply you want to port over MATLAB Toolboxes The only thing about symbolic toolbox I've found is this... I hope I am just misinterpreting you. If you are then there might be licensing issues if you were to distribute your system because the MATLAB Toolbox. Just a thought. But perhaps you wish to port your MATLAB code to, so that it doesn't not have the MATLAB dependency. Update For Control System functionality Octave, I just found that Octave does have a toolbox, see: Octave Control Systems Toolbox Which has some of the functionality of Simulink, but it doesn't seem to have the graphical interface for building block diagrams.
