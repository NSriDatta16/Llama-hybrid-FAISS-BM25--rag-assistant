Your pink line clearly does not work because it does not separate two classes. You need a line that goes between the classes such as your other three lines. I will draw similar lines here. Even though each of these lines separates the classes these lines are not good because they are too close to the data points. They work for the training data but if you add new data, the lines may classify them incorrectly. So, we need a line that is farther from the data. Let's draw a margin between each line and the closest data. The larger the margin, the better the line. SVM finds the line with the largest margin. Here, the margin is shown by the dashed lines. The data points through which it goes, are called support vectors.
