Books for learning non parametric Bayesian model

Having studied parametric Bayesian statistics during the two last years, I plan to begin to self-study non parametric Bayesian model during this summer and look for recommendations. I would like the book(s) to cover both the theoritical aspects and the practical ones (with implementation, examples of models ...) Thanks for your recommendations.
