In engineering version control is often underestimated whereas it is essential to restore given settings in order to repeat experiments. For general adoption easy to use, mostly GUI oriented, tools help a lot. Leveraging version control with issue tracking that relates issues to code commits increases productivity tremendously. Concerning repository structure, at least looking at subversion, there are just conventions but no strict rules imposed by the tool. What about having a tree called 'trunk' where all 'common code' is managed. For every engineering task there is a branch created. Which is nothing else than a 'project folder' with version control. Source code relevant to other projects will be merged back to trunk.
