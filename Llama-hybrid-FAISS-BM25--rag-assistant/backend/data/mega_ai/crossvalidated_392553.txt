Stepwise logistic regression: What exactly is meant by eliminating features based on contribution?

I would like to know how my program is selecting and removing features during stepwise regression. I'm using R's caret package which in turn I think is using stepAIC from the MASS package. I was reading the MASS documentation here (pdf). However, I could not find any reference to what criteria are used during each iteration of adding or subtracting a feature. I recall reading a paragraph of text, I think within the well known ISLR book that stepwise regression optimizes to p-values/feature significance on step backwards regression, RSS on stepforwards, and then both during mixed. Don't quote me on that though. Does the direction/method determine which criteria are used to pick features (pvalue significance, RSS, both)? Is it some combination of the above 3 criteria that are used?
