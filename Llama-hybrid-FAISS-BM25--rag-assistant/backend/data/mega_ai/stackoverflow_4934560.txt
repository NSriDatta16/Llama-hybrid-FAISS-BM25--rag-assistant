Best way to create a hightraffic temporary database, in-memory or SQL?

i this project, that will be create a "NAT-T server" It is a Server listing in some port, where clients send their ID, IP, Port and the server keep their last-contact time, for purge olders clients. The ID is UNIQUE and is how the clients will be located. The problem is that it have to handle 15k transactions per second. The database donÂ´t need to be stored. The average tracked clients should be 200k. How could be the best way to implement it, with a SQL server or with a data-structure ? Witch data structure ?
