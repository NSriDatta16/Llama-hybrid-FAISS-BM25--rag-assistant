Graph Neural Network - Node and Global properties

I am trying to work with Graph neural networks. I am trying to use the 3d coordinates and some othe things related to those positions as features. However the whole system also has some global properties like the spread in x,y or z dimension and few others which by already know knowledge must have some dependence on target output variable. However. I don't know how to work together with node and global properties together for graph neural networks. Can anyone help.
