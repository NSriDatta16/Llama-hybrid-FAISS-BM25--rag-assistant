Using MSTest as site/environment monitoring tool

We currently use Hp SiteScope for monitoring synthetic transactions across some of our web apps. This works pretty well except for the licensing cost for each synthetic transaction makes it prohibitive to ensure adequate coverage across our applications. So, an alternative would be to use SiteScope's URL monitoring which can basically call a URL and then provide some basic checks for the certain strings. With that approach, I'd like to create a page that either calls a bunch of pages or try to tap into a MSTest group somehow to run tests. In the end, I'd like a set of test cases that can be used against multiple environments to be used for production verification, uptime, status, etc. Thanks, Matt
