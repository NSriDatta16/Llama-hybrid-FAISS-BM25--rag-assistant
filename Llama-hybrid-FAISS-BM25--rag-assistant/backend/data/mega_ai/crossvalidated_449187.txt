You could use logistic regression. If you represent your likert, that is ordinal, predictor with numerical codes $1,2, \dotsc$ , then use also a quadratic term to represent possible nonlinearity in the effects, or maybe even with a spline. For an example with a monotone spline, see Looking for function to fit sigmoid-like curve . For some other ideas see How do you estimate correlations between ordinal and binary data in SPSS? and specifically Correlations between continuous and categorical (nominal) variables .
