Identifying non-linearities in relationship between variables

Logistic regression is often used to identify the effect of $x$ on a binary variable $y$ after adjusting for potential confounders $x_1,...,x_n$ . In the medical literature, I will sometimes encounter a statement as follows: The relationships between $x_1,...,x_n$ and $y$ were each evaluated to identify non-linear relationships. When a non-linear relationship was identified, cut-offs were visually chosen to categorize the variable. That is, the non-linear nature of the relationship was "accounted for" by categorization. As expounded upon here and elsewhere , this is not good practice for a number of reasons. The issues with this approach not-withstanding, I realize that I am not sure exactly how this visualization can be done. The most obvious interpretation is that they are visualizing the $x_i$ vs. $y$ plots for each $i$ . However, this does not account for correlations between the $x_i$ . That is, if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are not independent, then the relationship between $y$ and $x_1$ might be affected by inclusion of $x_2$ in the model--potentially rendering the cut-offs meaningless. How can one visualize the relationship between $y$ and $x_i$ while adjusting for the other $x_j$ for $j\neq i$ ? I think this can be done by regressing all the other $x_j$ to $y$ , and then somehow plotting the residual against $x_i$ . Would this be the "correct" procedure? If the relationship between $y$ and $x_i$ changes when you include $x_j$ for $j\neq i$ , then in what "order" would you then categorize the variables? Again, this is not a question about the pitfalls of categorization. Rather, I am trying to understand how categorization by visualization could even be done in the first place, when the relationship between $x_i$ and $y$ is affected by the other covariates.
