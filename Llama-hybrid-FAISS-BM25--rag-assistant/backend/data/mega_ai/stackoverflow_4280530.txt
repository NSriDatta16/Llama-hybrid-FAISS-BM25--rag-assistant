There is no 'mouse drag event'. You'll have to sub-class the control. Record the mouse position in the WM_LBUTTONDOWN message handler and capture the mouse. Then check it against the current mouse position in the WM_MOUSEMOVE message handler. It the button is still down and the distance is larger than GetSystemMetrics, SM_CXDOUBLECLK and SM_CYDOUBLECLK then make that your mouse drag event.
