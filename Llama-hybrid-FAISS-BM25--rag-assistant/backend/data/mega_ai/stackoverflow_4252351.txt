Plugins are being used less and less so stick with gems. Gems and plugins can do exactly the same thing so that is why they are confusing. However the differences are how they are organized and most importantly how gems are managed such as bundler or config.gem . It is much easier to manage gems and their versions. Plugins must be installed in the vendor folder where as gems can also be installed in that folder if they need to be customized or they can be installed in a gem directory as long as rails understands where that directory is located. When rails started most people used plugins to added functionality but developers quickly realized that gems offered a better way to package and update libraries so most plugins have migrated to gems and fewer plugins are being built.
