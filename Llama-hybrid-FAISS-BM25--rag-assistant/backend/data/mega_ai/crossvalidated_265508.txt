Pareto Chart v.s. machine learning feature selection

A Pareto chart could be used to show which factors have the greatest impact and where attention is likely to yield the greatest benefit. Also common machine learning feature selection methods can simplify model, reduce training times, overfitting etc. Both techniques are used to pay attention to some bolded features. I want to what the benefits are to use one policy instead of another one?
