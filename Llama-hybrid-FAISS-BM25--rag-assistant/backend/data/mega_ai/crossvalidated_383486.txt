Books for data sources

There are many books on data science that describe in detail learning algorithms and methods. But another important step in data science is data collection and feature engineering. Are there books solely devoted to this topic? The book should be a collection of several data sets, recommendations on how these datasets were obtained and then cleaned. Discussion of Feature engineering will be a bonus but not required. I am looking for seminal books that cover the process of collecting a wide variety of datasets for academic research purpose.
