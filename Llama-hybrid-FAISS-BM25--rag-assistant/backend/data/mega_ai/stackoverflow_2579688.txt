Iphone Link Static Library

I have created a static library in XCode called TestLib. I then created a simple test project that will use this library. I dragged the TestLib xcode project into my test project (frameworks section - if it matters), and set TestLib as a direct dependency of the test project. I am having trouble importing header files from the Library, I only have 1 in there (its a test project) called TestLibHeader.h, but no matter how I attempt to import them, I get compile errors stating that the header file cannot be found. Where am I going wrong?
