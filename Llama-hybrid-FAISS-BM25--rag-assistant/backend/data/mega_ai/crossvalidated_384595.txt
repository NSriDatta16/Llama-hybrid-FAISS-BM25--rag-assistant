Does X^2 divided to DF converge to F distribution when X^2 is Rao Scott chi squared statistic?

I'm studying Rao-Scott chi-squared test, kind of survey sampling analysis method. It uses when we want to test independence between two variables under complex sampling data instead of Pearson chi-squared test. simply, R*C two way table. As I see the paper (Thomas and Rao, 1987), the Rao-Scott statistic approximately converge to chi-squared distribution. But Thomas and Rao said that if Rao-Scott statistic(denoted X^2) divided into df(degree of freedom, (R-1)(C-1)), then it approximately converge to F distribution. But I have no idea how to induce this result. As I know, F statistic organize "(X1^2/v1)/(X2^2/v2) ~ F" when X1 and X2 are independent. But the paper just said "approximately X^2/df ~ F". And there is no procedure about this conclusion. So I searched to solve this problem. I found this formula in wikipedia(chi-squred distribution - Relation to other distiribution; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution ) which is Is this relate to my problem? If not, How can I solve my problem? furthermore, How can I get the paper which concluded that formula? Please let me know either of them. Thank you for your patient. English is not my first language. maybe reading is so hard. Thanks again!
