The built-in WinForms DGV does not support grouping. Here is an article where someone has added this functionality themselves (note that I have not used this myself and so am not making a recommendation): http://blogs.vbcity.com/hotdog/archive/2008/12/19/9226.aspx Alternately there are countless third-party DGV controls for sale. Infragistics has an excellent one that I can recommend which does provide grouping: http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/winforms/wingrid.aspx#Overview
