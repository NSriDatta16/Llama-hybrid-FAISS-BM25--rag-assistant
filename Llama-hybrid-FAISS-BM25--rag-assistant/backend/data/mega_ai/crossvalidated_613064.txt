Calculate difference in log odds between two logistic regression models

I would like to calculate the difference in log-odds between the error of two logistic regression models, given the correct answer aka ground truth (depression present ${}= 1;$ depression absent ${} = 0$ ) and the predicted probabilities of depression being present from each model (pA and pB). I believe the formulas are as follows: When the correct answer is that depression is present: $$=(\log(1) - \log(1-pA)) - (\log(1) - \log(1-pB)).$$ This should reduce to: $$=\log\left(\frac{1-pB}{1-pA}\right)$$ When the correct answer is that depression is absent: $$=(\log(0) - \log(pA)) - (\log(0) - \log(pB)).$$ I think that might reduce to the following, since the undefined $=\log(0)$ terms cancel each other out: $$=\log\left(\frac{pB}{pA} \right)$$ But I'm not sure if the ${}=\log(0)$ terms can actual cancel each other out here. Are these the correct formulas or am I wrong? Is this the correct way to calculate the difference in log-odds between two logistic regression models?
