Accessing parent window through Javascript (when child window's URL is on another server)

I understand that ajax can't go cross-server. So I am trying to just access my parent window, like change its location. So it works when the child page is on the same server but not when it is on another server. For example: parenttest.html: Click here childtest.html opener.document.location="http://www.cnn.com"; So this works when childtest is on the same server but not when it is on another server. Why can't I even access the opening window that popped up the pop-up window? thanks
