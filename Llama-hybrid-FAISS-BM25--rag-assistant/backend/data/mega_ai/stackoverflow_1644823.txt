Problems with char(4) FK, entity framework

I'm having a char(4) FK reltionship, and it gives me lots of errors when I use that in my designer. I have a relation between tables: BookingObjects 1:* IntervalEntities, and it is a char(4) PK in the IntervalEntities table. Error 9 Error 3007: Problem in Mapping Fragments starting at lines 813, 1037: Non-Primary-Key column(s) [IntervalEntityID] are being mapped in both fragments to different conceptual side properties - data inconsistency is possible because the corresponding conceptual side properties can be independently modified. and: Error 10 Error 3012: Problem in Mapping Fragments starting at lines 813, 1037: Data loss is possible in BookingObjects.IntervalEntityID. An Entity with Key (PK) will not round-trip when: (PK does NOT play Role 'BookingObject' in AssociationSet 'FK_BookingObjects_IntervalEntities' AND PK is in 'BookingObjects' EntitySet) What can be wrong? /M
