Image strategy in iPhone app

I'm writing a card game for the iPhone, and I'm not sure about the best strategy for displaying the cards. I have a basic prototype that creates a UIImageView that can be dragged for each card with a dummy image. I wanted to use one large UIImage that contains the faces of all of the cards, and then have each draggable UIImageView display a part of that image. I must be misunderstanding what setBounds is for - I thought that controlled which part of the underlying image is displayed. So, two questions: Is this the right approach? How do I display just a part of the image?
