What is the relationship between discriminative and generative and directed and undirected graphical models?

I feel that most generative models happen to be DGM(directed graphical model), and most discriminative models are UGM(undirected graphical model). Is there any correlation between these concepts? generative model and DGM, e.g. Navie Bayes/Mixture Gaussian/HMM discriminative model and UGM, e.g. Logistic regression/CRFs generative model and UGM:? Ising Model ( $p(x,y)=\frac{\exp(-E(x,y))}{Z}$ ) discriminative and DGM: any examples? In generative model(or DGM), we model the joint probability $P(X,Y|\theta)$ ( $\theta$ is hyperparameter, $X$ is hidden variable). The objective is to maximize the marginals $P(Y|\theta)$ w.r.t $\theta$ . Because we specify the joint distribution, we can make inference about $X$ . For discriminative model(or UGM), we specify $P(Y|X,\theta)$ and try to maximize it directly. e.g. Logistic regression, $\operatorname{logit}[P(Y_n=1|x_n)]=\beta x_n$
