modal dialog in jquery that doesn't block the whole site

how to achieve this? let's say that I have 3 dialogs A, B and C. I can work with them at the same time by having them one next to the other, drag them around, put them one on top of another, etc... now, at some point, the B dialog opens a dialog X. I must still be able to work with dialogs A and C but I must not be able to work with B until I close X. like the "modal" approach of visual basic thanks in advance!!
