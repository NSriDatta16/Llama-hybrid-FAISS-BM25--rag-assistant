Is there i.i.d. assumption on logistic regression?

Is there i.i.d. assumption on the response variable of logistic regression? For example, suppose we have $1000$ data points. It seems the response $Y_i$ is coming from a Bernoulli distribution with $p_i=\text{logit}^{-1}(\beta_0+\beta_1 x_i)$ . Therefore, we should have $1000$ Bernoulli distributions, with different parameter $p$ . So, they are "independent", but are not "identical". Am I right? PS. I learned logistic regression from "machine learning" literature, where we optimize the objective function and check if it is good in testing data, without talking too much about assumptions. My question started with this post Understand Link Function in Generalized Linear Model Where I try to learn more on statistical assumptions.
