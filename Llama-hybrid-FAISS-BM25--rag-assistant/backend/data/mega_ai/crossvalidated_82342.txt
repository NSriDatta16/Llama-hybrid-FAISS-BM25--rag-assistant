As far as R mechanics are asked you can do stuff like that (as hinted towards in my comment): #raw observations of number of days in hospital data1 = c(1,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,6,7,8) data2 = c(1,2,2,3,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,8) #histograms for first analysis hist(data1,nclass=8) hist(data2,nclass=8) #q-q Plots for further graphic analysis qqnorm(data2) qqnorm(data1) #Shapiro test from stats package require(stats) shapiro.test(data1) shapiro.test(data2) #Hartiganâ€™s dip test statistic for unimodality from diptest require(diptest) dip(data1) dip(data2) For really understanding the results delivered by these tests or how to interpret the graphs you should definitely look for appropriate statistics guidance. For starters, this answer on shapiro.test() would be a good start: https://stackoverflow.com/a/15427746/3124909
