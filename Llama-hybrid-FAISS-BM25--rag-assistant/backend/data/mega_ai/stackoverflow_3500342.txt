Is it possible to add a custom folder inside 'drawable' folder of an Android app?

I created this folder, tab_bar, inside 'drawable' and added barbgnd.png. And then in my code, I tried to access it using android:background="@drawable/tab_bar/barbgnd" However, I got this error error: Error: No resource found that matches the given name (at 'background' with value '@drawable/tab_bar/barbgnd'). My objective is to further organize the files inside the drawable folder.. i.e. all images used in a Navigation Bar component in one folder, etc. Is this not possible? Thanks!
