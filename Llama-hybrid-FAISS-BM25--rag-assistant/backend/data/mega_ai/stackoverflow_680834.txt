Hadoop Hbase: Spreading column families across tables or not

The Hbase documentation makes it clear that you should group similar columns into column families, because the physical storage is done by column family. But what does it mean to put two column families into the same table, as opposed to having separate tables per column group? Are there specific cases when "partitioning" tables this way makes more sense, and cases when one "wide" table works better? Separate tables should result in separate "row regions", which could be beneficial when some column families (as a whole) are very sparse. Conversely, when would it be advantageous to have columns families bunched together?
