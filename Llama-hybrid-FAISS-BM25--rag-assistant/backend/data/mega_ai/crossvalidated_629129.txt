Would ordinal logistic regression be appropriate in this case?

I have 2 independent variables with 2 categories each: 'gender' (male, female) and 'relationship status' (married, single), and one DV: 'emotional impact' measured on a 10 point scale ranging from 1 (least) to 10 (most). What test do I use? Would it be ordinal logistic regression?
