If "diagnosis" is coded as either 0 or 1, then your interpretation is in the ballpark. There are issues with causality, ceteris paribus, and estimates vs actual, but you have the right idea. But the result is indeed strange, so I would guess that you have something like 0,100 instead of 0,1 for "diagnosis"; or that the "smoothness" variable has a very small sdev so that a one unit increase is out of bounds; or maybe that there is extreme multicollinearity, which might imply a one unit increase is out of bounds, ceteris paribus. Or maybe there is some other mistake, like reading the output wrong. Finally, you should use logistic regression here.
