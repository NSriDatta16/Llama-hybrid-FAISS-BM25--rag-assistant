Move multiple BufferedImage in Java2D?

How can I mousedrag different BufferedImages in Java2D? For instance, if I have ten or more images, how can I move that images which my mouse is over? Now I'm importing an BufferedImage with BufferedImage img = new BufferdImage(new File("filename")); And I'm painting this with Graphics2D with public void paintComponent(Graphics g) { super.paintComponent(g); g2d = (Graphics2D) g; g2d.drawImage(img, x1, y1, null); g2d.drawImage(img2, x2, y2,null); } Everytime I'm moving on a image I'm repaint()-ing the entire screen. My mousemove class is as follows class MouseMotionHandler extends MouseMotionAdapter { @Override public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) { x1 = e.getX() - (img.getWidth() / 2); y1 = e.getY() - (img.getHeight() / 2); repaint(); } } With this method I'm able to "drag" one picture, but what to do when I will drag more individually?
