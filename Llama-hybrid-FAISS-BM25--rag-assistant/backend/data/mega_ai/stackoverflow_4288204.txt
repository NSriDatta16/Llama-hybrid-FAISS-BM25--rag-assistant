XCode doesn't show developer profile, devices, or simulator choices

My Macbook Pro was damaged and I have to take it to Apple to get a new Hard Drive. The old one would not boot but I was able to recover my projects from it. I opened a project and actually revoked and reset my certificate, etc in the provisioning portal. I also reinstalled my device (iPhone) in the organizer. Everything looks fine in the organizer except nothing shows up under "Developer Profile". I cleaned all targets also and restarted XCode. The profiles are there in the target and projects settings but they are grey so I cannot click on them. I only have ios 4.2 as a choice for SDK's (No simulator and no iPhone even though it's connected and ready in the organizer)
