I would try and keep it as small as possible. The app-store could probably support, say, a 100MB application, but it wont be nice to install for users. The problem is installing via the phone - all you get is a simple progress bar, and most people have their phone auto-lock after 1 minute.. So, ideally the app would download in under a minute on an average connection..
