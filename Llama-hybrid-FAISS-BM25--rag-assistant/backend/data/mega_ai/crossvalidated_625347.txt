This ended up longer than I originally intended and I am kind of strapped for time, so apologies if I misunderstood your questions or answered sloppily! I might be misunderstanding how you are interpreting statements (1) and (2), but to me it seems like (1) expresses: $$ E[Y^{T=1}] - E[Y^{T=0}] $$ While (2) expresses: $$ E[Y^{T=1} - Y^{T=0}] $$ Both are valid ways of expressing the ATE. Notice that estimating the ATE is inherently about contrasting counterfactual worlds. Essentially, if we (hypothetically) had a copy of our universe, we could give our study population treatment $T=0$ in one world, treatment $T=1$ in the other world, and then contrast the mean outcome in each world to calculate a sample causal effect. The same identifiability conditions apply to both researcher A and researcher B and both have the issue that they would need a second world to observe all potential outcomes for study participants. This applies regardless of how potential outcomes are assigned in each world. You can communicate the definition of the ATE either way depending on preferences or your research question. Let me jump to point (4): What you are outlining here is a violation of the stable unit treatment value assumption (usually abbreviated SUTVA and also known as no interference). Essentially, if your study participant's potential outcomes depend on the treatment assigned to other participants, potential outcomes do not immediately translate to a causal effect. If some participant $i=1$ smokes a lot around other participants, such that $i=2$ and $i=3$ have their baby's birthweight caused in part by $i=1$ , an individual causal effect cannot easily be defined, which means that the ATE cannot easily be defined. You are asking a very good question here, but the unfortunate answer is that this would be a problem in any study, including in a (hypothetical) randomized trial addressing smoking and birth weight. The reason that the causal effects defined by researchers A and B appear to differ is therefore just an unfulfilled identifiability condition. About statement (3): Yes, you cannot know that an estimated causal effect will exactly apply to you, but interpreting it this way would be a mistake in other settings too. The ATE defines an operation on sample means. I do not expect an ATE to apply to me the same way I (obviously) do not expect to be the same average height or age as people in Germany. Let us say we perform a randomized controlled trial to assess whether or not smoking influences birth weight in pregnant people. To avoid SUTVA violations, we only sample participants living far away from each other, such that they are not exposed to each other's second-hand-smoke. We then randomly either force people to smoke ( $T=1$ ) or to not smoke ( $T=0$ ). If there is no loss to follow-up, $E[Y|T=1]-E[Y|T=0]$ estimates the sample ATE, defined as $ E[Y^{T=1}] - E[Y^{T=0}] $ . A 95% confidence interval around this estimate will contain the true sample ATE in 95% of studies, had we repeated the experiment many times. The same interpretations apply (under the identifiability conditions) to observational studies in causal inference, if they intend to estimate the ATE. In every randomized controlled trial we therefore have the issue that we only have an estimate of a difference in sample means (observational studies have the additional burden of being unable to guarantee exchangeability). Whether estimated ATE's apply to individuals depends on expert knowledge and the generalizability/transportability of study results. Not smoking during pregnancy is unambiguously good. In medical settings, a new drug that shows superiority over previous treatments might not be superior for everyone, but we expect it to be an improvement over current treatments on average and can make individual treatment decisions informed by the literature.
