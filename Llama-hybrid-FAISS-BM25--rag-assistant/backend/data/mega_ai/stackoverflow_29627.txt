I thought you meant pagination of the printed page - that's where I cut my teeth. I was going to enter a great monologue about collecting all the content for the page, positioning (a vast number of rules here, constrait engines are quite helpful) and justification... but apparently you were talking about the process of organizing information on webpages. For that, I'd guess database hits. Disk access is slow. Once you've got it in memory, sorting is cheap.
