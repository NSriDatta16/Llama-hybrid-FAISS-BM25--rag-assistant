Downcasting makes sense, if you have an Object of derived class but it's referenced by a reference of base class type and for some reason You want it back to be referenced by a derived class type reference. In other words You can downcast to reverse the effect of previous upcasting. But You can't have an object of base class referenced by a reference of a derived class type.
