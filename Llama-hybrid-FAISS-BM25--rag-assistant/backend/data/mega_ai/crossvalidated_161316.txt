What Ross Ihaka is discussing is (as he explains) a simultaneous confidence band for the points in the QQ-plot based on a Komogorov-Smirnov interval for $F$ ; a point falling outside the band would correspond to rejection by the KS-test. However, note that the bound from the KS-test is predicated on $\mu$ and $\sigma$ being known. The existence of some value for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ laying within the bands is equivalent to estimating those quantities (whence the test is no longer distribution free, and the bounds too wide -- for which then values from a Lilliefors test would be necessary). So if Ihaka is actually doing what he says, the interval would be too wide to be interpreted as a CI with the claimed coverage. What Ihaka discusses there may or may not be the same thing as what's in the plot you show in your question.
