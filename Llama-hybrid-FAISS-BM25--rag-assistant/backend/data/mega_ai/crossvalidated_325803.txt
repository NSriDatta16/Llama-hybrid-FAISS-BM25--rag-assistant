Retraining CNN Model

I have created my CNN model which takes data from training set folder and from test set folder, now in each training set folder I have added some sub folders to both the folders. I have trained my model on given data but what if I want to expand the learning of my model? If I add another folder in my training set and in test test, I have to retrain my model completely. How can i save time in this situation? Suppose I have already added 5 folders in training set and in test test and trained it on those and then I wish to expand data and add two new folders of data into training and test set, I have to re-run my model again completely and retrain it again. Can anyone enlighten me on this?
