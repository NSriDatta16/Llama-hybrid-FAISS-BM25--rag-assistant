Since you have two matrices (memory- and attention related groups of variables), and want to know the relationship between them, I would suggest a PLS analysis (partial least squares). PLS fits variables between two matrices and identifies these which have the largest explanatory power on the other set of data. One way of understanding it is that one set of variables contains the independent variables (X, memory), the other one contains the dependent variables (Y, anxiety). However, one can also run PLS in a canonical mode in which the relationship is symmetrical and you do not assume that one set is dependent. In R, a package implementing PLS / SPLS (sparse PLS) is called "mixOmics" and I had v. good experience using it.
