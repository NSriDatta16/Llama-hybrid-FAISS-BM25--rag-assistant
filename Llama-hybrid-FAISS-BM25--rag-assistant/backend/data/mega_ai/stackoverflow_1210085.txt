Keeping separate repositories allows you to customize backup schedules and storage locations on a per repository basis. Also, if you occasionally have to dig into the repository and perform some maintenance or cleanup actions (say, you want to delete a commit from the repo entirely... rare but possible) keeping separate repositories will allow you to do so with minimum interference to other users and other repos. That being said - for small projects, these things are typically not a big concern. I give another hearty recommendation to the trunk/branches/tags setup.
