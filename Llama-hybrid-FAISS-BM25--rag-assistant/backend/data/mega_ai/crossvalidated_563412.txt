If these are fits on training data, Lasso and Bayesian regression models are supposed to not fit the training data as well as simple linear regression. This is to avoid overfitting. However, a negative r-squared value on training data indicates that something has gone wrong, although I can't say what from the information provided. If these are fits on test data, the results would indicate that Lasso/Bayes are underfitting the data, and you can easily find resources on how to avoid this.
