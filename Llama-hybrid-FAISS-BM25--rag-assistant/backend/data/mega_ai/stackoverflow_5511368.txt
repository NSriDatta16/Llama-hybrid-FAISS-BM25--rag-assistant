The user doesn't have to install Visual Studio in order to use an app built in C#. They do have to have the .NET framework installed, however. Modern versions of Windows have come with .NET preinstalled for a while, and they've been part of Windows update, too - obviously the earlier the version of .NET you target, the more computers you're likely to be able to run on. I expect that targeting .NET 2.0 should give pretty good coverage, although that way you miss the goodies from LINQ etc. While there are "native" compilers for .NET, I don't know of any mainstream ones... the Mono AOT is probably the closest to mainstream, but I haven't used it myself.
