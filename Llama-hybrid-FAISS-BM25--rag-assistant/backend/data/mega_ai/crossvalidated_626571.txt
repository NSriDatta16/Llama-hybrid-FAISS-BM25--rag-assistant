I did a multivariate linear regression however the results are not what I expected

I'm working on a personal project trying to model the Electricity consumption of a furnace, using R. After creating my code I get this results for my model: R2_adj N_Test N_trained_data E_relative RMSE 0.1022 1104 2593 0.03979 23.22kwht My R2_adj is not great, however the model can somewhat precisely predict the output of electricity is this correct? If it is, how do I explain it? The first image is the distribution of the data The second image is the distribution of Errors and its average error The last image is the real consumption cs the consumption predicted by the model. I would appreciate greatly your help I don't know if the model can be useful
