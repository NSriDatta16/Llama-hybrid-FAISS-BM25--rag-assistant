I totally enjoy CodeIgniter . It doesn't have the magic functions of CakePHP/Rails, but it automatically comes with a good MVC setup and a good basic library for forms, ActiveRecord implementation, dealing with POST data sanitization, and other nice things that I just don't prefer to deal with every project. Their intro video on making a blog is all it took me to get hooked. Good syntax, good practices... Can't recommend it enough for your size/style project. EDIT As noted by commenters, I'll line up the pluses as bullet points: Small File Size (download is 2.1MB, but actual files for use ~1.5MB) Libraries and helpers called on demand -> minimizes memory usage Great docs . Not a big fan personally of the drop-from-top effect, but they're written in readable English with good examples Extensible - good number of libraries written by the community Encourages MVC architecture Good built-in security features
