I don't know if something like this exists. However, I don't find a real gain in requests to the server, as with the usual server-side MVC you can download the template only once and request just the JSON data (perhaps moving some of the model's behaviour to JS). Also, remember that 10 requests of 1kb of data to the server will take longer than 1 request of 10kb. If you have more requests with less data you may experience higher delays. One big downside that I find to this idea is that you are exposing all your code. You may obfuscate it, but it is still there for anyone to see it. A big upside: it might work offline if you implement some offline storage with a minimum of data.
