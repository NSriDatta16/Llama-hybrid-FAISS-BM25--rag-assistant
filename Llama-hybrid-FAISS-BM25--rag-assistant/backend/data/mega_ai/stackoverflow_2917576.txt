Also, if you are really worried, there is 'MFA Delete'. (MFA == Multi Factor Authorization) With MFA - Delete 'on' - which requires versioning, no one can delete files from S3 unless they have a physical key - fob thingy that has a constantly changing number on it that needs to be entered so you can delete the file.
