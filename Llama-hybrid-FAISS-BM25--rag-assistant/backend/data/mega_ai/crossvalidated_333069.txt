I would try PCA analysis. Get the first principal component of all three variables, and use it in regression. It's becoming popular in econometrics these days. You know that all three variables are important, so instead of picking on of three, you pick a linear combination of all three. For example, see the last paragraph in section 2.3 of this paper: Mihov, Atanas and Curti, Filippo and Abdymomunov, Azamat, U.S. Banking Sector Operational Losses and the Macroeconomic Environment (July 5, 2017). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2738485 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2738485 : To condense the information contained in GDP Growth, HPI Growth, CREPI Growth, VIX and BBB-T10 Cred Sprd into a single measure of macroeconomic activity, we apply the method of principal component analysis (PCA). Following prior studies (e.g., Stock and Watson (1999), Ludvigson and Ng (2007), Koopman et al. (2011), Sarlin (2016)), we use PCA as a dimension-reduction methodology to relate observed variables to a small set of orthogonalized factors/components. In our analysis, we focus solely on the first principal component as our measure of the macroeconomic environment, ME, as it adequately summarizes variation in the underlying data by explaining a high proportion of the variables’ variances — 69%.15 You can call you new variable "person size" factor.
