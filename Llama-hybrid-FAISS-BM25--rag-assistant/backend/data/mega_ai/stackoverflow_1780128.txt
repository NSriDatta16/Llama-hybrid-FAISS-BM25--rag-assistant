You're not comparing like with like. JavaMail talks SMTP to hand off to the nearest mail server. Sendmail is a Mail Transfer agent responsible for routing emails to their destination. A common setup is a java application using JavaMail to relay email via SMTP to a Sendmail server. The two are not competitors, they're used together. A sendmail server should be able to accept deliveries from javamail faster than any java application can produce them, but then it delivers them asynchronously at its own rate.
