plot more than 2 PCAs in 2D in R

I have done a PCA analysis where 7 PCAs explain about 80% of cumulative variation in the data. I would like to plot the scores for all 7 PCAs in R but not sure on how to achieve it. When I use biplot function, it plots scores for all PCAs (16 in total in my case), and the plot becomes rather messy. Rest by general plotting, I am only able to a make a 2D plot with PCA 1 and PCA 2. Is there a way I can plot only 7 PCAs in 2 dimension like how biplot does? Thanks bunch in advance!
