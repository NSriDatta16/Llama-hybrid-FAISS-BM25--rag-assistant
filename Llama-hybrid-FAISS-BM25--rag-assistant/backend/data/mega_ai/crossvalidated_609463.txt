There are no numbers would immediately be obviously wrong. The only possibility would be numbers that are mathematically impossible, such as odds ratios that are negative. In general, regression coefficients are keyed to the units of your data, so you could make the coefficients arbitrarily large or small by converting, say, length data between nanometers and kilometers. If there is some well grounded reason to believe that the variables 'should' be significant, there are a couple possibilities. First, as @Henry notes , you could have multicollinearity. You can check VIFs for this. If you have it, you won't be able to get highly informative tests of individual variables, but you could get a simultaneous test of the collinear variables and show that something in there somewhere is related to the outcome. With logistic regression (or ordinal, or multinomial), another possibility is that there is complete separation in your dataset. You can simply use a different type of test, such as a likelihood ratio test or a score test. You can also get CIs based on the likelihoods or score functions. To learn more about those topics, try reading some of our threads categorized under the multicollinearity and separation tags (you may want to sort by 'votes' or 'frequent' and start reading down from the top).
