Suppose that you want to test the hypothesis that the average height of men is "5 ft 7 inches". You select a random sample of men, measure their heights and calculate the sample mean. Your hypothesis then is: $H_0: \mu = 5\ \text{ft} \ 7 \ \text{inches}$ $H_A: \mu \ne 5\ \text{ft} \ 7 \ \text{inches}$ In the above situation you do a two-tailed test as you would reject your null if the sample average is either too low or too high. In this case, the p-value represents the probability of realizing a sample mean that is at least as extreme as the one we actually obtained assuming that the null is in fact true. Thus, if observe the sample mean to be "5 ft 8 inches" then the p-value will represent the probability that we will observe heights greater than "5 ft 8 inches" or heights less than "5 ft 6 inches" provided the null is true. If on the other hand your alternative was framed like so: $H_A: \mu > 5\ \text{ft} \ 7 \ \text{inches}$ In the above situation you would a one-tailed test on the right side. The reason is that you would prefer to reject the null in favor of the alternative only if the sample mean is extremely high. The interpretation of the p-value stays the same with the slight nuance that we are now talking about the probability of realizing a sample mean that is greater than the one we actually obtained. Thus, if observe the sample mean to be "5 ft 8 inches" then the p-value will represent the probability that we will observe heights greater than "5 ft 8 inches" provided the null is true.
