What is the Dirichlet Proces Mixture Models posterior

I am trying to understand Dirichlet Process Mixture models. One of the videos I have been watching is by Tamara Broderick . I think it is a very good introductory video to Dirichlet Process mixture models. Another resource I am looking at is by radford Neal which talks about MCMC sampling for the posterior distribution of Dirichlet Porcess Mixture Models. Both videos also talk about sampling from the posterior distribution of a DP mixture, however I am not sure why the posterior distributions Neal and Tamara refers to are different. In particular, Tamara Broderick does not talk about updating the cluster parameters $\mu_k$ but rather only the cluster assignments $z_i$ . radford Neal on the other hand talks about sampling a new cluster mean $\mu_k$ from the posterior at every step of gibbs sampling. (Algorithm 2) I have a few questions regarding. What is the posterior distribution of a DP mixture model ? What is the difference between Tamara Broderick and radford Neal method ?
