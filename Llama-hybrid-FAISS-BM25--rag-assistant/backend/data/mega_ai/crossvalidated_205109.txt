Time varying copula vs. dynamic copula

I need to understand the difference between time varying copula ( Patton, 2006 ) and dynamic copula . For the time varying copula, is it when the parameters of copula follow ARMA($p$,$q$)? Is that when the marginals are modeled by GARCH or ARMA, so the copula will be dynamic? References Patton, Andrew J. "Modelling asymmetric exchange rate dependence*." International economic review 47.2 (2006): 527-556. Engle, Robert. "Dynamic conditional correlation: A simple class of multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models." Journal of Business & Economic Statistics 20.3 (2002): 339-350.
