The first error you're getting is likely because the input becomes too small for the network to perform a 5 by 5 convolution on. The second error is caused by the fact that you are placing the padding argument in the wrong place. You are currently using it for the model.add call, whereas you should use it with the Conv2D classs: model_cnn.add(Conv2D(filters = 32, kernel_size = (5, 5), activation = 'relu', padding = 'same'))
