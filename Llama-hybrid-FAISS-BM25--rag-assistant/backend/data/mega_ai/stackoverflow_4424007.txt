There is QChar::Category however it does not provide everything you need. For checking whether a char is in certain range, you could write a function like this: bool inRange(QChar c, ushort b, ushort e) { return (c.unicode() >= b) && (c.unicode() You could then use it like this: inRange(c, 0x3040, 0x309F); // Hiragana? Of course you could go further and make it more abstract and enumerate the ranges: inRange(c, Range::Hiragana); And here is the list of the Unicode Blocks
