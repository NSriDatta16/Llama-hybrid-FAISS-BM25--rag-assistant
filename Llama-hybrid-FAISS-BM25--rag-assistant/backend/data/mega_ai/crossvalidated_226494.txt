If I'm understanding your question, you want to pass to a function a unique vector for all permutations of the same value. I'm not sure if there is any standard way to do this in theano or in machine learning, but in Python I would just sort the vector before passing it to the function, since all permutations give the same list when ordered. Python has a sorted function and a sort method to sort lists in place.
