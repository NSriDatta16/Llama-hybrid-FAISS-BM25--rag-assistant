from may also be included. Photographic Metadata Standards are governed by organizations that develop the following standards. They include, but are not limited to: IPTC Information Interchange Model IIM (International Press Telecommunications Council) IPTC Core Schema for XMP XMP – Extensible Metadata Platform (an ISO standard) Exif – Exchangeable image file format, Maintained by CIPA (Camera & Imaging Products Association) and published by JEITA (Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association) Dublin Core (Dublin Core Metadata Initiative – DCMI) PLUS (Picture Licensing Universal System) VRA Core (Visual Resource Association) JPEG or JPG is a joint Photographic Experts Group Video Metadata is particularly useful in video, where information about its contents (such as transcripts of conversations and text descriptions of its scenes) is not directly understandable by a computer, but where an efficient search of the content is desirable. This is particularly useful in video applications such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition and Vehicle Recognition Identification software, wherein license plate data is saved and used to create reports and alerts. There are 2 sources in which video metadata is derived: (1) operational gathered metadata, that is information about the content produced, such as the type of equipment, software, date, and location; (2) human-authored metadata, to improve search engine visibility, discoverability, audience engagement, and providing advertising opportunities to video publishers. Avid's MetaSync and Adobe's Bridge are examples of professional video editing software with access to metadata. Telecommunications Information on the times, origins and destinations of phone calls, electronic messages, instant messages, and other modes of telecommunication, as opposed to message content, is another form of metadata. Bulk collection of this call detail record metadata by intelligence agencies has proven controversial after disclosures by Edward Snowden of the fact that certain Intelligence agencies such as the NSA had been (and perhaps still are) keeping online metadata on millions of internet users for up to a year, regardless of whether or not they [ever] were persons of interest to the agency. Geospatial metadata Geospatial metadata relates to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) files, maps, images, and other data that is location-based. Metadata is used in GIS to document the characteristics and attributes of geographic data, such as database files and data that is developed within a GIS. It includes details like who developed the data, when it was collected, how it was processed, and what formats it's available in, and then delivers the context for the data to be used effectively. Creation Metadata can be created either by automated information processing or by manual work. Elementary metadata captured by computers can include information about when an object was created, who created it, when it was last updated, file size, and file extension. In this context an object refers to any of the following: A physical item such as a book, CD, DVD, a paper map, chair, table, flower pot, etc. An electronic file such as a digital image, digital photo, electronic document, program file, database table, etc. A metadata engine collects, stores and analyzes information about data and metadata in use within a domain. Data virtualization Data virtualization emerged in the 2000s as the new software technology to complete the virtualization "stack" in the enterprise. Metadata is used in data virtualization servers which are enterprise infrastructure components, alongside database and application servers. Metadata in these servers is saved as persistent repository and describe business objects in various enterprise systems and applications. Structural metadata commonality is also important to support data virtualization. Statistics and census services Standardization and harmonization work has brought
