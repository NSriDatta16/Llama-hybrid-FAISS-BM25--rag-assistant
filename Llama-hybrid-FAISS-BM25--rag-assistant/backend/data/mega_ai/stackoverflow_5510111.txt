All the solutions above are good, and people have gone to great length to test them out. Look up "Togelius and Lucas" or "Loiacono and Lanzi". They have tries things like neuroevolution, imitation (done via reinforcement learning), force fields, etc. From my point of view the best way to go is center line. That will take an hour to implement. In contrast, neuroevolution (for example) is neither easy nor fast. I did my dissertation on that and it can easily take several months full time, if you have the right hardware.
