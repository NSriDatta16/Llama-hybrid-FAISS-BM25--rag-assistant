If you mean with BinaryFormatter (which is usually where this kicks) - don't; it isn't (IMO) suitable for storage - only for transport (and versioning is much less an issue here, as you probably control both ends of the pipe). Many other serializers of every variety are available; most of them cope just fine with versioning. Personally, I would go for: xml: XmlSerializer (DataContractSerializer isn't as flexible in the output, but can handle graphs) json: JavaScriptSerializer binary: protobuf-net (I'm biased here) With any of these, you should be fine between versions, adding members, renaming fields, etc. Actually, I'd use the above 3 even if I was just transporting (not storing).
