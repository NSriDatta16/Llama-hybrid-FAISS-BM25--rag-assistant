This is the best x86 ASM introduction I have found: http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/ There is a pdf version of his book on that page. It starts at the very basics and works its way up. I got all of the fundamental ASM knowledge that I needed just with this book (stack frame creation, calling conventions, c interop, just to name a couple).
