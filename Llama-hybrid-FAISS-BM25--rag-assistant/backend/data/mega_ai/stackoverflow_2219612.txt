"I can do all these individual things but am very frustrated to find my code ends up all over the place and different on wether i want all the above or just some of them." What I can get is, you need to organise your aaplication into layers or Tiers. You can place common functionality into a layer and assigh responsibility. Following is a Pattrn which Might give you an idea Presentation WebForms, Html Pages etc Business Logic Layer (BLL) Business Objects, Business Rules Objects Data Access Layer (DAL) Repository Objects (Responsible for Access your Datasets Stuff), Model (All you Data-sets / Table-Adapters etc.) "i cant have custom columns and custom rows in the datagridview etc etc." If One or more of your datagridviews need some data from TableAdapter (Model(DAL)), but Customised columns or rows, your BLL layer should server the purpose here. It should somewhat be as follows: AccountGridViewClient (Presentation) --> AccountsManager(BLL) --> AccountsRepository(DAL) -->AccountsTableAapter -- >DB AccountGridViewAdmin (Presentation) --> AccountsManager(BLL) --> AccountsRepository(DAL) -->AccountsTableAapter -- >DB Have look at this thread as well. Hope it helps
