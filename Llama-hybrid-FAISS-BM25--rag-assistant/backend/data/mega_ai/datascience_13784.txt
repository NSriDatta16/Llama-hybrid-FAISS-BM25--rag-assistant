transition to data scientist for more money

Not sure if this is a right forum. Please advise if not. I am currently employed as a Software Engineer and am fairly happy. Except, I'd like to make more money. I hear data science is the hottest field these days but wasn't sure if it paid more. I was contemplating to get a certificate like this one. I understand in the beginning it might not be more than what I currently make (~100K) as I am new to the field. However, in few years (let's say about 3 years) is it common to make 150K+? I have a MS in Computer Science, and was good at math classes. So I feel confident in being able to transition.
