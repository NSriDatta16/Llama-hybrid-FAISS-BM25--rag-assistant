NHibernate - create criteria based on a property that is a list

I have a class called LoanApplication, and it has a collection property set up called Workflow. In the mapping file, I am setting the order of retrieval of the Workflow records to sort by Date, so the current workflow is always the first item in the list. Now I want to query by the current workflow to get LoanApplications that are in a specific workflow step using the Criteria API. I'm not really sure how to do this. Here is how I am mapping the Workflow collection: Here is how I am retrieving applications (this is where I need to add the filter by Current Workflow functionality): public IList GetCompletedApplications() { IList result = null; using (ITransaction transaction = this.Session.BeginTransaction()) { result = this.Session.CreateCriteria () .AddOrder(new Order("EnteredDate", false)) .List (); transaction.Commit(); } return result; } Thanks for any help!
