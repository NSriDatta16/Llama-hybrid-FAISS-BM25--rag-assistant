You can model the data in a Bayesian way to capture the robustness of parameter estimates. Construct a probability distribution for each estimated CTR. Each distribution will have the same mean but the page with fewer samples will have greater variance (i.e., less confidence that the population parameter is near the observed data) than the page with more samples.
