In summary, yes, java is generally write once run anywhere. It's "Skinned" to fit the platform. You do have to pay attention to hardware information like screen size if you expect it to work on a phone. Note that it also will be running on cable boxes--I'm working on some of that stuff. Even interactions with platform specific elements are often in the same codebase--so if you have a library that detects the existence of the windows toolbar, you might detect it and support it if it's available, but the code would just not detect it on a mac (or might use a different library). A competent engineer would not, however, have to recompile for a different platform.
