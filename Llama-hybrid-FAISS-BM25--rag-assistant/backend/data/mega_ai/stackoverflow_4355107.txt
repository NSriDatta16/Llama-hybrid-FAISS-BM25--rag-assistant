parsing a big big not well formed file with Java

I have to resolve a problem close to parsing a huge file like, 3 GB or higher. Well, the file is structured how a pseudo xml file like: ... others doc... Surfing the net i have read about some people that have encountered problem to manage files, but they suggest to me, to map a file with NIO. So i think that the solution is too expansive and could bring me thrown an exception. So i think that my problem is to resolve 2 doutbs: How to read efficiently in time the 3 GB text file How to parser efficiently the html extract from the docFileNoxx, and apply rules to the html's tag to extract the post of the tag. So.. I have try to resolve the first question on this way: _reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath)) // create a buffer reader of file _currentLine = _reader.readLine(); // i iterate the file reading it line by line For every line, i append the lines to a String variable until encounter the tag so with JSOUP and post CSS filter i extract the content, and put it on file. Well the process of extraction of 25 MB, on average takes about 88 seconds.... So i would like to perform it. HOw I could perform my extraction??
