Which of the alerts isn't showing? The code you posted contains two, so identifying which section of the code we're supposed to be focusing on would be helpful. One very small thing that I noticed: You're missing a semi-colon at the end of the second alert - if (ajaxRequest.responseText == 'you voted allready'){alert('Du kannst pro Beitrag nur 1 x voten.')} - which may cause the problem (I'm not sure how picky IE8 is about that kind of thing).
