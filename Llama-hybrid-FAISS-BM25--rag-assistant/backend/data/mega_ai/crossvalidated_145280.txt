From my experience - linear algebra, calculus and basic probability are all that are required initially. The book is very well written and does a good job in explaining GP's without expecting the reader to have much previous knowledge. Obviously there are strong links between GPML and other areas of machine learning, so if you have knowledge of SVMs or any of the regression based ML methods they will stand to your advantage - although this definitely isn't required. If you really want to understand GPs make sure you write your own as you read through the book; that was invaluable to me. Also when you get to the chapter on kernels you should check out the Kernel Cookbook which is a great little resource.
