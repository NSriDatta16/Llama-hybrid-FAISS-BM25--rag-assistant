Variable-byte encoding clarification

I am very new to the world of byte encoding so please excuse me (and by all means, correct me) if I am using/expressing simple concepts in the wrong way. I am trying to understand variable-byte encoding. I have read the Wikipedia article ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-width_encoding ) as well as a book chapter from an Information Retrieval textbook. I think I understand how to encode a decimal integer. For example, if I wanted to provide variable-byte encoding for the integer 60, I would have the following result: 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 (please let me know if the above is incorrect). If I understand the scheme, then I'm not completely sure how the information is compressed. Is it because usually we would use 32 bits to represent an integer, so that representing 60 would result in 1 1 1 1 0 0 preceded by 26 zeros, thus wasting that space as opposed to representing it with just 8 bits instead? Thank you in advance for the clarifications.
