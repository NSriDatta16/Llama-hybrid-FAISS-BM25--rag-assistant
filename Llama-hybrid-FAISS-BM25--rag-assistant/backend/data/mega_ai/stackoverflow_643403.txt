In your StyleCop install, there's a Settings.StyleCop file. You can edit this to turn off rules globally. Drag that file onto the Settings Editor executable in that file to edit it. You can also put copies of the settings file into your projects to override the global settings. If you're using Visual Studio integration and not just MSBuild integration, you should be able to get to the settings editor on a per-project basis by right clicking on your project and choosing StyleCop Settings or something like that.
