table1 has many rows with a value of fname that matches the same in table2. Example, say 5k rows table2 have no matching rows in table1, you have a average of 2 rows in table 1 for each of the remaining 13k table2 rows Because you have also asked for a column for table1, this will happen. You'll note multiple t1.fId values for a given t2.fname. Or NULLs
