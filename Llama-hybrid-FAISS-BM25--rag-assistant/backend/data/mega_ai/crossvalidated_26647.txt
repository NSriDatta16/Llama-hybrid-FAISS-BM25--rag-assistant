Short Answer You average the variances ; then you can take square root to get the average standard deviation . For example: ╔═══════════╦════════╤════════╤══════════╗ ║ Month ║ MWh │ StdDev │ Variance ║ ╠═══════════╬════════╪════════╪══════════╣ ║ January ║ 927 │ 333 │ 110,889 ║ ║ February ║ 1,234 │ 250 │ 62,500 ║ ║ March ║ 1,032 │ 301 │ 90,601 ║ ║ April ║ 876 │ 204 │ 41,616 ║ ║ May ║ 865 │ 165 │ 27,225 ║ ║ June ║ 750 │ 263 │ 69,169 ║ ║ July ║ 780 │ 280 │ 78,400 ║ ║ August ║ 690 │ 98 │ 9,604 ║ ║ September ║ 730 │ 76 │ 5,776 ║ ║ October ║ 821 │ 240 │ 57,600 ║ ║ November ║ 803 │ 178 │ 31,684 ║ ║ December ║ 850 │ 250 │ 62,500 ║ ╠═══════════╬════════╪════════╪══════════╣ ║ Total ║ 10,358 │ 805 │ 647,564 ║ ║ ÷12 ║ 863 │ 232 │ 53,964 ║ ╚═══════════╩════════╧════════╧══════════╝ And then the average standard deviation is sqrt(53,964) = 232 Long Answer From Sum of normally distributed random variables : If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables that are normally distributed (and therefore also jointly so), then their sum is also normally distributed ...the sum of two independent normally distributed random variables is normal, with its mean being the sum of the two means, and its variance being the sum of the two variances And from Wolfram Alpha's Normal Sum Distribution : Amazingly, the distribution of a sum of two normally distributed independent variates $X$ and $Y$ with means and variances $(\mu_X,\sigma_X^2)$ and $(\mu_Y,\sigma_Y^2)$ , respectively is another normal distribution $$ P_{X+Y}(u) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi (\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2)}} e^{-[u-(\mu_X+\mu_Y)]^2/[2(\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2)]} $$ which has mean $$\mu_{X+Y} = \mu_X+\mu_Y$$ and variance $$ \sigma_{X+Y}^2 = \sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2$$ For your data: sum: 10,358 MWh variance: 647,564 standard deviation: 804.71 (i.e. sqrt(647,564) ) So to answer your question: How to 'sum' a standard deviation ? You sum them quadratically: s = sqrt(s1^2 + s2^2 + ... + s12^2) Conceptually you sum the variances, then take the square root to get the standard deviation. Because i was curious, i wanted to know the average monthly mean power, and its standard deviation . Through induction, we need 12 normal distributions which: sum to a mean of 10,358 sum to a variance of 647,564 That would be 12 average monthly distributions of: mean of 10,358/12 = 863.16 variance of 647,564/12 = 53,963.6 standard deviation of sqrt(53963.6) = 232.3 We can check our monthly average distributions by adding them up 12 times, to see that they equal the yearly distribution: Mean: 863.16*12 = 10358 = 10,358 ( correct ) Variance: 53963.6*12 = 647564 = 647,564 ( correct ) Note : i'll leave it to someone with a knowledge of the esoteric Latex math to convert my formula images, and formula code into stackexchange formatted formulas. Edit : I moved the short, to the point, answer up top. Because i needed to do this again today, but wanted to double-check that i average the variances .
