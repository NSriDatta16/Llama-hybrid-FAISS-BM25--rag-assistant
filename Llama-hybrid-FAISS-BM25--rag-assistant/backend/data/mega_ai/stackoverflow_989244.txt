What's the difference in Windows program invocation?

I have a program on a Windows XP computer on another continent. If I start it by double-clicking on an associated file, so that it runs the program according to the file-type association, it crashes at a certain point. If I start it by dragging an associated file to the program icon, it works fine. If I double-click on the icon and drag the associated file to the window, it works fine. The guy on site assures me that he's triple-checked the file-type association, and it should be correct. Assuming that the icon points to the same executable as the registry, what differences would there be in starting the program in these two different ways? EDIT: In response to a comment, the machine I'm having problems on is running in Japanese, while my normal machine is US English.
