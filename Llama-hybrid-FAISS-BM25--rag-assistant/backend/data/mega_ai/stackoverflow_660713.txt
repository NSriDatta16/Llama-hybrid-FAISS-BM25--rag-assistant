C# How can I assign a context menu to a tray icon when the tray icon is not on the same form?

I used the code below to programmatically create a system tray icon, this code lives in class file and not on my main form. I have dragged a contextMenuStrip control on to my main form, I now need to link the two but as the control if private I can't see it. What is the best way to link these two? trayIcon = new NotifyIcon(); trayIcon.Icon = mainForm.Icon; trayIcon.Text = "Test"; trayIcon.MouseDoubleClick += new MouseEventHandler(this.trayIcon_MouseDoubleClick); trayIcon.ContextMenuStrip = //help needed here??? Thanks all
