Bishop writes: Applications in which the training data comprises examples of the input vectors along with their corresponding target vectors are known as supervised learning problems. Cases such as the digit recognition example, in which the aim is to assign each input vector to one of a finite number of discrete categories, are called classification problems. If the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called regression . Bishop, C. M. (2006). Pattern recognition and machine learning (1st ed. 20). Springer.
