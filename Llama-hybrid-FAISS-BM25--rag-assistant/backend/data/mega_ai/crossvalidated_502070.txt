Which coefficients to include in out-of-sample prediction?

I am estimating a logistic regression on a subset of my data and predicting the outcome for the whole sample. In the regression only some data are statistically significant at the chosen level. Should I include only those regressors in the prediction or all of them? I cannot chose my preferred model specification as it includes years Fixed Effects and there is no perfect overlapping year-wise between the samples. Should I just go for my second-best specification without the Fixed Effects? How do I go about the first point in R ? For reference, my code in R looks like this db_tr $group=="1",] db_pr group=="2",] f
