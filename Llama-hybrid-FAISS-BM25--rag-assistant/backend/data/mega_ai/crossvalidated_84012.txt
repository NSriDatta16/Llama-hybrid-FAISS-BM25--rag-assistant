Choosing optimal alpha in elastic net logistic regression

I'm performing an elastic-net logistic regression on a health care dataset using the glmnet package in R by selecting lambda values over a grid of $\alpha$ from 0 to 1. My abbreviated code is below: alphalist which outputs the mean cross validated error for each value of alpha from $0.0$ to $1.0$ with an increment of $0.1$: [1] 0.2080167 [1] 0.1947478 [1] 0.1949832 [1] 0.1946211 [1] 0.1947906 [1] 0.1953286 [1] 0.194827 [1] 0.1944735 [1] 0.1942612 [1] 0.1944079 [1] 0.1948874 Based on what I've read in the literature, the optimal choice of $\alpha$ is where the cv error is minimized. But there's a lot of variation in the errors over the range of alphas. I'm seeing several local minimums, with a global minimum error of 0.1942612 for alpha=0.8 . Is it safe to go with alpha=0.8 ? Or, given the variation, should I re-run cv.glmnet with more cross validation folds (e.g. $20$ instead of $10$) or perhaps a larger number of $\alpha$ increments between alpha=0.0 and 1.0 to get a clear picture of the cv error path?
