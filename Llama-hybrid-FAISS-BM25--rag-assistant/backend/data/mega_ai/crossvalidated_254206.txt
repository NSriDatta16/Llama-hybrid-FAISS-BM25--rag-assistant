If you are willing/able to try a different MCMC package, you might consider Stan . There are rstan , pystan , and other interfaces, or you could use the command-line version CommandStan. It does have a von miss distribution. Two caveats: I've indirectly used the von miles distribution, through an R package called brms , which uses rstan under the hood. I found it to be a bit tricky in my particular problem, but this may be just me. Stan, unlike BUGS/JAGS is more procedural. For example, a for loop in BUGS/JAGS is a concise way to describe plates in your model. It's not a literal loop that's executed at run time. In Stan, a for loop is literally executed at run time. There are other consequences of Stan's similar-looking-but-different language, such as the order of statements within a block mattering. So it may be too large of a leap for you to switch to Stan for just a single distribution, but I wanted to suggest it. Stan is compiled to C++ code, which is compiled to an executable and it's a very efficient sampler. If you are using R and can set up your model as a regression, I can highly recommend the brms package or rstanarm , both of which use rstan (and hence Stan) under the hood. (You do need to have a C++ compiler on your system to use brms , which is the default under Linux, and straightforward on the Mac.)
