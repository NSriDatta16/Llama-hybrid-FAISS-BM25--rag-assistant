This is a very cool idea indeed, and a couple of years ago I also had a very strong need for something like that. Unfortunately, at least back then, I wasn't able to find something like that. Doing a quick search on sourceforge and freshmeat also doesn't bring up anything related today. But I agree that such a wiki frontend to user-contributed documentation would be very useful, I know for a fact that something like this was recently being discussed also within the Lua community (see this ). So, maybe we can determine the requirements in order to come up with a basic working draft/prototype? Hopefully, this would get us going to initiate such a project with a minimum set of features and then simply release it into the wild as an open source project (e.g. on sourceforge), so that other users can contribute to it. Ideally, one could use unified patches to apply changes that were contributed in such a fashion. Also, it would probably make sense to restrict modifications only to adding/editing comments, instead of allowing arbitrary modifications of text, this could probably be implemented by using a simple regex. Maybe, one could implement something like that by modifying an existing (established) wiki software such as mediawiki. Or preferably something that's already using git as a backend for storage purposes. Then, one would mainly need to cater for those Doxygen-style comments, and provide a simple interface on top of it. Thinking about it some more, DoxyGen itself already provides support for generating HTML documentation, so from that perspective it might actually be interesting to see, how DoxyGen could possibly be extended, so that it is well integrated with such a scripted backend that allows for easy customization of embedded source code documentation. This would probably mainly boil down to providing a standalone script with doxygen (e.g. in python, php or perl) and then optionally embed forms in the automatically created HTML documentation, so that documentation fixes/augmentations can be sent to the corresponding script via a browser, which in turn would write any modifications back to a corresponding branch. In the long term, it would be cool if such a script would support different types of backends (CVS, SVN or git), or at least be implemented generically enough, so that it is easily extendible. So, if we can come up with a good design, it might even be possible that such a modification would be generally accepted as a contribution to doxygen itself, which would also give the whole thing much more exposure and momentum. Even if the idea doesn't directly materialize into a real project, it would be interesting to see how many other users actually like the idea, so that it could possibly be mentioned in the doxygen issue tracker ( https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/issues/new ).
