It might not be the most elegant solution, but I think you could achieve this by using a combination of CCK and Views . Use CCK to add another field to your content type, one that contains your alternative teaser text. Then, use Views to create the list of nodes where you want the alternative teaser to show up. Include your new teaser field in the view, add some formatting, and you're done. If you have complex formatting needs, you could try this trick and write a specific .tpl.php file to present the view.
