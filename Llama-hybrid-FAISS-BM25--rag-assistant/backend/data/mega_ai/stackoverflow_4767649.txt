Depending on what you need (implement a file system or just a virtual disk with existing file system) you can use one of our virtual storage products: Callback File System and CallbackDisk respectively. The difference is that CallbackDisk emulates a disk device (so you can mount, for example, ISO image there), and Callback File System lets you build your own file system (eg. distributed, or just remotely stored) .NET APIs are available in both products.
