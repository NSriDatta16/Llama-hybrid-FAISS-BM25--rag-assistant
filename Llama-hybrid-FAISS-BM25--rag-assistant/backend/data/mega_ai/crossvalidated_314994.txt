Seasonal or non-seasonal? ETS and auto-arima disagree?

I am working with the following monthly time series to build forecasting models: From this plot, it's quite tricky to identify if there is some kind of seasonality or not. When I use the ets function, it comes up with a ETS(M,N,N) which I believe suggests non-seasonal data. However, my auto-arima function comes up with a ARIMA(0,1,0)(1,1,0)[12] which suggests seasonality, right? Why do the algorithm disagree? Am I interpreting it right? Also, would you recommend a way to identify any potential seasonality in my time series? Ideally, I would like to make a preliminary analysis where I can state whether my time series is most likely seasonal, or not. Thank you. This is the data I'm using: structure(c(198.5, 206.5, 220.25, 210, 201.5, 235, 248, 249, 243, 236.25, 236.25, 260.75, 282, 271, 298.8, 351.5, 324.9, 307.8, 320, 322.6, 334.7, 344.6, 366.3, 395.2, 423.3, 462.4, 435, 440.6, 412.7, 437.3, 460.9, 453.5, 455.8, 431.4, 424.4, 461.3, 484.7, 500, 473.7, 435.7, 426.5, 425.2, 440, 320, 349.5, 368.4, 365.7, 314.7, 329.5, 354.6, 315.9), .Tsp = c(2012.75, 2016.91666666667, 12), class = "ts")
