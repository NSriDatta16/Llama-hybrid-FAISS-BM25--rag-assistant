Multiple outcomes (Y1, Y2, Y3) disqualifies regression. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is suited for multiple outcomes. However, if prediction of multiple dependent variables is needed, then you probably want to use causality, or more specifically, the structural approach to causation. Counterfactuals and logical approaches to causation and causal relationships will aid your model design, specification, confirmation and analysis also. See Judea Pearl (2009) Causality : Models, reasoning, and inference; Stephen L. Morgan and Christopher Winship (2007) Counterfactuals and causal inference: Methods and principles for social research; and Bill Shipley (2000) Cause and Correlation in Biology: A user's guide to Path Analysis, Structural Equations and Causal Inference. Best wishes.
