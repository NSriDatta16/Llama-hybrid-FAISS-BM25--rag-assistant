Are there specific Machine Learning Algorithms that are more indicated for Real Time Analytics?

As the title suggests, I am wondering if there are specific ML algorithms that are more suitable for real time learning. In my case, I am working on deploying a stacking algorithm on Spark Streaming and aside from being limited by the lack of stacking libraries in Spark ML, I am wondering if my approach to choosing classifiers for the ensemble should be affected by purely mathematical factors related to the real time (mini-batch) computation. For example, I am dealing with a time series dataset. If I train my stacking algo in batch over a time range in the dataset, will it make sense to deploy it and compute in real time as new instances come in? I was leaning towards building my stacking ensemble with classifiers considering rolling windows of different duration (in conjunction with classifiers using different features), and perhaps giving more weight to the classifiers with a smaller and more recent rolling window would make sense.
