I'm pretty sure the injection works with an IComponentInstantiationListener (at least that's how the Spring version works). Update: it does, see this document . However, Sessions are not components, so a different mechanism is needed. Perhaps there is a way to wire your Session in the Application.newSession() method? You will have to take a look at the implementation of JavaEEComponentInjector and copy what it does when creating your session.
