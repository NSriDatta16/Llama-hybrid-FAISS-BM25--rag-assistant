HTML head is processed before everything else, even when the whole page is only partially downloaded (it is assumed, that pages are loaded from the beginning to the end sequentially, i.e. not in random chunks, like via BitTorrent for example). It doesn't apply just to external resources, but to everything independent of the current page's content. Internet can be slow and laggy sometimes and user agents (browsers) can be run on variety of platforms, including very limited ones. If the Internet connection has a long ping delay (for example, it's a satellite link), it will take considerable time for a request to make a complete round-trip. So you want the client to be able to request all these external items simultaneously. The sooner the browser can decide on whether to request a resource, the better -- this facilitates a quick page download, together with all the stylesheets, javascript code and whatnot. And there is also a question of caching. It is usually assumed that stuff declared in the head of the page is immutable across requests, so it's good to be cached and only be requested as rarely as seems reasonable enough. This also speeds up things considerably.
