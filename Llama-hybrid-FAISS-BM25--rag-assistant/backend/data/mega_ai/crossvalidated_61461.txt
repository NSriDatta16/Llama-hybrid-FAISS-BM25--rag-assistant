Finding correlations between aggregated and non aggregated data

I am trying to correlate server usage data with CPU utilization. E.g., X number of transactions on the server correlates with Y amount of CPU utilization. The transactions are reported hourly and the CPU utilization is reported on a per minute basis. The current approach is to average the CPU utilization over the hour and then plot that against the hourly transaction data. My concern is that there can be a spike in the load that lasts only a few minutes which would drive the CPU utilization up to a critical level during that time, but that spike (and the server performance degredation) would be lost when the CPU is averaged. Is there a better way to approach this? More granular load data may not be available so any help is appreciated.
