Detect touch *anywhere on the screen* in cocos2d?

I'm really sorry, I realize there have been several questions asked about cocos2d touch detection (including this answer which helped me a bunch), but I just can't get any of them to work. I would have commented on the answer I linked instead of asking my own question, but i don't have enough rep to leave comments. All I want to do is stop animation as soon as a user taps anywhere on the screen. Here's my code so far: - (BOOL)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"Touches Began"); UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView: [touch view]]; location = [[Director sharedDirector] convertCoordinate: location]; CGRect mySurface = (CGRectMake(100, 100, 320, 480)); if(CGRectContainsPoint(mySurface, location)) { NSLog(@"Event Handled"); return kEventHandled; [[Director sharedDirector] stopAnimation]; } return kEventIgnored; NSLog(@"Event Ignored"); } I've tried both BOOL and void , ccTouchesBegan and touchesBegan , in a layer file and a cocosNode file, and many other things. Nothing happens. Nothing shows in the log, and the animation continues on its merry little way. What am I doing wrong?
