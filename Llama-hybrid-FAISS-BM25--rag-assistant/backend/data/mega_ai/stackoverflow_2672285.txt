LINQ to SQL vs Entity Framework for an app with a future SQL Azure version

I've got a vertical market Dot Net Framework 1.1 C#/WinForms/SQL Server 2000 application. Currently it uses ADO.Net and Microsoft's SQLHelper for CRUD operations. I've successfully converted it to Dot Net Framework 4 C#/WinForms/ SQL Server 2008. What I'd like to do is also offer my customers the OPTION to use SQL Azure as a backend storage for their data instead of local/LAN SQL Server. If I know SQL Azure is in my application's future, should I: A. Switch to LINQ to SQL or B. Swith to Entity Framework or C. Stick with ADO.Net and SQLHelper ? Thanks !
