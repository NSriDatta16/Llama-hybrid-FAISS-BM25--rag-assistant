What I do is just add a querystring at the end of the path to the xap file. Then when you change the querystring variable, the proxies etc. should see it as a request to a new file. So far this has worked fine for me. So basically, when embedding an .xap in a straight-up HTML file, you would do this: And then when you deploy a new version, just change "whatevervalue" to something else. EDIT If you need to use this technique in many places in your app I would read the querystring value from config and just write it to the page using asp.net. That way you only need to update it in one place when you deploy.
