Is there a way to check if its safe to copy or assign an object in C++?

I have the following problem. I'm using the C library igraph (http://igraph.sourceforge.net/) in a program I must do in c++. So I found a c++ wrapper of this C library (http://code.google.com/p/igraphhpp/) that provides some nice interface I wanted to use, in a class called Graph. I have the following class in my program: class Agent { private: double beta; Graph * innerGraph; public: Agent(int N, double beta_) { innerGraph = new Graph; *innerGraph = Graph::full(N); beta = beta_; }; ~Agent() {delete innerGraph;} void MCStep(); }; The function MCStep() must do the following: make a copy of the Graph contained in *innerGraph , do some stuff to this copy, without altering the original, check if the altered copy satisfy some condition and, if yes, update *innerGraph with this new modified graph. If I knew that the library implements a safe copy constructor, I'd do it in the obvious way, but I don't. How can I check it?
