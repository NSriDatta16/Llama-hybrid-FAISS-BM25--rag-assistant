Best continuously updated resource about python web "plumbing"

I'm a programmer in Python who works on web-applications. I know a fair bit about the application level. But not so much about the underlying "plumbing" which I find myself having to configure or debug. I'm thinking of everything from using memcached to flup, fcgi, WSGI etc. When looking for information about these, online, Google typically delivers older-documents (eg. tutorials from before 2007), fragments of problems that may or may not have been resolved etc. Are there any good comprehensive and up-to-date resources to learn about how to put together a modern, high-performance server? One that explains both principles of the architecture and the actual packages?
