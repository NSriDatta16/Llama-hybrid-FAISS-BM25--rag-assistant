Well... In my case I have issues using Application Isolated Storage, each time I deployed a new version of my app (just for instance changing the color of a button I lost my Iso Storage :-(). I move to use SiteStorage instead of Application level, and it worked: http://www.tipsdotnet.com/TechBlog.aspx?PageIndex=0&BLID=13 On the other hand what I had done with Iso Storage is perform CRUD on folders and files, not sure abou that other kind of settings.
