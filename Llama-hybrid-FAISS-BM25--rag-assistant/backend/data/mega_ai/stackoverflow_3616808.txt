No adding an index on every field won't make it faster - the system can only use one index at a time. If the column only holds a few different values (e.g. customers year of birth) then using an index will be les efficient than reading through every record in the table and discarding the ones which don't match. OTOH if the user filters by the primary key of the table then the index will be very, very efficient. Adding an index on every combination of fields will make it faster - but that's (N+1)! indexes. This is going to require a lot of storage and slow down any DML massively. The best compromise is require some filtering by default build indexes matching common selection criteria (including the 'default' filtering) log selection criteria and query times to identify how it can be improved C.
