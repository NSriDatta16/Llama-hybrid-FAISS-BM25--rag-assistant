ASP.NET GetFullHtmlFieldId not returning valid id

In MVC2 template, I normally use this.ViewData.TemplateInfo.GetFullHtmlFieldId(fieldName) to generate the id field of an html element. This has worked in most of the cases. However this method does not actually return valid id field , it merely prefix fieldName with ViewData.TemplateInfo.HtmlFieldPrefix , this is causing problems for me when rendering collections which has [] in the HtmlFieldPrefix. I have been manually converting those characters to _ where I find the need, but this seems to be not elegant (repeated code), has anyone found a good way to generate id field properly?
