On the existence of rule of thumb for machine learning algorithms

I want to know if there are conditions about the minimum number of observations to have (the relation between the number of variables and the number of presence and absence records) in order to use the following machine learning algorithms: CART, RFs, and BRI (I will be very thankful if there are any references).
