Container_of() not compiling

List.h defines a macro called list_entry which is a wrapper for container_of() function. An elegant function, which seems very delicate: Consider this piece of code: tmp = list_entry(pos,(struct Order),ord_Queue); When I compile it using gcc, a constant error of expected expression is popping up. My structure is defined as: struct Order { double idNum; char* entryTime; char* eventTime; struct list_head ord_Queue; }; It seems there is a problem with container_of when there are superfluous brackets used in Arg2 and Arg3, and there should be one bracket only for Arg1 courtesy here . I have tried it, but it doesnt work. Some help would be appreciated.
