Sorry I can't post a comment yet so please bear with me. Anyway, I bumped into this discussion thread which reminded me of a paper I had seen very recently. I think it might be of interest to folks participating here: AdaNet: Adaptive Structural Learning of Artificial Neural Networks Corinna Cortes, Xavier Gonzalvo, Vitaly Kuznetsov, Mehryar Mohri, Scott Yang ; Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning, PMLR 70:874-883, 2017. Abstract We present a new framework for analyzing and learning artificial neural networks. Our approach simultaneously and adaptively learns both the structure of the network as well as its weights. The methodology is based upon and accompanied by strong data-dependent theoretical learning guarantees, so that the final network architecture provably adapts to the complexity of any given problem.
