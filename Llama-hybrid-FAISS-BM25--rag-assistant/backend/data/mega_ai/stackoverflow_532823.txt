It seems that you defined each pixel as some kind of structure or object. Using a primitive type (say, int) could be faster. As others have mentioned, the compiler is likely to optimize the array access using pointer increments. If the compile doesn't do that for you, you can do that yourself to avoid multiplications when you use array[][]. Since you only need 3 bytes per pixel, you could pack one pixel into one int. By doing that, you could copy 3 bytes a time instead of byte-by-byte. The only tricky thing is when you want to read individual color components of a pixel, you will need some bit masking and shifting. This could give you more overhead than that saved by using an int. Or you can use 3 int arrays for 3 color components respectively. You will need a lot more storage, though.
