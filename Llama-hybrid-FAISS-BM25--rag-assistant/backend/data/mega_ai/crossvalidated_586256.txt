Your response variable is ordinal because there is clear ordering to it: before -> during -> after. You'd typically fit an ordinal logistic regression to this kind of data, though sometimes it is convenient to treat it otherwise (e.g. as continuous). A multinomial logistic would be called for if your response variable had categories with no ordering e.g. apple/banana/orange.
