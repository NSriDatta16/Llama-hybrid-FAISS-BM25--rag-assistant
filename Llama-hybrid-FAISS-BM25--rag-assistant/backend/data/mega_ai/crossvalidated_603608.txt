no, neural network per-se are not mixture models, tho ideas from mixture models has influenced some of the neural network modules like softmax attention. mixture models require a mixing in the probability density function, corresponding to the logsumexp() function. Some NN uses logsumexp, on pdf quantities and non-pdf quantities. Thus NN are not necessarily MM, but may use MM subcomponents, and vice versa.
