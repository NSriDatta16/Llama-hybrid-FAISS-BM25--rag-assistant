How to change behavior enter/backspace pressed in WYMEDITOR

In Google Chrome after pressing enter key in WYMEDITOR a new is created. How to change it? I would rather insert tag as it happens after shift-enter combination. (In fact shift-enter creates two ). Similar question concerns backspace pressed on the beginning of paragraph. How to change this behavior to erase paragraph (or other) only when it is empty and do nothing otherwise. I'll be grateful for any hints.
