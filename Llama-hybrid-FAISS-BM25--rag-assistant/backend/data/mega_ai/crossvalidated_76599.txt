Peter D. Huff. A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods . Springer (2010) Also Andrew Gelman et. al. Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd ed.) . CRC (2013) The Gelman book isn't constrained to R but also uses Stan, a probabilistic programming language similar to BUGS or JAGS. I believe earlier editions of the book used BUGS instead of Stan, which is probably very similar. And finally: John Kruschke. Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A tutorial with R and BUGS . Academic Press (2011) More BUGS than R, but probably the most pragmatic of the three books I've suggested. Don't let the cover deter you, this is a perfectly respectable text.
