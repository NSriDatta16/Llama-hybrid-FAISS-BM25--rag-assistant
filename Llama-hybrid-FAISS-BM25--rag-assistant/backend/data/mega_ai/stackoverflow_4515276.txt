openMP is not creating threads in visual studio

My openMP version did not give any speed boost. I have a dual core machine and the CPU usage is always 50%. So I tried the sample program given in Wiki. Looks like the openMP compiler (Visual Studio 2008) is not creating more than one thread. This is the program: #include #include #include int main (int argc, char *argv[]) { int th_id, nthreads; #pragma omp parallel private(th_id) { th_id = omp_get_thread_num(); printf("Hello World from thread %d\n", th_id); #pragma omp barrier if ( th_id == 0 ) { nthreads = omp_get_num_threads(); printf("There are %d threads\n",nthreads); } } return EXIT_SUCCESS; } This is the output that I get: Hello World from thread 0 There are 1 threads Press any key to continue . . .
