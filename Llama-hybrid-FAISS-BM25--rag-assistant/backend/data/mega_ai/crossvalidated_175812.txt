I guess that we can have an idea of why a standard deviation is called "standard" by looking at the synonyms of this word ( see here ). Some of them, like "typical" or "average", make clear the fact that a standard deviation is conceptually a typical or an average deviation to the mean, even if technically speaking you have to take the square root of the averaged squared deviations to the mean of your dataset. In French, we use "écart-type" to refer to standard deviation, "écart" meaning deviation and "type" meaning typical, which probably makes this clearer. I found this a very useful way to provide a conceptual definition of standard deviation to students.
