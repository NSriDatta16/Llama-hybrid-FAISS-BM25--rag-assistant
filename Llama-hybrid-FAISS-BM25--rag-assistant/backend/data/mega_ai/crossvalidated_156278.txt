You should first differentiate your time series, i.e. consider $X_t = S_t - S_{t-1}$. Then, a correlation-based clustering will do it. You should use Spearman correlation rather than the Pearson one, as it is more generic and robust to strong variations. If you suspect that the strength of variations matters somehow, you could use a correlation+distribution clustering, i.e. each time series can be viewed as a random variable, and the values of its variations $X_t$ are realizations. Sklar's theorem asserts that the whole information, assuming i.i.d. sampling of the $X_t$, can be captured by a "pure correlation" and distribution separately, cf. this paper which illustrates the approach by clustering financial time series , and eventually this link for a snippet of Python code .
