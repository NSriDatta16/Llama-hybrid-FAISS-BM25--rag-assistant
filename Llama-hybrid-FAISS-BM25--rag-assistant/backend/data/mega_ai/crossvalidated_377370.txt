I am very intimidated by the lack of responses to this question; but i'll give it a stab. I am just a student, so please don't pile on the response. Maybe my response is incredibly naive but at least it's something. I would take a sufficiently large sample of similar schools (eg.30 schools) and record how many students got exactly 95 (or simply very high scores). divide that by the total number of students in each school to get a proportion. If you assume there is no cohort effect where the school in question improves over time, you can simply go through the old test results from this very same school. Then you can simply do a T test against the claimed value of what proportion got that score in the current year/school. i.e. (sample mean of proportions - claimed value)/(sample standard deviation/number of schools). Then look up a T test p values chart, with degrees of freedom=number of schools minus 1. If the p value is less than 0.05, it's sufficient to say this is abnormally high--the lower the p value the more significant the gap between what you'd normally expect by chance and what you got at the current school. If the sample is sufficiently large then central limit theorem kicks in and it doesn't matter what the original distribution is; the test is on the means, it'll work anyway. 30 is a rough guide, 13 schools might be enough, though try to get more. It won't matter that students are not independent of each other; we're averaging between schools not the students, as long as the schools are independent you should be fine. You can't tell which student cheated, but you can tell that this amount of 95's is abnormally high compared to other similar schools.
