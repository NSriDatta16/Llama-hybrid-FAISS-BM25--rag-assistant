Can a cURL based HTTP request imitate a browser based request completely?

This is a two part question. Q1: Can cURL based request 100% imitate a browser based request? Q2: If yes, what all options should be set. If not what extra does the browser do that cannot bee imitated by cURL? I have a website and I see thousands of request being made from a single IP in a very short time. These requests harvest all my data. When looked at the log to identify the agent used, it looks like a request from browser. So was curious to know if its a bot and not a user. Thanks in advance
