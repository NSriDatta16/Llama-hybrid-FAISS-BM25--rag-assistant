Interpreting plot.lm()

I had a question about interpreting the graphs generated by plot(lm) in R. I was wondering if you guys could tell me how to interpret the scale-location and leverage-residual plots? Any comments would be appreciated. Assume basic knowledge of statistics, regression and econometrics.
