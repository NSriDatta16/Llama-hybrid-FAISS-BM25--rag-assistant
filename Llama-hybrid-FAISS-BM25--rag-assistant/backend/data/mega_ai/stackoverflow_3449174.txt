Programmatically, there would be no reason. The reason might be in readability though; wrapping an arbitrary code snippet in a transaction is a pretty good way of drawing the attention of future developers to it - or away from something else. It might also just be that the Best Practice at the time of writing was to wrap any dealings with the database in a transaction, just as wrapping stuff in try/catch-blocks. My suggestion: If the code is clearer and more readable because of this, or if all other database calls are in transactions, leave it in. Otherwise, remove it.
