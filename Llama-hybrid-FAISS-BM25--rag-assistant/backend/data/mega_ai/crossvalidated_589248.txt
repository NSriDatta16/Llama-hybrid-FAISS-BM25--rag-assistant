If you have a Markov chain with transition probability matrix $\mathbf{P}$ then any stationary distribution $\pi$ for that chain is a unit eigenvector of $\mathbf{P}$ with corresponding eigenvalue of one. This means that knowledge of a single stationary distribution for the chain is equivalent to knowledge of a single eigenvector/eigenvalue pair. It is well-known that this is insufficient to determine the entire transition probability matrix (for any chain with more than two states).
