Android ACTION_SEND Attached File

When you attach a file to an e-mail using the ACTION_SEND intent (with the extra EXTRA_STREAM) does the e-mail app copy that attached file to its own location? My app creates a file and attaches it to an email, but this can happen many times and I would like to be able to delete this file when it is no longer needed (so it doesn't flood the user's storage with junk data). Is the file safe to delete after the e-mail intent has started?
