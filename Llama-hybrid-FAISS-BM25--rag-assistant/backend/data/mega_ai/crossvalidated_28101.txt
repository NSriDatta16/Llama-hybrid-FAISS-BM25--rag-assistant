Learning a mapping from one time series to another with a Kalman Filter

I am interested in finding the relation between two (possibly multi dimensional) time series $x_{1:T}$ and $y_{1:T}$. I wonder how I can do that with a linear dynamical system/Kalman filter. My approach would be sth like estimating the parameters $\theta$ with EM for the joint probability $p(x_{1:T}, y_{1:T}, h_{1:T})$ where $h_{1:T}$ is my hidden state. Then say that I have observed a sequence $x'_{1:T}$, I want to determine the most likely sequence $y'_{1:T}$ by finding $p(y'_{1:T}|x'_{1:T})$. Does anyone know whether this is the standard approach for this problem? If not, what is the standard approach? Does anyone know a source where this is described?
