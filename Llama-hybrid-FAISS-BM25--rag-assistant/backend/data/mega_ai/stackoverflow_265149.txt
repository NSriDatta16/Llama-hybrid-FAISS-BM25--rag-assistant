If your employees are really new to programming, I would start with having them learn the fundamentals of C# (or some other .Net language but C# is probably the way to go for beginners) and good programming practice. I would imagine there are existing stackoverflow threads that would have suggestions for this. I think a solid understanding of object oriented programming and knowing the syntax of the language that examples will be in will facilitate the learning of ArcObjects. I am not really aware of non-ESRI books on ArcObjects. However I think their resources are adequate to get beginners started. In addition to ESRI course books, I would suggest starting with the online resourses at http://resources.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/dotnet/index.cfm Other suggestions are to learn how to read the object model diagrams and to use the help to explore methods and properties of the ArcObjects. Also encourage the employees to take advantage of the ESRI user forums. There are a lot of knowledgeable people willing to help with questions there.
