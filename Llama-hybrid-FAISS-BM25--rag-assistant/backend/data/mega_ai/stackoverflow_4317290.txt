The current final SDK is only 4.2 while the iOS out in the wild on the devices is 4.2.1. When you first plug in your device in XCode, the Organizer window will collect the debug symbols for your device. If you need to do this again, you can explicitly delete the /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/. Funny thing is that occasionally you still get those annoying "Unable to find symbols" error. But at least you'll be able to debug on device now.
