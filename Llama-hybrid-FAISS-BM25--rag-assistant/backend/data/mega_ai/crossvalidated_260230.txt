MCMC Metropolis-Hastings' jumping distribution for non-negative parameters

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique for sampling from some distribution $f(x)$ by constructing a Markov Chain whose equilibrium distribution is equal to $f(x)$. Essentially given the current state of the Markov Chain a new state is proposed and it is either accepted or rejected. This new state $X_\text{new}$ is given by: $$X_\text{new} = X_\text{old} + \lambda$$ Let us call the distribution of $\lambda$ the `jumping distribution'. Typically $\lambda$ is taken to be a mean-zero normal random variable : $$\lambda \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$$ Usually the variance $\sigma^2$ is fine-tuned to alter the acceptance rate $\alpha$ of of new moves. My question regards sampling from a non-negative distribution $f(x)$. For instance this may arise from sampling from the Bayesian posterior distribution of the variance parameter of some model. My intial approach was to keep $\lambda$ normal however if the proposed new value is negative I set it to zero instead. However this does not seem like a particularly intelligent or efficient approach. Can you propose a better jumping distribution for non-negative $f(x)$?
