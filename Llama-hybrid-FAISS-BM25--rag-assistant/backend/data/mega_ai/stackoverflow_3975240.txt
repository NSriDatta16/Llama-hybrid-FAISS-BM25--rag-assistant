How to Modify HTTP Header of a request using C#?

I was trying to modify a HTTP Header using C#. I tried to manipulate the Request.Headers on Page preinit event. But when i try to set anything to the Headers, i get PlatformNotSupportedException. Since We can not set a new NameValueCollection to Reqeust.Headers, I tried to set the value using following code: Request.Headers.Set(HttpRequestHeader.UserAgent.ToString(), "some value"); Any idea how can this be achieved?
