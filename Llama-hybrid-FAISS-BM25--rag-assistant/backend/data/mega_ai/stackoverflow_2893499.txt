Is DB logging more secure than file logging for my PHP web app?

I would like to log errors/informational and warning messages from within my web application to a log. I was initially thinking of logging all of these onto a text file. However, my PHP web app will need write access to the log files and the folder housing this log file may also need write access if log file rotation is desired which my web app currently does not have. The alternative is for me to log the messages to the MySQL database since my web app is already using the MySQL database for all its data storage needs. However, this got me thinking that going with the MySQL option is much better than the file option since I already have a configuration file with the database access information protected using file system permissions. If I now go with the log file option I need to tinker the file and folder access permissions and this will only make my application less secure and defeats the whole purpose of logging. Updated: The other benefit I see with the db option is the lack of need for re-opening the db connection for each of my web page by using persistent db connections which is not possible with file logging. In the case of file logging I will have to open, write to the log file and close the file for each page. Is this correct? I am using XAMPP for development and am a newbie to LAMP. Please let me know your recommendations for logging. Thanks. Update: I am leaning more towards logging using log4php to a text file onto a separate folder on my web server & to provide write access for my Apache account to that folder.
