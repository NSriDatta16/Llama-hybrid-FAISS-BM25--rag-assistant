Increasing the number of hidden layers for a standard neural network actually won't improve results in a majority of cases. Changing the size of the hidden layer will. This fact (that the number of hidden layers does very little) has actually was noted historically and is the motivation behind the field of deep learning. Deep learning is effectively clever ways of training multilayer neural networks by, for example, isolating subsets of features when training different layers.
