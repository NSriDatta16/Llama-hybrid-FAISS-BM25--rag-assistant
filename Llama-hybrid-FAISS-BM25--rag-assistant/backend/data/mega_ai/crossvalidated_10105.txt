I'm not a fan of simple formulas for generating minimum sample sizes. At the very least, any formula should consider effect size and the questions of interest. And the difference between either side of a cut-off is minimal. Sample size as optimisation problem Bigger samples are better. Sample size is often determined by pragmatic considerations. Sample size should be seen as one consideration in an optimisation problem where the cost in time, money, effort, and so on of obtaining additional participants is weighed against the benefits of having additional participants. A Rough Rule of Thumb In terms of very rough rules of thumb within the typical context of observational psychological studies involving things like ability tests, attitude scales, personality measures, and so forth, I sometimes think of: n=100 as adequate n=200 as good n=400+ as great These rules of thumb are grounded in the 95% confidence intervals associated with correlations at these respective levels and the degree of precision that I'd like to theoretically understand the relations of interest. However, it is only a heuristic. G Power 3 I typically use G-Power 3 to calculate power based on various assumptions see my post . See this tutorial from the G Power 3 site specific to multiple regression The Power Primer is also a useful tool for applied researchers. Multiple Regression tests multiple hypotheses Any power analysis question requires consideration of effect sizes. Power analysis for multiple regression is made more complicated by the fact that there are multiple effects including the overall r-squared and one for each individual coefficient. Furthermore, most studies include more than one multiple regression. For me, this is further reason to rely more on general heuristics, and thinking about the minimal effect size that you want to detect. In relation to multiple regression, I'll often think more in terms of the degree of precision in estimating the underlying correlation matrix. Accuracy in Parameter Estimation I also like Ken Kelley and colleagues' discussion of Accuracy in Parameter Estimation. See Ken Kelley's website for publications As mentioned by @Dmitrij, Kelley and Maxwell (2003) FREE PDF have a useful article. Ken Kelley developed the MBESS package in R to perform analyses relating sample size to precision in parameter estimation.
