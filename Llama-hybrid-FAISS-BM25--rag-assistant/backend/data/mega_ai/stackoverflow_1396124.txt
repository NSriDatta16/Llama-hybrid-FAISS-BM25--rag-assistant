John Fishers approach looks good. But if you want to stick with jQuery's each, which is quite elegant, try this (based on JasonWoof's hint to set timeouts to 5s, 10s etc.): $("#div_image_thumb ul li").each(function (i) { var $li = $(this); setTimeout(function () { doThis($li); }, 5000 * (i + 1)); });
