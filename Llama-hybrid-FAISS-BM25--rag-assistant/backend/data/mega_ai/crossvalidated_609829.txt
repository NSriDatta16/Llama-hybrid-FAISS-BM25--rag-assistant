Practical usefulness of PCA

I asked a similar question in the past, but I've thought about the message I am trying to convey a bit more and feel I can articulate it better. For context, I am on an introductory course in machine learning. A while ago we covered PCA, and from my point of view, I really can't see what it's good for in the real-world, and Google searching doesn't seem to shed much light on my question. To illustrate my confusion, imagine we have a big data set and we would like to run PCA on it. Suppose (for convenience) that using 2 principal components explains an adequate amount of the variability. Now what? All we have information on now is the linear-combinations of a subset of the variables. I feel like at this point the data has become too abstracted to be interpretable in any meaningful way, in general. So, I reiterate, what's the point? I might be missing something as PCA is used in industry all the time. My ignorance probably comes from only being on an introductory course. Does anyone have any perspective that might be useful?
