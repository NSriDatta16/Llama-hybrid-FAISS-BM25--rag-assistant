Is Recursive Feature Elimination + Random Forest feature ranking an embedded or wrapper feature selection method?

Feature ranking in Random Forest is considered a multivariate feature selection method (Filter). And RFE is a wrapper method. And I know that embedded methods are a combination of filter + wrapper. So is RF feature ranking + RFE an embedded method?
