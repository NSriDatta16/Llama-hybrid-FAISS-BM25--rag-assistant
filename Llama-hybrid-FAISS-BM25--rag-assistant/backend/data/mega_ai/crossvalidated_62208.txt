Simulate data for power analysis of logistic regression model - include covariance variance of variables?

I've tried to simulate data for a power analysis of a logistic regression. The results of the power analysis look reasonable: power=90% for a sample of 6000 persons. But I feel that the analysis lacks something. So, my question is: when generating the data should I include something about how the variables are correlated, or their covariance, other than just defining their linear relationship as I have done in the example below, and if so where do I write that into the code? I know other questions look like this but I'm not confident that they answer this question. library(plyr) # functions ## Define Function simfunktion
