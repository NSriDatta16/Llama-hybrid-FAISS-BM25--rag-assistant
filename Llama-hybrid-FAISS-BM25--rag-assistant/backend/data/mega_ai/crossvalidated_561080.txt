XGBoost: is tuning max depth effectively the same as tuning min_child_weight, or vice versa?

XGBoost allows the user to tune both parameters, max depth and min_child_weight. Since both hyperparameters control the depth of trees, it seems that you would only really need to tune one. However, all the blogs/tutorials I see online tune BOTH simultaneously, and I don't understand why. Is there any reason to tune both?
