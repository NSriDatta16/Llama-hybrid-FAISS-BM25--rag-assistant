Links to sourcecode just suck. Try to avoid that whenever you can. In general I see the following options: Create distinct Project/Solution files in the same folder (one for VS2010 another for VS2008) Mantain your lib within VS2008, link it as a binary reference. Attention: you might need to set the application target framework to 4.0 client profile instead of "plain" 4.0.
