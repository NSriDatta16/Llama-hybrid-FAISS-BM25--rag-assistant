So I've looked into it an i also can't see a straightforward way of flipping the axis. However i do have a solution that would work perfectly well and is relatively elegant giving the omission of a property to do this for you. So consider this normal left-to-right line chart (should just be able to copy and paste this into a project to test). To change this to a right-to-left chart, i do some inverting of the time values to make them negative and then plot them along an axis that uses a negative minimum and zero as the maximum. I also then run a function on the labels to make them positive again to fit the original data source.
