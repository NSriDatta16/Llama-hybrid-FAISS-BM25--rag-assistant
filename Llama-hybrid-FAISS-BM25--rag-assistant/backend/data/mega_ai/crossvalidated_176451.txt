Least-squares means are not means of the data values. They are marginal averages of predictions from the model, taken over a grid consisting of all factor combinations. If your model had included all the two- and three-way interactions, then those predictions would be the same as the cell means, making the LS means the same as the raw means, provided the data are balanced. (You can try this to verify). However, your model excludes most of the interactions, so its predictions don't match the cell means, and the marginal averages of the predictions don't match the marginal means.
