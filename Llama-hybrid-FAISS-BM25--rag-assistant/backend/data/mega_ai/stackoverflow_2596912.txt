Displaying UserControls based on the type a TreeView selection is bound to

I am making an app in WPF in a style similar to Windows Explorer, with a TreeView on the left and a pane on the right. I want the contents of the right pane to change depending on the type of the selected element in the TreeView. For example, say the top level in the Tree View contains objects of class "A", and if you expand the "A" object you'll see a list of "B" objects as children of the "A" object. If the "A" object is selected, I want the right pane to show a user control for "A", and if "B" is selected I want the right pane to show a user control for "B". I've currently got this working by: setting up the TreeView with one HierarchialDataTemplate per type adding all the UserControls to the right pane, but collapsed implementing SelectedItemChanged on the TreeView, and setting the appropriate usercontrol to visible and the others to collapsed. However, I'm sure there's a better/more elegant way to switch out the views based on the type the selection is bound to, perhaps by making more use of data binding... any ideas?
