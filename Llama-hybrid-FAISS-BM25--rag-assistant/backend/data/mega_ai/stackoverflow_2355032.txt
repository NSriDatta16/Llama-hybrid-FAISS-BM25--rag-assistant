DataSets allow multiple tables of data to be held and processed in memory. LINQ to DataSets is part of .NET 3.5: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386977.aspx This would allow a custom storage format, if you write the serialisation and deserialisation to a DataSet for your format. If you don't want to create your own file format, SQL Server Compact Edition (or SQL Express) would probably be an easier option (as in other answer).
