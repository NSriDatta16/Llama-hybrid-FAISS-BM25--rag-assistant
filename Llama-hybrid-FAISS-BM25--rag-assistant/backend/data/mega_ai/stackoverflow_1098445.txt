double unit test reporting with hudson and maven

I have a maven2 project in hudson and when the cobertura reporting plugin runs, it causes the unit tests to show that they have run twice. I don't mind them running multiple times, but the trend graph shows twice as many tests as we actually are running. Is there a way to make sure the graph only shows them once? thanks, Jeff
