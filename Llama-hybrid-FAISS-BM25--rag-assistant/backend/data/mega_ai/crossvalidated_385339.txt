Initialize replay memory and action value function Q

I am not sure I can ask this question here, but I will make an attempt. I am trying to implement Beat Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning . They explained all steps very well, but they ask you to fill the gap in trying yourselves. I take that quite seriously, but I faced some problem. Here is a problem I have: In the linked article , they explained every step how to implement the subject: How do I have to "Initialize replay memory D to capacity N" and "Initialize action-value function Q with random weights" ? Maybe I messed up completely, but for the atari_model() function, did they mean # With the functional API we need to define the inputs. frames_input = keras.layers.Input(ATARI_SHAPE, name="frames") actions_input = keras.layers.Input((n_actions,), name="mask") P.S. Note that I use Keras as framework.
