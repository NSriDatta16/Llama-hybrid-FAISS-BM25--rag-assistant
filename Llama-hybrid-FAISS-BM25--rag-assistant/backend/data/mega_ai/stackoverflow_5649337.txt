Caching url request results can improve your application's latency over a slow connexion. You could use CoreData to manually manage a cache (key:url, value:request's answer) Another more elegant solution would be (if you have write access to the webservices) to implement server-side the "if-modified-since" header so that your request data received would be kept at a minimum level.
