Every time series with a trend component is necessarily a non-stationary series . Non-trended series may or may not be stationary. First plot your time series (if required logged series) to visualize the presence of trend. If there is an intuition for presence of trend , it means the series is not mean reverting , hence non-stationary . To test for stationarity statistically, you can apply unit-root test . For unit root test ADF method is most common as generally, there is auto-correlation in the series. If there is auto-correlation as well as heteroskedasticity in the series, select phillip perron method . Use intercept or intercept + trend or none option as suggested by plot. If null hypothesis is rejected means series has no unit root, so it is stationary. If not, use difference or transformation to make it stationary.
