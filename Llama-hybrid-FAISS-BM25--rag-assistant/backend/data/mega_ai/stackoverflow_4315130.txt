Trouble getting NuGet to work on XP

I have Powershell 2 installed on the box. I can run ISE and load modules. The command test-path PathAndFileName works fine. The box is 64bit running 32bit XP Pro SP3 with VS2008 and VS2010 Premium edition loaded. I installed the Nov8 version of Nuget using the .vsix. I have downloaded the NuGet Command Line Tool. When I try and open a “Add Library Package Reference” no packages are listed. I can open the package manager console as Scott Hanselman showed off in PDC 2010. I can type “list” press the tab key and it auto fills List-Package. I read some articles about deleting previous copies however I do not think that is the issue. I have read where there was a “package” directory at the same level as the solution file. I do not have one. I have read where the feed from CP1 has changed for CP2. I deleted all my feeds and added one called MicroDefault with a url of http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=204820 . The url is from the NuGet download page. The problem is when I execute List-Package I get the following. PM> List-Package Get-Package : Expected an absolute, well formed http URL without a query or fragment. Parameter name: serviceRoot At line:1 char:13 + List-Package Any further clues or hints would be awesome.
