Here are a couple of options: Use the Maven ant task to run jarsigner from the JDK against all the dependencies. Use the webstart plugin which can sign all your JARs, even if you aren't using it for the purpose of JNLP-izing your app. I'm using it to actually JNLPize one app. Look at what the webstart plugin source is doing to iterate over all dependencies and sign them and start a new Maven Plugin/Mojo that does the same thing, sans JNLP. Onejar your app and its dependencies and just sign that.
