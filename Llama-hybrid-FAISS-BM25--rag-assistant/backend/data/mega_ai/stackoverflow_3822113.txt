GEF EditPartViewer selection

I'm experimenting a strange issue developing Drag and Drop with GEF. If I start a drag operation of a not yet selected element in a org.eclipse.gef.ui.parts.TreeViewer the selected element got from EditPartViewer.getSelectedEditPart() is different from the one obtained via the SWT Tree control (Tree.getSelection()). This appens only when I start the drag operation without selecting an element in the tree before starting the operation: steps to reproduce: - select an element in a treeviewe - start dragging an unselected element of the tree now the method Tree.getSelection() return the dragged TreeItem but the EditPartViewer.getSelectedEditPart() still returns the selected editpart, not the dragged one. How can I correct this behavior?
