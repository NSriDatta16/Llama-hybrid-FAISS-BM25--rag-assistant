Who -- specifically -- is the sociopath who's going through the effort to break a program by hacking the pickled file? It's Python. The sociopath has your source. They don't need to fool around hacking your pickle file. They can just edit your source and do all the "damage" they want. Don't worry about "insecurity" unless you're involved in litigation with organized crime syndicates. Don't worry about "a rogue save file could inject harmful code into the program". No one will bother with a rogue save file when they have the source.
