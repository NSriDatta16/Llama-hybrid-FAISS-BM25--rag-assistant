Your backup strategy for the FileStorage is fine. However, making a backup of any database that stores data in multiple files never is easy as your copy has to happen with no writes to the various files. For the FileStorage a blind stupid copy is fine as it's just a single file. (Using repozo is even better.) In this case (with BlobStorage combined with FileStorage) I have to point to the regular backup advice: take the db offline while making a file-system copy use snapshot tools like LVM to freeze the disk at a given point do a transactional export (not feasable in practice)
