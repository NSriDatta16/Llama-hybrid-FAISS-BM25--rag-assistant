I can't solve your problem, but I'll point out you're using a very recent version of Ruby with a quite old version of Rails. That's likely the cause of the issues you're running into. Try installing an older version of ruby and see if that solves your problems. If you' like to learn rails, I humbly suggest you learn Rails 3 (i.e. the latest version of the framework, which will support the recent versions of Ruby). Two excellent resources: http://railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book available online free of charge (along with eBook and screencasts for sale) my personal favorite http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails Rails 3 has really brought a ton of great features (as well as deprecating others), so you're really doing yourself a disservice by learning Rails 2. In addition, the two resources above explain things clearly enough that you won't be held back by the lack of comparisons to Microsoft frameworks.
