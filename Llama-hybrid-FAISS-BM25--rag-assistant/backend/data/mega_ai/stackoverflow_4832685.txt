This will in any case be a tradeoff between lag and stability. Check your data. You may find that the jerking is because of low resolution in Kinect. If so the jerking distance will be determined at how close you are to the Kinect cameras. When you are too far away the camera resolution is too low and it will keep bouncing between one or two pixels (stereo cams). You are thinking in the right direction by calculating average and having a threshold for movement. You say you have calculated average for the last 10 positions, which with a resolution of 30 fps causes a 0,33 second delay. You may want to average out only the 5 last (experiment), and instead of average calculate the mean value. Just a thought; movement rarely comes alone, so you could set a threshold for when you decrease the number of samples used for averaging/mean.
