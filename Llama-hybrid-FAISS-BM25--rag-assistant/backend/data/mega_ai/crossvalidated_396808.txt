Basic aspects of PCA relevant to question PCA is effectively decomposing you original observations into a series of simultaneous equations, ranked in terms of how much they contribute to the overall data set. They are also created such that the pattern of the variable contributions are orthogonal between the PCs. Information post PCA vs original variables If you number of observations = number of variables then using all your PCs captures exactly the same information as the original variables. In this select case the solution is exactly determined. If your number of observations exceeds the number of variables you have an over-determined solution. This means that you have more equations than variables. What happens in this case is that variance is explained until the number of pcs = the number of variables. Any variance remaining after that is not captured by the PCA. What is this unexplained variance? First note that it will be the smallest contributors to the overall variance of the dataset. Whether the unexplained variance is useful or not is an entirely different question - amongst many other options it may be describing random noise describing observation artifacts and biases describing subtle non-linear effects within the data generating process describing real effects that are much weaker than those captured in the top ranked PCs. This means that if you use an over-determined PCA some information is lost compared to the original variables, which may or may not be a good thing depending on the nature of the information lost. Conclusion Are there ever any advantages to using all principal components vs. all original variables for any analysis? PCA is advantageous to eliminate noise and irrelevant artifacts from your data if that is what the excluded information represents restructure your variables so that they are orthogonal for input into further analysis data exploration to understand the inherent interaction of your variables within your dataset
