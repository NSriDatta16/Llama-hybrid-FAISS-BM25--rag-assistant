On Xcode 3.2.5, after building 25 times with successful Builds I started to wonder what was going on. I had to do Build and Archive, as it turns out. After that you get a window in the Organizer which I've never seen before (Archived Applications). There I selected the App and then the Archived build and then context menu with Show in finder. There it was and it uploaded fine to iTunes. Update: From that same sceen, Archived Applications, you can Validate and Submit your App straight to the App store. no more Application Loader. Makes the process less daunting, that's for sure.
