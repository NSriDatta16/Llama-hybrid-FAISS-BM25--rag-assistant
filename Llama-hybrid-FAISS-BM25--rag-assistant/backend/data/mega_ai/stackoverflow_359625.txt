Most elegant way to detect if a String is a number?

Is there a better, more elegant (and/or possibly faster) way than boolean isNumber = false; try{ Double.valueOf(myNumber); isNumber = true; } catch (NumberFormatException e) { } ...? Edit : Since I can't pick two answers I'm going with the regex one because a) it's elegant and b) saying "Jon Skeet solved the problem" is a tautology because Jon Skeet himself is the solution to all problems.
