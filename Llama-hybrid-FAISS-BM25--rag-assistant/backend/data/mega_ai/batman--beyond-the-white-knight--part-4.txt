he Batmobile where he frees Terry but as a result everyone can see Napier. Bruce allows Terry to keep the Batsuit, and decides to lead an assault on Powers. During the assault, Powers activates the Bat Mechs and nearly kills Bruce's allies, and Bruce has another panic attack, but Harley helps him overcome it and Bruce becomes Batman once more. Powers nearly takes control of Terry's suit, but Napier double crosses him and Terry decides not to kill Powers. Napier saves his daughter, but in the process his programming is destroyed. After Powers is arrested, Diana Prince and John Stewart arrive and tell Batman that Derek Powers fears an invasion is coming because of the arrival of Superman. Production Development In late November 2018, while working on the limited series Batman: Curse of the White Knight (2019–20), the sequel to Batman: White Knight (2017–18), comic book writer Sean Murphy revealed in an interview with DC Daily host Tiffany Smith that he planned to introduce Terry McGinnis — the successor to Bruce Wayne as Batman in the animated television series Batman Beyond (1999–2001) — to the Murphyverse, the comic book line overseen by Murphy himself. On the subject of presenting his own depiction of Batman Beyond in the White Knight series, Murphy said: "I'd like to eventually bridge the entire thing series into Batman Beyond. I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with it or how I'm gonna introduce Terry, but I have an idea that will explain why Gotham [City] looks so gothic and Batman Beyond looks so futuristic, and how did this city change so fast. I think I have a way to explain that". Later interviews with Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter and Paul Shirey of JoBlo.com would reinforce the above statement concerning the creation of a sequel to Batman: White Knight and Batman: Curse of the White Knight based on Batman Beyond. A new installment in the Murphyverse titled Batman: Beyond the White Knight was confirmed by Murphy in early December 2019. Writing Speaking with Dustin Holland of Comic Book Resources (CBR) and Matthew Aguilar of ComicBook.com about bringing a distinct version of Terry to Batman: Beyond the White Knight, Murphy emphasized how important it was to him that the character be "unique, but sort of familiar at the same time", with part of his approach to him revolving around introducing Terry as an antagonist at the beginning of the story: "The trick there is like Terry is the antagonist for a bit, but I also don't want to make him a bad guy". Likewise, he simplified that Terry is not an evil person, just someone traumatized by the loss of his father Warren McGinnis and who is looking for a replacement role model in his life. In this way, Murphy hoped to explore Terry's complex nature and establish an engaging dynamic between him and Bruce, the latter who, in Murphy's words, "ages like a fine wine". Additionally, Terry is depicted as being multiracial (partly of Asian and Irish descent) in this book; this was a creative shift the author made to the character's ethnicity, something that was never addressed or specified by the production team of the original TV show, with many of its viewers assuming Terry was Asian for his physical appearance and Irish for his last name, a fact that Murphy was not initially aware of when he decided to diversify the character. In May 2020, during a meeting with Jeff Spry of Syfy Wire, the author described the latest volume of the Murphyverse as a "sci-fi thriller", with its predecessors being a political thriller (Batman: White Knight) and a historical thriller (Batman: Curse of the White Knight), respectively. Furthermore, Murphy unveiled some plot details for Batman: Beyond the White Knight, while hinting at potential supervillains to make appearances in the volume — keeping in mind specific characters like corrupt businessman Derek Powers and criminal groups like the Jokerz and the Royal Flush Gang — who, according to Murphy, fit his "grounded" concept of antagonist that
