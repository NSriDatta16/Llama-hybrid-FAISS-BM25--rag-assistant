How to capture an image and store it with the native Android Camera

I am having a problem capturing an image and storing it from the native camera app. Here is a sample of some of my code. _path = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "make_machine_example.jpg"; File file = new File( _path ); Uri outputFileUri = Uri.fromFile( file ); Intent intent = new Intent(android.provider.MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE ); intent.putExtra( MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, outputFileUri ); startActivityForResult( intent, 0 ); After the picture has been taken and I'm returned back to my original Activity, When I navigate to my sd card via Android DDMS File Explorer the picture is not there. Anyone know why this is not being saved?
