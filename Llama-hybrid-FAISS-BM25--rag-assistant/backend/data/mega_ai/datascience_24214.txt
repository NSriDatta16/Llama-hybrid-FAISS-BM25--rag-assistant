Why should I normalize also the output data?

I'm new to data science and Neural Networks in general. Looking around, many people say it is better to normalize the data before doing anything with the NN. I understand how normalizing the input data can be useful. However, I really don't see how normalizing the output data can help. I've also tried both cases with an easy dataset, and I achieved the same results. The only difference is that in some weird problems, it is really hard to then re-convert the output back. Can you give me some intuition on why we should also normalize the output? Or maybe why it is indifferent?
