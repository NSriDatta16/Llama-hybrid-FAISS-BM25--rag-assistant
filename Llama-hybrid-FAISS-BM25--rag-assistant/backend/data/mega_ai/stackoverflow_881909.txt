structured/combined logging with Log4J

I hope you can help me. I have a web service that needs to log transactions. Since there are many hits, the log statements appears disjoint/fragmented in the log file. I've considered passing a StringBuilder instance through-out the layers and appending the statements to this instance, then I log its contents once at the very end (finally clause in the main controller) before returning a response to the client. This seems unnecessary and I'm sure there's a cleaner way to do it with Log4J. Can anyone shed light on the issue? Thanks
