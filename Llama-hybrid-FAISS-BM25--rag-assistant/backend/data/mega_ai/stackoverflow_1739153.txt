If your can't predict how your data is going to be organized, maybe http://couchdb.apache.org/ can be interesting for you. It is a schema-less database. Anyways, XML is maybe not the best choice for big amout of data. Maybe trying JSON or YAML works out better? They need less space and are easier to parse (I have however no experience on using those formats on larger scale. Maybe I'm wrong).
