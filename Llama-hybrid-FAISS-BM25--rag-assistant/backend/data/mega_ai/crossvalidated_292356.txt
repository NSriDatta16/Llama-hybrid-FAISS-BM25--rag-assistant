Shrinking Mean with Noisy and Skewed Dataset

I am having difficulty inferring the proper measure of central tendency in a noisy, right skewed dataset. The mean for each group is higher than is expected and the coefficient of variation is very high (sometimes 2+). If I infer a value that is overstated, there are business penalties because client goals will not be achieved. However, I do not want to underestimate the value because it would undervalue the group's ability. For example: how do I find the most likely central value of the following sample when the mean is 1,861 and the median is 225? 19533, 19395, 11723, 9998, 9584, 8499, 8438, 8005, 7234, 6667, 6313, 5472, 4819, 4484, 4031, 4018, 3863, 3320, 2640, 1928, 1188, 1089, 1046, 906, 842, 790, 547, 484, 484, 463, 441, 381, 318, 302, 301, 296, 287, 270, 268, 256, 249, 241, 239, 239, 227, 223, 223, 215, 213, 202, 193, 187, 181, 178, 173, 173, 170, 165, 156, 149, 145, 136, 133, 130, 128, 126, 119, 117, 111, 107, 104, 100, 91, 90, 84, 80, 79, 78, 78, 75, 70, 68, 66, 64, 63, 60, 59, 48, 42, 0 The example uses one group, but I have over 200 other groups. Below is an image of the density distribution of means for each group (blue) with a Gamma (red) and Normal (yellow) distribution density overlayed: ggplot(variance_table, aes(x=mean)) + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour="black", fill="white", bins=50) + stat_density(colour="blue", geom="line", position="identity") + stat_function(fun=dnorm, args=list(mean=mean(variance_table$mean), sd=sd(variance_table$mean)), color = "yellow") + stat_function(fun=dgamma, args=list(shape=mean(variance_table$mean)^2/sd(variance_table$mean)^2, scale=sd(variance_table$mean)^2/mean(variance_table$mean)), color="red") I've tried Bayesian mean shrinkage using a Gamma prior, but the shrinkage estimators only shrink the mean at most 11%. I want to produce a more reliable statistic that balances between not overstating and also not understating the most likely value. I would appreciate any ideas or techniques to determine the central tendency for each group. EDIT: If it adds context I would prefer a method to estimate the probability of reaching the mean given the prior distribution. Example: there is a 80% probability that the next observation will reach the mean given the prior distribution of 200+ groups.
