The most elegant solution found so far is this: On the form you want to handle the SecondaryShortCut, add this to the OnShortCut event: procedure TMyForm.FormShortCut(var Msg: TWMKey; var Handled: Boolean); begin Handled := dmDataModule.ActionList1.IsShortCut(Msg); end; Alternative: (This is not a real solution, but a workaround.) Put an action list on the form that has an identical action to the one on the data module. In its execute and update events it only forwards the events to the data module action. The menus on the form use the local action. In this case it suffices to add Ctrl+W to the SecondaryShortCuts property using the IDE. Obviously, when the action on the data module changes, I have to change all local actions too.
