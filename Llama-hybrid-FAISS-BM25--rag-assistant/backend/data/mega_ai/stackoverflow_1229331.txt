Problem with Two Datasets in the same layout in SSRS

IN my SSRS project, I created two datasets that I want to use in the same layout. In my layout, I added two tables. I drag columns from one dataset to one table, and they are all fine. Then I drag columns from the 2nd dataset (same column names as those in the first dataset) to the 2nd table, and it becomes First(....) , as if it thinks I want only the first row of that dataset. Why does it automatically add first(...) and more importantly,how do I refer to the same column names from different datasets in the same layout?
