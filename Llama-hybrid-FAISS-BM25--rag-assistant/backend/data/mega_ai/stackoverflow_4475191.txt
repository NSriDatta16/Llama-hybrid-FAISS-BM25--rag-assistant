Whatever the Progressive Alarm Clock developer is doing, it's not what Robert HÃ¶glund is describing, AFAIK, since the alarm will sound even if the phone is in silent, and UILocalNotification doesn't seem to have any way to allow for this. In addition, if you kill the app manually while an alarm is pending, the app will notify you that it needs to relaunch. This seems to suggest that it must be somehow running in the background.
