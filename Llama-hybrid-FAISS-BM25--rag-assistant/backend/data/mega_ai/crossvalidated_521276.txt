Can I use “Time” as an independent variable in my model in a Machine Learning problem?

I am a new user of Python and Machine learning! Hereunder, I am trying to explain my data and model and then ask my question. I have a couple of independent variables : Ambient temperature, Solar intensity, PCM melting temperature ( PCM is a kind of material that we glue to the back of the PV panel in this experiment ) and, Wind speed. My only dependent variable is the power output of a photovoltaic panel. All independent variables change during a day (from 8 AM to 5 PM) as "Time" passes. For instance, ambient temperature increases from 8 AM to 3 PM and gradually drops from 3 PM to 5 PM. My question is : can I consider "Time" (which is defined in an hour -- e.g. 8,9,....,13,14,....,17) as another independent variable to use machine learning techniques (in Python) like linear regression, Bayesian linear regression and SVM in order to predict the behaviour of the system? I think because time here shows its effects on temperatures and solar intensity directly, I can disregard "time" as another independent variable. I am quite confused here. Any help and suggestion would be much appreciated. Thanks a lot.
