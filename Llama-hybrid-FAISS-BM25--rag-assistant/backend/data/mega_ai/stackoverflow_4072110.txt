The issue is probably that the tools you are using don't support all possibilities supported by the XML schema spec. Certainly xsd.exe doesn't support everything. The spec is gigantic and it isn't worth providing mappings from everything it supports into a programming language, particularly when some things just don't map very well. To work around this, you could try to create a set of C# classes that mimic the xml you want to generate and then run xsd.exe on those classes to generate an xsd. There is probably some other XML schema construct that supports what you want.
