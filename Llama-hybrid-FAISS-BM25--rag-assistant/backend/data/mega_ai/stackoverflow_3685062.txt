The first thing you want to do is to 'symbolicate' the crash dump. Then you will see references to your application code. It will actually display what your app did by references your source files and line numbers in those those files. The easiest way to do this is to drop the crash dump on Xcode. It will add it to the Organizer and try to find the symbols. Note that this only works if you have used 'Build and Archive' for the application version that corresponds to this crash dump.
