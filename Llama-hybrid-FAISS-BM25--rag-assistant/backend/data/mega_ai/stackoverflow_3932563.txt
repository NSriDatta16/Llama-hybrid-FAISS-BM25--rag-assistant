In terms of performance measurement, if you are considering the time performance then the Integer.toString(i); is expensive if you are calling less than 100 million times. Else if it is more than 100 million calls then the new Integer(10).toString() will perform better. Below is the code through u can try to measure the performance, public static void main(String args[]) { int MAX_ITERATION = 10000000; long starttime = System.currentTimeMillis(); for (int i = 0; i In terms of memory, the new Integer(i).toString(); will take more memory as it will create the object each time, so memory fragmentation will happen.
