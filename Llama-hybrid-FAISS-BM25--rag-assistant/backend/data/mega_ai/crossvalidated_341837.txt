A kernel is used a multitude of times in Machine Learning and statistics. A few examples are: In Support Vector Machines a kernel is a function that maps the data to a higher-dimensional space where the problem becomes linearly solvable (watch this ). Kernel Density Estimation Kernel Density Estimation is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. In this context a kernel is simply a weighting function used in kernel density estimation. The last link also has a few more uses of the word kernel in statistics. In Convolutional Neural Networks , a kernel is a small matrix that is used to perform the convolution between the image and itself. See here . In all these examples a kernel is a mathematical function that is used for some sort of transformation on your data. The kernel essentially is the constant part of that transformation. Depending on the choice of kernel we use for each transformation we might get a different effect from it.
