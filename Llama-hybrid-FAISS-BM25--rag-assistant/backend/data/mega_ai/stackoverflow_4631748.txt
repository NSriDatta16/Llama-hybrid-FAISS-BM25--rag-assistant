A particular database design question

My current database consists of the following tables. Store users ratings of given questions - user( uid(varchar), qid(varchar), rating(varchar), primary key(uid, qid) ) Store the question and its id - questions( uid(varchar), question(text), primary key(qid) ) Store the relationship that questions have amongst each other - related( qid(varchar), related_qid(varchar), relation(varchar), primary key(qid, related_qid, relation) ) Each question is related to at least one other question; for instance, question1 and question2 could be related in that the average rating of question1 is expected to be greater than that of question2. This relationship would be stored in the "related" table as INSERT INTO related (qid, related_qid, relation) VALUES (1, 2, gt) where 'gt' means "greater than". The issue is that encoding the relations doesn't seem at all elegant. Does anyone have a better solution?
