I would say that yui, and especially yui3 encourage and makes it easy to keep your code modular. You have the yui loader where you can pull in parts of your application on the fly, and you also have rich support for synthetic events that lets you decouple parts of your application a bit more. You aren't forced to use these features, but if you do it can help you build more modular applications and aid code re-use.
