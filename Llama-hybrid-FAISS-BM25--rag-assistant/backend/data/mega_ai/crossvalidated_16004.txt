In the 2-group situation, the cut-off value of the discriminant function scores is simply the mean of the means of the scores for the groups (those means are also called "function's values at group centroids"). Say, if for group 1 the mean score is -.742 and for group 2 it is .576, then the cut-value for classifying is their average, -.083. This is true when prior probabilities are set to .5 and when discriminant function scores used aren't normalized in some way). Note that my answer is "general": I'm not R-user and don't know how it is all in MASS.
