I've written several answers and each time they got long and I eventually decided I was getting up on a soapbox. But I think that this conversation has not fully explored two important factors: The Science in Data Science. A scientific approach is one in which you try to destroy your own models, theories, features, technique choices, etc, and only when you cannot do so do you accept that your results might be useful. It's a mindset and many of the best Data Scientists I've met have hard-science backgrounds (chemistry, biology, engineering). Data Science is a broad field. A good Data Science outcome usually involves a small team of Data Scientists, each with their own speciality. For example, one team member is more rigorous and statistical, another is a better programmer with an engineering background, and another is a strong consultant with business savvy. All three are quick to learn the subject matter, and all three are curious and want to find the truth -- however painful -- and to do what's in the best interest of the (internal or external) customer, even if the customer doesn't understand. The fad over the last few years -- now fading, I think -- is to recruit Computer Scientists who have mastered cluster technologies (Hadoop ecosystem, etc) and say that's the ideal Data Scientist. I think that's what the OP has encountered, and I'd advise the OP to push their strengths in rigor, correctness, and scientific thinking.
