Well, it took me 3 days to figure out that FileUploader was not doing ftp uploads, and that the server destination was actually not a folder but a server-side script. I am going to answer my question in case someone else needs help. Here is a barebone php script to save the image 'uploaded' by FileUploaded. Make sure to create a folder where your php file is ("my_images" in this example). To trigger the FileUploader plugin: window.plugins.FileUploader.uploadByUri("http://www.yourserver.com/your_php_script.php", your_actual_image, null, "image", "my_image.jpg", "image/jpg", uploadSuccess, uploadFail, uploadProgress); Notice that my fileKey parameter is "image" because I am uploading an image. This matches $_FILES['image']['tmp_name'] and $_FILES['image']['name'] . Make sure to copy 'fileUploader.js' in your www folder, but 'fileUploader.h' and 'fileUploader.m' in your Plugins folder. (Do not copy the FileUploader folder itself). Roberto
