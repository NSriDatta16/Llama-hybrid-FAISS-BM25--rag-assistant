Uniform prior: Is this description of the function correct?

I was learning about Bayesian Parameter Estimation when I came across Uniform prior. I saw the answers to this question for some insight into it. In the source I'm referring to, this is how the function is described: Doesn't this suggest that for any θ, P(θ) = 1? How is that possible? Have I misunderstood the description? Any insight is appreciated!
