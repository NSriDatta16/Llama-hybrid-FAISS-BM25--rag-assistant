You might find the below reference of use: http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/bs/bs704_multivariable/bs704_multivariable7.html Essentially, a good first step to estimate the impact of potential confounders on both your dependent and independent variable of interest, is to add confounding variables to your regression in a stepwise fashion. For instance, if you find that upon adding a confounder that your coefficient changes value by a significant percentage, e.g. 10% or more, then you can infer that the added variable is indeed a confounder. Moreover, take into account the effect of interaction when looking at the differences between your treatment and control groups. e.g. if sex is one of your variables and your interaction variable is (treatment*sex), then you could find that such a variable is statistically significant, indicating that treatment differs by gender. For a logistic regression, you are likely better off using the AIC value to compare models. The lower the AIC value, the better the indicated fit. Hope this helps.
