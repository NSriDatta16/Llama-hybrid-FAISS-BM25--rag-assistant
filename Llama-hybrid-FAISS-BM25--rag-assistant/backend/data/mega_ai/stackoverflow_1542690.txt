Generalization functions for Q-Learning

I have to do some work with Q Learning, about a guy that has to move furniture around a house (it's basically that). If the house is small enough, I can just have a matrix that represents actions/rewards, but as the house size grows bigger that will not be enough. So I have to use some kind of generalization function for it, instead. My teacher suggests I use not just one, but several ones, so I could compare them and so. What you guys recommend? I heard that for this situation people are using Support Vector Machines, also Neural Networks. I'm not really inside the field so I can't tell. I had in the past some experience with Neural Networks, but SVM seem a lot harder subject to grasp. Are there any other methods that I should look for? I know there must be like a zillion of them, but I need something just to start. Thanks
