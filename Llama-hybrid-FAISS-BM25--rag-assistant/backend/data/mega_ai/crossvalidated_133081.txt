I have become curious about the topic and performed a brief research. It appears that, generally, the taxonomy of approaches to kernel density estimation (KDE) for data streams consists of two large groups: offline and online approaches. The offline approaches include so called CF-kernel and KD-kernel methods, while the online approaches include grid-based , sample-based and cluster-based groups of methods. More details about this taxonomy as well as one of the methods (called adaptive KDE ), can be found in this research paper . M-Kernel method is the core of the cluster-based approach to KDE for streaming data and is discussed in various research papers, for example in this and this . Finally, an interesting and novel method, implementing KDE for data streams, based on self-organizing maps (SOM) , has been proposed recently. It is called SOMKE and is described in this research paper . Hope this helps.
