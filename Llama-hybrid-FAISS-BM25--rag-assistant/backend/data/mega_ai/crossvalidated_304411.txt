Prior for the regression coefficients in the logistic regression

I'm trying to model Bayesian logistic regression model with my dependent variable (status: 0=alive, 1 death) & independent variable (age) in the categorical form (0=patients =65 yrs old). I'm using normal dist. as a prior for constant term, b0 and Dirichlet dist. as the prior for the regression coefficient,b1. However, i got the error of incorrect number of parameters in distribution ddirch. Am i using the correct prior for b1? or should i just assigned normal prior for it? Below are the codes i used: # Bayesian logistic model for JAGS # bayes.mod
