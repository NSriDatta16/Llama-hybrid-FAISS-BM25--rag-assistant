If you want a "local" time-domain model -- as opposed to estimating correlation functions or power spectra), say in order to detect and characterize transient pulses, jumps, and the like -- then the Bayesian Block algorithm may be useful. It provides an optimal piecewise constant representation of time series in any data mode and with arbitrary (unevenly) spaced sampling. See "Studies in Astronomical Time Series Analysis. VI. Bayesian Block Representations," Scargle, Jeffrey D.; Norris, Jay P.; Jackson, Brad; Chiang, James, Astrophysical Journal, Volume 764, 167, 26 pp. (2013). http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5578
