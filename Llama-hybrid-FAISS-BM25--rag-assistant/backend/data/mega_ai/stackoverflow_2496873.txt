How to save value of an element selected by the array style in jQuery?

Let's say we have following this: This is paragraph 1. This is paragraph 2. This is paragraph 3. This is paragraph 4. We can save the value of an element in value variable and show like this. var value = $('p').slice(3,4); value.text(); // result --> This is paragraph 4 Above way has no problem if we know the number of element but we'll get problem if we have a lot of elements and we want to do with looping. why I get error if I do like this? $('p')[3].text(); What should I do if I want to loop and get values?
