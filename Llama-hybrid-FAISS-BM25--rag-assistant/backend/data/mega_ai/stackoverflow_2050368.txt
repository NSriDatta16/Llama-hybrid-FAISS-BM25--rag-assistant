I don't see the event name anywhere, but I'll post the general case here: Assumed: That you have a module set up, with models being loaded correctly from the Yourmodule/Model directory.. In your module's config.xml file: singleton yourmodule/observer yourMethodName Create a file %yourmodule%/Model/Observer.php with the following contents: getData(); // this follows normal Magento data access // perform your action here } }//class Yourmodule_Model_Observer Really, you can name the method whatever you want within your observer, but the pattern seems to be to name the class itself Observer. It is loaded using normal model loading (e.g. yourmodule/observer maps to Yourmodule_Model_Observer). Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
