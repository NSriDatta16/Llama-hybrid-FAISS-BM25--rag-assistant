You can try out Yelp's MRJob to get your job done.. Its an opensource MapReduce Library that allows you to write chained jobs that can be run atop Hadoop Streaming on your Hadoop Cluster or EC2.. Its pretty elegant and easy to use, and has a method called steps which you can override to specify the exact chain of mappers and reducers that you want your data to go through. Checkout the source at https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob and documentation at http://packages.python.org/mrjob/
