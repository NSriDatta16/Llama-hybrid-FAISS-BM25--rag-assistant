To my knowledge, this is not possible using the default control. I believe you could create a custom report i.e. by creating an ASP.net application for example and embedding the Report Viewer Control. You could then create a custom implementation of a calendar/date picker component in order to have more refined control over the behaviour. I also believe Dundas have a custom Calendar control for Reporting Services Further Reading: Report Viewer Controls Dundas Calendar
