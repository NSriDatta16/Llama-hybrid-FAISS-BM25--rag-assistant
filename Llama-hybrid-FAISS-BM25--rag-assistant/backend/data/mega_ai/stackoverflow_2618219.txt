Nobody seems to have mentioned the DBUS - available to developers on a Linux system. I guess that's no good if you're trying to make a Windows/Cross Platform application, but the DBUS is a ready-made application-communication platform. It helps address issues such as: Someone else might already be using the port you're trying. There's no way for you client application (The "Preferences" window I guess) to know whether the thing listening on that port is your main application, or just something else that happens to be there, so you'll have to do some sort of handshake, and implement a conflict-resolution mechanism It's not going to be obvious to either the future you, or anyone who comes to maintain your app why you're on the port you are. This might not seem important, but communicating on Socket 5574 just doesn't seem as neat to me as communicating on channel org.yourorganisation.someapp . Firewalls (as I think someone's already said) can be a little over-zealous Also, it's worth getting your hand in on DBUS - it's useful for communicating with a whole bunch of other applications such as the little popup notification thing you'll find in recent Ubuntu distributions, or certain instant messaging clients, etc. You can read up on what I'm talking about (and maybe correct me on some of the things I've said) here: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus . It looks like they're working on making it happen on Windows too, which is nice.
