Should one blindly trust the DTA advise and implement all recommendations without considering the implications? No. Should one ignore the DTA and just analyze everything from scratch? No. DTA (or whatever it's later incarnation is called) it's a tool. Like any other tool, is how you use it... The tunning advisor will give advice based on the workload you present to it. As a general rule, the DTA advice is good quality and solid advice. DTA cannot advise on other types of workload, that was not captured for the analysis replay. It cannot advise on the implications of adding extra indexes on the storage capacity and long term retention policies. It cannot detect stupid queries, it will give advise to improve the access path of those stupid queries but an inteligent human analysis might give advise to improve the query syntax or redefine the requirements. For someone immersed in a project for months and working with the project data schema and queries every day, the DTA should not reveal any surprise. So it may be said that is a superflous tool in that case. But I'd say that it should still be used exactly to validate that it does not give any stelar new advice.
