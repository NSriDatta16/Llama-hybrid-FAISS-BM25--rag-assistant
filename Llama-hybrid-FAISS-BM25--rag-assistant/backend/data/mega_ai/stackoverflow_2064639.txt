from http://groovy.codehaus.org/ : "Groovy is like a super version of Java. It can leverage Java's enterprise capabilities but also has cool productivity features like closures, builders and dynamic typing. If you are a developer, tester or script guru, you have to love Groovy." So in many cases it does make sense to use Groovy over Java; For instance in Java unit tests!
