If you have the raw data, you should not perform $t$-tests (either one- or two-sample) in the normal way. That is because the data will not be independent--the students who come from the same class will be more similar to each other than to students from other classes. Due to this non-independence, you won't have quite as much information as your $N$ implies. Most likely, you would want to fit a multilevel / mixed-effects model with students as 'level 1' units and classes as 'level 2' units. This amounts to including a random intercept for each class. You can pursue this strategy whether you are doing a one-sample or two sample test. On the other hand, if you only have the class averages from different classes with differing numbers of students in each, and you know what the $n_j$'s are, you may want to do a weighted $t$-test. This will be more efficient than an unweighted version. The rationale is that the averages from the classes with more students are more precise than the averages from smaller classes, thus they should get more weight in the calculation.
