"Classic" ASP.NET hasn't gone anywhere - you can still use it if that's what you want or need Though you may or may not get "drag-and-drop" functionality, between AutoComplete and the various render helpers you can easily get a working view in minutes Creating the views is only a small fraction of the overall project Even in ASP.NET I rarely used the visual editor. I always felt that it got in my way and made decisions for me, wrongly.
