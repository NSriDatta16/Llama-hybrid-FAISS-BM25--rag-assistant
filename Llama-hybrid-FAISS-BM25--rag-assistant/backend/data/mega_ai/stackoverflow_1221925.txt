You can clone the fragment and append it inside of the popup. $('#fb_contentarea_down21').clone().appendTo('#contactArea'); The only issue is that you will end up with duplciate id's in the dom which is not valid and will start playing havoc with your selectors. So you will have to rename all the id's which can get messy Best thing to do is append the fragment and when you close the popup append the fragment back $('#fb_contentarea_down21').children().appendTo('#contactArea'); then when closing popup $('#contactArea').children().appendTo('#fb_contentarea_down21');
