problem forecasting in R using a VAR model : interpretation of characteristic polynomial roots

I have the following R code, I am fitting a VAR(10) models to a bivariate time series, comprising two variables, gaz and nuc. Yet, when trying to forecast, I had negative values, whereas my series is the nuclear electricity production and the total imports of gaz by France, from november 2003 to november 2022. So negative values are impossible. I wonder the cause of this, as my model passed the ARCH test, the serial tests too, but not the Jarque-Bera test. Maybe it is not stationary, but I do not know how to interpret the value of the roots of the characteristic polynomial in R, which you can see here, performed on 4 different models . I tried to perform an RMSE test, but it didn't work, because R doesn't recognise that start_date is before end_date : library(lubridate) start_date $Nucléaire, actual_2022$ Nucléaire) I get the following error after subset data : Error in window.default(x, ...) : 'start' ne peut pas être après 'end' In addition: Warning message: In window.default(x, ...) : valeur de 'end' inchangée Here is my code : lagSelect Here is the summary of the model : Any help would be welcome, thanks in advance !
