How to change the rules for inference

I am using Eclipse with Jena framework to develop a Web Application. My application does the following: Register the new users with the information of name, email, interest(C language, Java, etc),Occupation, Username and password. This information is stored in the rdf file named user.rdf. With the new desired username and password a new user account is created.The Login of the new user opens all the relevent books in the database as per the interest of the user. Now I require to recommend the new user the following: If he/she is interested in C Language then the books of C++ will be recommended to him and the list can be populated onto the screen. I know this requires an inference engine which needs facts and rules. The facts will be in the rdf file which stores the interest of the users. The rules file will show based on the rules when the recommendation will be done. I have an user.rdf file with the following contents. Suresh suresh suresh Agent Java Suresh suresh_345@yahoo.co.in ra@gmail.com Raj lkj raj C Language Student Anvika anu anu Student C Language Anvika anu@gmail.com The users Suresh and Anvika were actually created in Protege and then the file will be updated with the other user details through the application. The test.rules file has the following: @prefix kb: http://protege.stanford.edu/kb# [likec++: (?s rdf:type kb:LikeC++) The inference which comes is suresh_345@yahoo.co.in Suresh Java Agent suresh suresh Suresh Student C Language raj lkj Raj ra@gmail.com anu@gmail.com Anvika C Language Student anu anu Anvika Now due to the line having inference gives the user Anvika recommendation of LikeC++. But the same is missing for the user Raj who also is interested in C Language. I understood that the line has caused only user Anvika to be infered. But this line was automatically added through Protege. My programme does not do that. So how do I add that line through my application. If this is not possible please tell me how do I change the rules to infer the correct results. Please help me. I am struck at this for a long time.
