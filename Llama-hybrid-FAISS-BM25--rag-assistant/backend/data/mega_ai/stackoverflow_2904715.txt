What is the safest way of databinding to an element in another xaml file in WPF

I have an application which shows a Tree where can select nodes of the tree and add them to a list. To keep the code clean I have moved the TreeView into it's own UserControl(I use this tree in several places) and xaml file. To add a node to the list I have an 'add' button. However I want to gray-out this 'add' button when none of the treeviewitems are selected. What is the wisest way to do this. I can bind to the complete usercontrol and write a more complicated converter, but this seems inelegant. Are there any simple solutions? I would have hoped something along the lines of "ElementName=xamlFile.TargetElement" would have worked...
