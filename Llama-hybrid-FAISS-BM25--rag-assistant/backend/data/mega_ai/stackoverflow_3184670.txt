How can I clear Magento Cache when using a Memcached server

I've been running on a problem for about two weeks. I Have a magento which is configured to use a memcache server. Recently, I got to change the server storing my magento application. I installed my new server, and just get my magento app up and running on the new server, with one change : I changed the database user and password used to connect to the database server. I changed from userold to usernew. This change takes place in my local.xml file. But now, when I active the magento cache, Magento tries to connect to my database with the old username : userold. I've tried all things : rm -fR var/ /etc/init.d/memcache restart killall memcached reboot the entire server running memcached! I still have my cache problem ! I can't get my Where does this "userold" value is fuc*** stored ? Any help would really be appreciated ! :) Hugues.
