It is my understanding that the performance degradation you get from (overloading) the Session is due to the overhead of serialization/deserialization, not storage size. If you are looking at compression to help with performance issues I think you're going down the wrong road. (De)Compression will just add more overhead. Now if you're talking about the Cache, then things are a bit different. But you specifically mention Session... I'm confused by your question having just read your comment on Scott's article. It seems you don't really understand you're getting data persistence by putting something in Session/Cache the same as if you put it into a database or wrote it to file. Compression isn't going to solve what you're asking about.
