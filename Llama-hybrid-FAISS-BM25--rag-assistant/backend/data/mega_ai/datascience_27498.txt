Multi task learning in Keras

I am trying to implement shared layers in Keras. I do see that Keras has keras.layers.concatenate , but I am unsure from documentation about its use. Can I use it to create multiple shared layers? What would be the best way to implement a simple shared neural network as shown below using Keras? Note that all the shape of input, output and shared layers for all 3 NNs are the same. There are multiple shared layers (and non-shared layers) in the three NNs. The coloured layers are unique to each NN, and have same shape. Basically, the figure represents 3 identical NNs with multiple shared hidden layers, followed by multiple non-shared hidden layers. I am unsure how to share multiple layers as in the Twitter example, there was just one shared layer (example in API doc).
