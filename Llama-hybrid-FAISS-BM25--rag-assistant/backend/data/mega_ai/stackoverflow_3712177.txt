Teradata Optimizer Equal vs Like in SQL

I am currently trying to optimize some bobj reports where our backend is Teradata. The Teradata optimizer seems very finicky and I was wondering if anyone has come up with a solution or a workaround to get the optimizer to treat likes in a similar regard to equals . My issue is that we allow the user to input one of two methods: 1. Enter the Number: or 2. Enter a Number like: Option one performs like a dream while option two is dragging our query times from 6 seconds to 2 minutes. In addition to this; does anyone know of any good articles, discussions, vidoes, etc.. on optimizing SQL statements for the teradata optimizer?
