Penalized methods comprehensive overview

For the last 10 years from 2004 we have seen a growth in the number of different regularization techniques that have been in use. First it was LASSO, then Adaptive-LASSO, Elastic Net, SCAD, MC+, just to name a few. Is there any definitive book chapter or paper which provides a comprehensive overview of ALL the different penalized methods (Convex, Non-Convex, Bayesian, Frequentist etc)(LASSO and all its modern rivals :-) ) and kind of tells us why one method is better/more useful than the other both theoretically and in any applied setting?
