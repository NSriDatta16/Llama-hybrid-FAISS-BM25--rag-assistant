Is my network a real network

I have a network with a 361 nodes and 695 edges. My objective is to prove that my network is real and not a random connection of nodes like in the case of a random network. So, I did some research and 4 parameters are said to be valid 1) Degree distribution plot real network has a power law distribution for nodes rather than a bell curve 2) Real network would have a single giant component with average degree > 1 3) Clustering co-efficient (transitivity) for Random networks are very close to zero. and I am unsure about this but, 4) Diameter of a real graph is large and random networks have small diameters (Small world connectivity) Could you please clarify if these four points are correct? My network satisfies the first two parameters,i.e it has a power law distribution for the degrees and the average degree is 3.85 (which is much larger than 1) However, the clustering co-efficient of my network is zero, moreover, all nodes have clustering co-efficient values very close to zero or zero. Does this mean that my network is not real? Does it have to satisfy all four parameter? Thank you in advance
