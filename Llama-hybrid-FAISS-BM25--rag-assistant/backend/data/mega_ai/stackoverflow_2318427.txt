text selection AND bubbling

this is the problem: I'm using javascript and JQuery (not UI) to drag nested objects in my web page. to disable the text selecting I have to return FALSE from the mousedown handler, but this disable also the event bubbling. But I need event bubbling... What can I do?? thanks
