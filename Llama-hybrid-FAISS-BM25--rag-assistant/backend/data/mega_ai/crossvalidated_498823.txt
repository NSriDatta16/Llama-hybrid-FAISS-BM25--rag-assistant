How to compute Cohen's d when provided percent difference and standard deviation?

I am trying to compute Cohen's d from a published paper. M1 and M2 were provided as percent differences (the average difference in scores from t1 to t2 for an experimental group and then a control group). SD was provided. M1=40.50%, SD1= 3.40 M2=6.89, SD2=5.78 Am I able to compute cohen's d by transforming these percentages or is more information required? If so, how do I compute. Thanks!
