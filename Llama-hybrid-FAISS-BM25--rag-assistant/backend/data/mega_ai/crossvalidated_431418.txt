Instructive example for using machine learning to predict continuous variable?

Arguably, the MNIST or titanic examples are probably the most common and instructive examples of classification problems solved using machine learning. Are there any 'iconic' examples of machine learning models used to predict continuous variables? Notes By 'continuous', I mean continuous within some range, not limited to negative infinity to positive infinity, 0 to positive infinity, or 0 - 1. E.g. predicting a property value or temperature. By 'example' I mean something accessible on the web, with easy to download data and code (preferably available in the main data science languages)
