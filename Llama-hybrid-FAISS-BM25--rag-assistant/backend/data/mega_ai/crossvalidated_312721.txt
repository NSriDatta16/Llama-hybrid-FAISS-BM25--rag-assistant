I think there are two types of "false placebo"/back tests that work well with SC methods. Pick a few target time series where there was no treatment, like sales in a different store/region where the was no promotion and you don't expect any interference from the treated units. Repeat the analysis as if the treatment happened during your campaign period. If you see a lot of significant effects, become very nervous. Use the target time series from your campaign, but focus on the pre-campaign period. Pretend there was a campaign during a random day/week/month/year and repeat the same analysis few times. If you consistently find an effect, become worried.
