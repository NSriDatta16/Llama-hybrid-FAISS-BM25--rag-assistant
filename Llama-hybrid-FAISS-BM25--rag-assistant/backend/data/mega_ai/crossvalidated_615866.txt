In which contexts is MSE equal to RSE squared?

My instructor in a recorded online data science learning platform described MSE as equal to RSE squared. After reviewing the formulas for MSE and RSE, however, I don't understand how or when this might be true. The formulas are: $\text{RSE} = \sqrt{\dfrac{\text{SSE}}{n-p-1}}$ $\text{MSE} = \dfrac{\text{SSE}}{n}$ If RSE accounts for degrees of freedom, and MSE does not, when/how can MSE be equal to RSE squared?
