d practical functionality. Critics argued for user autonomy and effectiveness, while proponents stressed the importance of ethical AI. Claude 3 Claude 3 was released on March 4, 2024, with claims in the press release to have set new industry benchmarks across a wide range of cognitive tasks. The Claude 3 family includes three models in ascending order of capability: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. The default version of Claude 3, Opus, has a context window of 200,000 tokens, but this is being expanded to 1 million for specific use cases. Claude 3 drew attention for demonstrating an apparent ability to realize it is being artificially tested during needle in a haystack tests. Claude 3.5 On June 20, 2024, Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which, according to the company's own benchmarks, performed better compared to the larger Claude 3 Opus. Released alongside 3.5 Sonnet was the new Artifacts capability in which Claude was able to create code in a dedicated window in the interface and preview the rendered output in real time, such as SVG graphics or websites. An upgraded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, billed as "Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New)", was introduced on October 22, 2024, along with Claude 3.5 Haiku. A feature, "computer use," was also released in public beta. This allowed Claude 3.5 Sonnet to interact with a computer's desktop environment by moving the cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text. This development allows the AI to attempt to perform multi-step tasks across different applications. Upon release, Anthropic claimed Claude 3.5 Haiku would remain the same price as its predecessor, Claude 3 Haiku. However, on November 4th, 2024, Anthropic announced that they would be increasing the price of the model. Claude 3.7 Claude 3.7 Sonnet was released on February 24, 2025. It is a pioneering hybrid AI reasoning model that allows users to choose between rapid responses and more thoughtful, step-by-step reasoning. This model integrates both capabilities into a single framework, eliminating the need for multiple models. Users can control how long the model "thinks" about a question, balancing speed and accuracy based on their needs. Anthropic also launched a research preview of Claude Code, an agentic command line tool that enables developers to delegate coding tasks directly from their terminal. Claude 4 On May 22, 2025, Anthropic released two more models: Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4. Anthropic added API features for developers: a code execution tool, a connector to its Model Context Protocol, and Files API. It classified Opus 4 as a "Level 3" model on the company's four-point safety scale, meaning they consider it so powerful that it poses "significantly higher risk". Anthropic reported that during a safety test involving a fictional scenario, Claude and other frontier LLMs often send a blackmail email to an engineer in order to prevent their replacement. Enterprise adoption of Claude Code has shown significant growth, with Anthropic reporting in August a 5.5x increase in Claude Code revenue since it launched Claude 4 in May. In the API, Opus costs $15/$75 per million tokens input/output, whereas Sonnet costs $3/$15. Claude Opus 4.1 On August 5, 2025, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.1 to Claude users and via third-party services. Claude Sonnet 4.5 On September 29, 2025, Anthropic released Claude Sonnet 4.5. It was added to GitHub Copilot the same day. Claude Haiku 4.5 On October 15, 2025, Anthropic released Claude Haiku 4.5, making the model available on both the Claude.ai website and mobile app. Features In June 2024, Anthropic released the Artifacts feature, allowing users to generate and interact with code snippets and documents. In October 2024, Anthropic released the "computer use" feature, allowing Claude to attempt to navigate computers by interpreting screen content and simulating keyboard and mouse input. In March 2025, Anthropic added a web search feature to Claude, starting with only paying users located in the Unit
