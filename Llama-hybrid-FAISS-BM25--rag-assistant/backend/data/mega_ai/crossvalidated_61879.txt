I assume you have a dataset that has the following variables: outcome (one or more of these), cohortID, covariates (many of these). If you've matched the two cohorts on all of the covariates, and your plan is to analyze the outcome(s) between groups using t-tests (or similar), then there should be no added value of incorporating the covariates into your analysis since the two cohorts will not differ (post-matching) on any of those variables. You mention logistic regression specifically, which I assume means that one of your outcomes is coded (0,1) like whether an individual did graduate or did not graduate. You could use logistic regression including only the cohort identifier variable as a predictor. This should, however, give you substantively similar inference to a number of other tests suited for binary outcomes, like a difference-of-proportions test, the odds-ratio, or the risk ratio. If your outcome is not binary, then t-test, linear regression, or similar are the way to go.
