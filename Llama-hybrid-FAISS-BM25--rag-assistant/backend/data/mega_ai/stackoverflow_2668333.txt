Thanks for the advertisements folks ! though I would prefer an advice how to do it myself. I found out that I can do it for free , since Interspire supports Interspire -> OsCommerce migration and there's free OsCommerce -> Magento migration module in Magento Connect, only thing I need to do is to setup temporary OsCommerce on public server.
