When are Magento rule-based product relations worked out?

Magento's rule-based product relations (up-sell, cross-sell etc) are stored in a database table, and I assume they are updated once in a while. Unfortunately, I can't find any documentation about when that happens or what triggers it. Is it: Cached, like a block, and expires after a certain time? Generated whenever you save a product? Generated by CRON? I'd really appreciate it is someone could fill in the blanks for me. I'm using the Enterprise edition, if that helps or makes any difference.
