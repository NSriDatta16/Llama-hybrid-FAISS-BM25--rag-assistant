The only way you can reliably reduce file fragmentation is to allocate space for the complete file in one go (fill the rest of the file with zeros, as filler). But this can only be done if you have some idea of the final size of the file. Another option would be to increase the file size by a certain value during each increment (say, 100 MB). That way you would have lesser defragmented chunks.
