You could make it sort-of work by adding a width to the within itemBody (and some padding to make it nice): .itemBody p { width:400px; padding-left:20px; } .itemBody h1 { padding-left:20px; } The problem with this solution is that the right edges of the paragraphs will be aligned differently depending on the image size, and the text could still fall to the next line if the image is pretty wide. If you can dynamically size things with server-side code based on the image size, then this would be ok. (Or I suppose you could do the resizing in javascript.) I really think this is a problem still best solved with tables. You get the dynamic width adjustment and everything stays on the same line, no matter what size your images and text are. No hacks, no fuss, works in all browsers.
