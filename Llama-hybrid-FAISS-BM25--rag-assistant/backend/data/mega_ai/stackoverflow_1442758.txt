Are there non-sampling time-profiling tools for iPhone apps?

I have tried Instruments and Shark to profile an iPhone app, but both use a data sampling approach, by regularly taking screenshots of thread stacks. I would prefer to have a full coverage profiling tool, which would record every single function call and the time spent in functions and their subroutines. This seems intuitively better than getting samples. Something like AQtime on Windows would be great. So my questions are: Can sample-based profiling be trusted and be as useful as function-call-based profiling? Can Instruments or Shark do this type of profiling? Are there other tools available, which would be closer to what I want?
