in application/config/config.php , under "Session Variables" is a boolean value called sess_encrypt_cookie which can obscure the session ID. There are also options to require a matching IP address and user agent. This should make it very difficult for someone to spoof the session ID, even if they know what it is. Regarding whether a session ID will always exist, if your app starts a session on page load it is safe to assume that there is a session ID. However, it expires after a period of inactivity, so it may not be the same the next time the user visits, meaning all of your session settings will be lost when they leave. Hope this helps.
