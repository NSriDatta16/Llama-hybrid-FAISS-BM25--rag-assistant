Bartlett's theorem is useful for this. If $\{\mathbf{X}_{t}\}$ is a bivariate time series whose components are defined by $$ X_{t1} = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \alpha_k Z_{t-k,1}, \hspace{10mm} \{Z_{t1}\} \sim \text{IID}(0, \sigma^2_1) $$ and $$ X_{t2} = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \beta_k Z_{t-k,2}, \hspace{10mm} \{Z_{t2}\} \sim \text{IID}(0, \sigma^2_2) $$ where the two sequences $\{Z_{t1}\}$ and $\{Z_{t2}\}$ are independent, $\sum_k |\alpha_k| In particular $$ \sqrt{n}\hat{\rho}_{12}(h) \overset{D}{\to} \text{N}\left(0, \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} \rho_{11}(j)\rho_{22}(j) \right), $$ which means that you can still observe large cross-correlations for independent time series! But, if you assume further that at least one of $X_{t1}$ and $X_{t,2}$ is white noise, then many of those summands are $0$ and $$ \sqrt{n}\hat{\rho}_{12}(h) \overset{D}{\to} \text{N}\left(0, 1 \right). $$ This is why prewhitening is done, which may or may not be necessary. Apply whitening filter(s) to the data will not change whether or not the series are independent, but it will give you a better standard error for the sample correlation at different lags. Under this assumption, you can look at cross correlations (in R with acf or ccf ) and see if they're larger than $\pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{n}}$ (assuming $n$ is large).
