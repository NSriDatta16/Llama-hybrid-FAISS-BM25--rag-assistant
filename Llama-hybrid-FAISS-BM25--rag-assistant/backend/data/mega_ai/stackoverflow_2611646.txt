Merge items in nanoc

I have been trying to use nanoc for generating a static website. I need to organize a complex arrangement pages I want to keep my content DRY. How does the concept of includes or merges work within the nanoc system? I have read the docs but I can't seem to find what I want. For example: how can I take two partial content items and merge them together into a new content item. In staticmatic you can do some like the following inside your page. = partial('partials/shared/navigation') How would a similar convention work within nanoc?
