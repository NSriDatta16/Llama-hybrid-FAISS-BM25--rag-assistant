Is there a standard Windows error log api? There is the Windows Event Log, but I don't think you want a typical user having to go into it to extract your logged information. You probably don't want to log by default, unless you're shipping questionable pre-release code. When a user is experiencing problems, then you have them turn logging on. In this case, I recommend placing the file somewhere that typical users have experience with, like My Documents. By the way, if you're writing a standalone application and want the best possible information in the event of a crash, look into minidumps. Here is a Codeproject sample . My app needs to store settings information Yep, registry. My app needs to store and retrieve files Yes, App Data. Just be sure to use SHGetFolderPath and CSIDL_APPDATA. My app needs a very straight-forward database There's nothing wrong with CSV for simple data. You could store the data in XML and use MSXML to process it, if you prefer. I've used SQlite in the past when I needed fast, lightweight storage of more complicated data.
