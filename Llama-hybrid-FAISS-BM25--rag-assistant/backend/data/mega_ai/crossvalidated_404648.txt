The combined SEM of two averages with SEM

I am looking to calculate the difference in blood flow between the controls and intervention group (dipyridamole) and whether this is significant. The table 2 shows the average blood flow + SEM each from 20 measurements To calculate this I am taking the average of the inner (In) and outer (Out) blood flow in each group - so you get 0.19 for the control and 0.145 for the intervention. But how do I get the standard error for these averages to see if the difference is significant? It should be said that the authors reports a P=0,05 for the difference, but I cannot seem to arrive at this.
