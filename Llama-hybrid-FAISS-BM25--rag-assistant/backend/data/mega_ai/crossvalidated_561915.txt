You could/should include x as fixed effects and an interaction x:age in your model. Please be aware, that I removed the order from your variable age , so that now it is a simple unordered factor: age This will give you the the slopes of each age-group as coefficients: Linear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod'] Formula: y ~ 1 + x + age + x:age + (1 | age) Data: data REML criterion at convergence: 151.3 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.03703 -0.75784 -0.09648 0.64946 2.94535 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. age (Intercept) 6.1309 2.4761 Residual 0.2341 0.4838 Number of obs: 100, groups: age, 3 Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error t value (Intercept) 1.88845 2.47930 0.762 x 0.12595 0.09123 1.381 age1 -6.85007 3.52032 -1.946 age2 -18.37227 3.57822 -5.134 x:age1 -0.62312 0.12065 -5.165 x:age2 -1.05771 0.12099 -8.742 Correlation of Fixed Effects: (Intr) x age1 age2 x:age1 x -0.039 age1 -0.704 0.028 age2 -0.693 0.027 0.488 x:age1 0.030 -0.756 0.040 -0.021 x:age2 0.030 -0.754 -0.021 0.112 0.570 So essentially, the output (fixed effects) can be interpreted as follows: the intercept and slope for your first level of age is 1.8885 and 0.12595 , respectively. The corresponding response y can be depicted below as the black trajectory given as y = 1.8885 + x*0.12595 For the second level of age the intercept and slope is given as 1.8885 + (-6.850) and 0.12595 + (-0.62312) , respectively. The corresponding response y is shown as the red trajectory given as y = 1.8885 + (-6.850) + x*(0.12595-0.62312) For the third level of age the intercept and slope is given as 1.8885 + (-18.37227) and 0.12595 + (-1.05771) , respectively. The corresponding response y is shown as the green trajectory given as y = 1.8885 + (-18.37227) + x*(0.12595-1.05771) The plot: plot(y ~ x, data, col=age) lines(x=c(-20:20), y=1.888 + (-20:20)* 0.126) lines(x=c(-20:20), y=1.888 -6.85 + (-20:20)* (0.126-0.623), col=2) lines(x=c(-20:20), y=1.888 -18.37 + (-20:20)* (0.126-1.0577), col=3) As to your question Where is the slope and intercept of the black line (regression of average per age) : I would't know how to do this with age as random effects in the model. The easiest way I can think of to get the average intercept and slope across all levels combined would be simple linear regression lm(y ~ x, data)
