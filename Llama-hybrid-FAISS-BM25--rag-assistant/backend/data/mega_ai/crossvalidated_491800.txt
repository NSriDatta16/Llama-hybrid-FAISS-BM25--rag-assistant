How to compute the final misclassification rate in multi-class logistic regression?

Let's say we have the following samples: So there are three labels $y=\left\{1,2,3\right\}$ , three binary logistic regression 1-vs-rest classifiers have been learned with model parameters $\beta_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$ , $\beta_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -3 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$ , $\beta_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & -4 \end{pmatrix}$ . How do you calculate the final misclassification rate / final error? I think I can work with the normal loss function for logistic regression? I mean this one: $$L(\beta) = -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}cost(h_\beta(x^{(i)}), y)$$ where $h_\beta(x) = \sigma(\beta \cdot x)$ and $m$ means total amount of $(x_1,x_2)$ points thus $m=6$ . How ist $cost$ defined for this specific example with 3 classes? Like this is correct? $cost_\beta(x,y)=\left\{\begin{matrix} h_{\beta_1}(x), \text{if } y=1\\ h_{\beta_2}(x), \text{if } y=2\\ h_{\beta_3}(x), \text{if } y=3 \end{matrix}\right.$ Are the things correct so far? Still I don't know how to use all these things to get a number / the error in the end. I hope someone can help me because this will probably be asked in some test soon and I like to be able to solve a few things :c
