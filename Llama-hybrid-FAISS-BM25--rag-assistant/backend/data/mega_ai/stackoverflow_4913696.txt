I believe that you'll need to do a path animation. See: http://www.bdunagan.com/2009/04/26/core-animation-on-the-iphone/ for a simple tutorial on doing that. The basic animation just animates between one point and another with some velocity changes (ease-in, ease-out). Path animation can do curves, direction changes, etc.
