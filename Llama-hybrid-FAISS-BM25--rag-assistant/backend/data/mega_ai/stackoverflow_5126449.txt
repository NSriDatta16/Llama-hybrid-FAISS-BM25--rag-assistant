Recommendation of a JavaScript (GUI) framework to act as a frontend to a website's backend?

I'd like to tap your experience regarding the use/deployment of a JavaScript powered framework to implement a GUI frontend for different backend tasks. The framework would have to provide a managable way of displaying arbitrary data fetched from a database (data can be provided in every thinkable way JSON, XML etc.) and allow the manipulation of that data by means of a clean and RESTful API. Prebuilt widgets (tables/lists/dashboard) and UI (drag'n'drop/sorting) would be nice to have but aren't mandatory. The requirements are: Open Source (obligatory) clean and RESTful API to fetch, display and manipulate data Ability to extend the functionality thru plugins Standards-compliant (IE does not have to be supported) Thorough documentation and/or helpful community I've figured that jQuery's UI framework comes very close to the ideal, though it lacks a decent support of general structures to master a full-fledged application. I'm interested of what you guys would recommend. Thanks in advance.
