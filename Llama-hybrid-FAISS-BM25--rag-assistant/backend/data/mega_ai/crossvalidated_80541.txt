In principle, yes it is correct. However I think you should look at the distribution of the number of days in hospital. If there are lot of people who spend very few days in hospital and few people who spend a lot of days in the hospital, the average calculated may be misleading because you will get an artificially high number. If you graph the distribution and see that there are a few outliers, you might want to consider the trimmed mean (i.e. just exclude the outliers). Another option is the weighted average.
