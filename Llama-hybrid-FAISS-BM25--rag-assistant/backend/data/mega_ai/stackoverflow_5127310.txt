Your code has several issues. 1. Since you've selected onDomReady on the sidebar, the functions you defined aren't global. Use no wrap (head) instead. Note : you don't need to declare these functions globally if you use jQuery's .bind() method (see #5). 2. You don't need and in the CSS pane. 3. You're adding the class on the radio button, this has no effect. You should do something like this: HTML Label JavaScript $('label[for=foo]').addClass('active').removeClass('inactive'); Or in this case, do it on the elements. 4. This is just a styling issue, but you should use paragraphs ( text ) instead of simple text nodes ( text ) and line breaks after every line. 5. If you don't use inline event handlers and inline styles, instead you write your CSS and JS code in separate files, and reference to them like this: Since you're already using jQuery, avoiding inline event handlers is simple: you can use jQuery's .bind() function, it will work in all browsers. $('#el').bind('click', function() { // your event handler goes here }); Some event handlers (e.g. click , keyup , change ) have shorthands: $('#el').click(function() { // your event handler goes here }); 6. Should I use tables for layout? No. It's better to use forms in this case. 7. Instead of writing .addClass('active').removeClass('inactive') in two functions, you can use .toggleClass('active inactive') [docs] and then you have one function instead of two.
