Using a logistic regression to predict binary outcome

Any input on my following query would be great. Currently I have a a number of monthly datasets of individual(s) who have purchased properties (2012-2017). These individuals can be split into two categories. 1)First-time buyer 2)Non first_time buyer. Therefore, it is possible to create a monthly statistic on the percentage of home buyers who are first time buyers and who are not. However, what in the future if this indicator was to disappear from my dataset, say it was no longer available in 2019. Would it be possible to use the previous data collected from 2012-2017 to predict who are first-time and non first time buyers into the future? The dataset contains various information about these individuals and the property (age, gender, marital status, income, property location and property price). I'm think of using a logistic regression to carry this out, but would be interested to hear of any papers which have carried something like this out before as I need to know what are good predictors to include in my model. If anyone can think of any other issues please let me know.
