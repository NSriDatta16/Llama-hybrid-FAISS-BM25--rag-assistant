One thing to pay extra attention to is if you by library mean a DLL or similar. Then there might be problems if the library consumer, say an application, is built with another compiler than the library itself. Consider the case where you in your example return a std::vector<> by value. Memory will then be allocated in the context of the library, but deallocated in the context of the application. Two different compilers might allocate/deallocate differently and so havoc might occur.
