Are these approaches Bayesian, Frequentist or both?

currently I am comparing different combination methods: Equally Weight Averaging -> deterministic Ordinary Least Squares Averaging -> frequentist? Bayesian Information Criterion Averaging -> both, bayesian and frequentist? Bayesian Model Averaging -> bayesian For the two models in the middle I am not sure If my classification is correct?
