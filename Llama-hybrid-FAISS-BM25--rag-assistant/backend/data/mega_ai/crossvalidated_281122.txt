How does auto.arima deal with integrated time series in R?

From my experience, when a time series $T$ is integrated/has a unit-root, one cannot model it with an ARMA model can usually need to turn to the first difference of $T$ (or some research I read uses $ln(T)$). However, I just realized recently that in R's auto.arima function (under the "forecast" package), it is possible to run an ARIMA regression with covariates (by specifying the parameter xreg ) even if the time series is integrated (e.g. an ARIMA(2,1,2) process). My question is: Does this model still yield valid statistical results about the covariates' coefficients? If valid, how does auto.arima deal with the integrated process? I think it is probably not taking the first difference, but am not sure what is it.
