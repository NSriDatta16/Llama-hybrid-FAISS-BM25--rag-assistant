Transition Probability Matrix with zeros

A markov chain model TPM for daily rainfall is given by: [0.4 0.6 0.0; 0.2 0.6 0.2; 0.0 0.7 0.3]; Thus, it is not possible to pass directly from state 1 to state 3 or state 3 to state 1 without going to state 2. How would I compute the fraction of time the system is in each of the states?
