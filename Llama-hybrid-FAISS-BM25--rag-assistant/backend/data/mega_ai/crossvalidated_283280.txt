Feature extraction ideas for short phrases

I have a dataset of around 1 million short phrases (mostly 2-3 words) and they are labelled as either appropriate or inappropriate. E.g. phrases include "cute kittens", "pasta recipes", and "how to dye hair". Currently, I'm using 3 features: bag of words 2-gram character 3-gram character 4-gram bag of soundexes I don't have a word embedding that works well with this dataset. Are there more features I could add?
