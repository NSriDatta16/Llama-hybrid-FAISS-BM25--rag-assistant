c code for gtk+ vs glade generated .glade files

I am new in the field of gtk+ programming. I'm still exploring many options to use. I will be coding in C language. I have the following questions: Which is better? Writing code or using the .glade files generated by glade? Which is better to use? libglade or gtkbuilder? Why is using the build option in glade2 discouraged?
