heterogenous Neural Network output

My neural network (actually it is a CNN) must output the transformation matrix coefficient it should output tx and ty for translation that lay in the range of [0,200], 2 coefficients for shear [0.7, 1.5] and one angle [-30 60] degrees AND other 10 coefficients/weights to perform the linear combination of predefined vector sets to find first the pixel coordinates at that space and then apply the collected transformation matrix. Those final coordinates will then compared to labels and the model will be optimized based on that comparison criterion as you may notice the output has different ranges and nature(angles, unitless ones, and pixel) Is there any way to push the model outputting coefficients in the desired ranges?
