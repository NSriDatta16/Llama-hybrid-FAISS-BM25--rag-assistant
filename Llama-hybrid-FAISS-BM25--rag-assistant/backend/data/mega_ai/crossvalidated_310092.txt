This paper compares some methods in this area. They refer to the Robust PCA approach you linked to as "PCP" (principal components pursuit) and the family of methods you linked to for robust covariance estimation as M-estimators. They argue that PCP is designed for uniformly corrupted coordinates of data, instead of corrupted data points (i.e., outliers), therefore, the comparison with PCP is somewhat unfair for this kind of data and show that PCP (aka robust PCA) can fail for outlier detection in some cases. They also talk about three kinds of "enemies of subspace recovery," i.e. different kinds of outliers, and which kinds of methods might do well for dealing with each one. Comparing your own outliers with the three kinds of "enemies" discussed here might help you pick an approach.
