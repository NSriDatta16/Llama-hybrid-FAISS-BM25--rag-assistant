You're correct--you can read this data from the cookies. To configure the tracking: connect your adwords and GA accounts: in your AdWords account, go to My Account > Account Preferences, click the "edit" link next to Tracking then select the box that says "Destination URL Auto-tagging". Click "Save Changes"; still from your AdWords account, click the Analytics tab and choose Analytics Settings > Profile Settings > Edit Profile Information; check "Apply Cost Data", then click Save Changes So how can you tell if it's working? And where does GA store the data? Grab an initial __utm.gif request and look at the Referer. Appended to the URL is a new parameter " gclid ." This is the keyword-specific parameter (unique to your account). It's this parameter that distinguishes your visitors as AdWord-originating (i.e., "google(cpc)") from "google(organic)" Here's one i just grabbed and anonymized (scrambled the numbers/letters): Referer: http://www.adomainname.com/ ? gclid =CKr61p31yKACFZlg4wodjj3gbA You'll see this identical string in two other places in the same tracking pixel request: (i) as the value for the GIF Request Parameter " utmp " which is the page request for the current page, and, most importantly; (ii) as the value for the GIF Requests Parameter " utmcc "--the container for the cookies. The specific cookie that holds the adwords data is __utmz , which is actually the container for all referral data. Here's an anonymized example i just grabbed more or less at random (i.e., i just did search in Google using a query comprised of obvious Adwords and then clicked one of the paid links in my search results, then just pulled the Request Header): utmcc=__utma%3D755416178.1576730350.1269876846.1269143846.1269143846.1%3B%2B__utmz%3D219726107.1269143846.1.1.utmgclid%3CKr61p31yKACFZlg4wodjj3gbA%7Cutmccn%3D(not%2520set)%7Cutmcmd%3D(not%2520set)%7Cutmctr%3Dhomes%2520for%2520sale%3B HTTP/1.1
