How about runtime font embedding. You can start with device fonts while loading the japanese font in the background. When the japanese font has loaded you make a call that updates the font to the loaded font and does the embedding. Check out GAIA framework for easy runtime font embedding as it's built in. for the update part, I write an array that records the font and it's text format. Then when a font is loaded it references the array which loops and updates all the text fields that are registered to it. Seems to work out. Shoganai is a kop out...... ganbatte all the way!@
