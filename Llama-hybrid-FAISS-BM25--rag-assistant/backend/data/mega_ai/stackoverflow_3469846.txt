I can answer your last two questions. You should not use the cookie store if you're storing sensitive data in the session because you want such data to be on the server-side and not on the client. The cookie store is the default because Rails is giving you a strong hint that you should not be storing lots of data in the session, by virtue of the fact that cookie storage is limited to 4 KB.
