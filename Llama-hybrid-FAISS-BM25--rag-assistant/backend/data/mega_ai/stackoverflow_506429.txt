It seems to me that there is an additional step in there that, based on your description, appears unneccessary. Here is what I am referring to - When a report is requested, a stored procedure is invoked which gathers the data into a format required for a report, and forwarded to another stored procedure which transforms the data into a view, and forwards THAT off to a PHP framework for display. A sproc transforms the data for a report, then another sproc transforms this data into another format for front-end presentation - is the data ever used in the format in which it is in after the first sproc? If not, that stage seems unneccessary to me. I'm assuming that your reports database is a data warehouse and that data is ETL'ed and stored within in a format for the purposes of reporting. Where I currently work, this is common practice. As for your question regarding stored procedures, they allow you to centralize logic within the database and "encapsulate" security, the first of which would appear to be of benefit within your organisation, given the other sprocs that you have for data transformation. Stored procedures also have a stored execution plan which, under some circumstances, can provide some improvement to performance.
