Counting objects from Where-Object

I am currently trying to write a little powershell script (I have no experience in Powershell scripting so was wanting to use this as a test) that loops through our svn repositories counting how many commits have been made with a comment of "Reviewed by; No-one" as this indicates an unreviewed commit. I currently have the following $repositorys = @("Path1", "path2","path3","path4") $matches = 0 foreach ($path in $repositorys){ "Path: {0}" -f $path.tostring() ( [xml] (svn log --xml $path)).log.logentry | Where-Object {$_.msg -imatch "(Reviewed By: (no(.*)one))" } | measure-object | format-list } This gives me the output with the count depending on how many matches it has found Count Average Sum Maximum Minimum Property ----- ------- --- ------- ------- -------- 1 If I remove the measure-object then I get the details of the SVN commit (revision, author, message, date etc.) Essentially what I want to be able to report is the number of un-reviewed commits and there details (so essentially a merge between the two methods described above). So I have report that looks like Path1: Number of un-reviewed commits: xx Revision Author -------- ------- x x Can anyone enlighten me?? Is this possible?
