According to RFC1738 the ] character is unsafe: Other characters are unsafe because gateways and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify such characters. These characters are "{", "}", "|", "\", "^", "~", "[", "]", and "`". Thus, only alphanumerics, the special characters "$-_.+!*'(),", and reserved characters used for their reserved purposes may be used unencoded within a URL. You should encode either the individual character that you want to add, or run the whole string through a URL encoder. Try this: new URL("http://abc.com:123/abc%5D.mp3").getPort();
