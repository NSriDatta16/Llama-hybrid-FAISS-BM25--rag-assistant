If you're lookin for a "TerminateAsnyc" method, you won't find one. Therefore, no, there's probably no elegant way while using Control.BeginInvoke/EndInvoke. Thus, I'd put the boolean flag on the UI thread and have the delegate being executed asynchronously check that flag periodically while it's executing. However, you might check into using background worker threads.
