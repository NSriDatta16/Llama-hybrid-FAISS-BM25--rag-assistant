Does it matter which variable I assign 1 or -1 in a perceptron machine learning algorithm

I am using perceptron machine learning to solve the binary classification problem A vs B. For this I have to assign the actual values of A and B to either 1 or -1 to be able to use perceptron. Does it matter which value I assign, as it is not clear which value makes more sense to assign 1.
