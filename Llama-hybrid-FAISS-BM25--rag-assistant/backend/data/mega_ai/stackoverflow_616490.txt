Sharepoint custom web part property does not show up in the toolbox

I have defined a boolean property as follows: [Browsable(true), Category("Display"), DefaultValue(false), WebPartStorage(Storage.Shared), FriendlyName("Obey Workflow"), Description("")] public bool ObeyWorkflow { get; set; } I'm expecting it to render as a checkbox in the webpart's properties toolbox, however it doesn't show up. My web part is derived from the Sharepoint WebPart base class.
