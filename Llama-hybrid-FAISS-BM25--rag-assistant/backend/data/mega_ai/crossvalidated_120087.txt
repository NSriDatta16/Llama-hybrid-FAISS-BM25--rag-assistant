You should not model $\sigma$ with a Normal, that way you are allowing negative values for the standard variation. Use instead something like: sigmas = pm.Exponential('sigmas', 0.1, size=2) update: I got near the initial parameters of the data by changing these parts of your model: sigmas = pm.Exponential('sigmas', 0.1, size=2) alpha = pm.Beta('alpha', alpha=1, beta=1) and by invoking the mcmc with some thinning: mcmc.sample(200000, 3000, 10) results: The posteriors are not very nice thou... In section 11.6 of the BUGS Book they discuss this type of model and state that there are convergence problems with no obvious solution. Check also here .
