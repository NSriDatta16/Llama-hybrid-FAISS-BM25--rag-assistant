Your code has nothing to do with that. The blinking in the tray is a default Windows behavior. When you have a grouped set of IE windows it doesn't blink the group in the taskbar because it wouldn't be able to blink for just the single window that needs focus, it would have to blink the entire group. And if it blinked the entire group that wouldn't tell you which window wants attention, so Microsoft chose to just turn the blinking off.
