What platform are you developing for? PHP, Java, .NET, or other? You should look into SAML and OpenID in addition to OAuth. These protocols are used for website to website authentication, more often than OAuth, which is mainly used for client applications on the desktop/mobile. It can be used but this is what people tend to use it for. In general you are considered to be the service provider. The other organizations are identity providers. In SAML you would redirect a user to the identity provider who would authenticate (and possibly authorize) a user. They would be redirected back to the service provider which would then be able to log them in. See the links from another post of mine for links to protocol documentation. Google Apps also have a good diagram of single sign-on with SAML in action.
