How to find the inflection point in logistic regression using R?

I have conducted a binary logistic regression (with 7 predictor variables) in R using "year" as a random effect, i.e. a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). For a few of the predictor variables, I would now like to find the inflection point, i.e. the value of the predictor variable for which the probability of the response variable being "1" equals 0.5. I would like both to produce a curve of this and to calculate the exact value, so that I won't have to read it from the curve (with the inaccuracy this would cause). A post from November 2013 made by Francis and edited by Scortchi touches on this topic (with a different purpose, though) and shares a specific code for producing such a curve ( Logistic Regression and Inflection Point ). However, I don't understand the 4th line of the code ( newdata ) and can't make the code work for my data. Is the 4th line something that has to be done in order to produce the curve? Might someone help me by uploading a more general code, or gently translating the referred one, for me to understand exactly how to fit my own data into the code? Also, if someone knows how to make R calculate the exact value, I would very much like to know. As you might be able to tell, I'm still learning R. I hope that someone can help.
