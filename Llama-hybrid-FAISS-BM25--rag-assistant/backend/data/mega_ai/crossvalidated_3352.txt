Are these equivalent representations of the same hierarchical Bayesian model?

If $X$ is a categorical variable, and I am interested in the posterior distributions of $\beta_1$, where $\beta_1$ is a vector of coefficients, one for each level of X, are these equivalent models? Model 1: $$Y \sim ( \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1,\sigma^2)$$ $$\beta_1 \sim N(0,\tau)$$ Model 2: $$Y \sim(\beta_1X_1,\sigma^2)$$ $$\beta_1 \sim N(\beta_0,\tau)$$ In both models, $\beta_0$ has an informed prior, $\tau$ has a weak prior: $$\beta_0\sim \text{Gamma}(6,3)$$ $$\tau \sim \text{Gamma}(0.1,0.1)$$ If these are not equivalent, why not? I ask because although I thought these would be the same, but when implemented in JAGS, the MCMC chain for $\beta_0$ from the first model has much higher autocorrelation than the second. I (originally) put my R code here SO.test.tgz , but it is no longer available. I apologize ...
