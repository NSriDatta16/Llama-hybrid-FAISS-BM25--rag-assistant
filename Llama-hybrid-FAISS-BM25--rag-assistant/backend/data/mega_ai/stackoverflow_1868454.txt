Silverlight 3 Toolkit - ListBoxDragDropTarget

I have two listboxes that I am dragging one item from to the other. Using the November 2009 build of the Silverlight 3 Toolkit's ListBoxDragDropTarget. I have an EventHandler on the Drop event of the second listbox. I am trying to get the index of the item that is being inserted so I can see what comes before it in the item collection. Does anyone know how to get the index of the item to be added on a dropped item?
