Imagine that you found a black box on a street. It has attached post-it note saying "if red light blinks, it is going to rain in 2h" . It is a solid box, made of some hard material, with no visible screws, so there is no obvious way of opening it and looking inside. You really have no clue what it does, how does it work, or if it is going to work at all. As you grab it, it blinks the red light. Should you trust it? Would it rain? This is a pure subjective probability scenario. You know nothing about how does the box work, you can only make a bet and check what happens. The subjective prior that you'd choose is how much do you believe that it may work . If after two hours it rained, you could apply Bayes theorem to update your belief. Now you'd be inclined to trust it a little bit more, since you saw that at least once it "worked". You are a statistician and you know that correlation is not causation, so observing it once, doesn't convince you yet, but it shifts your opinion a little bit towards trusting it. That is what Bayes theorem does, when you update your prior. For more formal discussion, you can check an answer of mine on the subjectivist interpretations of probability . Finally, it is not an either-or scenario, when using Bayesian approach, you are not forbidden to use frequentist, or physical, interpretations of probability. The subjectivist interpretation is just the broadest one, since knowing the physical process behind something directly translates to your beliefs, so that you can make assumptions based on your knowledge.
