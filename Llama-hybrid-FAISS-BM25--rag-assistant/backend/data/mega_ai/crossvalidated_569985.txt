Why model expected value is computed using a model with input features?

This post is kind of related to these two posts here and here I learnt that model expected value (average prediction) is nothing but performance of the model when all input features are absent. But I see that this expected value is calculated from a model with input features (whose values are not zero). But it is interpreted as model's simplest performance when X is not present. I find this difficult to understand. Because, we compute mean(y_pred) from a model that we build using X input features (and their values are not zero).You can refer the code sample from this answer where the average is computed using mean(y_pred) . And this is how SHAP package does it as well. we are taking average from a model which has non-zero values for all predictors ? Can I know why is it done this way? I see that in SHAP average/expected values are calculated this way only, Can you help me understand why is it done this way?
