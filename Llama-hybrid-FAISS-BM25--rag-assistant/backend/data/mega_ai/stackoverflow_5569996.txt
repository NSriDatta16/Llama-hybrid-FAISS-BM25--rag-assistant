Problem trying to create Sequence Container

I am new to SSIS. I am using BIDS 2005. When I am not in the debugging mode, I select the Control Flow tab, go to the Toolbox and click on a Sequence Container. I then drag it out on to the design surface. As I drag, my cursor is showing a "plus" sign as though it is going to let me create a new instance of the Sequence Container. However, when I let go of the mouse button, the "plus" disappears and there is no Sequence Container. What is really odd is that I already have one Sequence Containter on the surface and all I want to do is create a second one. Am I doing something wrong? Why can't I get the new instance? Is there a limit to how many Sequencer Containers exist on the surface? -- Puzzled
