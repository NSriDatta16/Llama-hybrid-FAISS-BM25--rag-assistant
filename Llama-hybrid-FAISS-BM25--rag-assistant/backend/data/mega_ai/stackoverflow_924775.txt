A non-SQL method (really only a single step as the data step just creates a view) would be: data companies_v /view=companies_v; set companies (keep=country); _upcase_country = upcase(country); run; proc sort data=companies_v out=companies_distinct_countries (drop=_upcase_country) nodupkey noequals; by _upcase_country; run;
