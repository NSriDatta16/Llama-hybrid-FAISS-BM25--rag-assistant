URL::equals reference URL urlOne = new URL("http://stackoverflow.com"); URL urlTwo = new URL("http://stackoverflow.com/"); if( urlOne.equals(urlTwo) ) { // .... } Note from docs - Two URL objects are equal if they have the same protocol, reference equivalent hosts, have the same port number on the host, and the same file and fragment of the file. Two hosts are considered equivalent if both host names can be resolved into the same IP addresses; else if either host name can't be resolved, the host names must be equal without regard to case; or both host names equal to null. Since hosts comparison requires name resolution, this operation is a blocking operation. Note: The defined behavior for equals is known to be inconsistent with virtual hosting in HTTP. So, instead you should prefer URI::equals reference as @Joachim suggested.
