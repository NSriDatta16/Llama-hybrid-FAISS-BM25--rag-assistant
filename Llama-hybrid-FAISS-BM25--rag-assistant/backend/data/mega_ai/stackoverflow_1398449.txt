I suck too in desinging user interfaces. I keep on messing up things.. I'm trying to improve, anyway. My new approach is very simple: copy. There are plenty of good user interfaces around, and we don't need to reinvent the wheel. A good side effect is a continuity in our users experience. Take a program your users find famirial and try to mimic it. I think lot of applications can be done by tracing MS Outlook UI, for example. Or if you want to do something new, look what the bigs do: just for example, try Picasa (desktop) by Google. Or any program with the ribbon bar. If you have time, give a look at MS' Vista User Experience Interaction Guidelines (PDF available for download). There are lot of little solutions, like where to place "save-cancel" buttons and in which order.. it's a stupid thing but makes a great difference. A good resource if you have a task to be done and want a starting point about how to present it is Quince from Infragistic . It has lot of "do like this" tips and sample screenshots. Another good resource, as mentioned by Harald, is SmashingMagazine : you can subscribe their feed, and it is true that desktop design is every day closer to web counterpart. And finally, icons. SmashingMagazine often gives tips about icons, and you can find many collections on IconFactory . HTH!
