Interpreting Ordinal Logistic Regression in R

I am doing an ‘Ordinal Logistic Regression’ in R but I am struggling to interpret the output. When looking at regression with continuous values I can understand the values and what they represent but when it becomes ordinal (categorical) data I don’t see how these numbers translate. I will give an explanation of what I’ve done to help explain the issue: I have conducted a questionnaire study where I ask people to rate their response to a series of statements as either ‘Strongly Disagree’, ‘Disagree’, ‘Neutral’, ‘Agree’, or ‘Strongly Agree’. In this example ‘W1’ is one of the statements. I then want to have each statement in turn as the dependent variable and determine if any of the other factors about the respondents (age, gender, type of diagnosis etc.) significantly affects their response The columns of data are: Age: Ordinal, ’25-34’, ’35-44’, ’45-54’, ’55-64’, and ’65 and over’ Gender: Categorical, ‘Male’, ‘Female’, ‘Nonbinary’, and ‘Other’ Anxiety: Categorical, ‘Professional’, or ‘Self’ Anxiety_Years: Ordinal, ‘1-4’, ‘5-9’, and ‘10+’ W1: ‘Strongly Disagree’, ‘Disagree’, ‘Neutral’, ‘Agree’, or ‘Strongly Agree’. How do I interpret the coefficient values and/or the p-values to determine which factors are significant? For example, if this were using continuous data then you would say ‘for each increase of 1 for x, y increases by 14.542’. What I’m struggling with is how I translate that idea into the categorical/ordinal data I have.

Train and Test The result was: 0.6140351 I have interpreted this to mean that the model misclassified 61% of the data and therefore isn't a very good model. I believe I have read somewhere that a misclassification rate of 10% or lower is what you would like to see. #GET DATA data $Gender Gender, levels = c("Male", "Female", "Non-binary", "Prefer not to say", "Other")) data $Anxiety Anxiety, levels = c("Self", "Professional")) data $Age Age, levels = c("18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65 or above"),ordered=TRUE) data $Anxiety_Years Anxiety_Years, levels = c("1-4", "5-9", "10+"),ordered=TRUE) data $W1 W1, levels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Strongly Agree"),ordered=TRUE) ##PREPARE TRAINING AND TEST DATA set.seed(100) trainingRows $W1, predictedClass) # confusion matrix mean(as.character(testData$ W1) != as.character(predictedClass)) # misclassification error Goodness to fit test In addition to the code shown originally, I have also run: lipsitz.test(m) This does give me a result but also shows a warning. I have researched this warning but haven't been able to solve the issue. I am now sure how to interpret these values to understand more about the model? Lipsitz goodness of fit test for ordinal response models data: formula: W1 ~ Gender + Age + Anxiety + Anxiety_Years LR statistic = 13.996, df = 9, p-value = 0.1225 Warning message: In lipsitz.test(m) : g >= n/5c. Running this test when g >= n/5c is not recommended. Questions from Kat's explanation For the gender, there are the options for Male, Female, Non-binary, Other, Prefer not to say. Your explanation of interpreting the Male is clear, and I can see how you would apply that to the other options on the list. What I'm unsure of is how do you comment about 'Female' as this isn't on the list? When looking at the results, would you follow these steps: a. Look at the p-values b. Identify significant p-values (ones that are c. Calculate the 'odds less likely to agree' for the significant ones d. Comment on these values you calculate Is there a guide on the significance of 'odds less likely' and the confidence interval of when it is considered significant? In a statistics session I attended we were told about the guidance for interpreting p-values (see below) - is there something similar or 'odds less likely? p-value p-value p-value ≤ 0.05 some statistical evidence of an effect. p-value >≈ 0.05 weak or limited statistical evidence for an effect p-value > 0.1 no statistical evidence of an effect
