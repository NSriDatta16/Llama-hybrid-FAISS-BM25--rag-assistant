In the current version of WP7 you cannot save songs to the media library. You can save them to IsolatedStorage, but since your goal is to transfer them off the device, your only option is to upload them to a web service. From there you can then transfer the files to a PC etc. Thanks, Stefan Wick - Microsoft Silverlight
