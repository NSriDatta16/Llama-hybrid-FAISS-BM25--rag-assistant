Machine Learning Model Alert/Notification system - Python

Let's say, I have a Machine Learning model built and does predictions for the future. If I have some predicted values that exceed a threshold, can I set up some type of notification system? It can be in email or a text message. Is it possible to do it in python ? I have been searching online, could not find a valid answer. Any thoughts or resources would be appreciated.
