Were your images normalized?? If your images were normalized between 0 and 1 then I am sure sigmoid will give a smaller loss then what you are getting now Infact with normalized images you should get loss which will be less then your model 2 which is last layer: CNN Sigmoid squashes the values between 0 and 1 and your normalized image are already between 0 and 1 and hence, this will give you a smaller loss With images that are not normalized the model 2 will have a lesser loss and it makes sense because convolutions may result in any number and they do not have a upper or lower bound of producing numbers Say your ground truth pixel value is 250 and you want sigmoid to predict 250. Sigmoid predicts a number closer to 1 (that's the maximum it can output) and hence MSE will be (255-1)^2 = 64516 while with last layer CNN can actually produce a number closer to 255. Let's say it produced 250 so the MSE will be (250-255)^2 = 25. Normalized images also makes your learning faster and also provides good results in different lighting conditions
