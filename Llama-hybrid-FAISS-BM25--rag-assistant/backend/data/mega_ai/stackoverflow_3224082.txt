Elegantly Determining System Architecture Within Perl

I'm looking for a simple way to determine whether a system is 32- or 64-bit from within Perl 5. I have read the perlvar manual page backwards and forwards, and have not discovered a variable that contains the system's CPU architecture (the CPU architecture Perl was compiled for will come close enough). This is the closest I have come: chomp (my $arch = `uname -m`); I was wondering if there was a more elegant way of determining this; I hate relying on backtick expressions, as they are both a bottleneck, tend to be insecure, and often (this example especially) break cross-platform compatibility. There is no reason Perl shouldn't already have this information available.
