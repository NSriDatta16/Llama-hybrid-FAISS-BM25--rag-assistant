Test of association and Logistic regression

Hi I have 9 predictor variables and 1 binary dependent variable. After running chi-square test of association, 8 out of 9 are significantly associated to the dependent variable. My question is, should I run all the 8 predictor variables in binary logistic regression simultaneously or individually? Thank you! I am a starter statistician handling clients.
