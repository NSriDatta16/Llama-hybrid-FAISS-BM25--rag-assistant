While people often get worried about the the proliferation of tables inside a database they are under management. Management by the DBMS. This means that you can control the data control task like updating and it also takes you down the route of organising the data properly, i.e. normalisation. Large collections of CSV or XML files can get extremely unwieldy unless you are prepared to write management systems arounf them (that already come with the DBMS for, as it were, free). There can be good reason for not using DBMS's but i have not found many and certainly not in mainstream development.
