Javascript Architecture/Application Structure Best Practices?

Do these exist? I've been a slave to big strongly typed OO languages (Java & C#) for many years and am a devotee of Martin Fowler and his ilk. Javascript, due to it's loosely typed and functional nature seems to not lend itself to the idioms I am used to. What are the best practices for organizing a javascript rich client? I am interested in everything from where to keep your code, (one file or multiple files) to MVC patterns to gang of four patterns to layering. Not putting stuff in the Global namespace seems to be the only consensus. I am using JQuery as the "Extended API."
