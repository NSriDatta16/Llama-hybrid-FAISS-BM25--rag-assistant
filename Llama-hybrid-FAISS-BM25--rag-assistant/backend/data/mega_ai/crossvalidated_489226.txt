in neural networks, what happens if we interchange z[l]=w[l]a[l−1]+b[l] w and a terms

z[l]=w[l]a[l−1]+b[l] In this if I interchange w and a terms i.e. z[l]=a[l−1]w[l]+b[l] I know matrix multiplication constraints that is no. of columns in first matrix should be equal to number of rows in second matrix. If we ignore those constraints, that is these constraints are satisfied z[l]=a[l−1]w[l]+b[l] is valid, then how will this affect my neural network? Will this work? what change can I expect?
