Croston's method is definitely an appropriate choice for this case. Its basic idea is to estimate non-zero demand and inter-demand interval separately. But note that its output is actually "demand rate", not actual demand units (e.g. a forecast of 0.1 means a demand of 1 unit over 10 periods). The exact timing of the demand is actually not provided. tsintermittent package provides some alternatives for intermittent time series forecasting, including iMAPA and Teunter-Syntetos-Babai method. This package also lets you use some adjustments to deal with the bias of Croston's method, like Syntetos-Boylan approximation.
