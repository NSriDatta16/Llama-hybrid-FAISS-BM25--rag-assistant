One approach that would work for you is to use a recurrent neural network. The caveat is that those are easier to work with in Python than in R (There are R libraries for RNN, but personally I've had difficulties with them). I'm pretty sure State Space Models and Dynamic Linear Models can also solve your problem, and for those there is ample R documentation available, but I don't have any direct experience with those approaches.
