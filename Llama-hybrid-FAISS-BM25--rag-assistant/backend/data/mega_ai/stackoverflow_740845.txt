How do I remove characters from a textbox when the number of characters exceeds a certain limit?

I would like to implement a text box with a 140 character limit in Javascript such that when the 141st character is added that character is erased. I don't want to show any message or alert to user they have exceeded the limit. There is already a counter.re. Here is an example of what I want to do: http://titletweets.com/category/games/michigan-state-vs-north-carolina/ I am using jQuery, if it already has this functionality please let me know.
