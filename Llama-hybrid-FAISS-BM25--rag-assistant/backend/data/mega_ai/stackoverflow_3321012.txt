I would think you might want a per-question weight that was based on how all users responded. As an extreme case, if 1,000 people answered questions A & B, and the results were A (2Y, 998N) and B (500Y, 500N), the two 'Ys for A count much more than any given pair of Y's from B. And any similar pair from B is somewhat more similar than any pair of Ns from A. Check out Bayesian Probability
