the essential of the statistic is the lack of information: ex: to determine the output of flip coin, we have to know earth gravitation at the test point, coin curvature, wind speed, hand posture,... If it is determined, it will surely know the output of that experiment. But we can't determine it all. Or in the determining price of the house, we have to know the location, market, macroeconomic,.. not only the distance to the center and the size of the house. => Therefore, in ML, if we have the training set only include the distance to the center and the size of the house, the output is still stochastic, not determinable, -> also have the error, even with the oracle (in Deep Learning book: “y may be a deterministic function that involves other variables besides those included in x “)
