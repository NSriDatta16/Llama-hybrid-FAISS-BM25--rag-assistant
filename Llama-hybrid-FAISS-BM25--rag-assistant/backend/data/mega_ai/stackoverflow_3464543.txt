Data Retrieval - Performance with CLOB Columns in Oracle

I have a table in Oracle that is currently storing close a Million Records. This table is having 2 CLOB columns that store XML data. I also have a search screen built for this particular table where users can search on pretty much all the columns except for the CLOB columns. Now here is my questions - Assuming that I have right indexes in place on the frequently search columns, does the existence of the CLOB columns in a table effect the performance while search the table for records? Let us say If I move these 2 CLOB columns into a new table and define a relation to its parent table using the primary key, will it improve performance in terms of record search and retrieval. Let me know.
