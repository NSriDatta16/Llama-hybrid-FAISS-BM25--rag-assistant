How to remove double quotes surrounding the text while importing a CSV file?

I have data which resembles the following: "D.STEIN","DS","01","ALTRES","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","APCASH","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","APINH","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","APINV","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","APMISC","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","APPCHK","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","APWLNK","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","ARCOM","TTTTTTFFTT" "D.STEIN","DS","01","ARINV","TTTTTTFFTT" I've used a Flat File Source Editor to load the data. What is the easiest way to remove all of the double quotes?
