You can only call delegates with method call syntax, if they have a known signature. You need to cast your delegate to the delegate type you defined earlier. var del = (PropertyRetrievalClass.getProperty)Delegate.CreateDelegate(typeof(PropertyRetrievalClass.getProperty), obj, "get_Chart_" + i.ToString()); You also need to change the first argument to CreateDelegate , because it should be the delegate type. And capitalize the "C" in "get_Chart_". And then, you will need to cast the returned object to string : string output= (string) del("asldkl"); Or change the delegate type and the methods to have string as their return type.
