How to increase memory size for phpmyadmin

I am facing some problem when I am trying to import magento database on localhost. It just import 18 table but in actual it contain 383 approx table. It gives error given below Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 16777216 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 2089674 bytes) in /usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries/import.lib.php on line 253 How this problem will configure. Is there need to change php.ini ?
