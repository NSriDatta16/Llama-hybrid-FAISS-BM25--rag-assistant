Taking your questions one after the other: Assume that I have a classifier which can classify left hand / right hand well. I am curious whether it can decide whether there's a hand in the image? No . It cannot. A model which is trained on hand/no-hand can do that. Not this. At most, it shall predict one of the either (left/hand) with a very low confidence score. But, it definitely is not a nice idea to use it for a hand/no-hand identification. But there's so many things that are "no-hand" such like dogs, cats, flies... I don't think it is possible to collect all those possible "no-hand" data You are trying to do build a binary hand.no-hand classification model, not a hand/cat/dog/... style multi-label classification model. So, you just need to have a bunch of images with a hand in it, and some more which doesn't have one. Would it be reasonable that we use some activation functions like [sigmoid] as the final outputs for the classifier(neural network) and we consider the outputs for both left/right classes as the scores that classifier think how far the input is from the left/right hands classes. Possible, but not advisable.
