Average, Count, etc of entire column of table in SQL Query or as Function in VBA to Display result in Form?

I need to calculate Count, Average and a couple other things of a column as a result of a Query and then put the result in a text box in a form. I was thinking about either implementing it in the Query and putting the results in a column or something like that, OR use a VBA function to calculate it; however I don't know how to calculate this for an entire column in VBA. Any suggestions/examples?
