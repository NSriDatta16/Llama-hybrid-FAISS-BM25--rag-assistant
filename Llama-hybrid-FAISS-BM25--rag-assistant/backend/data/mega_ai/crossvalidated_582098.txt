Accounting every minute data

I get real time data by the minute, and sometimes they miss the minute data. A day has 1440 minutes, and I need to figure out a way to have data for all the 1440 minutes. If there is timestamp missing I need to fill it in with the average of the daily data. Can you help me figure this out using R, (tidyverse preferred). The current time stamps are as follows: 07-06-2022 15:20:10 (they have seconds) To be precise I have data that looks like the following: time quantity 07-06-2022 15:43:01 1 07-06-2022 15:44:17 2 07-06-2022 15:45:10 6 07-06-2022 15:45:54 7 07-06-2022 15:48:29 10 in the above data set one can see that there are two entries for 07-06-2022 15:45. and there missing minutes of data (15:46 and 15:47). I need to write a code that accounts for the missing time stamps and their respective data set. The missing timestamps data (quantity) can have average of the data set per day. Basically I should account for all the 1440 minutes in a day and get a total table per day.
