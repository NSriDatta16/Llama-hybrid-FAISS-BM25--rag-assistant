If you know the frequency of the oscillation, you can include two additional predictors, sin(2π w t) and cos(2π w t) -- set w to get the desired wavelength -- and this will model the oscillation. You need both terms to fit the amplitude and the phase angle. If there is more than one frequency, you will need a sine and cosine term for each frequency. If you don't know what the frequencies are, the standard way to isolate multiple frequencies is to detrend the data (get the residuals from the linear fit, as you have done) and run a discrete Fourier transform against the residuals. A quick and dirty way to do this is in MS-Excel, which has a Fourier Analysis tool in the Data Analysis Add-In. Run the analysis against the residuals, take the absolute value of the transforms, and bar graph the result. The peaks will be your major frequency components that you want to model. When you add these cyclic predictors, pay close attention to their p-values in your regression, and don't overfit. Use only those frequencies that are statistically significant. Unfortunately, this may make fitting the low frequencies a little difficult.
