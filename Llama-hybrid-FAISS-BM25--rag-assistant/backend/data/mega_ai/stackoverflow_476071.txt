I agree with krosenvold, and want to generalize his advice a bit: Do not use Property getters and setters for expensive operations, like reading a file or accessing the network. Use explicit function calls for the expensive operations. Generally, users of the class will not expect that a simple property retrieval or assignment may take a lot of time. This is also recommended in Microsoft's Framework Design Guidelines. ; Do use a method, rather than a property, in the following situations . The operation is orders of magnitude slower than a field set would be. If you are even considering providing an asynchronous version of an operation to avoid blocking the thread, it is very likely that the operation is too expensive to be a property. In particular, operations that access the network or the file system (other than once for initialization) should most likely be methods, not properties.
