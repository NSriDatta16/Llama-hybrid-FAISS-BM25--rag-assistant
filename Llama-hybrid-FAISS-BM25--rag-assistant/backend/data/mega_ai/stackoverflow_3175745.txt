What if you simply created a different project entirely and then dragged in the relevant classes you wanted to reuse, but instead of copying them, merely used references to them? Just don't select 'copy items into destination's folder' option when you drag the class files into your groups & files pane. That way your CL project always uses the latest version from the main iPhone one. Having it all in one project would no doubt be cleaner though.
