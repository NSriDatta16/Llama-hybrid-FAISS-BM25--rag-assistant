NLP: how to organize this research into Tensorflow

I need a network with the following organization: the input text, it is constant for training, for example "mama soap frame sponge" or the formulas of physics, math, chemistry and others a series of questions (who, where, when, what, whom, what, for what), for example "who washed the frame?" A series of answers (labels), for example, the answer "Mom". How to do it with TensorFlow? Thank you
