Impulse-response analysis is quite simple. Having estimated a vector autoregressive (VAR) model and expressed it in a vector moving-average (VMA) representation, you are able to see how a shock to variable B affects variable A in subsequent periods. You just plug in the shock in the VMA representation. For example, if the VMA equation for variable A is $$ A_t = \mu_A + \theta_{1AA} \varepsilon_{A,t-1} + \theta_{1AB} \varepsilon_{B,t-1} + ... + \theta_{2AA} \varepsilon_{A,t-2} + \theta_{2AB} \varepsilon_{B,t-2} + ... + \varepsilon_{A,t}, $$ the shock to B from one period before, $\varepsilon_{B,t-1}$, will have an effect of $\theta_{1AB}$ and the shock to B of two periods before, $\varepsilon_{B,t-2}$ will have an effects of $\theta_{2AB}$, etc. In a particular time period, how do you know it was a shock to variable B that is affecting A? You have the estimated shocks $\hat\varepsilon$ from the VAR model, so you can calculate the effects you are interested in, at any time period, for any variable.
