Sign change of a coefficient in logistic regression?

I am running a logistic regression with 5 continuous independent variables (IV). The problem is that IV4 when taken alone has a positive correlation with outcome (coeff > 0), and when taken with the other variables has a negative correlation (coeff I ran other logistic regressions eliminating one at a time all the other variables to look if one of them was responsible for the sign change, and I noticed that when eliminating IV1, the sign of V4 coefficient became positive. Thus, it seems that IV1 changes the sign of the coefficient of IV4. Is there someone who knows what might be the cause and (possibly) the solution? Practically, do I have to eliminate the IV4 (or IV1) from the model and explain why? Thanks a lot for answering Leonardo Frazzoni, MD
