What is the response variable in your regression? And for what purpose are you finding correlations between these things? My apologies, I'm not entirely sure if I understand your situation. I'm going to assume here (please correct me if this is incorrect) that you are attempting to find the relationship behind different things (like building material, size, country of origin, etc.) and the price of the object. I'm also going to assume you're fairly new to R. If this is incorrect, please excuse the unnecessary explanation. So let's take for example a microservo, and we want to know if the price is different for three different building materials -- steel, iron, and titanium. Do those make a difference, and are those material differences dependant on (say) the size of the microservo. I would create a categorical variable from my materials (steel = 0, iron = 1, titanium = 2, for arbitrary reasons) and let's assume two levels of size small (0) and large (1). Now, we use a regression model to see if these things predict the price. We will also include an interaction term to see if they modify each other's influence on each other. We first read in your excel (presumably) sheet, taking tab (\t) as the seperator value, and including the column headers in the file (header = true). We then do a linear regression (try ?lm and ?glm in your R console), and then read the output. yourdatatable This will give you the three levels of predictors predicting your price. Firstly it will show how size affects price and the associated P value, and how material affects price at the associated P value. The coefficient will be the increase in price per 1 unit increase in your predictor variable. For example, as size goes from small to large (0 to 1), you may have a coefficient of 5. This would indicate that your price increases by an average of $5 when your size goes from small to large. An interpretation of this nature for the materials scale would need a ranked list of materials, which I did not provide. The interaction line (size*material) will tell you if the size of the microservo affects the increase in price caused by materials. For example, if it doesn't matter that your microservo is tiny or huge if it is made out of copper because your materials are reasonably inexpensive, then the P value associated with this will be insignificant. If, however, the increase in size really matters because you're making your microservo out of titanium, then this interaction term will be significant, because the size of the microservo is directly affecting the increase in price associated with material. Take a look on google for some articles explaining the interaction term. Let's do a quick example using an example data set called mtcars. You can copy paste this into R. ex This gives the output Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 49.80842 3.60516 13.816 5.01e-14 *** hp -0.12010 0.02470 -4.863 4.04e-05 *** wt -8.21662 1.26971 -6.471 5.20e-07 *** hp:wt 0.02785 0.00742 3.753 0.000811 *** The response variable here was miles/gallon of gas, and our two predictors were horsepower and weight. So we can see that, yes, both of these have an effect on the miles/gallon of the car. We can also see our interaction term (hp:wt) is significant, which means that if a car is much heavier it will affect the contribution of horsepower to the miles/gallon. I hope this helped. If I really misunderstood, I apologize, please correct me.
