Predicting time of event from multiple timeseries

I apologize for the newbie question, but I'm hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. I want to predict the time at which an event (x) occurs given several timeseries which I suspect are correlated with the timing of X. My model would take in the full timeseries as input, and output a single value for the time at which event X is predicted to have occurred. Note that I'm not trying to predict the timing of a future event, but the timing of a past event. When using the model, I will have access to the entire timeseries. Here's a quick sketch of what the data looks like: My dataset consists of many examples like the above, that is, several timeseries within a set window along with the time of the event. Can something like an LSTM model be trained for this task? After doing a bit of digging it looks like LSTM and RNN models are good for predicting the next point in a timeseries, not so much outputting the time of an event like I've described. I am able to fairly consistently fit curves to some of the timeseries, so I tried training some tree-based ML algorithms on the coefficients of these fitted curves with little success. I'm hoping to try a more sophisticated timeseries-based approach next. I would appreciate being pointed in the right direction here - ie. what type of model or approach should I be looking into.
