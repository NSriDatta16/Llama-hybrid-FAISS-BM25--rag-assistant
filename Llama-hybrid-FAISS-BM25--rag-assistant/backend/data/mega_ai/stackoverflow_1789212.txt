Running multiple TeamCity Agents on the same computer?

We have several build machines, each running a single TeamCity build agent. Each machine is very strong, and we'd like to run several build agents on the same machine. Is this possible, without using virtualization ? Are there quality alternatives to TeamCity that support this?
