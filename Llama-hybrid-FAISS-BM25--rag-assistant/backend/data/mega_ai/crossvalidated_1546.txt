Any study should start out with some conception of a goal. Are you interested in measuring the impact of your SEO? Or are you trying to model the visitor behavior? It isn't clear to me that you're making use of the "time series" aspect of this data. Are you also interested in the time of day or day of week of visits, for instance? Or visits around specific events? You could just as easily divide your # of visits/day into two groups -- with/without SEO -- and eliminate time. This would then be a categorical variable in your data. A basic next step could be to run a logistic regression to see the impact of SEO on your site traffic. In R, this could look something like this (where "seo" is a factor ): site.traffic.lg If you want to use the fact that this is across a number of different kinds of sites, you could include this by adding it into the formula as another variable.
