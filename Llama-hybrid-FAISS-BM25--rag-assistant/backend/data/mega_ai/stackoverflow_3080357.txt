Drag and drop an image in WPF

I'm trying to drag and drop an image from one spot on the canvas to another (should be relatively simple), but can't figure it out. The image which I want to move has the following XAML: The code is as follows: bool isDragging = false; Point initMousePos; private void cityImage_MouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { isDragging = true; initMousePos = e.GetPosition(theGrid); } private void cityImage_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (isDragging) { Image image = sender as Image; Canvas.SetTop(image, initMousePos.X); Canvas.SetLeft(image, initMousePos.Y); image.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Visible; } } private void cityImage_MouseLeftButtonUp(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { isDragging = false; }
