You may find this topic dealt with in Brillinger, D.R. Time Series Analysis and Theory , in Chapter 4, particularly Theorem 4.4.2. I think in your case the answer is that the Fourier coefficients will have asymptotically a complex normal distribution, as pointed in the response by @micork. This will be the case rather generally, the crucial assumption being that the dependence in the original time series is mild enough (for precise conditions, see op. cit. Assumption 2.6.1).
