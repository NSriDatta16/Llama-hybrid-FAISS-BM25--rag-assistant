Determining if change in a time series is statistically significant

I have the total number of calls received each week and have plotted them on a chart, going back nearly 3 years. By eye it seems that there was a massive drop over Christmas, that doesn't seem to have recovered, it seems that there has been a step change in requests. Is there a test I can do that can quantify this difference? Cheers Ben
