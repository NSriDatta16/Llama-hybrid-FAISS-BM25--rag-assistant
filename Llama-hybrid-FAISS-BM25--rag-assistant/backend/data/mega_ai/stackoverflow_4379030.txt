As you've coded, the file will be placed in public web root. That's where getRealPath("/") will point to. To be precise, it's the folder named Web Pages as in your screenshot. As an exercise, do the following to figure the absolute path, so that you can find it by OS disk explorer. System.out.println(file.getAbsolutePath()); I don't do Netbeans, but likely you need to refresh the folder in your IDE after the write of the file so that it appears in the listing in the IDE. Click the folder and press F5. This is at least true for Eclipse. That said, this approach is not recommended. This won't work when the servletcontainer isn't configured to expand the WAR on disk. Even when it did, you will lose all new files and changes in existing files when the WAR is been redeployed. It should not be used as a permanent storage. Rather store it on a fixed path outside the webapp or in a database (which is preferred since you seem want to reinvent a CMS).
