This is really a cultural problem of unbalanced thinking, where publication bias leads to the favouring of positive results and our competitive nature requires editors and researchers to be seen to be producing results of interest that are novel or contentious, for example, in the sense of rebutting someone else's results. In medical research there is considerable progress being made to redress this problem by the compulsory registration of trials and publication of results with records of abandoned trials to also be made public. I understand that since publication in journals for unsuccessful research may not be practicable, there are plans to keep a publicly available database of them. Unusual results that can not be replicated are not necessarily a result of misdemeanour, as with perhaps 50,000 (a guess) researchers worldwide doing several experiments a year, some pretty unusual results are to be expected from time to time. Using different methods is not necessarily a solution either. For example, what chemist would mix reagents in different ways in different conditions and expect the same results as a matter of course?
