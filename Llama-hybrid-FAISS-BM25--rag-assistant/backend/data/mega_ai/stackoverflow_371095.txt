For the SSL support - take a look at openssl.org Cancel support is nice; to do it you have to check on regular basis from the worker thread if cancel was requested. Pay attention to use volatile variable or protected the access to it with a Critical section. Do not do the network operation from the GUI thread, even if it asynchronous. It is a nice policy not to do any kind of IO from the GUI thread to ensure it is responsive and more important, that it won't hang.
