The issue of multiplicity in the context of confidence intervals is regrettably less popular that multiplicity in hypothesis testing while the same problems exist. In particular, if you want to control the probability of all your parameters being covered ("simultaneous" coverage) , you cannot use the standard "nominal" confidence intervals. Just like in hypothesis testing, you need to decide what is the measure of error you wish to control. If it is the probability of simultaneous coverage of all parameters (FWE equivalent) or the "non coverage rate" (FDR equivalent). For simultaneous coverage, you could inflate the confidence level a-la Bonferronni. As usual, these might be needlessly conservative. To the best of my knowledge, not all multiple comparison procedures can be inverted to give confidence regions. Moreover, I am unfamiliar with any introductory text to the matter except Hochberg's and Tamahane's . For non-coverage rate control things are easier as the nominal confidence intervals trivially guarantee an expected non coverage of $1-\alpha$ within and between samples.
