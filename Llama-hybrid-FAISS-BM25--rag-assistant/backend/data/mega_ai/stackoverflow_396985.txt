Your question is incomplete. A database is for (1) querying and (2) updating. You've mentioned neither the queries or updates to your data. Storing data is not a particularly good use for a database. If you want to store data, you generally use simple files. Databases are regularly backed up to simple files for long-term storage, backup and restore. If there are no queries and no updates, than a simple file is fine. If, however, there are queries or updates, then a database might make sense. The specific structure would depend, of course, on nature of the queries or updateds.
