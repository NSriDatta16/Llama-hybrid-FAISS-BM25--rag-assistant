Perhaps worth a mention. The European Space Agency's Planck mission is running on the Versant Object Database. http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=46951 It is a satelite with 74 onboard sensors launched last year which is mapping the infrarred spectrum of the universe and storing the information in a map segment model. It has been getting a ton of hype these days because of it's producing some of the coolest images ever seen of the universe. Anyway, it has generated 25T of information stored in Versant and replicated across 3 continents. When the mission is complete next year, it will be a total of 50T Probably also worth noting, object databases tend to be a lot smaller to hold the same information. It is because they are truly normalized, no data duplication for joins, no empty wasted column space and few indexes rather than 100's of them. You can find public information about testing ESA did to consider storage in multi-column relational database format -vs- using a proper object model and storing in the Versant object database. THey found they could save 75% disk space by using Versant. Here is the implementation: http://www.planck.fr/Piodoc/PIOlib_Overview_V1.0.pdf Here they talk about 3T -vs- 12T found in the testing http://newscenter.lbl.gov/feature-stories/2008/12/10/cosmic-data/ Also ... there are benchmarks which show Versant orders of magnitude faster on the analysis side of the mission.
