Resources for machine learning for time-dependent data

For the past year, I have spent the majority of my free time learning a variety of ML techniques (boosting, random forests, neural nets, SVMs etc.), but I have not been able to find a lot of material (books, papers etc.) that explain ML techniques in the presence of time-dependent data. Are there any textbooks or other resources on this?
