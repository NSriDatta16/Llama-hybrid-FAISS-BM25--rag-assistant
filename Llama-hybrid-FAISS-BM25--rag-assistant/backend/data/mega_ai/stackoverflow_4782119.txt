I can only answer for db4o. I don't have enough experience with the other databases you've named. Ease of use: I think that db4o is very easy to use in many scenarios. You add the db4o jar to your project, open the database and start storing and querying objects . Efficient memory usage: Yes, db4o can do that. It supports transparent activation . In that mode db4o loads only objects which you are actually using. Automatically change objects when manipulated: Is also supported . Native querying: Yes db4o supports that. Native queries are great and powerful. However in practice complex native queries often cannot be optimized and run slow. In such cases you have to fall back to less elegant SODA queries. It's free under a GPL licence. Another advantage of db4o that has a community which can help and share knowledge. Do you have a particular use case scenario for the database? I think that you should pick the database which fits you're application the best.
