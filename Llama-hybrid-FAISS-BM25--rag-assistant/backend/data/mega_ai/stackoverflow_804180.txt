Can I append an Ajax requestXML object to my document tree all in one go?

Greetings. Here is an XML object returned by my server in the responseXML object: howdy! hello world another line Now I attach this fragment to my document tree like so: getElementById('entryPoint').appendChild(responseXML.firstChild.firstChild); But instead of being rendered as a table, I get the following text : howdy! helloworldanotherline The same result occurs of I replace firstChild.firstChild with just firstChild. It seems like I'm just getting the nodeValues, and all of the tags are stripped out?! Am I fundamentally misunderstanding what the responseXML object is supposed to represent? This works, BTW, if I take out the 'root' tags, and set innerHTML to responseText. Can someone please enlighten me on the correct way to use responseXML?
