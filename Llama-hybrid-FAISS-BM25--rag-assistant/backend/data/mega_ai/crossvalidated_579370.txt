How to calculate Bayesian marginal credible interval?

I have a Bayesian model that I've fit using Stan, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to calculate the correct credible interval that I am interested in. The model is a hierarchical GLM with a random intercept for each of $n$ subjects, so I have $k$ samples from the posterior distribution of the linear predictor. So, I can get the mean and credible interval of the posterior distribution for each individual fairly easily. To construct a credible interval for each individual, that is easy. I just get either the HDPI or use the quantiles and get $n$ different means with credible intervals. But if I want to get the marginal mean and credible interval for the entire population, I'm not sure what to do. I think I can use the "pooled" data to calculate a CI (e.g., calculate the mean and quantiles of all the samples for each individual put together), but I am not sure if this is the correct approach. I'm mostly using the book "Statistical Rethinking" to develop my model, but the book does not include any guidance on how to get this CI. Can anyone provide any guidance on how to construct the correct CI in this case?
