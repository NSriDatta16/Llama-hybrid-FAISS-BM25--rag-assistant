First, there is no way to identify confounders from a multivariable logistic regression. Confounding is a causal concept that requires an understanding of the causal system. The presence or lack of an association in a regression does not inclicate the presence or absence of confounding by the corresponding variable. It should not be used as a criterion to decide whether to adjust for that variable in a future model. Second, understand that the coefficients for the race categories correspond to the estimated difference in the log odds of the outcome between each category and the reference category (in this case, Mexican American). It may be that these differences are fairly small, but it is possible that differences among the non-reference categories are large. Indeed, we see that the difference between Other Race and Non-Hispanic Asian is quite large: $.5111 - (-.5629) = 1.074$ . This difference is twice as large as any of the differences between the reference category and the other race categories. The p-value on Race in the ANOVA reflects that there is a substantial effect of race; it just happens not to be between the reference category and the other race categories.
