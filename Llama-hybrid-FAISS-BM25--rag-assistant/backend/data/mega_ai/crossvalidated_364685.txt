Is MCA equivalent to PCA when all variables are binary?

I am looking to apply principal component analysis on binary (true/false) data, and I have come across the "equivalence between PCA and MCA" (Multiple Correspondense Analysis) for binary data, but haven't been able to find a reference to cite or check the proof. For example the comment by IHateDerekBeaton in the thread below suggests they are the same for binary data: https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/3hq2oq/pca_or_equaivalent_on_sparse_binary_matrix/ Similarly, the comment by ttnphns in the question below suggest they are equivalent Would PCA work for boolean (binary) data types? . So is there any proof for this or any reference that can be cited?
