What are the actual ms time values for Android's animTime constants?

Android includes config_longAnimTime config_mediumAnimTime config_shortAnimTime but the actual values identified by these constants don't make sense as milliseconds. I'm sure they get compiled into useful values, and I can determine them with code, but I'm sure someone else knows the answer - and, more to the point, I'm sure other people will be looking for them. So please post the actual values as an answer and save everyone a little bit of time.
