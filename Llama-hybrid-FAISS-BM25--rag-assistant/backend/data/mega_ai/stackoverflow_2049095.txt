You're looking for a combination of: Transfers an already open file from a server to a client RFile::TransferToClient(const RMessage2 &,TInt)const Transfers an already open file to another process RFile::TransferToProcess(RProcess &,TInt,TInt)const Transfers an already open file to a server RFile::TransferToServer(TIpcArgs &,TInt,TInt)const in the first thread/server/process and Allows a server to adopt an already open file from a client RFile::AdoptFromClient(const RMessage2 &,TInt,TInt) Allows a server to adopt an already open file from a client process RFile::AdoptFromCreator(TInt,TInt) Allows a client to adopt an already open file from a server RFile::AdoptFromServer(TInt,TInt) .. in the second. This effectively duplicates the file handle allowing both to use it. If transferring between threads in the same process then you can more simply use RFile::Duplicate(const RFile &,TOwnerType)
