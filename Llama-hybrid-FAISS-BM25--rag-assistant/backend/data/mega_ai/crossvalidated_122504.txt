Logisitic regression cutoff point + evaluate misclassified instances

I have created a logistic regression model in the explorer in Weka which can classify between three classes. When there are two classes it takes a 50% cutoff values, but I was wondering how it works with three classes. Each model is seperate and the highest probability is chosen? Additionally I am wondering: I would like to see which of the instances are misclassified. Is there an easy way to do this from the interface? Or do I need to use the java library?
