An Elementary Question on Sampling

(Apologies if the question is too basic or vague. I have taken only one course in the subject long ago. This question stems from a silly argument I was having with a friend) Two friends want to find out the temperature below which a given population of people would consider the weather to be 'cold'. If they are given a table such as: $$\begin{matrix} X & | & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 0 & \ldots \\ T (^\circ C) & | & 20 & -10 & 7 & -15 & & 25 & \ldots \end{matrix}$$ Where $X$ stands for the binary response of Cold (1) and Not Cold (0) one could perform a Logistic Regression to find the threshold temperature. How would one go about filling such a table? Does one randomly select a number of people and ask their opinion on randomly selected temperatures? Or The above is completely wrong headed and instead the following sort of procedure is more true to real research: We randomly select a number of people and quiz them on a complete range of temperatures to create a following sort of frequency table: $$\begin{matrix} \text{Temp Range} & | & -10 \sim -5 & -5 \sim 0 & 0 \sim 5 & 5 \sim 10 & 10 \sim 15 & \ldots \\ \text{Answered 'Not Cold'} & | & 2 & 4 & 7 & 10 & 60 & \ldots \end{matrix}$$ This table gives a distribution $F$. We fix on a fraction we'll consider a minority, say $\theta = 0.1$ and consider a value $m_F ^\circ C$ such that $P(F \lt m_F) = \theta$ i.e. $1-\theta$ (in this case $0.9$) of the population finds temperature at and above this value to be 'Not Cold' and decide that for temperatures less than $m_F$ 'the population' will find the temperature cold i.e. $m_F$ will be the answer we are looking for.
