Use bitwise operations. For a word of length N you need an integer type represented by N bits. If the word is longer - split it. Iterate through values from 0 to 2 N -1 and examine each bit from 0 to N-1. If the bit is 1 - upcase ( Char.ToUpper() ) the letter corresponding to that bit. This approach is better that a recursive algorithm since it is not prone to stack overflows on long words.
