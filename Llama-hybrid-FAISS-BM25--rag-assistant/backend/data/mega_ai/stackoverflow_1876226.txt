I would ask how the data is going to be used. The interviewer will either reveal what he initially withheld to see if you'd ask, or make something up. Then I'd ask what kind of updates and how it will be updated. It would be less likely for him to have thought this far ahead, so bonus interview points. Otherwise make up an in-memory storage structure just complicated enough to account for all the facts, or maybe put it in a relational database.
