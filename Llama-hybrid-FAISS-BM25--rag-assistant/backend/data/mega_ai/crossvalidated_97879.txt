How about this approach: Use aov with Error(simulation/(Strategy * Task)) . This is easier if you tidy your data first. Organize your data to look like this: Strategy Task Simulation Performance A 1 1 105 A 1 2 102 ... ... ... ... C 3 7 92 Then, aov(Performance ~ Strategy * Task + Error(Simulation/(Strategy * Task)), data) . I'll leave the Tukey test for someone else. You could also do a bunch of repeated measures t-tests.
