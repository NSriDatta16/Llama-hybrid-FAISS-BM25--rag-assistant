If you are looking for computer aid , where the software provides suggestions for solutions or part of solutions, I think to provide automated thesaurus lookup for the content words in each sentence would be a good start. Just use a stop-word list to filter out uninteresting words. Translation Memory is a related concept, where NLP is used to aid in translation, I'm sure you can get ideas for the user-interface etc. from this. There are several open source solutions available. If you want a totally unsupervised process, I think parsing into some semantic representation and changing some content words based on WordNet for example, and then generate from this is perhaps the theoretically cleanest approach. If only grammatical restructuring is okay then drop the changing. The quality, however, will most probably be low. If you only need this for a narrow field, it is possible to do a lot of tailoring, and making quite good results possible.
