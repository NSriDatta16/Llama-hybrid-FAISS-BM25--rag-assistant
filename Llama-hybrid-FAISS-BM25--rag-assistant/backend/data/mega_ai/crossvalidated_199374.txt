Do you by any chance "predict" raw residuals rather than standardized residuals? (Then you would get exactly the same result of the ARCH-LM test when "pre-testing" and when "post-testing" in the case of no conditional mean model $r_t=\epsilon_t$.) The raw residuals will contain ARCH effects and that is why you want to apply a GARCH model and obtain standardized residuals that do not contain ARCH effects. On the other hand, if you find ARCH effects in the standardized residuals, the GARCH model you are using may be inappropriate. Try different variants of the GARCH model (EGARCH, APARCH and whatever else) and different lag orders. Also note that the original ARCH-LM test is inappropriate for testing for remaining ARCH effects in the standardized residuals of a GARCH model; Li-Mak test should be used instead. (I do not know whether the Li-Mak test is available in Stata. Also, use of the original ARCH-LM test seems to be relatively widespread in the applied literature, even though it is inappropriate.)
