Vim Dvorak keybindings (rebindings :)

Although I played with it before, I'm finally starting to use Dvorak (Simplified) regularly. I've been in a steady relationship with Vim for several years now, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to remap the key bindings to suit my newfound Dvorak skills. How do you remap Vim's key bindings to best work with Dvorak? Explanations encouraged!
