Bayesian Classifier to predict a class probability?

I have a 2 input (independent) variables: 1) number of likes (numeric value between 0 and 99) 2) number of dislikes (numeric value between 0 and 99) and I would like to predict a class ('class'), from which we have a finite pre-defined set (e.g. A1-A5) but also its probability or likelyhood ('prob'). Here an example of the output that I would like get, "output" is the dependent variable: like dislike class prob ------------------------------------ 5 2 A1 0.3 10 10 A3 0.5 99 1 A2 1.0 What is the best method given that I do not have much training data (e.g. 1000 cases) ?
