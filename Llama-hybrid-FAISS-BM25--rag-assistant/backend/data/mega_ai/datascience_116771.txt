How to find correlation between features and labels when features are unordered words?

I have a data set with ~ 85 labels and a target (house price) I wish to explore the correlation between the labels and the effect it has on the target. I have some features that number and others that are letters that go along with no particular order and therefore I can not encode them into numbers. such as : Feature: Heating. With unique entries such as "Floor", "GasA","Grav","Wall". another example Garage type. Unique entires such as "2Types", "Attched", "BuiltIn", "Detached". How should I go about exploring the effect of these on the sales price of the property?
