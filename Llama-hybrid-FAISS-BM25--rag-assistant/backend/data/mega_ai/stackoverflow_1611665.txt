I'm working on a project with a lot of UpdatePanel and jQuery, things just work fine. Yes, it is a period when you need to learn, to make things work. If you have a lot of UpdatePanels and you don't want to remove them then this is understandable, and using jQuery is just improving the UI, so it's not going to much worse. Also jQuery has functionalitys related to AJAX,so you can make elegant client side coding with jQuery which is not related to Design and ui stuff. I think if you search for jQuery and Ajax on the internet you will find a bunch of good examples, and fine techniques to both technologies together. PS : Remenber that UpdatePanel is evil in sort of way when you are using in an inappropriate way. UpdatePanel is (and generally AJAX) is very customizable, make time for yourself to optimize it Good luck!
