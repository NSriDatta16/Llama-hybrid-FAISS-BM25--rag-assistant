Not entirely sure about all the questions, but log-normalization will not work with data that is negative or zero. I routinely use sklearn's PowerTransformer to scale features that suffer from high skewness (usually due to outliers) which usually leads to slight performance improvements of my NN models. But it seems a bit odd to me to use a scaling method that usually suppress outliers in order to detect outliers.
