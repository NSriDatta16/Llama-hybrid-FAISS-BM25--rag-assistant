block processing with multiple input matrices

I'm working in matlab processing images for steganography. In my work so far I have been working with block processing command blockproc to break the image up into blocks to work on it. I'm now looking to start working with two image, the secret and the cover, but i can't find anyway to use blockproc with two input matrices instead of one. Would anyone knowof a way to do this?
