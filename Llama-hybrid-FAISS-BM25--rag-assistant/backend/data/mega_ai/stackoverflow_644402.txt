A telephone chain is implemented directly as a linked list. Here's how it works: A group organizer collects the phone numbers of all members. The organizer assigns each member the number of one other member to call. (Sometimes they will assign their own number so that they know the message got through, but this is optional.) When a message needs to be sent, the organizer calls the head of the list and delivers the message. The head calls the number they were assigned and delivers the message. Step 4 is repeated until everyone has heard the message. Obviously care must be taken to set up the list in step 2 so that everyone is linked. Also, the list is usually public so that if someone gets an answering machine or busy tone, they can call the next number down and keep the chain moving.
