Multiple Solutions when Fitting MA Model

Given an MA(2) model $$X_t = e_t + A_1 e_{t-1} + A_2 e_{t-2}$$ There are cases where there are multiple solutions. Given time series data that we can correctly estimate one solution $(A_1^*,A_2^*)$, how would we calculate the other pairs of coefficients satisfying the model from these? How does this generalise?
