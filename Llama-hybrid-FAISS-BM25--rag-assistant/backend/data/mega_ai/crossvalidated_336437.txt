The add and to arguments have no effect for measure="ROM" in the metafor package. help(escalc) indicates to which outcome measures these arguments apply. I don't think adding a constant is an appropriate adjustment for measure="ROM" . Consider what happens as the sample sizes of the two groups increase. Then m1i and m2i converge to the true means and hence log(m1i) - log(m2i) converges to the true log ratio of means, but that won't be true for log(m1i + .5) - log(m2i + .5) (except when the true means are equal to each other). Since the log response ratio is only an appropriate outcome measure when the measurements are made on a ratio scale (so, the measurements must be $>= 0$), a zero mean implies that all of the measurements in that group were equal to 0. That seems a rather strange case, but I guess with a small number of measurements (and measurements that are possible rounded to some extent), that could happen. I don't know of any work that addresses this issue. Just as an idea, one could consider what happens if we approach this from a Bayesian perspective and assume some kind of prior for $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$. Since the prior should only have mass for values $>= 0$, the posterior will have a mode that is pushed away from 0 to some extent. So, in a way, the effect will be like adding a constant. But one would have to work through this properly and the constant won't be 0.5.
