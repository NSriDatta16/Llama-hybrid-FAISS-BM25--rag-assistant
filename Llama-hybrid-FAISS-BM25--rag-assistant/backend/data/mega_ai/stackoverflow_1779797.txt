iphone firmware downgrade

I'm trying to downgrade my firmware to 3.0 so that I can test compatibility of my app. I tried doing an Option+Restore in itunes and selected iPhone1,2_3.0_7A341_Restore.ipsw I found on the web, but it errors out about half way through. When I tried downgrading from xcode organizer I got an "Error: Updating baseband: The baseband cannot be rolled back" Is there anyway to roll back the firmware ?
