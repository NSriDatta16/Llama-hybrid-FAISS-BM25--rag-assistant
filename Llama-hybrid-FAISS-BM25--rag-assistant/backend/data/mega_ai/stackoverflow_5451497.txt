What would the tsql be for this type of database schema?

I asked this question , and someone suggested this type of schema. I'm not familiar with how super/subtypes work. Can you show me a TSQL example of how I would create this database? Another problem I'm having trouble wrapping my head around, is given an order, and a collection of items in that order, how would I know if an item is a Pizza, Beverage or Side dish? Thank you.
