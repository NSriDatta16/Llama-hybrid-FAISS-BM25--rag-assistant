What off-the-shelf licensing system will meet my needs?

I'm writing a piece of open-source software which will be easily embeddable (both static/dynamic libraries and executables on top of them). Which software licence would: allow the user to use either the source code by embedding it, or link against it dynamically or statically in his own programs under any licence, including closed and open-source? ensure that any modifications made to the files created by me be released under the same licence? I am given credit in his software, no matter how he uses my code? He doesn't misuse the name of my software in his program? Thanks
