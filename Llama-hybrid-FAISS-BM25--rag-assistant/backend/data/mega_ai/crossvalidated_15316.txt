The order of the explanatory does not matter in logistic regression. The symptoms you describe, i.e. the unstable results, may hint at multicollinearity problems or problems of quasi-complete separation in your data. Do you also have large standard errors? As your independent variables are factors, you can tabulate them one against each other and inspect the relation between them. You should also tabulate the covariate patterns against your dependent variable. You can also start by fitting the model stepwise. Then you will see at which point the problem arises.
