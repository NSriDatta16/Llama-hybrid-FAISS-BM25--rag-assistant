On a fundamental level, Monte Carlo is an approach to approximating integrals. It is not intrinsically a method for forecasting. It becomes a method for forecasting when your model defines a certain integral which corresponds to the forecast that you are trying to approximate. Because you have not explicitly defined a model, there is no way to tell if your Monte Carlo forecast is correct ; we don't know what integral you are trying to approximate. You mention normality but that is just the marginal distribution; a time series model includes the full joint distribution at all time points. One possible model for which your one-step-ahead forecast would be correct is this: $$Y_t = \mu + \varepsilon_t, \quad \varepsilon_t \sim^{\text{iid}} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$$ You would then fit your model by estimating its two parameters, $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ . Then, the usual point forecast is given by the conditional expectation, which you can compute exactly in this case: $$E(Y_{t+1}|\mathcal{F}_t) = \mu$$ Your point forecast would then just be your estimate of the mean, $\hat{\mu}$ . There is no reason to use Monte Carlo here, but if you really wanted to, you would simulate: $$Y_{t+1}^{(i)} \sim^{\text{iid}} \mathcal{N}(\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma}^2)$$ And you would approximate the integral that corresponds to $E(Y_{t+1}|\mathcal{F}_t)$ by the sample mean of the $Y_{t+1}^{(i)}$ . As far as the 2-step-ahead forecast, there is no reason to include your 1-step-ahead forecast as if it were data: you did not observe it and it should not be used to refit parameters. Also if your model is as described above, then the $h$ -step-ahead-forecast is, for any $h$ : $$E(Y_{t+h}|\mathcal{F}_t) = \mu$$ You would simply copy the same point forecast (estimated by Monte Carlo or not) for any horizon. Finally, it is very clear from the plot that this is not a good model for your data at all, as it seems to (1) have very large spikes, (2) be approximately periodic and (3) from context probably bounded below by zero.
