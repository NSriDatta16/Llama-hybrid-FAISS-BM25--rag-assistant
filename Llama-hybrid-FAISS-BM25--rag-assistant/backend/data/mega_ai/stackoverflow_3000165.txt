Anybody using AmaterasUML in Eclipse?

Does it automatically creates the sequence diagram? Or we have to drag and drop the related Java files and then manually create the sequence diagram? This was the only link I could find on Google: http://amateras.sourceforge.jp/cgi-bin/fswiki_en/wiki.cgi?page=AmaterasUML Thanks
