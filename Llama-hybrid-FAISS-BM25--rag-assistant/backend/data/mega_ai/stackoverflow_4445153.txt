javascript parseFromString changing order of elements in xml doc

in my system, i had to move a big javascript ajax system to seam. i got that to work correctly by adding xml = (new DOMParser()).parseFromString(s, "text/xml"); now my problem is it has just come to my attention that the domparser is for some reason changing the order of the xml elements. ive narrowed it down, it has to be this. since these elements are sorted in a specific order when it leaves the server, the dom parser reorganizing is not a good thing. anyone seen this? anyone know how to fix it?
