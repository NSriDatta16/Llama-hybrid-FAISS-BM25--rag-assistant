With the release of Chrome OS, arrival of HTML5, Ajax techniques and new hardware form factors such as thin web clients which will appear to support Chrome OS, a lot of IT budgets will be diverted to Web Applications. Your boss is not the only manager coming to this conclusion. I meet many managers with similar views every day. The question is the choice of platform. If it is not already decided for you then .NET and Silverlight will leverage your existing skills. The only other one I know you can use your VB and C# skills would be Morfik but it is radically different and you need to keep an open mind. If you are prepared to invest time in learning new stuff then my advice is do not rush into selecting one as in my opinion the landscape will drastically change in 2010 and 2011.
