best method of detecting mobile browsers with javascript/jquery?

For a site I'm working on I'm implementing image preloading with javascript however i most certainly do not want to call my preload_images() function if someone is on slow bandwidth. For my market the only people with slow bandwidth are those using mobile internet on a smartphone. What's the best approach for detecting these users so i can avoid image preloading for them? option 1 : detect browser width if($(window).width() > 960){ preload... } option 2: detect user-agent with a list of browser to preload for if($.browser in array safelist){ preload... } are there any better options?
