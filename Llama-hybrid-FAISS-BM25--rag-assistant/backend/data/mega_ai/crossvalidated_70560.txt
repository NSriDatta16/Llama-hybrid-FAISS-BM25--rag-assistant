Some of the things in formula are a bit confusing. The : is for interactions between two terms while the * is for main effects and interactions. The / is another one for interactions but what it does is generate an interaction between the numerator and all of the terms in the denominator (e.g. A/(B+C) = A:B + A:C ). The | is for something like "grouped by". So, 1|station would be intercept grouped by station and in parentheses it's random (1|station) . That's how you would do nesting. Hopefully that's help. It's a bit odd to have a random effect nested within a fixed effect and I'm not sure how you'd represent that. I can't even imagine the situation. You might get a better response if you explain just what your variables are and what you want to accomplish. Lots of times people ask questions and are using the terminology wrong and it's hard to communicate. Explain what the variables represent and what you want to know about them. Focusing on your your description in your last paragraph it sounds like your tow is simply an indicator of the samples you gathered and not something you need estimates of in the sense that you expect tow 1 to be consistently different from tow 2 in some way. Tow is just indicating a sample. Unless you really believe the order of tows mattered you don't even bother with that variable. And if they mattered then it's a fixed effect (and maybe random, but not a solely random effect). You say that you want to know if tows change in variability from day to day. How about the answer is yes? It's not in the realm of realistic probability that they don't vary from day to day. It's just the variance of your measures. You're not allowed to try to account for every spec of variance because then you wind up not having any variance left over for error. You'd have an over-specified model. You'd be at the point of just reporting each measure. You make a similar statement about wondering if station varies by day; of course it does. But maybe you mean specific days? Were the days grouped in some way by season, lunar cycle, etc? Unless you have something other than just this is day 1, this is day 2, etc how does knowing that stations vary day to day tell you anything other than stations vary? So the answer to that question is, of course stations vary day to day. And of course tows vary day to day and station to station. You end up left with a simple model: aov(y ~ station, data = dat) The one fixed effect you have here, station, just is sampled over multiple tows and multiple days. I'm not sure you really need multi-level modelling here at all. It sounds like you're over-specifying your model. If you really do want random day and tow effects and there's information that you haven't specified here then you might expand it out to a multi-level model. That would be: lmer(y ~ station + (two*day|station), data = dat) You need multiple tows at each station and day to use that model though.
