OO ABAP: When and Why?

Months after my company has upgraded from 4.6c to ECC6.0, our team of programmers are still coding in the traditional 4.7c way. I'm eager to try out the new OO approach of ABAP, but much to my dismay most people here only emphasize on getting things done in the shortest time frame given. My question would be: 1) When do people in your organization actually started coding in OO ABAP? 2) Is there any significant reason that people would want to code it in an OO way? e.g. Call Method is faster than a PERFORM statement?
