Diagnostic probability plots in logistic regression

There is some discussion on StackExchange about diagnostic plots for logistic regression, but all are focusing on "residuals", for which there is not even a consensus how to define them for logistic regression. And whether they are useful seems to be another can of worms. I wonder, however, why dignostic plots are not simply based on comparing the predicted probabilities with the observed probabilities dierectly estimated form the data. Two obvious approaches come to my mind ( $x_i$ is the linear predictor, i.e. $x_i=\sum_j\beta_j x_{ij}$ and $y_i$ the binary response): Compare the predited probability $P(y=1|x=x_i)$ with its non-parametric estimate from a conditional density plot on basis of the $x_i$ , as e.g. computed by the R function cdplot . Compare the predicted cumulative probability $P(y=1|x\leq x_i)$ with its empirical value computed from the data. As I have not found these dignostics discussed in text books on logistic regression, there must be strong objections to these plots or their usefulness. Does someone know why these diagnostics are not useful? PS: From its abstract, it seems that this article suggests method 1), but unfortunately I cannot check this because the article is behind a paywall: Fowlkes, Edward B. “Some Diagnostics for Binary Logistic Regression via Smoothing.” Biometrika 74.3, pp. 503–15, 1987
