How to increase spacing between paragraphs in Crystal Reports PDF

I have a report that I'm exporting to PDF using the VS2008 version of Crystal Reports. There is a field that displays a product description that contains HTML data pulled from my database so I've set Text Interpretation to HTML for the field. The text displays fine with all the appropriate HTML formatting, however, there is only a single line-space between paragraphs. I've tried adding multiple and multiple tags to increase the spacing but this does not work. How can I increase the spacing between paragraphs in an HTML field that I'm exporting to PDF?
