You can use live() as others have mentioned. For an alternative let me suggest a little more elegant solution using an array of messages and a single click handler. $('#left').append(" Don't click. "); // time for some fun var messageNumber = 0; $("#dontclick").click(function() { var messages = [ "I told you not to click.", "Now you will suffer.", "Shame!", "You shouldn't click.", "But you did. Sigh." ]; $(this).text(messages[messageNumber]); // Cycle to the next message unless we're already there. if (messageNumber I've changed it so you just create the once, and it doesn't need a number any more. The click handler is only registered once and each time it's called it displays a different message in the #dontclick link. The $(this) in the $(this).text(...) line, by the way, refers to $("#dontclick") . It's just a little shorter to write $(this) .
