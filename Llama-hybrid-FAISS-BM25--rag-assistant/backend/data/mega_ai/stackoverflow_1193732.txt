I'm really confused as to what purpse MeteoDataPointList serves...? And no; you don't need a destructor/finalizer unless you are handling unmanaged objects. For example, it would be a lot simpler to just subclass Collection (or perhaps List ) to extend it: public sealed class MeteoDataPointList : Collection { // additional methods only, such as AverageTemperature } Note that in C# 3.0 you can also do this via extension methods, and it will be available on any common collection/sequence of MeteoDataPoint s. public static class MeteoExtension { public double AverageTemperature(this IEnumerable items) { // or just return items.Average(m=>m.Temperature); ;-p double sum=0; int count = 0; foreach (MeteoDataPoint m in items) { sum += m.Temperature; count++; } return sum / count; } }
