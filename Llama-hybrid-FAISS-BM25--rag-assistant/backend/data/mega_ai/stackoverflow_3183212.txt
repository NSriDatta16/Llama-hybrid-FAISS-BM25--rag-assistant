You may want to contact the folks over at http://www.ebridgeconnections.com/ . Magento Enterprise edition claims to have the "Bridge Connect" integration. We had a client that needed to connect with Sage Timberline, so we called Varien to see if it was possible to get the modules for that connectivity, but they said no. After looking at an installation of EE, we didn't see any modules for this at all, so they either don't actually exist, or they are extra that you have to request for EE. Upon actually calling eBridge, they claimed that no additional modules were needed. But, the problem that we encountered was that they hadn't actually built the web services for that particular software yet (Timberline). So, while I don't have a solid answer for you, I hope that perhaps this helps in some way.
