Why is it that Support Vector Regression isn't as popular as SVM?

I know that SVM and SVR have different purposes in that the former is used for classification while the latter is used for regression, despite the similarity in the concepts between the two. However, in classification, SVM appears to be popular while for regression, I am under the impression that SVR isn't that common. I say this because it doesn't seem to be the first choice when performing regression -- others would, say, employ Gaussian process regression first. The coverage of SVR in text books on machine learning isn't as in-depth as SVM, for example, and is usually just mentioned as an aside. Is there a reason why? I am not 100% familiar with SVR as I am only working on classification problems and hence have only been using SVM.
