If I understand this post correctly, casual models and directed graphical models (Bayesian networks) aim at different stages of the workflow. A casual model is a way of assigning dependencies such that they reflect causation. Bayesian networks provide us with inference techniques. So, one can perform estimation using something different. On the other hand, one can model Bayesian networks using different techniques than SCM. If you dig into it deeper, please let us know, because I don't fully understand the subject of SCM (while I'd like to :).
