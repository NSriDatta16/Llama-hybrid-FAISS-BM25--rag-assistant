For alpha number text (with out newlines), you can use Find/Replace however as soon as you get in the realm of bullets, new paragraphs, etc. it will no longer do exact matching. If you often need to do that, I would suggest using a program like LaTeX to write your documents. LaTeX would allow you do this style of exact matching of large blocks of text. If you're on a Windows machine, a great LaTeX package would be proTeXt which can be found at http://www.tug.org/protext/
