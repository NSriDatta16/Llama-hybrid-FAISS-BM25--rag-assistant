Have you confirmed that the following resources are served properly? (e.g., they aren't 404, they are the correct content type, etc.) /css/base.css /javascript/jquery-1.4.3.js /javascript/jquery.tablesorter.js If so, have you used something like the Firefox Error Console to ensure that there are no JavaScript errors in your code? Also, why are you embedding forms in your table that appear to just link to a page with an id? In other words, why not just link to the page?
