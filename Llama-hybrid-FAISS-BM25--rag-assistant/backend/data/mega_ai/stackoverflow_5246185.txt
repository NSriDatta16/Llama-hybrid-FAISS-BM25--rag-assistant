List all Processes & Threads under processes from Linux core dump using gdb

I am developing a scripting tool for gdb/linux core dump, where if I point script to core bump , it lists all stack traces of all threads under process i.e, what I am trying to achieve is pretty much gdb equivalent of windbg's !process 0 which dumps all the processes and threads with stack from dump. Is there gdb equivalent of !process 0 ? if Not Whats the gdb command to list all the processes and list all threads under processes in gdb from core dump ? This would enable me to write a script to loop over all pid's and tid's and get an backtrace which could be logged to an file? Also suggestions on scripting language for this such as perl/python, the better one is welcome. Thanks Ganesh
