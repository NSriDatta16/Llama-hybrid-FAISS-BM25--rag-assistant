Yes coefficients will be numerically different but I think coefficient estimates between linear regression and logistic regression should be interpreted relatively in a similar way. I believe the main difference is that coefficients from logistic regression would be on a different scale. For example, if you used a log link then your coefficient estimates will be on a log scale. To get estimates on their original scale you can use information found here https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/14639/108922
