long shape line in tSNE plot

My question is similar to this post: What does the long curve-shape t-SNE mean? but the problem is that my data is not time series, but I also get these long shape line in tSNE plot . I don't know what that means or how I can get rid of that. I suspect some structure in the data causing that. But I could not find a useful resource explaining what structure in data could cause this. My data is single cell data, each row is a cell, each column is a biology marker (e.g. CD3, CD4), so the data is the marker expression on each cell.
