One concept that I will never forget is the whole "plural" versus "singular" thing with naming. A great mentor I had way back once told me that you should design your table names as plural and your column names as singular and that you never create temporal-specific names for column names. Temporal Names examples are NutsSold1998, NutsSold1999, NutsSold2000, etc. Never add a year or month or week number or time, etc to a column name. Table Name Examples: Employees (not Employee) Parts (not Part) Students (Student) Column Name Examples: EmployeeID (not EmployeesID or EmployeeIDS, etc) PartID (not PartsID or PartIDS, etc) StudentID (not StudentsID or StudentIDS, etc) And to pay attention to the correct usage of ID, Code, Key, Number, etc... I was always taught to not use "Key" in the name of a Column unless it was an actual table Key (primary or foreign, but not necessarily alternate).. Most of the time appending "ID" will be a better choice than appending "Number" or "Code", but it all depends on the context. And that comes with time and experience in designing tables, reading good materials such as the book Database Design For Mere Mortals and Data Modeling for Everyone . Also, spending lots of time looking at good designs and taking them apart. Its definitely a craft and you only get better with time and practice.
