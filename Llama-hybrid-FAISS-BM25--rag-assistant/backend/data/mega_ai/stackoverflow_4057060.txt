Well I am perhaps going through a similar process. Sorry, this isn't an answer as such, however maybe from a contextual perspective. I have a situation where a web app will allow a user to upload images for a design.. the problem is I need to obviously handle the initial upload, but then queue the actual process of the images. For instance, I need to: Create scaled thumbnails of the main images, along with some watermarking etc Send the actual images over to an Amazon S3 storage unit. Update some logs/notifications etc. Again, I instantly thought MSMQ from my old days working in finance along with IBM-MQseries, and because I am using SQL 2008 R2, I notice it too has (probably for a while!) queuing mechanisms. So I am sort of in the same boat trying to find the correct option! Thanks for the replies so far.. will check out some of the solutions, but again, any other ideas would be grateful
