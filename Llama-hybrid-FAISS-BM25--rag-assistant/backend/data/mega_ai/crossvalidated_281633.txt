Regression with independent variable as factor of 2

I have the wine data from here which consists of 11 numerical independent variables with a dependent rating associated with each entry with values between 0 and 10 (increments of 1). The dataset is split into 2: red wine and white wine. Can one make a single regression model to predict rating, i.e. for both red and white in the same time? I have run a two independent samples t-test to check whether the rating means are equal between red and white and with a very low p-value (to the -9) they are not (the rating histograms and qqplots look normal, despite the difficulty of seeing this given the factor-like variable). Is it correct to conclude that a single linear regression model cannot be made for both wines, i.e. there should be 2 models, one for red and one for white? Lastly, it seems that logistic regression could account for this red/white factor, even though one should perhaps fit a multinomial/ordinal logistic model; so a single model would suffice. Is this correct? I work in R.
