Language. I don't just mean COBOL vs C#, but also the words used to describe problems and solutions. I have often found myself having difficulty in conversations with older COBOL programmers because we lack the shared language of ABENDS, working storage (old school), methods, automated unit testing (new school), and much more. As with many other problems in life, "knowing is half the battle" â€” once you recognize the issue, you can work to overcome it.
