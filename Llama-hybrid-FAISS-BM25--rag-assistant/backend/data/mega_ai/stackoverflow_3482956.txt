In general the rowguid column is used in replication, if you start to use replication the rowguid column will be created. From Books On Line Merge replication requires that each published table have a ROWGUID column. If a ROWGUID column does not exist in the table before the Snapshot Agent creates the initial snapshot files, the agent must first add and populate the ROWGUID column. To gain a performance advantage when generating and applying snapshots during merge replication, create the ROWGUID column on each table published during merge replication. When creating the column, specify: The column title as ROWGUID. The data type as UNIQUEIDENTIFIER. The default as NEWID(). The ROWGUIDCOL property. An index on the column. The ROWGUID column is used frequently for relating to merge tracking data during tracking and synchronization of changes made at the Publisher and at Subscribers.
