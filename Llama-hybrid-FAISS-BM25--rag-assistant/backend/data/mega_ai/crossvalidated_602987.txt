A zero probability Distribution from a neural network

I have a neural network that gives out a probability distribution of 128 in length. However, the output mainly comprises numbers close to 0. (Probability of Strike) What can be the reason(s) for such a situation to arise? Some information about the Network:- It uses LeakyRelu as the activation function. It is a convolutional network.
