Seems like you want to specify misclassification costs: the cost of a false negative should be higher than the cost of a false positive. I am not an expert on MatLab or the fitcsvm function, but this seems to explain how to specify misclassification costs: https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/fitcsvm.html#bt9w6j6-Cost Alternatively, you could undersample the majority class or oversample the minority class.
