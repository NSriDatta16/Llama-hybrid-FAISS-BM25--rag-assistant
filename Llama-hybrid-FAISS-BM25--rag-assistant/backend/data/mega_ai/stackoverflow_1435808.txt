I'm guessing you are saying the tooltip remains open while you are dragging the div around? If you are using the jQuery tooltip plugin... it makes a div with an ID of "tooltip", so you could just access the tooltip directly to change the data. $('#tooltip').append('new data'); I haven't tested it but I don't think the title will update with this new data once you are no longer hovering over the tooltip.
