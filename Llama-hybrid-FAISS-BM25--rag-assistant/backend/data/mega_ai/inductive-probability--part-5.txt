hortest encoding. Knowledge is represented as statements. Each statement is a Boolean expression. Expressions are encoded by a function that takes a description (as against the value) of the expression and encodes it as a bit string. The length of the encoding of a statement gives an estimate of the probability of a statement. This probability estimate will often be used as the prior probability of a statement. Technically this estimate is not a probability because it is not constructed from a frequency distribution. The probability estimates given by it do not always obey the law of total of probability. Applying the law of total probability to various scenarios will usually give a more accurate probability estimate of the prior probability than the estimate from the length of the statement. Encoding expressions An expression is constructed from sub expressions, Constants (including function identifier). Application of functions. quantifiers. A Huffman code must distinguish the 3 cases. The length of each code is based on the frequency of each type of sub expressions. Initially constants are all assigned the same length/probability. Later constants may be assigned a probability using the Huffman code based on the number of uses of the function id in all expressions recorded so far. In using a Huffman code the goal is to estimate probabilities, not to compress the data. The length of a function application is the length of the function identifier constant plus the sum of the sizes of the expressions for each parameter. The length of a quantifier is the length of the expression being quantified over. Distribution of numbers No explicit representation of natural numbers is given. However natural numbers may be constructed by applying the successor function to 0, and then applying other arithmetic functions. A distribution of natural numbers is implied by this, based on the complexity of constructing each number. Rational numbers are constructed by the division of natural numbers. The simplest representation has no common factors between the numerator and the denominator. This allows the probability distribution of natural numbers may be extended to rational numbers. Probability and frequency The probability of an event may be interpreted as the frequencies of outcomes where the statement is true divided by the total number of outcomes. If the outcomes form a continuum the frequency may need to be replaced with a measure. Events are sets of outcomes. Statements may be related to events. A Boolean statement B about outcomes defines a set of outcomes b, b = { x : B ( x ) } {\displaystyle b=\{x:B(x)\}} Conditional probability Each probability is always associated with the state of knowledge at a particular point in the argument. Probabilities before an inference are known as prior probabilities, and probabilities after are known as posterior probabilities. Probability depends on the facts known. The truth of a fact limits the domain of outcomes to the outcomes consistent with the fact. Prior probabilities are the probabilities before a fact is known. Posterior probabilities are after a fact is known. The posterior probabilities are said to be conditional on the fact. the probability that B {\displaystyle B} is true given that A {\displaystyle A} is true is written as: P ( B | A ) . {\displaystyle P(B|A).} All probabilities are in some sense conditional. The prior probability of B {\displaystyle B} is, P ( B ) = P ( B | ‚ä§ ) {\displaystyle P(B)=P(B|\top )} The frequentist approach applied to possible worlds In the frequentist approach, probabilities are defined as the ratio of the number of outcomes within an event to the total number of outcomes. In the possible world model each possible world is an outcome, and statements about possible worlds define events. The probability of a statement being true is the number of possible worlds where the statement is true divided by the total number of possible worlds. The probability of a state
