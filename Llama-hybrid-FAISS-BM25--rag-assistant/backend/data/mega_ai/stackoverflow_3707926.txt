You can either use Android's Intent system to launch the native email client on the phone. You can pre-populate the fields. User intervention is required to send the email. Code would be something like: Intent email = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND); email.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL, recipients); email.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "First Email from Android"); email.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "Subject & Predicate"); email.setType("message/rfc822"); startActivity(email); You can also send attachments, see this thread for details. EDIT : Use android.content.Intent.EXTRA_STREAM and pass to it the URI of your file image file. For e.g: if you have your a image file on your sdcard you can say: emailIntent.putExtra(android.content.Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, Uri.parse("file://"+Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath()+"/mybitmap.png")) If you want to send an email programmatically, without user intervention you can use the JavaMail port for Android. I haven't tried it myself but see the following thread for details: Sending Email using JavaMail
