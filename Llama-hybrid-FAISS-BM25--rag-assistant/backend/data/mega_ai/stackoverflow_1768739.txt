You might want to tackle a new language. After Java, you could go down in power by trying C (and then try C++ later) or you could go up in power by trying Python. (Or Ruby, if you prefer, or even LISP/Scheme.) If you try a new language, start by getting a decent book that teaches the language, with exercises. Try out the exercises, and see if they inspire you to do something new. Once you have learned the basics of Python, you could use the PyGame library to write some sort of simple game. If you do this, you might want to get the book Beginning Game Development with Python and Pygame: From Novice to Professional . Once you have the game working, be sure to share it with the world by putting it up on Github or some other code-sharing site! (Once you have a working game and you share it, someone may be inspired to take your game and add new features to it. Eventually your game may turn into something big!) Or, instead of writing your own game, look at games written by others, and see if you are inspired to add new features. There are dozens on the PyGame web site, in various stages of completion. P.S. Yes, I am pushing Python. I love the simplicity of the basic language and the power of its advanced features. You can use Python for everything from trivial system administration scripts to advanced AI. There are other good languages too, and I'm not looking to start a language flame war here, so if you want to learn something else, that's fine too. I do strongly encourage you to learn by writing programs, and I do strongly encourage you to try different languages. I've found that I learned things in Python that have made me a better programmer even in C, a downright primitive language in comparison. After years of experience with C, I would not have expected a slower-performing high-level language to teach me cool things, but it did.
