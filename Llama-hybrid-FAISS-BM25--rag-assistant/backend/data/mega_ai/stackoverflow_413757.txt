I don't believe this is possible as it create countless security problems. The only way I can see this being secure is a mix of user permissions and some way of verifying (on the client side) the authenticity of the website and the files they want to download to my computer. One method you could do is triggering the "FileSaveDialog" but I don't think that is what your looking for. Maybe packaging the collection of files first and then triggering is the way to achieve your goals. Silverlight only allows for 1mb of isolated storage per domain and will absolutely not give sites access to the clients hard drive.
