TopLink used to require you to explicitly set GenerationType.IDENTITY for MySQL, so change this and drop the database. Then try running your sample again. Further you might also want to explcitly set the database platform: Also I vaguely remember that you have to run Toplink using its Java agent in order to make it function properly with a resource local entitymanager. I did however successfully run your example using EclipseLink (which you should use since Toplink is outdated). Only cavat was that I did not have MySQL server handy, so I ran it using H2. I used the following Maven pom.xml to resolve the dependencies: 4.0.0 org.randompage sandbox jar 1.0 sandbox EclipseLink Repo http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?r=1&amp;nf=1&amp;file=/rt/eclipselink/maven.repo javax.persistence javax.persistence 2.0-SNAPSHOT org.eclipse.persistence eclipselink 2.0.0 runtime com.h2database h2 1.2.130 and this persistence.xml: org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider org.randompage.MyEntity With these settings your code ran as expected.
