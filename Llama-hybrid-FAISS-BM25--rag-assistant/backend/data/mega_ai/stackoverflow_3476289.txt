Last() method not working on IQueryable object

I'm pretty new still at C# so I might be doing something stupid, but I've spent some time looking at this and still can't see what the problem is. Here are some code snippets: double work = 0; ProjectRepository pr = new ProjectRepository(); IQueryable cds; // Find matching day of week // Then for that day, cycle through all working times // Return list of working times in day cds = pr.GetCalDetails(calendarID, startTime.DayOfWeek.GetHashCode()); foreach (CalendarDetail cd in cds) { DateTime wts = startTime.Date + cd.WorkingTimeStart.Value.TimeOfDay; DateTime wtf = startTime.Date + cd.WorkingTimeFinish.Value.TimeOfDay; //more code here.... if ((cds.Last().CalendarDetailID == cd.CalendarDetailID) && (finishTime > wtf)) work += Work(startTime.Date.AddDays(1), finishTime, calendarID); } The error is being thrown run-time due to my use of the cds.Last() method call. However, cds has been declared and is being used as an IQueryable object, so what is the problem? Error text: The query operator 'Last' is not supported. Failing a solution I'm sure I can 'logic' my way around the problem, but this seemed elegant. Thanks, Jonathan
