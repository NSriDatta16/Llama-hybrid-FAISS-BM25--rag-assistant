Generate pseudodata by Monte Carlo

What does it mean for "Generate pseudodata by Monte Carlo"? For the text I was reading it says suppose that the real data $Z_n \sim N(\mu(\theta), \Sigma (\theta))$ , then the pseudodata are generated by Monte Carlo according to a normal distribution based on a chosen initial $\theta$ . I though the Monte Carlo method is kind of generating the random number then take the average, I am not quite sure how is this method works here. Thanks for any help!
