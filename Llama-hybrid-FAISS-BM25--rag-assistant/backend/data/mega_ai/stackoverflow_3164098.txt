Where are the type names defined?

When you get Type of the variable you can check its name: if (my_type.Name=="Int32") however it would more elegant to write if (my_type.Name==TypeNames.Int32) to avoid typos. I can define such class on my own, but maybe there is already definition somewhere? If yes, where? Note : please avoid wondering "why would you like to get type of the variable in the first place", "it is better to use 'is'" and alike. Thank you very much! Edit : meanwhile, I jumped into the conclusion it would be enough to ignore the type of the object (my_type variable) and check the object instead. In other words the my_type is not necessary. I forgot about null case :-( Less code, more sleep, that's what I need ;-)
