Risk has several meanings in different contexts within statistics and is often used in combination with other terms, such as Bayes risk. According to Everitt & Skrondal (2002), risk is a term often used in medicine for the probability that an event will occur, for example, that a person will become ill, will die, etc. In decision theory, risk describes a situation in which an agent is facing a random variable with known outcomes and their probabilities (Luce & Raiffa, 1958) or either known or unknown probabilities that exist and can be estimated or somehow else arrived at (Knight, 1921).
