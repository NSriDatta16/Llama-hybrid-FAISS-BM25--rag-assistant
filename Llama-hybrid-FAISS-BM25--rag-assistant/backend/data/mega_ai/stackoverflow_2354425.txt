Is there a code-generator to create DataTable definition block from Excel Work sheet?

Basically the thing I want to achieve is to have a data-table that I want to use in my unit tests. And when I run my unit tests, I do not want to read any excel file into a data-table -or any call to Db-. So, I would like to have method that returns a data-table with the values that I can use in my test. Is there already any written tool to read an excel sheet and generate a code that defines an ADO.Net DataTable? Thanks, burak ozdogan
