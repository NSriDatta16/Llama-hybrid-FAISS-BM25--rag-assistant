How to find the relationship between an independent variable in a time series and a single dependent variable

I have a dataset of crop yield of a seasonal crop, under environmental conditions (rainfall, humidity, temperature etc.). Daily environmental conditions are recorded over few years with the crop yield of each season. example: Date , Temperature , Humidity , Rainfall 1/31/2019 , 28 , 64.55 , 1.2 2/1/2019 , 28.2 , 65.81 , 1.2 2/2/2019 , 28 , 67.18 , 0.6 2/3/2019 , 28 , 68.54 , 0.4 2/4/2019 , 27.43 , 69.17 , 0.2 Crop yield for the above season is 37000kg. Can you guide me on how can I find the relationships between the crop yield (dependent) and each environment factor (independent)? I am trying to find the impact of each factor on the crop yield of a season but I am having a hard time figuring out how to find correlation between a time series (environment factor) and a single variable (crop yield).
