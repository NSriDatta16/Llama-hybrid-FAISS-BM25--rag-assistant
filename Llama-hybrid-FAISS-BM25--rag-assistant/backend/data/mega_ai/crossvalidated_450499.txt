If I am understanding your question, you are wanting to compare the accurate machine learning model with ~100 samples to the ~351 samples on a 95% confidence interval. If that is the case, then I believe it is correct to say that the accurate machine learning model would give a much better estimation of the total population. By looking at the Central Limit Theorem (measure of sample means approach a normal distribution as samples increase; we want >30), we can see the ~100 samples definitely meet the criteria. Even though you have fewer samples, the accuracy helps. As you increase the samples, it will get more accurate obviously, but not very dramatically.
