I always like coding up the functionality first and then adding validation later. Seems fine to me seeing as most coding is done in a development environment and no one will be submitting data while you're working on it. But whichever way you feel comfortable with is best. The downside to my method is that, if you're disorganized, you may forget to add a validity or sanitation check somewhere. And it does happen :-)
