For something like this, I would probably ignore the changes in Cases and Population, and just use a robust or nonparametric method to determine if there is a slope of Age over Year, and to estimate that slope. It's simple and easy for the audience to interpret. It's probably also not worth it to try something more complex like auto-regressive time series. One method is Sen's slope, which is nonparametric, and is often used in time series data. Another nonparametric test of trend is Mann-Kendall. Alternately, you could use something like correlation or robust regression. In the following R code, for the function I used for Sen's slope, the data are first transformed into a time series object. But this isn't necessary for some other functions that calculate Sen's slope. Note that the output gives you Sen's slope (0.5), a p value (0.001), and a 95% confidence interval for the slope. if(!require(trend)){install.packages("trend")} Data = read.table(header=TRUE, text=" Year Age Cases Population 2009 53 2945 3.69 2010 53 3014 3.73 2011 54 3419 3.82 2012 54 3508 3.85 2013 54 3524 3.85 2014 55 3524 3.89 2015 56 3868 3.93 2016 56 4108 3.96 2017 57 4373 4.00 ") TS = ts(Data$Age, frequency=1, start=2009) library(trend) sens.slope(TS) ### z = 3.2287, n = 9, p-value = 0.001243 ### 95 percent confidence interval: ### 0.3333333 0.6666667 ### sample estimates: ### Sen's slope ### 0.5 You may not want to be too quick though, in reaching conclusions for this relationship. For example, it is also the case that the incidence of cancer ( Prop below, cases per 1000) increases over Year. I don't know what to make of this. Perhaps we are testing older people more over time, and so also are finding more incidents of cancer?

If you have the median age, you can only report what you can determine about the median age. You can't know if using the median was the best way to summarize the raw data.
