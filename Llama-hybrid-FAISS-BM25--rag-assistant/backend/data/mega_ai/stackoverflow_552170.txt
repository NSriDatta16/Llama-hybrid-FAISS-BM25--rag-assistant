How to implement drag and drop in Flex Grid control?

I have a simple Grid control with some buttons that I want to be able to move around. The code below does work, but it takes a lot of effort to actually do the drag&drop and it is not clear where the drop will happen. I have to move the mouse around a lot to get to a state where the drop is not rejected. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to make this more "user friendly". GridItem { borderColor: #A09999; borderStyle: solid; borderThickness: 2; horizontal-align: center; vertical-align: center; } Grid { borderColor: #A09999; borderStyle: solid; borderThickness: 2; horizontalGap: 0; verticalGap: 0; horizontal-align: center; vertical-align: center; }
