Magento email template location?

I've been trying to send an email from my magento module but for some reason I can't get the template to work: The template is set as follows: $emailTemplate = Mage::getModel('core/email_template')->loadDefault('application_status_email'); The headers and all are being sent correctly. I've created a file called application_status_email.html in app/locale/en_US/template/email and the selected language on the admin panel is English(US). Thoughts? The template itself simply contains: Message: {{var message}} But for some reason my emails are sent without anything content. I have another module sending emails, but from the front end wich works fine, with the template located in the same folder ...
