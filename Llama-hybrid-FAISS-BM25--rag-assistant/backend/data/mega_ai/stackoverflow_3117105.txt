You cannot access HKLM without elevation, so you simply cannot do what you described. I suggest some of the following: 1. Choose other data storage, eg. database, file, etc. that all your users can access. 2. Create a windows service running as LocalSystem (that gives RW access to HKLM) and make your apps talk to the service via named pipes/COM/a socket.
