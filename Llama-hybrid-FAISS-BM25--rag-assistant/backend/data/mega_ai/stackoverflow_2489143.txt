'Document' is a special type of object - an entity. The fact that it may be persisted or removed from storage is a separate concern, that should be handled by some other class in what some call the "data access layer". Your business classes (hope you have some) will use the entity, dal and other classes to perform your business functions. It goes well beyond that, with the introduction of interfaces and generics.
