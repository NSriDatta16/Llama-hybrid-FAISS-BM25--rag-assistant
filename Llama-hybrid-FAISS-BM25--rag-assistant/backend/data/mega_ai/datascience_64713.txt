PCA before Affinity Propagation (AP)

I have a large-ish dataset (100k samples, ~100 features), that I am trying to cluster, to an unknown number of clusters. I thought of using PCA first, to reduce dimensionality, since I understand that distances (euclidean, cosine) in high-dimensionality might not be actually accurate. However, I found very little on using PCA before AP, unlike K-Means, which made me wonder - is there any reason to not use PCA and then affinity propagation?
