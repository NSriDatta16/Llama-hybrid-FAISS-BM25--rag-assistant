The error View delegate should probably be self and not nil, but I'm not sure if that will solve the problem. If it doesn't, the issue is probably that NSNotificationCenter is sending too many notifications to it's observer (in this case checkNetworkStatus . The simplest (but probably less elegant) solution, is to keep a notice counter variable that is incremented when the error View is displayed, and only display the error View if the counter is zero. The better solution is to check the incoming notices, and respond to different notices differently (or not at all).
