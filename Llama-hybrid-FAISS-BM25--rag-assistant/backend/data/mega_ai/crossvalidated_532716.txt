What you have done is removed the linear association between the outcome DV and predictor IV , leaving only the residual values not explained by that simple regression. Those residuals necessarily sum to 0 , as you have found. It's not that the mean of DV is 0, it's that the mean difference between actual DV values and what's predicted by the regression is necessarily 0. On the average, as a result, there is nothing left for F to explain. That doesn't mean that F is unimportant, but without data on F you can't estimate it. If you had data on F you might find that it explains a good deal of the variation in residual values; that's actually one way that multiple regression is sometimes explained.
