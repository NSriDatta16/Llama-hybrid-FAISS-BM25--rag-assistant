Matched Case Control Design - Selecting Analysis

I am working through a data analysis plan for a program eval project. We are planning to use a matched case control design. We will be comparing involvement in a program versus going to jail (the traditional pathway) and comparing recidivism rates. People will enter the program in different cohorts and will be in the program for a year. so the critical needs are to be able to account for time spent in jail, time in the program, and length and severity of prior offense history. What is the best approach? I've seen people suggest Cox Regression, Bayesian Regression, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Estimates, etc. What would you suggest? Thanks! Kaitlyn
