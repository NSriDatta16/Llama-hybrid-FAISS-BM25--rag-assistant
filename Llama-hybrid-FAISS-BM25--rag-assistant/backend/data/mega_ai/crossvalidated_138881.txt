Put simply/blunty a logistic regression model is not a classifier . It is a model for the probability parameter of the binomial distribution. This is why predict() gives probabilities. In order to make it a classifier you need to specify a function converts probabilities into classes. Choosing a cutoff is one way - although probably not ideal for a large number of predictions. Taking your example, and the "naive" cutoff of 0.5 leads to all observations being classified as $0$. This is despite the model expectation of the number of $1$ classes to be about $2.5$ A better approach could be taking a randomised decision - generate a bernoulli random variable with the probability, and set that as your classifier.
