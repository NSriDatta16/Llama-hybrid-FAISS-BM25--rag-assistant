Interpretation of power calculations

We got the following comment from an associate editor who asked for ex-post power calculations. We used the treatment difference and sample size from our study and reported the power of detecting the effect of the observed point estimate at a 5% significance level. The AE was not happy and wrote: It appears that you used your existing data. However, power calculations are something one does (or should do) ex ante, i.e., when the treatments averages are unknown. it continued "More to the point, the idea of the power calculations is to test for the probability of type I and type II errors. This, by definition, means that the sample mean and standard deviation are likely to be different than those in the population. " If I am not mistaken, I can not jointly test (determine, I think is what s/he meant), as one has to fix at least one of the errors. I am really not sure what to make out of this comment.
