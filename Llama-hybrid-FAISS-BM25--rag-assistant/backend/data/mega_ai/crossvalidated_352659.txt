Why is Bayesian data analysis done if we already know the distribution of the parameters?

I am trying to learn Bayesian data analysis, so what I see is that most computations are carried out using MCMC simulations. So far as I understand, for simulating MCMC we need to know the distribution up to a constant (i.e., we need to know parameters) and then we can compute stuff related to it using the samples generated. But if we know distribution then why would we go about doing analysis? What am I missing here? Including a small example in your explanation or any reference that can explain this with toy examples will be helpful.
