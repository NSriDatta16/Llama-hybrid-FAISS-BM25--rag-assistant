I haven't seen usage of quantization in practice, but scikit-learn has several methods that can be used as compression, and trade accuracy for memory/compute time: Feature hashing - can be used to extract a specified number of features Approximate nearest neighbors with locality sensitive hashing Random Trees Embedding - partitions the data using trees and then encodes examples with appropriate indices of leaves
