Are you using Interface Builder? It's a lot easier to create a new UIViewController subclass in Xcode with the nib file, and then drag in the UIPicker. Then you need to present the view controller in a popover. Action sheets are not designed to have subviews, so don't do that. I have done it: see the third screenshot in C64 Paint .
