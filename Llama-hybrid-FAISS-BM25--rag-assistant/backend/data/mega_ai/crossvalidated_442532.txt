In general polynomial regression yields better results than neural networks, but they suffer from combinatorial explosion, so in order to tackle this we use neural networks with non-linear activations Sometimes linear models are sufficient so if neural network with only linear activations does the job then use linear/logistic regression and compare results. I would expect that these should be very close One remark: convolutional layers are one thing that helps in dimensionality reduction so this is one thing that is independent from activation functions
