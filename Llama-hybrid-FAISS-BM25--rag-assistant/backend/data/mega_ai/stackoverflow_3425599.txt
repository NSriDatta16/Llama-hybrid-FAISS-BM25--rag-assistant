Dynamic image gallery generation using PHP and jQuery

I've got an idea in my head, something I want to create, but am not sure about the best approach. I'd like to pitch the idea and get some opinions on a smart way to go about this before I dive headfirst in the wrong direction! I've got a photography website that displays multiple portfolios for a few different photographers. It's got thumbnails and large images, and they are organized into li in a ul . The idea: I'd like to have a login requiring only a password that takes you to a page allowing you to upload, rename, or delete files in a specified directory. The directory would be defined by a selection in a dropdown menu. After the images are uploaded I'd like them to be resized into a large image and a thumb, the thumb in a sub-directory, and have the files named sequentially. The gallery page would automatically create one gallery per folder in a specified directory. Each folder containing the images and a thumb folder. What I'm thinking: I'm thinking PHP or Perl script for image upload and manipulation, and maybe using a script out there for AJAX file upload and manipulation, but I'd like to hand code as much as possible. I imagine after each upload session is finished that a PHP script would generate HTML into the gallery file, rather than each time a visitor access the page having it create the content based on the directory. Could I get some advice on how best to approach this? Which languages are best suited for each step? (I'd like to use mostly jQuery as that is most of my JS) Any suggestions on the methods or sequence? Things to avoid doing all together? Thanks in advance!
