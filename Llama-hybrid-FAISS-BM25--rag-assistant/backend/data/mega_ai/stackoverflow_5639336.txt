For comparison, Haskell Platform's monad library package "mtl" gets Writer from packages "transformers". The implementation of Writer for all Monoid types is in the source near here . The instance uses mappend instead of (++): instance (Monoid w, Monad m) => Monad (WriterT w m) where return a = WriterT $ return (a, mempty) m >>= k = WriterT $ do ~(a, w)
