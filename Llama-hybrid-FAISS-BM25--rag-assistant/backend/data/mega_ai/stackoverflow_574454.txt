Check out these two jQuery plugins: Pulse : http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/simple-pulse-plugin-for-jquery/ Seek Attention : http://enhance.qd-creative.co.uk/demo/seekAttention/ (link now dead) I think Pulse is what you were asking for, but Seek Attention could be useful in some cases as well. Here is a very rudimentary sample I created using the pulse plug in. function doSomething() { if ($('.BadTextBox').val() == "") { $('.BadTextBox').pulse({ backgroundColors: ['#fcc', '#fff'] }); } else { $('.BadTextBox').css({'background-color': '#fff'}).stop(); } } When the user navigates away from the text box it starts pulsing if empty. If they go back and fill it out, it stops pulsing.
