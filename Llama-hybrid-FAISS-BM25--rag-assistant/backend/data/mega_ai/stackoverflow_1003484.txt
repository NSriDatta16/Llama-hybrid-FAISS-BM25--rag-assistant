I believe parseDateTime() and lsParseDateTime() are the closest to what you're looking for, from the library of built-in ColdFusion functions. Check out Adobe's LiveDocs for other date/time functions . Remember that you can also leverage any Java date/time class as well. Pete Freitag has an interesting post with some example code.
