As mentioned by others in the comments, the Bayesian approach estimates slightly different things than the frequentist and the results have different interpretations. So even in cases where you could expect the results to be similar, they are not the same thing. Start with the thread What is an "uninformative prior"? Can we ever have one with truly no information? . You would learn that there's no such thing as a “non-informative prior” as each prior brings some information. The Bayesian approach would give the same result as the maximum likelihood when using improper, flat prior $p(\theta) \propto 1$ , and looking at the mode of the posterior, because it's like maximizing the likelihood alone $$\begin{align} &\underset{\theta}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} \; p(X|\theta) \, p(\theta) = \\ &\underset{\theta}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} \; p(X|\theta) \times 1 \end{align}$$ But using flat priors has its own problems, like no guarantee of ending with the proper posterior distribution. So the three main reasons are: ideological (different interpretations), that the priors do bring information to the model, and that using such priors leads to different complications. There's no free lunch.
