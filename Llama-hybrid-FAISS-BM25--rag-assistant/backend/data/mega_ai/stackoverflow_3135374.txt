Using keys in xslt for converting trx file of mstest

I have written an xsl for converting the trx file of mstest into html. Following from this link , I'm unable to get the class names and number of passes and failures for each class to be printed in the output. I'm not sure where I'm goin wrong. the style sheet is applied on the same input file in the link. Thanks. //Some javascript code Coverage Summary Test Summary Total Failed Passed Inconclusive Error Unit Test Results Test Name Result Duration [+] background-color:pink; background-color:lightgreen; background-color:lightblue; background-color:yellow; display:none; FAILED Passed Not Run Error
