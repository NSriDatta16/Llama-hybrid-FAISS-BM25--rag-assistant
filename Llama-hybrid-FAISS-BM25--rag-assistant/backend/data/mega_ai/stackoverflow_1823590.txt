Here is a brief summary: Let the user browse for and upload a photo. Validate the photo is of correct type and dimensions using PHP's image functions. Show the user the photo in the browser, along with a draggable DIV that they can resize and move. This is the cropping area. When they click "Next", you transmit the x,y,width,height of the DIV to the server either by AJAX or simply as hidden fields in a form. Again, use the PHP image functions to crop the image, and then resize it. Save it to a permanent location. Post a comment for further specific answers.
