This is true for other browsers too, not just IE. The same behavior can also be observed for Firefox 3.6. Since HTML5 is only a working draft, the browser vendors have not yet created a default stylesheet for these elements, so by default elements are displayed inline. Use a reset stylesheet that gives these elements display: block if you want to use them, like: article, aside, footer, header, hgroup, nav, section { display: block; } Copied from Chrome's User Agent CSS :) If you want more info, well then - read the beta release notes on HTML5 . Nowhere does it explicitly state that IE9 "support" those HTML5 element. Your concept of support is also ill-defined here - what do you mean support? A UA stylesheet like the one above? Support for generic unspecified elements? (A feature which IE9 have, so you don't need a small script to create the elements prior to using them.) The HTML5 specs only talks about the semantics of each of these elements, and nothing on how browsers should display them. So do you expect a browser that "support" HTML5 do?
