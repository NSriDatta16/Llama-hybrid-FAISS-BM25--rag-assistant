Your overall approach is feasible, and essentially the same as time series cross validation. See this blog post by Rob Hyndman . Note that in your case, since you plan on using ARIMA and ETS models, only the second part of the post applies to your approach (i.e. time series cross-validation). You can't use K-fold cross-validation. A note of caution is that iterating thought all possible ARIMA models is unrealistic, you will need to put some bounds on the orders p,d,q and P,Q,D, additionally you will have to check for convergence for each set of parameters. For ETS models however, the number of models is not an issue since it is fixed, and convergence isn't usually an issue either.
