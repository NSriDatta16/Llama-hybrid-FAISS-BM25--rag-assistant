I don't really know the specifics of this bug, but I did run into this, or something very similar, years ago. Essential we found there was a hard limit on the amount of GDI handles which your application was bound to. Something like 9,999. When you hit this limit the application would crash with an out of memory exception no matter how much memory was free. So you could be doing something similar, but since you mentioned you are working with strings, I imagine you are fragmenting the heap and exceeding its capacity. If your strings are big enough, they are probably on the large object heap. I think the implementation for the LOH was very poor in early version of the framework. If memory serves me correctly, objects didn't get deallocated properly, making it very easy to run out of space on only the LOH.
