As the numbers don't represent real value (e.g. you cannot say that 1+2=3 for the features), you need to encode them as 1-hot vectors. (E.g. number 3 is encoded as [0,0,0,1,0,...0]). Then, your observations become a sequence of 10 vectors. (Each vector have the same dimensionality, which is the maximum value in your data). You can either tread them as non-sequential data, e.i. directly feed them to any standart classifier (logistic regression, fully connected network with logistic regression at output, SVM, kNN etc.) You can also try models specialized for sequential data: LSTM or GRU. I would start with simpler methods (logistic regression) and consider LSTM or GRU only if it doesn't work well.
