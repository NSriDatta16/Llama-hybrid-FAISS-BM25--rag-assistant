You have to list all the names I'm afraid. Assuming this is a permanent database object (e.g. table, view) then in Management studio you can right click the object in the tree view and choose SCRIPT TABLE AS -> SELECT to avoid typing them all. Or alternatively drag the "columns" folder into your query window to get the comma delimited list of column names added.
