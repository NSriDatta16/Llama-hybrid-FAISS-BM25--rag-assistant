Assuming you are talking about code documentation versus user documentation, an internal wiki is great if you do not need to distribute the documentation for the code outside of your organization, to contractors or partners. Javadoc or DOxygen is more suitable if you want distributable code documentation. If you are referring to user documentation, you may want to have a look at DITA .
