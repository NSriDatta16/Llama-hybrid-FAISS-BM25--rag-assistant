This is highly improbable without adding some hardware. You see, the power supplies in a regular PC are switching power supplies which effectively decouple the AC input from the supplied DC voltage needed on the PC side. The AC side just basically provides power that fuels the high-speed power switching circuitry. Also, a DC signal, by definition, doesn't provide a signal per se: it is a "static" power level (and yes the power level does vary a bit in the time domain but not as an easy to leverage function). Yes there can be an AD (Analog to Digital) monitoring chip that can be used on the PC side to read the voltage of the DC component supplied to the motherboard etc., but that doesn't mean there is still a signal that can be harvested : the original power line "signal" might have been through enough filters that there isn't a "signal" left to be processed. Lastly, one needs to consider that power supplies design varies from company to company; this fact will undoubtedly affect any possible design of a communication solution.
