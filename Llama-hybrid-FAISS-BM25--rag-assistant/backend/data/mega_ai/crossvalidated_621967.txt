How should I analyse this multicollinearity OLS regression problem?

I have a linear regression problem but am not very familiar with statistics so wanted to make sure I am on the right track. I am trying to answer the question: does the addition of additional "independent" variables improve my prediction, or does the data only depend on one variable? Here is some example data I have to illustrate the problem: x1 x2 y 0.00632417 0.00679581 0.32317827 0.00622976 0.00681978 0.3097791 0.00611744 0.00678052 0.30245155 0.0061263 0.00683414 0.2997192 0.00624025 0.006963 0.30711852 0.00664342 0.00731491 0.34573381 0.00651705 0.0072176 0.33728234 0.00677003 0.00750299 0.37058253 0.00626223 0.00702376 0.31360882 0.00617005 0.00692658 0.31424848 0.0066566 0.00741589 0.35940418 0.00703867 0.00788504 0.39341021 0.00703147 0.0080741 0.38132838 0.00752725 0.00875777 0.45101978 0.00768011 0.00898953 0.46833661 0.00785912 0.00928546 0.47491127 0.00707515 0.0083402 0.3916831 0.00735652 0.0088195 0.43994724 0.00672234 0.00808075 0.3664506 0.00738889 0.00891626 0.44791463 0.00818869 0.00991287 0.52140596 0.00839388 0.01007366 0.54547867 0.00786083 0.00951224 0.50600385 0.00810475 0.00993001 0.53698119 0.00715051 0.00851782 0.41489413 0.00757093 0.008898 0.45985079 0.00758228 0.00913975 0.48967028 0.0074294 0.00898206 0.44395012 0.00753441 0.00893392 0.45189571 0.00746246 0.00894566 0.4383567 0.00736734 0.00875527 0.43485564 x1 and x2 are my independent variables and y is my dependent variable. Clearly x1 and x2 are highly correlated (above 0.95). I've looked at some references online and what I've done so far is centered the data, applied a Gram-Schmidt orthonomalization and attempted a PCA. What I'm finding is that the p-value for the addition of the second variable is low (suggesting that adding it statistically improves the model) but that the increase in adjusted R^2 is quite small. With the PCA the MSE is very small with no components which I'm not sure makes any sense. Am I working through this correctly? Should I be looking at other methods that I've seen (i.e. ridge regression/partial least squares)? Is there an easy way to do all of this in python (any pointers, say with even more independent variables)? Many thanks!
