Easy way here does all the work for you. Embedding a map into a website or blog You can embed a simple map, a set of driving directions, a local search, or maps created by other users. Here's how: Ensure that the map you'd like to embed appears in the current map display. Click Link to this page in the top-right corner of the map. In the box that pops up, copy the HTML under 'Paste HTML to embed in website,' and paste it into the source code of your website or blog. If you'd like to adjust the size of the map before you embed it, just click Customize and preview embedded map, select your preferred size, and take a look at the preview map. Once you're happy with what you see, copy the HTML that appears in the box at the bottom of the window. Keep in mind that you won't be able to embed Traffic maps, Mapplets, and some other Maps features.
