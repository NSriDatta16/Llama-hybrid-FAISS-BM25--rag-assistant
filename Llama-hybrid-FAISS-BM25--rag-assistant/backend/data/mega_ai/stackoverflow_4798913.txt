Google Chart API - Line Chart: Averaging data

I have data that maps across ~4 years on a line chart: 0 72 346 172 193 240 34 24 18 26 25 34 52 104 23 34 29 32 55 46 44 25 36 45 48 60 65 69 66 24 28 39 2 72 74 65 69 44 66 57 49 35 77 49 32 63 47 79 47 the line chart seems to limit you to 100 max value, so some of my values are 'off the chart'. I figure they want you calculate your data in such a way that my max value (in my case, 346) equal 100 and then to average out everything in-between. It makes sense as Google Chart API allows floating numbers. Im just not sure how to do it.
