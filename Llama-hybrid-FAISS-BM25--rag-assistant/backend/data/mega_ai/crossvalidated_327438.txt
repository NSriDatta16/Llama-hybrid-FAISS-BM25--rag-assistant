Anova Analysis versus Time series analysis( hypothesis testing)

I have some data that I believe follows a Repeated Measures design pattern. But when I have shown this data to some, they tell me that one may want to approach this via time series analysis due to seeing a Seasonality Effect in the data. So here is the nature of my data: Imagine a Farmer in New Zealand grows oranges. The farmer counts all the oranges grown per month, and over many years. Question #1: The question i wish to know, is to find out which years are considered to be the same amount of orange production and which years are considered to be different, statistically significant. (I know that one would use a Post-hoc test after ANOVA analysis.) Question #2: Can my question be answered via some kind of Time Series Analysis? I have attached image of my data here:
