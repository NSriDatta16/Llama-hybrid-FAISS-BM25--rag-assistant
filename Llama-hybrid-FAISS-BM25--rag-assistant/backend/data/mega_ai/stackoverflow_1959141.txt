How do I detect user's location from a webpage opened in the Android browser?

Visiting www.google.com on the Android browser (or even with an android spoofed user-agent), presents the option to "Share Location" . When clicked, it uses the GPS/Cell phone towers to figure out the location. I tried the google.loader.clientLocation but that only works using the IP address. Is there a method to tap into the Android OS and access GPS data from a regular web application (and not an Android application) similar to the way Google does? [Perhaps Google uses the Google Gears app on Android to access this data.] Thanks!
