Problem with R console

I have a little problem with my R console recently. When I start R ( "C:\Program Files\R\R-2.8.1\bin\Rgui.exe" ), the cursor immediately starts in INSERT mode (thick state). Then I have to press Insert and toggle it to normal mode (thin state). As soon as I write a command line and hit Enter , the cursor again toggles to INSERT mode. I don't want to use R with the cursor in INSERT mode, and it's annoying that R always toggles. How can I get R console back to normal? EDIT: Today I realized that when I use the R console as a maximized window, the cursor is always in INSERT mode (thick state). When I unmaximize the window, it automatically gets out of the INSERT mode. The explanations in the first paragraph of my question are still valid as well.
