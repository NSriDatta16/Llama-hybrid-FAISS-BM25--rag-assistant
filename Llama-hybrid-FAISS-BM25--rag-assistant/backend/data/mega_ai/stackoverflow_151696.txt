Infragistics V7.3 vs. V8.1

We are using the Infragistics controls for .net (both ASP.Net and WinForms) for a few years. We want to upgrade our current version (v6.3) and are in a pickle. We can upgrade to v7.3 or v8.1 but not to a later one due to licensing limitations, and we don't want to spend more money on licenses unless it is really necessary. Rumor has it that the x.1 version is often less stable than the previous (x-1).3 version because there are more changes. This is only a rumor and I don't know if it is true or not, nor do I claim it to be true. What I want to find out is which option is preferred and why: Upgrade to v7.3 Upgrade to v8.1 Buy more licenses and upgrade to the latest and greatest (must be really good reason). Any recommendations? Do you have experience with both versions and can compare their stability? Thank you
