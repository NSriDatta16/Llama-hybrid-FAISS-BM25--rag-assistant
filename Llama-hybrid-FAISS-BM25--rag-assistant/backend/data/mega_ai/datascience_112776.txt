Another way would be simulate a time series, with any characteristic that you want. A very simple example in python: import numpy as np X = np.array([np.arange(0, 100)]) y = np.array([np.sin(np.arange(0, 100) * np.pi/4) + np.random.uniform(0, 1e-2, 100) + np.arange(0, 100)]) Simulating you're able to adjust tendency, seasonality, covariates and another feature of interest. And maybe this would be valuable in you research analyzing how time series features impact the performance both in RNN and formal methods.
