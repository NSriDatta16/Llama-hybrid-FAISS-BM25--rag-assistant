Websites should not be tied to specific devices. This is not 1998 : Best viewed in I.E. In fact your suggestion is worse than that. If you really want a website that only works on those devices then you'll need to check the user-agent string, but otherwise html is html and unlike what Apple may want you to believe, works just as well on Symbian, Blackberry, Android, S40, Windows, Windows Mobile, etc etc.. (In fact, it works better on Symbian as Symbian actually supports Flash.)
