See https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CAS/Solving+SSL+issues . CAS server requires SSL. After all, an authentication system needs to be as secure and trustworthy as possible. It would be a better use of your time to go ahead and configure your CAS server to use SSL with a self-signed certificate, rather than trying to find out how to bypass the SSL mechanisms. The phpCAS::setNoCasServerValidation() method is for situations where the server is using a self-signed certificate or a certificate that hasn't been signed by a Certificate Authority that's recognized and trusted by the client. It tells the client to simply accept the certificate as-is without doing any further checking to validate it.
