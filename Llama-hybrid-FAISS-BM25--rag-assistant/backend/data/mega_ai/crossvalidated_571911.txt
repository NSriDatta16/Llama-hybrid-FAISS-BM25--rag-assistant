The correct and efficient steps should be as follows: loop through each fold train the model try each threshold value you want to test on the validation fold report the threshold that gives the best performance metric (in your case F1) when averaged over all folds The only difference compared to a typical hyper-parameter is that you do not need to train the model for trying different thresholds. I'd also like to note that the thresholds are not fully regarded as hyper-parameters of the underlying model as they do not change the model flexibility but only reflect a measure of your classifier's trade-off.
