Good question! Plenty of people here have already said it - you end up needing to build a key into your app which potentially is retrievable by reverse engineering. Have a read up on Trusted Computing . This is built around a public/private key built into your PC - which your PC will never allow you to access. Memory curtaining / Sealed storage would make it difficult for an attacker to try discover a key delivered to your app.
