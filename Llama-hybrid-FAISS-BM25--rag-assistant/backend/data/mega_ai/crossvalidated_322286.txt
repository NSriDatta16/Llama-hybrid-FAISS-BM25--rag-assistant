(The standard version of) MASE only works for time series. The purpose of the $Y_t$ - $Y_{t-1}$ term in the denominator is that it represents a naive forecast , that it is your best guess for $Y_t$ is $Y_{t-1}$. In your case, your data is non-sequential and more importantly it is independent, so the idea of using $I_{n-1}$ as an estimator for $I_n$ doesn't really make sense (why $I_{n-1}$? Why not $I_{n-2}$ or $I_{n-199}$?) To answer your 2nd question, it depends on what error you are trying to measures exactly ? For dealing with the issue of zeros, a possible alternative for MAPE is sMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error). That might be a good option for you. Addressing the comment: When $Y_{emp}$ and $Y_{pred}$ are both equal to zero, than you set the sMAPE to 0 (since they are equal to each other, there is no error) (add an if clause to your calculation). Many software packages do that already, even with MAPE. For the second problem, you can use the modified version of the sMAPE: $$\text{sMAPE} = \frac{1}{N}\sum \frac{|y_{emp} -y_{pred}|}{{|y_{emp}|+|y_{pred}|}}$$ This gives you a 100% error in cases like you mentioned ($Y_{emp} = 0$ and $Y_{pred}=0.005$) So the modified version of sMAPE could be: $$\text{sMAPE} = \begin{cases} 0, & \text{ if } Y_{emp} = 0 & and & Y_{pred}=0 \\ \frac{1}{N}\sum \frac{|y_{emp} -y_{pred}|}{{|y_{emp}|+|y_{pred}|}} & \text{otherwise} \\ \end{cases} $$ If even 100% is too high a threshold, you can apply some sort of log transformation. Since I first wrote this answer, I noticed elsewhere in this forum that Rob Hyndman (the original author of MASE) proposes a modified version of MASE for non-time series data. See here If $e_j$ denotes a prediction error on the test data, then the scaled errors are $$ q_{j} = \frac{\displaystyle e_{j}}{\displaystyle\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N |Y_i-\bar{Y}|}. $$ where $y_1,\dots,y_N$ denotes the training data. Note here that $Y_{t-1}$ is replaced with $\bar{Y}$. In the time series case, this would mean that the prediction is being compared to the predictions produced by a mean forecast instead of a naive forecast (as it is in the standard formulation of MASE).
