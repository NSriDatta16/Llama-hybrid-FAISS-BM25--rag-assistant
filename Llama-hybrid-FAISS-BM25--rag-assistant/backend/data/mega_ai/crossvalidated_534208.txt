Which class to define as positive in unbalanced classification

In a classification task, why do we usually choose the minority class as "positive" case for response variable? For example, if there are 1000, 9000 for class A and B respectively, we usually define class A as 1 and class B as 0, thus the response variable can have average as 0.1 instead of 0.9. If the response variable has average like 0.6 or 0.7, will there be any issues for the classification algorithm? Do we need to choose the class with average 0.4 or 0.3 as positive class? Thanks in advance!
