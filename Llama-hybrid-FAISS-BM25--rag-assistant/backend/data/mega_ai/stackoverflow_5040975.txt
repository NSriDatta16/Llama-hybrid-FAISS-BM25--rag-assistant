Questions What kind of database are we talking about? Is it a Multi-T size or just a few G? How much data is in it? How are constraints defined? How quick should this be done? How long do your tests take? (a few days or a few weeks) How much storage is available? How much updates are made during a test? What version database do you have? Suggestions If you have plenty storage and not very many updates, try a flashback database. If you are testing on copies of the prod database, use cloning (and of course, data masking) (also a good test for the prod backup). If you have a nice test database with valuable test data in it, use backup/restore. If you have a version 11g database, configured with a physical standby database, you could try to test on a snapshot database.
