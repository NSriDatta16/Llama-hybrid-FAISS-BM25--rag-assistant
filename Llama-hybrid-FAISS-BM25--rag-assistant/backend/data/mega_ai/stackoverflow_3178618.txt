If you are using the load balancing built into Windows, then there are several options for how the load is distributed. The servers keep in communication with each other and organise the load between themselves. The most scalable option is to evenly balance the requests across all of the servers. This means that each request could end up being processed by a different server so a common practice is to use "sticky sessions". These are tied to the user's IP address, and make sure that all requests from the same user go to the same server. There is no way to share static variables across multiple servers so you will need to store the value in a database or on another server. If you find an out of process to host session state (such as stateserver or sql server) then you can process any request on any server. Viewstate allows the server to recreate most of the data needed that generated the page.
