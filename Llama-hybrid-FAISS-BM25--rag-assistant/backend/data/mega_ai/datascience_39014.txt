I was stuck in a similar problem while working with glove. Assuming that you have a dataset in text form, from which you want to collect the topmost 100000 words, you'll have to make a list of those words. In the glove file, each embedding is on a separate line, with each line starting with the word itself and then the embedding. You'll have to write a code to compare your list of words with the words in glove file and extract the lines which make a hit. Have a look here for example code .
