Assuming VSM = Vector Space Model, you can go about a simple retrieval system in the following manner: Create a Document Term Matrix of your collection/corpus Create a function for your similarity measure (Jaccard, Euclidean, etc.). There are packages available with these functions. RSiteSearch should help in finding them. Convert your query to a Document Term Matrix (which will have 1 row and is mapped using the same dictionary as used for the first step) Compute similarity with the query and the matrix from the first step. Rank the results and choose the top n. A non-R method is to use the GINI index on a text column (rows are documents) of a table in PostgreSQL. Using the ts_vector querying methods, you can have a very fast retrieval system.
