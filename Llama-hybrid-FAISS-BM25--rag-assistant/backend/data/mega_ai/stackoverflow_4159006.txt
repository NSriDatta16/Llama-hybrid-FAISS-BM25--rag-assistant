How can I convert a batch of Mavenized examples into a format that Eclipse understands?

I'm in the process of looking at taking some examples that are currently in one format (NOT Mavenized - actually in ANT form) and trying to find an automated way to munge them into something that Eclipse can comprehend. Though I have several years of Java and other odd languages, doing this in Java sounds like using a sledgehammer to drive a nail. I've been looking into scripting languages such as Ruby, Python, Perl, and so on. I have no experience with any of them, but would be happy to learn. How can I take an example in one format (directory or directory with files) and restructure it into something approximating an Eclipse project? For example, I'd like to take a tree with the following structure dir my_example - build.xml - deployment.xml - jboss-esb-unfiltered.xml - log4j.xml - readme.txt and convert it to dir1 my_example_eclipse - dir src - [empty] - dir esbcontent - dir META-INF - deployment.xml - jboss-esb-unfiltered.xml - log4j.xml - readme.txt In addition, I need the ability to create certain hidden files that Eclipse needs. One of these is the .project file like this: helloworld org.eclipse.jdt.core.javabuilder org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.builder org.eclipse.wst.validation.validationbuilder org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.nature org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature org.eclipse.wst.common.modulecore.ModuleCoreNature org.eclipse.jem.workbench.JavaEMFNature How would I create a text file with one of these scripting languages? Thanks in advance.
