Filter other Select Options when an option is selected

This is a problem I'm having in actionscript, but just as easily applies to Javascript or Jquery. Basically, I have 3 select boxes, e.g.: Red Blue Green 1 2 3 A B C When a color is chosen - I want the size and type to filter out only those which are available for that color. Further, when a user then chooses a size, the type should reduce further, and the color should also be filtered according to the size. I've been wrestling with this problem for awhile, and have yet to find an elegant solution for it. Does anybody have any clues for an approach?
