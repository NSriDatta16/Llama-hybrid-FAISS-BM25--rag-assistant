"Points of view" in the object model

We have two domain types: Users and Locations . We have a method on the LocationRepository : GetUserLocations() . The existing implementation: var user = UserRepository.GetUser(userId); var locations = LocationRepository.GetUserLocations(userId); To me it makes more sense to retrieve the locations associated with a user from the User type i.e.: var user = UserRepository.GetUser(userId); var locations = user.GetLocations(); I think the latter implementation reads more cleanly and as an API client I have to deal with fewer types (i.e. the LocationRepository is not required). On the other hand, there will be more code to maintain as I have to write the "facade" to the LocationRepository . Should I act on my instinct and create a facade on the User type to the LocationRepository , or should I be happy with the status quo and live with a sequence diagram that "feels" wrong to me (i.e. retrieval of the location information feels like it is being retrieved from the wrong "point of view")?
