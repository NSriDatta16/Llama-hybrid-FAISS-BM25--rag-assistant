Set flags (variables) for each group of validations. Initiate the flag at 0. Set the flag to 1, when validation is complete for the group. When the user pops the button, if all flags are 1, popup the window. The callback that Jon mentioned would solve the problem of "what do you do if they are not yet all validated?" EDIT: Added after clarification: Have you considered adding the popup button, via DOM methods (easy) (or innerHTML, if you like), after everything is validated? That way, there is no option shown before its time. :D Also, do you test if a popup is blocked? If it is, you could branch to either a notice to the user that their blocker is blocking the editor; or to loading your editor into an iframe automatically; or to loading the editor to the main page via DOM methods (appending documentFragment, etc.). Some blockers give users the option to block even popups generated from clicking on links (which were traditionally off limits to blockers). I would think you would benefit from some kind of a backup method, or at least a warning system in place regardless. HTH
