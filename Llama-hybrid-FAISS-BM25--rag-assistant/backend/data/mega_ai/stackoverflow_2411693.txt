take a snapshop of a qgraphicsview

I am using Qt 4.5 and a qgraphicsscene/view to show video to the user. I would like to provide a "take a snapshop" button and I am sure that there is a pretty straightforward way much simpler of everything I am thinking about. How can I do this elegantly? BTW, the code is here : http://gitorious.org/handy
