You're saying it shows up in the Organizer, but not in the "Overview" list in Xcode? Are you perhaps still running the 4.0 SDK, and does it show up with a "yellow light" in the Organizer along with the error message like "this device's firmware is too new for me"? If so, updating to the 4.1 SDK should fix your problem.
