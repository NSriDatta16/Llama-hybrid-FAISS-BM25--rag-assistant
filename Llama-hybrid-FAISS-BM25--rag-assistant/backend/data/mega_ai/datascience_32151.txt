Intuition behind the fact that SVM uses only measure of similarity between examples for classification

I have read about SVM and although I did not understand the math behind it completly, I know that it produces decision plane with maximum margin between examples of different classes and role of support vectors in the process. I also know that SVM is a kind of dual learing algorithm(algorithms that operate only using the dot product between examples). It uses kernel functions to calculate dot product(measure of similarity) between training examples. What I want to understand in simple terms is that: Suppose I have a similarity matrix of all training examples specifying amount of similary between any(all) two examples in training sample. How Can I make a classifier or cluster based only on this information?
