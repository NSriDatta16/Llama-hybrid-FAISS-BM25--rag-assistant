Good options have been given, another obvious answer is to use the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer : Now you can keep your password either as a property in a properties file (which you might create during deployment if you don't want to have it in the SCM) or as a System Property (which will hopefully also be beyond reach of other developers). Clarification: create during deployment is somewhat vague. I guess you will have to write an installer that generates the properties file dynamically on the end user's machine, probably coupled with a sign up / log in mechanism. EDIT: I still haven't figured out who you are hiding the information from. Two theories: a) People who have access to your source code b) Your customers If it's a), then go my way. All other ways can easily be breached by the other developer just starting your application with a debugger (and suddenly he's inside the datasource object and sees the password). If it's b), then you have no chance, basically. The customer has tons of possibilities to get at your password: debuggers, agents, bytecode manipulation, loadtime weaving etc. Even if he doesn't do any of that, he will just have to attach a port sniffer to get at the password in clear text. The only safe thing to do is have a username / password per customer (never store a global password at your customer's machine).
