Lesser known string similarity metrics

This may be a hard question to answer but I'm researching something and I was wondering if anyone knew of "lesser known" string similarity metrics (see this page for examples of well-known ones). I've been to wikipedia and Sourceforge has a nice library called Simmetrics with a bunch of string metric algorithms . Has anyone done some research or has found some string algorithm that called your attention as not much used? Thank you.
