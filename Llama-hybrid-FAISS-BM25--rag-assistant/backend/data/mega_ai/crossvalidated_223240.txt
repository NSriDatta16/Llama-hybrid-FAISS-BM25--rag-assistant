In general, an example from the sample set is an input. :) This means that since you represent samples with $d$ units of data, your network will have $d+1$ input units: $d$ for the sample you want to process with the net, and one additional for the bias unit (that is always equal to $1$). When you train the network, you do it with respect to all the samples in the training set. You may use Gradient Descent, or a metaheuristic optimization algorithm such as Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, etc. I've never worked with auto associative neural networks, so I don't know if there are specific ways to train this particular type of networks, but you can always start with traditional approaches and go for more complex if they turn insufficiently good. I hope I helped a bit. :)
