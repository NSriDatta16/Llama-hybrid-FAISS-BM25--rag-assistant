Here are some good resources: JFace databinding on eclipse wiki (incl. tutorial) The FAQ which links to some snippets An example that shows databinding with a ListViewer I do not think, there's a major difference between JFace databinding in eclipse 3.4 and 3.5. The concepts are still the same (ISWTObservables, etc). Edit Lars Vogel demonstrates an observable Listviewer with the following code: // Define the viewer viewer = new ListViewer(parent); viewer.setContentProvider(new ObservableListContentProvider()); List persons = new ArrayList (); // Just for testing we create sample data createExampleData(persons); input = new WritableList(persons, Person.class); // Set the writeableList as input for the viewer viewer.setInput(input); The introduction encourages that this works with TreeViewers aswell. The Content provider you need it org.eclipse.jface.databinding.viewers.ObservableListTreeContentProvider . It's a bit more complicated, because you need a list factory and a TreeStructureAdvisor to construct this content provider. That's all help I can provide. Didn't find an example either and didn't use databinding with tree viewers so far. So from now on the JFace API doc has to be your friend ;)
