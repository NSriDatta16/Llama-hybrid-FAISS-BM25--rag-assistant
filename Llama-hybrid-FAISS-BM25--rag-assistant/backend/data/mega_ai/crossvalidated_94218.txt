Standard deviation of normalized data

I have a data set $y_i$ (where the $y_i$ are photon counts in time period $i$ , $i=1,2,\ldots,n$ , assumed Poisson), with an estimated standard error $s_i$ ( $=\sqrt{y_i}$ ) for each count. For some reason, I normalize the data set by the average count rate $\bar y$ . $$\bar y = \frac{\sum y_i}{N}$$ where $y_i$ has $i=1,\ldots,N$ The standard deviation of $\bar y$ is calculated as $\sqrt{\frac{\sum (y_i - \bar y)^2}{N-1}}$ To normalize I simply do: $z_i = \frac{y_i}{\bar y}$ At this point how do I calculate the standard error for the $z_i$ ? Is error propagation the right thing? $\text{se}(z_i) = z_i \times \sqrt{\left(\frac{s_i}{y_i}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\text{se}(\bar y)}{\bar y}\right)^2}$ It seems to me that the error stay of the same order as before, while the count rates increase their value about one magnitude. So I am probably missing something. So, if I print the ratio of the count rate values divided by their standard deviation, before the normalization, I obtain: [ 1.06904497 1.07222193 -0.306786 2.22599555 5.04049535 10.44367859 10.37041246 4.71728177 10.85418506 10.99314159 10.18889392 9.20449287 13.24244513 10.70825227 15.64406957 15.41271307 10.06729494 12.88619079 14.76416192 3.90199486 13.33680974 11.57703491 9.38122633 11.53686373 13.32397254 -0.78308901] And after the normalization (plus error propagation): [ 2.27976751e+00 2.29330204e+00 1.88194867e-01 9.79928633e+00 4.80280889e+01 1.74659904e+02 1.72699185e+02 4.23542991e+01 1.85693431e+02 1.89443907e+02 1.67854381e+02 1.41988475e+02 2.50472302e+02 1.81762548e+02 3.14047817e+02 3.08069283e+02 1.64619984e+02 2.40831046e+02 2.91120670e+02 2.94284485e+01 2.53020286e+02 2.05263389e+02 1.46572585e+02 2.04172711e+02 2.52673822e+02 1.69702062e+02 2.48534464e+01 1.65477547e+01 4.12770323e+00 4.47260177e-01 1.22474257e+00] Any suggestion really appreciated. PS: Sorry if the formulas are not well displayed, I don't know how to set the "formula" environment.
