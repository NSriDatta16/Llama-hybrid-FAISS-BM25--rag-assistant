Coloring the verbatim like environment?

This is a screen capture from Pragmatic Bookshelf book. http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/3168/screenshot20100717at123.png It looks like that the verbatim environment with the coloring, but I'm not sure. How can one can use color for verbatim like environment as is shown? Using line by line method would be a solution, but I expect a better way to go. {\color{red}\begin{verbatim} line 1 line 2 \end{verbatim} } \color{blue}{\begin{verbatim} line 3 line 4 \end{verbatim}}
