C: Using a select call, when I am reading, how do I keep track of the data?

First of all, I've never worked with C before (mostly Java which is the reason you'll find me write some naive C code). I am writing a simple command interpreter in C. I have something like this: //Initialization code if (select(fdmax+1, &read_fds, NULL, NULL, NULL) == -1) { perror("Select dead"); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } .... .... //Loop through connections to see who has the data ready //If the data is ready if ((nbytes = recv(i, buf, sizeof(buf), 0)) > 0) { //Do something with the message in the buffer } Now if I'm looking at something like a long paragraph of commands, it is obvious that a 256 byte buffer will not be able to get the entire command. For the time being, I'm using a 2056 byte buffer to get the entire command. But if I want to use the 256 byte buffer, how would I go about doing this? Do I keep track of which client gave me what data and append it to some buffer? I mean, use something like two dimensional arrays and such?
