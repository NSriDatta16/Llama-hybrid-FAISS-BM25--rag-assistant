Polynomial Regression sensible in case with 6 cross-sectional points of experience?

I have a dataset of 300 cases of police students, spread over 6 semesters. They all filled out a survey at the same time (cross section), thus their experience is interval scaled since semester 1 means approximately 6 months of studies and every further semester has each 6 additional months. I have an integrity measure (7-point Likert scale) and found out, that integrity is lower for those in 2nd and 5th semester (which are practical semesters). Edit: I calculated an aggregated value over 11 situations which are judged on a 7-point Likert scale. I calculated a stepwise polynomial regression and came to the conclusion, that one with a 4th degree fits the data best. Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.77130 -0.31675 -0.02838 0.34768 1.50143 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 7.94414 0.85978 9.240 $data_crosssection_complete.SEM -4.44345 1.41442 -3.142 0.00185 ** I(data$ data_crosssection_complete.SEM^2) 2.18171 0.72026 3.029 0.00267 ** I(data $data_crosssection_complete.SEM^3) -0.42178 0.14460 -2.917 0.00380 ** I(data$ data_crosssection_complete.SEM^4) 0.02807 0.01001 2.804 0.00538 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 0.5719 on 297 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.03747, Adjusted R-squared: 0.02451 F-statistic: 2.891 on 4 and 297 DF, p-value: 0.0226 Thing is, I am not sure, if I am allowed to do that. My doctor mother has not worked with polynomial regression, so she can't help me and suggested I should find studies which used one, preferably in the field of organisational psychology (am still searching). And she said the variance is too small, which I am not sure, what that means in my case. Is it that I only have 6 fixed points? How could I work around this? Edit: Here are my boxplots:
