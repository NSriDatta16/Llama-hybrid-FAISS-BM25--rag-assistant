terminology for the opposite of annotated?

I have a dataset which is annotated, used both for training and testing. And I have another dataset which is not annotated, used for production. Currently I call them AnnotatedDataset and UnannotatedDataset . I am looking for a better term for UnannotatedDataset (simply calling it Dataset is not the answer that I am looking for, because I want to be explicit here).
