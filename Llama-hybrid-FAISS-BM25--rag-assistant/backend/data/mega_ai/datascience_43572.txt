Mercer's Theorem and infinite-dimensional spaces aren't used directly. It justifies use of things like the Gaussian kernel in SVMs. Mercer's theorem says this kernel is just an inner product in some other space, but we need not figure out what that space is, or a mapping to it. The fact that it exists is essential to proving that the SVM still works.
