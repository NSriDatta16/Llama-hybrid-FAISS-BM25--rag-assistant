Perhaps it is because you've declared E as something that extends Enum . I can't say I understand it completely, but it looks like it limits the set of types to some subset that can't include LogEvent.Type for some reason. Or maybe it's just a bug in the compiler. I'd be happy if someone could explain it more clearly, but here is what you can do: public > void postEvent(E code) { if (code instanceof LogEvent.Type) { LogEvent.Type scode = (LogEvent.Type)code; ... } ... This works and it is more elegant than just casting to an Object.
