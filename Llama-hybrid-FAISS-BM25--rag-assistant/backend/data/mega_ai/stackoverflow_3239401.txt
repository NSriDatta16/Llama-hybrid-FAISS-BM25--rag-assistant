I would use memcache to store your sessions. It will be much faster than storing them in a database or disk. Database storage is good but you will need more databases when your site becomes very high traffic. Sessions on disk will also cause a lot of IO issues when your site gets a lot of traffic. Memcache on the other hand scales much better than a DB and files. I personally use memecache and the sites i work on get millions of hits a day. I have never had any issues with storing sessions in memcache.
