For forecasting low frequency variables with high frequency you can use MIDAS regression. The idea behind this regression is quite simple, average the high-frequency variable and then use it as a regressor. The key is to use custom weights. Suppose we have $Y_t$ which is sampled monthly and $X_\tau$, which is sampled daily. Then MIDAS regression is defined as follows: $$Y_t=\sum_{h=0}^k\beta_hX_{tm-h}+\varepsilon_t$$ where we assume that for observation $t=s$ we have $m$ observations $\tau=sm-m+1,...,sm$. We also assume that $\beta_h=g(h,\theta)$, for some function $g$ and hyperparameter $\theta$. So if you want to test out whether the $X_\tau$ is a good predictor for $Y_t$, fit a MIDAS regression with different weight functions and inspect the results. If you enter MIDAS regression into google you'll find many articles. Forecasting monthly CPI with daily variable was investigated in the article "Forecasting with mixed frequencies" by Armesto, Engemann and Owyang. The MIDAS regression idea was introduced by Eric Ghysels , you can look into his articles. There are two software packages for fitting MIDAS regression: MIDAS Matlab toolbox and midasr R package . They both have user guides, where you can find more detailed examples and links to other literature. Note, this is only one possible way of solving your problem. Others surely exist too, but as I am the developer of midasr R package, I am biased in my suggestions.
