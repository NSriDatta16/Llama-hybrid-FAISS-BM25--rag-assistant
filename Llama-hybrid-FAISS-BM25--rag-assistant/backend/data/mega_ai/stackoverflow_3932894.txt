RowCommand in GridView raises multiple events on click

A nice good afternoon from Germany, I have a asp:GridView and ButtonFields on the row with a RowCommand event. protected void gridView_RowCommand(object sender, GridViewCommandEventArgs e) { switch (e.CommandName) { case "FirstButton": this.DoSomething(); break; case "SecondButton": this.DoSomethingElse(); break; } this.BindDataGrid(); } My Problem is in over 90% of all cases when I cklick on a ButtonField this event get's raised twice. The Problem with this is after I execute the this.DoSomething() or this.DoSomethingElse() the specific Line can't get executed agan. thx Marc
