I've never used Maven to build server-side Axis2 code. Web services (.aar files) generated for Axis2 are designed to be deployed under the "services" subdirectory of the Axis2 web application. Each service will then leverage jars that exist on the web apps classloader. The Axis2 project is built using ANT meaning it only has redimentary maven support (Module jars are published to Maven central). Version 1.5 changed these modules to reflect different logical groups of jars. If it's any help, here is a Groovy client that uses the Axis2 maven jars.
