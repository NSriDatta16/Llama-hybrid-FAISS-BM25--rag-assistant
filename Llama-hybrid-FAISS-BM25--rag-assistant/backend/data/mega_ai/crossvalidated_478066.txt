Collecting my comments into an answer: we have several options; which is best depend on what your goals are, and what the data mean. There's no enough information in the question to say which is most correct. Use a rnn model such as an lstm network or gru network. Sequence-based NNs are not restricted to fixed-length inputs. Use a CNN network. This network will either (a) pad all inputs to the same length of input, or else (b) reduce the CNN output to a fixed length before fully-connected layers yield the predicted output. Use a fully-connected network. This either (a) pads all of the inputs to the same length, and then proceeds as usual or (b) uses some more ornate kind of pre-processing to create a fixed-length vectors and proceeds as any fully-connected network does. Importantly, the fact that the data are binary does not enter into any of these suggestions, so we can consider them as generic options for any usage where one is interested in classifying sequences of data with varied lengths.
