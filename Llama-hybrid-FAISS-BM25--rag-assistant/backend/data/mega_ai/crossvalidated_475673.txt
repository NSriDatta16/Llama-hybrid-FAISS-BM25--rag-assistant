Why does the GAN paper make the assumption that $G(Z) = X$?

There exists crucial assumption in one (several) proof of the GAN paper that doesn't really make sense to me. Let $X \sim p_{data}$ be the random variable associated with the input data, and $Z \sim p_{Z}$ be the random variable associated random noise. Note that they are written with bold letter in the paper e.g. $\mathbf{x}$ . In the computation of the optimal discriminator , in Proposition 1, the paper found that, https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf $$D^{*}(X) = \frac{p_{data}(X)}{p_{data}(X) + p_{g}(X)}$$ where $p_{g}(X)$ is the probability distribution of the output of the random noise to the generator, $G(Z).$ However, to make this calculation work, the paper makes the key assumption that $X = G(Z) \sim p_g$ . That is, the random variable associated with the data $X$ is the same random variable as $G(Z)$ . However, in my opinion this is not true. First, while $G(Z)$ represents a random variable takes on value in the same space as the data, they are is not exactly the same space. This means, $X: \Omega_1 \to \mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ , but $G(Z): \Omega_2 \to \mathcal{Y} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ , where $\mathcal{Y}$ could be a super or subset of $\mathcal{X}$ . Furthermore, the sample spaces $\Omega_1, \Omega_2$ associated with the two random variables may differ as well. All this is to say that the random variables $X$ , $G(Z)$ are not the same, hence we cannot make the argument that $G(Z) = X$ , and proceed to calculate the optimal discriminator as shown in Proposition 1. Also, at the notation level this is also troublesome, because $X \sim p_{data}$ is the random variable representing the data, but now $X \sim p_g$ as well. All the above problems can be solved by denoting $G(Z)$ using a different random variable, say $X^\prime = G(Z)$ . But the authors did not make this decision. Therefore, I don't understand how equation (3) is derived. Can anyone help me with this question?
