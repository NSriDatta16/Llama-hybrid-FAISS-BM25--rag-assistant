arXiv is, unfortunately, not widely used in machine learning. You could peruse recent volumes of the Journal of Machine Learning Research for free. It's one of the better journals in the field and entirely open access. Top conferences like NIPS, ICML, IJCNN, KDD, ... also have freely accessible proceedings which contain some of the most influential publications.
