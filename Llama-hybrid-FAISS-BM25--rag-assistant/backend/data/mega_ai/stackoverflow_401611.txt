Your control key is stuck. Do not press control key when dragging controls. I drag controls from form control to tab page controls all the time no problem. Answer #1 is totally correct. You can use the Document Outline window and move the controls to the tab page one by one by dragging tree nodes. The hardest problem is retaining control locations on the tab page.
