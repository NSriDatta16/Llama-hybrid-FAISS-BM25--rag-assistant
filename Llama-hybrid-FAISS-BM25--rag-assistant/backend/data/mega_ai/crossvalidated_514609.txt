Proving statistical significance in the number of games won against another team

I trained a reinforcement learning agent to learn a collaborative game played in teams. Then I let it play against another team and now I want to prove that a) the number of games won differs significantly from 50 % (meaning that the result of the games is not just random) and b) that one team won significantly more games than the other team. Could you please give me an input on which statistical tests to use in order to prove statistical significance? And also how you would set up these tests?
