Popularity of Bayesian methods in statistics and machine learning

I know I have seen some research, perhaps in the contexts of time-varying topic models, on the popularity of Bayesian methods in statistics and machine learning over the last 20 years. Unfortunately I cannot seem to find the citation. Does anybody know a paper that includes a plot over time of the popularity of Bayesian methods in published statistics and machine learning journals?
