How to define anything that extends this trait

Refer to the following code snippet: trait Fruit { val color:String def == (fruit:Fruit) = this.color == fruit.color } case class Orange(color:String) extends Fruit case class Apple(color:String) extends Fruit As expected, Orange("red") == Orange("red") is true . However, I would like to enforce that only the same type of fruits can be compared, so for instance Orange("red") == Apple("red") should give an error. Can we enforce this in the signature of == in trait Fruit in an elegant way? EDIT: I want the error to be caught at compile time, not at runtime.
