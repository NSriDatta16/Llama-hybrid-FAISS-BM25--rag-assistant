You should use the QDialogButtonBox::button() method, to get the button of the corresponding role . For instance : QPushButton* pOkButton = pButtonBox->button(QDialogButtonBox::Ok); QPushButton* pCancelButton = pButtonBox->button(QDialogButtonBox::Cancel); // and so on... Generally speaking, I would say it's a bad idea to find a button from it's text, as this text might change when you app is internationalized.
