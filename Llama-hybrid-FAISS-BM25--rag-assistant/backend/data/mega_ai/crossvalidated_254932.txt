If $x_i$ is outside the unit interval, the log-likelihood is negative infinity. That's defined. It's not like this is an expectation or something, where we say it isn't defined if it's infinite. You might prefer writing this as a piecewise function, or just restricting your attention/assuming your data are all on the unit interval.
