Are relations necessary in mysql / phpmyadmin

I can create relations/foreign keys in phpmyadmin/mysql. My question is...is it necessary? Is it mainly just for my flow-chart / organization / notes..or does it actually help the database in performance? Also, when I export the database to an sql file, I don't see mention of the relations anywhere...how would mysql recover them if I reloaded the database from this file? Thanks
