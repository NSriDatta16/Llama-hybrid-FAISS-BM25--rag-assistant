Expected Value of an ARMA-GARCH Model

An ARMA(p,q) model is given by $ \qquad \qquad Y_t = c + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{p}\varphi_iY_{t-i}+\sum\limits_{i=1}^{q}\theta_i\varepsilon_{t-i} + \varepsilon$ with $\varepsilon_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ . Let's say our model is simply an ARMA(1,1) model. The expected value for tomorrow's forecast then is $\qquad \qquad E[Y_{t+1}] = E[c+\varphi_1Y_t+\theta_1\varepsilon_t + \varepsilon_{t+1}]$ $\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad = c+\varphi_1Y_t+\theta_1\varepsilon_t + E[\varepsilon_{t+1}]$ $\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad = c+\varphi_1Y_t+\theta_1\varepsilon_t$ with $Y_t$ being our time series. Correct so far? Now, a GARCH(p,q) model is given by $\qquad \qquad X_t = \sigma_t\varepsilon_t$ $\qquad \qquad \sigma_t^2=\omega + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{q}\alpha_iX_{t-i}^2+\sum\limits_{i=1}^{p}\beta_i\sigma_{t-i}^2$ with $\varepsilon_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ again and with $X_t$ being our time series here right? Now my questions arise when looking at an ARMA(n,m)-GHARCH(p,q) model: $\qquad \qquad Y_t = c + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\varphi_iY_{t-i}+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{m}\theta_jX_{t-j}+X_t$ . I understand that $X_t$ ist the underlying time series of the garch model, but isn't that simply the time series we are looking at and trying to just fit to a GARCH-Model? Next, when looking at tomorrow's expected value from the ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) model, it is $\qquad \qquad E[Y_{t+1}] = ... = c+\varphi_1Y_t+\theta_1X_t + E[X_{t+1}]$ $\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad = c+\varphi_1Y_t+\theta_1X_t + E[\sigma_{t+1}\varepsilon_{t+1}]$ $\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad = c+\varphi_1Y_t+\theta_1X_t + E[\sigma_{t+1}]E[\varepsilon_{t+1}]$ $\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad = c+\varphi_1Y_t+\theta_1X_t + E[\sigma_{t+1}]*0$ $\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad = c+\varphi_1Y_t+\theta_1X_t $ Aren't $X_t$ and $Y_t$ basically the same time series were we tried to apply these models to? And where is $\sigma^2$ now, I thought our goal was to use tomorrow's forecasted variance in our combined model. Thanks in advance for reading and taking your time.
