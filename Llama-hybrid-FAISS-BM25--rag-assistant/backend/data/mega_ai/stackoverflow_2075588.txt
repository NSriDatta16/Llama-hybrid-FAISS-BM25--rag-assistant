SMTP server response: 451

I've build 2 contact forms (quote.php and contact.php), validated with jquery and submitted with to separate ajax_contact.php and ajax_quote.php files. They've both been built on the same template I've used on other sites, but for some reason the ajax_contact.php is returning this error: Warning: mail() [function.mail]: SMTP server response: 451 See http://pobox.com/~djb/docs/smtplf.html. in D:\Hosting\5219056\html\ajax_contact.php on line 41 I'm getting the autoresponder email, but not the email that actually contains the data submitted in the form. I'm literally at my wit's end with this. Been trying to fix it all day with "\r\n" and "\n", which I thought would fix it according to the error, but am still in the same boat. Here is ajax_contact.php: Firstname: $Firstname Lastname: $Lastname Email: $email Business: $Business Address: $Address City: $City State: $State Zip: $Zip Phone: $Phone Fax: $Fax Comments: $Comments "; // To send HTML mail, the Content-type header must be set $headers =3D "MIME-Version: 1.0" . "\r\n"; $headers .=3D "Content-type: text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1" . "\r\n"; // Additional headers $headers .=3D "From: Company " . "= \r\n"; $headers .=3D "Bcc: admin@email.com" . "\r\n"; // send mail and print success message mail($recipientemail, $subject, $message, $headers); echo " windo= w.location.href =3D \"thanks_feedback.php\"; "; ? Here is ajax_quote.php, which is the same thing, just for a different form: Contact Name: $Contactname Business: $Business Email: $email Address: $Address State: $State Zip: $Zip Phone: $Phone Fax: $Fax -- Describe your product(s): $product_desc How many SKU's (items): $sku How many turns per year?: $annualturns Are your products seasonal?: $seasonal Indicate minimum and Maximum pallet levels: $minmaxpallet Average value per pallet: $avgpalletval Weight of a typical pallet: $avgpalletwt Maximum pallet stacking height: $maxpalletht Cases per pallet?

"\r\n"; $headers .= 'Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1' . "\r\n"; // Additional headers $headers .= 'From: Company ' . "\r\n"; $headers .= 'Bcc: admin@email.com' . "\r\n"; // send mail and print success message mail($recipientemail, $subject, $message, $headers); if($autoresponse == "yes") { $autosubject = stripslashes($autosubject); $automessage = stripslashes($automessage); mail($email,"$autosubject","$automessage","From: $recipientname "); } echo " window.location.href = \"thanks_quote.php\"; "; ? Here is ajaxSubmit.php, which doesn't do much: is_valid) { die ("The reCAPTCHA wasn't entered correctly. Go back and try it again." . "(reCAPTCHA said: " . $resp->error . ")"); } $isValidate = true; // RETURN TRUE FROM VALIDATING, NO ERROR DETECTED /* RETTURN ARRAY FROM YOUR VALIDATION */ /* THIS NEED TO BE IN YOUR FILE NO MATTERS WHAT */ if($isValidate == true){ echo ""; }else{ echo '{"jsonValidateReturn":'.json_encode($arrayError).'}'; // RETURN ARRAY WITH ERROR } ? EDIT: I looked into it a bit more, and it turns out the GoDaddy windows hosting(NOT my choice) doesn't allow the PHP mail function. So I either find a workaround that works(looks like there's a few out there, not many that seem to work), or I get them to switch to Linux hosting(which might fix it).
