Here's a very rough metric: 12 + [number of lines]/1000 - [number of comments]/50 + [number of functions]/100 + [number of pointer variables]/50 + [number of macros]/10 + [number of bitwise operators]/5 + [number of #if[def]s]/3 + [number of function pointers]/2 + [number of pointer casts and unions]/2 - [average variable name length] You get a figure in hours.
