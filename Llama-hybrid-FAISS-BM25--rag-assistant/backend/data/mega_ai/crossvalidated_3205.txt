You might be trying to incorporate too much information into the graphic. The essence of the visualization seems to be the frequency with which units are active more than one day and, possibly, the times at which those units are active. Just to generate ideas--because there are many possible solutions--consider a display that provides a clear graphical distinction between the longer-term units and the shorter-term ones and allows assessments of the frequencies with which these occur. One simple solution is a scatterplot where the contiguous activity of a unit between times $x$ and $x + y$ is indicated by a point at $(x,y)$. Modify one salient characteristic of the point, such as its color, to emphasize the distinction between $y \ge 1$ and $y \lt 1$. Here is a crude illustration: the first plots units on the vertical axis (200 of them), time on the horizontal (75 days; it needs a grid to show the units of time), and unit activities on a gray scale where darker corresponds to longer continuous activity. The second shows similar data as a scatterplot. The latter could be accompanied by a histogram of frequencies. The former ought to have the units sorted vertically by their average length in service.
