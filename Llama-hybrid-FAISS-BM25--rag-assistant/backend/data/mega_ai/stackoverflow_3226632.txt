First of all: intranet win.forms? Are you talking about a ClickOnce WinForms application, an MSIE hosted WinForms application, a WinForms with an embedded web browser, or something even more exotic? I'm going to assume that you actually have a central data store, since otherwise your intranet web interface won't be happening... This really depends on the interfaces to your WCF services (or whatever way you choose to host and interface your service logic). You haven't really described them. Some questions to ponder: Is it a purely data based service, or does it do some user interface processing? The more of the latter, the worse support for Office and web reports simulatenuously... at one extreme, you're going to have to have two versions of each report. And then what happens when you want to add e.g. separate web versions for mobile interfaces? How well can you decouple reports from services? Can the same services support several reports? Are the data interfaces chunky or chatty? Chunky interfaces tend to scale better, but you pay the price with simple queries (since you need to pass more data than most reports need). Do you have user authentication and authorization requirements? Are there reports or data which only some users are allowed to see? Is WinWord and Excel a requirement or legacy? Do users really need editable documents: if not, would the web interface suffice, or a service providing PDF files? Generally speaking, Office integration isn't always the most easily supported option, especially once the next Office version or service pack hits you, or end users start tinkering with their templates... What worries me somewhat is that you let the WCF service know about and even handle the report template files (template directory, introspection interfaces). Why? Wouldn't it be cleaner to have the templates depend only on a data retrieval service? Won't you have that relation with the web reports anyway?
