That's a very generic question, it really depends on your use cases. I'd cite the following: You always need a mutex (or synchronized block) to protect the initial getInstance() call, which can be problematic in some cases. It is a hack to hide the fact that you are creating a global variable, and global variables are generally bad. However, there are many cases where the simplicity that they bring is appreciable, but pay attention not to abuse them.
