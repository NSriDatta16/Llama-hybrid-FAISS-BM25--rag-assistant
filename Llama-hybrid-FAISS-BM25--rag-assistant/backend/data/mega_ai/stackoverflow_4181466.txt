View full website, not mobile version on iPhone

I have a script that detects whether you're an iPhone user or not and redirects to a more iPhone friendly page. if((navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i)) || (navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i))) { location.replace("http://domain.com/iphone/"); } This works great but has one problem. It is convention to offer the user the ability to view the full web page. However, if I link to the root, obviously the redirect is going to send them to the mobile version! Any ideas on how to include if click on the link from /iphone/ , they can go to / and stay there.
