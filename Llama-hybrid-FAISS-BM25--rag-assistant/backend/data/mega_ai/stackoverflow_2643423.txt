There's a concrete example in the Python standard library that persuades me that doctests alone aren't always enough, namely the decimal module. It has over 60000 individual testcases (in Lib/test/decimaltestdata); if all those were rewritten as doctests, the decimal module would become very unwieldy indeed. It's possible the number of tests could be slimmed down whilst still giving good coverage, but many of the numerical algorithms are sufficiently complicated that you need huge numbers of individual tests to cover all possible combinations of branches.
