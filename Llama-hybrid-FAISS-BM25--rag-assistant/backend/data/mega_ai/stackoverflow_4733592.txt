Assert.Inconclusive and IgnoreAttribute

What is the right way to use Assert.Inconclusive and IgnoreAttribute in MS Unit test framework? We are using Assert.Inconclusive mainly for tests which are: Not implemented yet Somehow broken or incomplete = requires futher attention When test body is for any reason commented out We are doing this because: Inconclusive test can have message We want to see such tests in test results on TFS Our problem is that Inconclusive tests are marked as error in both TFS and Resharper. If we use IgnoreAttribute instead we will see these tests in Resharper but MS Test runner and TFS will ignore them at all. Using IgnoreAttribute in TFS and MS Test runner is same like commenting whole test which is useless.
