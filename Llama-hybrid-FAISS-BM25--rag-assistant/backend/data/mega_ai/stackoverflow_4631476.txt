Finally figured this out. WTH! 1.4.2.0 'upgrade'?!? Apparently it missed a bunch of files when it 'upgraded'. I assumed incorrectly that it was working and then tried to use 'design' today under configuration. Whoops. I recommend reading this post . ..And for the favicon error specifically do this: wget http://svn.magentocommerce.com/source/branches/1.4/app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/Model/System/Config/Backend/Image/Favicon.php place Favicon.php relative to where you see it downloading from in your source. (This had nothing to do with my end. All perms correct. I own this system. This was an incomplete upgrade per magento core via connect/pear.) Edit: Or easier if you dont want to keep finding problems (1.4.2.0): Grab source: wget http://www.magentocommerce.com/downloads/assets/1.4.2.0/magento-1.4.2.0.tar.gz untar and change to magento/app/code/core Be careful you copy carefully and understand next step(!) : cp -R * /{your_magento_site}/app/code/core The owner of these files may need to be chowned depending on credentials you copied files as... All needed 'upgrade' files should now be in place.
