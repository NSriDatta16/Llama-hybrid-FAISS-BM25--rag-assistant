This depends on project. Some projects may require fast development and there's no alternatives if deadline is already set and there's no good chance to prolong development. Typical issue: marketing campaign resulting in new service. Such deadline can be enough for normal development, but in some organizations it is so close, that developers work in stress and make many errors that are fixed during production stage. That's a kind of project when developers have to work with topmost effectiveness and they'd better get good reward on success. Some projects are accurately planned and here you can use all analytics you have: history data, some developer's time metrics on subtasks, calculating risks, etc. But anyway MAX time shouldn't be used: its the most inaccurate measure that usually leads to even more time taken. And here's a simple reason: when developer just gives away this MAX, he almost doesn't measure. He just gives away his intuition that has very little info at the time. But if he'll spend at least half an hour he'll understand specifics of his tasks, he even may split it into subtask and increase his accuracy. So you can give developer some bias like "hey, guys, just think in what time you would provide stable code here" but send him measure himself. It is good for a job, it is good for a programmer himself.
