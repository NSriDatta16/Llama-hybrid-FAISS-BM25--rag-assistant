If you don't want to write the WHERE clause, one way is to use a Filter object and add the conditions you want. For example: var sc = new Filter(); sc.Add("Contacttitle", "Sales Agent"); sc.Add("city", "london", Logical.Or); var customers = D2Bk.Fetch(sc, new Customers()); But you don't want to use DAOs (Customers above is such), so you would have to write the SQL statement and specify the where clause: DataSet ds = D2Bk.Fetch("SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Contacttitle=@PAR1 OR City=@PAR2", "Sales Agent", "london");
