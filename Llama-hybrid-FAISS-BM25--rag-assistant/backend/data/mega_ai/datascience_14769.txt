Is there standard parameters that characterize how fast neural network learns to achieve specific error rate?

I want to estimate how fast my model learn. Mb how many learn steps my model need to do to achieve specific error rate(precision/ recall/ MSE/ etc.). Any standard approach for measuring this?
