Licenses and sessions the RESTful way

This question crossed my mind after I read this post: “Common REST Mistakes: Sessions are irrelevant” If sessions are indeed discouraged in a RESTful application. How would you handle licenses in such application. I'm specifically referring to concurrent licenses model and not named licenses. i.e. the customer buys X licenses which means the application may allow up to X users to be logged in simultaneously. Which means that the application must hold a state for current logged in users. I know I can create a resource called licenses, which will set a cookie or generate a unique ID, and then the client will have to send it with every request. But it's the same as creating a session, right? If I'll adopt the stateless approach and ask the client to create an authentication token for every request how will the application know when to consume and release license for that client? Is there an alternative? specifically a more RESTful alternative?
