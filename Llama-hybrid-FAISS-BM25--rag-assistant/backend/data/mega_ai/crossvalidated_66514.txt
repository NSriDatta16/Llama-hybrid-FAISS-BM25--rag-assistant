Is alpha cumulated in ordinal regression?

My outcome is an ordinal variable having 4 levels. I did an ordinal regression and get one universal beta-coefficient describing each level change. If I do 3 logistic regressions on each level change, I would have an alpha-error of 3 * 5% (multiple testing) My question: Is there such a cumulation of alpha error in ordinal regression models (proportional odds or continuation ratio), too?
