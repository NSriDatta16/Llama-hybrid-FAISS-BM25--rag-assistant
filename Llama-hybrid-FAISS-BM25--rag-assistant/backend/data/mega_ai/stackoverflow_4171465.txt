Truncate NSTextView?

I tried using defaultParagraphStyle, but I can't seem to get a NSTextView (programmatically added) to truncate text with an ellipsis (...). I am setting the frame during the initWithFrame (150, 20) and I also set the maxSize (150,20). However, text simply overflows. If I set the height where half a line is visible, I can see the top half of the text, however I would like to see the text truncated with ellipsis instead. How can I do this?
