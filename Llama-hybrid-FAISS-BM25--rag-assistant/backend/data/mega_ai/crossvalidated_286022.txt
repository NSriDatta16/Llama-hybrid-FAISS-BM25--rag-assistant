The first part of your question is very closely related to this question ( How to choose the number of hidden layers and nodes in a feedforward neural network? ). However, keep in mind that mostly, you figure out the layers and unit amount through trial and error. Once you have found a suitable network architecture, you get on with the optimizer - you don't want your network to overfit the data for example. This part is related to reduce over/under fitting, but also making training faster by initialising your weights correctly. A list of gradient optimization algorithms . Ofcoures, you can always change the number of layers/units at any given time after that.
