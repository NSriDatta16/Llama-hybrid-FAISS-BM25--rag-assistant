Access Adobe InDesign files

I need some directions for the following problem: I have a lot of InDesign files and i have to setup a process that will track if a certain paragraph or text block has changed between diferent versions of the file. If the text block has changed i want to extract that text block in a "portable" format (html, pdf, txt). Is there an Adobe product that would do that ? Is there any public API to access an InDesign file ? Is there the posibility to export InDesign to, say, html ?
