Nominal and non-dichotomous variables

I am having problems analysing baseline data for my study population. My variables are erection dysfunction severity (mild, moderate and severe) and type of erection dysfunction (organic ED and psychogenic ED). I want to know the percentage of mild, moderate and severe ED in both groups (organic and psychogenic) and whether the difference is significant. Since the erection severity variable is non-dichotomous I cannot use chi square and Fisher's exact test. Please advise me which test I can use.
