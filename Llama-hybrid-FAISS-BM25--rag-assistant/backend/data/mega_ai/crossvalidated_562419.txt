James-Stein estimator with multiple samples

Let $X_1, \dots, X_n \in \mathbb{R}^p$ be i.i.d. samples from the $p$ -normal distribution $N(\theta, \tau^2 I)$ . Suppose we are interested in estimating $\theta$ with known variance $\tau^2$ . Take the loss to be squared error. Define the estimator $\delta(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ . Is there someway to prove that a suitably constructed estimator $\tilde{\delta}(\bar{X})$ will never be dominated by $\delta(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ , for the sample mean $\bar{X} = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i / n$ ? Some facts that might be helpful: The sample mean $\bar{X}$ is sufficient for $\theta$ The loss is convex I ask because often texts will only focus on the $n=1$ case when talking about the e.g. James-Stein estimator, suggesting that some averaging has occurred beforehand.
