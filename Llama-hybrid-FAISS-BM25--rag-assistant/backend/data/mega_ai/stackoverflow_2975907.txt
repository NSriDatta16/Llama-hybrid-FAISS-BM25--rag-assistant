Upcasting ServiceContract

I have a WCF service, which exposes many methods. My application consumes this service, and ServiceContract includes OperationContract definitions for only some of methods. To cut to the question, consider following code example: [ServiceContract] public interface IServer { [OperationContract] void BasicOperation(); } [ServiceContract] public interface IExtendedServer : IServer { [OperationContract] void ExtendedOperation(); } I would like to make contracts so that application has extension capability. In other words, I'd like to be able to use IServer contract everywhere, but to allow plugin-like architecture to extend basic contract interface, so that plugin itself can call ExtendedOperation() operation contract. So, how do I structure my code, or, what changes do I have to make, in order to be able to do something like following? (channel is of type IServer) ((IExtendedServer)channel).ExtendedOperation() When I attempt to do this, I get error System.InvalidCastException : Unable to cast transparent proxy to type 'Contract.IExtendedServer'. I hope I wasn't confusing...
