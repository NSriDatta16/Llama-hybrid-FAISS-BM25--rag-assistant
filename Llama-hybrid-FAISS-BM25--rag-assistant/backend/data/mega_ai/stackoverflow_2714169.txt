As you thought you can achieve this in the moveEvent function. I guess the following code do the trick but since I have nothing to test here I will write some pseudo code: First get the available screen area: const QRect screen = QApplication::availableGeometry(this); // This get the screen rect where you can drag a dialog Then get the position of your dialog relative to the desktop (if your dialog is a child of an other widget, you need to transform coordinates from widget relative to desktop relative): const QRect dialog = geometry(); // Do here transformation Now test if dialog is near screen border if( abs(dialog.left()-screen.left() Let me know if it works
