You can trivially write your own. bool LongCircuitAnd( bool term1, bool term2 ) { return term1 && term2; } bool Func3(int x, int y, int z, int q){ return LongCircuitAnd( Func1(x,y), Func2(z,q) ); And if you want to be very fancy, you could even inline it!!! Okay, Okay, if you really really don't want the terrible overhead of calling a function. bool Func3(int x, int y, int z, int q){ return ((int)Func1(x,y)) * ((int)Func2(z,q)); But I don't consider that elegant. It its conceivable that an overly smart compiler could short circuit this...
