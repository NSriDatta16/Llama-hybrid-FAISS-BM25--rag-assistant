Update action from Index controller

What is the best practice for organizing Show, Update, Create and Delete within the MVC? I'd like to perform an update action from the index controller and before I commit any time to it I'd like to consider this. Basically I want users to be able to tag articles from the index. Is it a bad practice to do an update action from the index? What are some things I need to consider? update This is in fact an update action, because I have constructed a HABTM association between to models with a join table. I'm simply looking for design thoughts on performing an update action from the Index. Thank you.
