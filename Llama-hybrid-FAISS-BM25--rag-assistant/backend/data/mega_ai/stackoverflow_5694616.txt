How could random functions be really random?

Introduction I know I'm going to lose a lot of reputation for this question and I also know it will be flagged as inappropriate but I'm really curious about that so I'm not giving up if there's any chance I'm getting at least an answer. Question Today I woke up thinking: Hei, how could random functions be really random if they are created by an algorithm? Think about it. How could you create a function that simulates randomness without the concept of random already built in? I began to think: Hei, I'd take an array of int, then I'd do [thing], then [thing], than [thing] again, then I'd choose only odd numbers... ecc But it seems more likely a function that make it more confusing to predict what the choose will be rather than real randomness. Is it possible to create randomness? How are functions that returns random ints (such as rand() in PHP) created? How can they simulate randomness?
