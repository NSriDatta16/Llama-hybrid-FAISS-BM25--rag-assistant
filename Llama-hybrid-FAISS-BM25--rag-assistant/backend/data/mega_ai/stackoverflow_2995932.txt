Error when putting variable in table, only constants allowed?

Currently I am working on a Netlogo program where I need to use nodes and links for vehicle routing problem. (links are called streets in the program) Here I have some practical problems of how to input variable linkspeed in a table with another node. Constants like 200 etc are fine. Online I found some examples where variables are used, but I do not know why I keep getting the following error: Expected a constant. (or why netlogo expects a constant) Here is the relevant piece of code: extensions [table] streets-own [linkspeed linktoll] nodes-own [netw] ;; In another piece of code linkspeed is assigned successfully to the links to cheapcalc ;; start conditions set costs very high 300000 ;; state 3 unsearched state 2 searching state 1 searched (for later purposes) ask nodes [ set i 0 set j count nodes set netw table:make while [i I hope somebody knows what is going on...
