Convertng labled images (EPS) to interactive web page using ImageMagick, OCR, JavaScript

Business Insight: We are in education domain and we have a requirement to automate the conversion of labeled images (EPS), into interactive exercises (using HTML/SVG/JavaScript), used by students. Technical Insight: Layered EPS files is what we get from the pubishers. The EPS files should be converted into two PNG files: [1.png] Which has label texts only [2.png] Everything else but label texts. Then [1.png] should be run through some advanced OCR (?) program that should output the label texts along with their positions (X,Y coords) in the image. Then HTML/JavaScript could be used to overlay the label texts over the [2.png] along with some interactions like Drag'n'drop using JavaScript. Tried so far: Manually converted the EPS into PNG and used ImageMagick and Tessaract OCR to get the label text alone. Question: How far the above requirements of image processing (EPS->PNG+text labels with coords) could be automated and what are the best tools that could be used? Appreciate the help in advance. PS: I'm an UI developer and could handle the HTML/JavaScript part, if just the coords are provided for the labels.
