Time-series analysis of fish market data

I have a dataset from 2002-2015 from a fish market next to a floodplain in southern Africa. We collected data on fish species, length and price from 5 randomly selected vendors every two weeks. The reviewers suggested we use a time series analysis to see if there is a correlation between species abundance and or length and the annual flood cycle. I have the monthly water levels during the period, but I am unsure of how to test for correlation. I think I understand the theory behind autocorrelation but not how to do it. Below is a screenshot of the data from the market (l) and river level (r)
