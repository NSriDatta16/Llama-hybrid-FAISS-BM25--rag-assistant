SQL Query to pull data from multiple tables, plus maybe some basic calculations

I'm struggling to get my head around a query. I know how to do basic SQL but I'm a bit out of my depth with this one. I'm trying to set up a query that returns a chart of highest ranked games. Users can rank a game out of 10. I want to select a list of the top 10 games and display them in a chart based on what their average rank is and also by the number of votes they have. So a game with an average rank of 8 and 20 votes will appear higher up the chart than a game with 10 votes and a average rank of 8. If this can't be be done with pure SQL then I can always do some coding for the rest. At this stage its just about getting the data I need, and in the right format. Any help would be much appreciated. My table structure is as follows: games | id | title | platform | genre | users | id | email | username | password | votes | userid | gameid | vote | The format of data I want to return is: | title | platform | average rank | votes |
