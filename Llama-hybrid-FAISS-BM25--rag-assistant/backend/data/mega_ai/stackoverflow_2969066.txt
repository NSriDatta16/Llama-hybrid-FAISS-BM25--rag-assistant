Can you post your vertex shader as well? Assuming that it's passing over the vec4 colorVarying there's no reason it shouldn't work when squashed into a single line as opposed to the two-line code in the sample (posted below) float odd = floor(mod(gl_FragCoord.y, 2.0)); gl_FragColor = vec4(colorVarying.x, colorVarying.y, colorVarying.z, odd); The only other difference I see is that you specified lowp - try it without that.
