i'm currently studying machine learning and the same question popped to my mind. What I think the reason should be is that in every machine learning problem we assume we have abundant observational data available and whenever data tends to infinity it gets normally distributed around its mean and thats what Normal distribution(Gaussian Distribution) says. Although its not necessary that Gaussian DIstribution will always be a perfect fit to any data that tends to infinity like take a case when your data is always positive then you can easily see if you try to fit gaussian dist to it it will give some weight to negative values of x also(although negligible but still some weight is given) so in such case distribution like Zeta is more suited.
