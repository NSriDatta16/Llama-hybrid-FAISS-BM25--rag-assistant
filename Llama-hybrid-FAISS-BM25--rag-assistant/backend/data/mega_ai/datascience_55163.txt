How to find the mean of a column relative to another column?

I am working on the Boston house price prediction. I have a column named GarageYrBlt that holds the year the garage was built for a specific house. My assumption is that the garage would most likely be built at the same time as the house so I want to fill the missing value with the median of the column GarageYrBlt relative to the column YearBuilt . To explain my idea further: While I was working on the Titanic problem, I filled the missing Age column with the median relative to the Sex column. So all female passengers with the missing age would get the value that is the median age of all female passengers. This is what I did: train['GarageYrBlt'] = train['GarageYrBlt'] .fillna(train.groupby('YearBuilt')['GarageYrBlt'] .transform("median"), inplace=True) And when I do print(train['GarageYrBlt']) , this is my output: 0 None 1 None 2 None 3 None 4 None 5 None 6 None 7 None 8 None 9 None 10 None 11 None 12 None 13 None 14 None 15 None 16 None 17 None 18 None 19 None 20 None 21 None 22 None 23 None 24 None 25 None 26 None 27 None 28 None 29 None ... 1430 None 1431 None 1432 None 1433 None 1434 None 1435 None 1436 None 1437 None 1438 None 1439 None 1440 None 1441 None 1442 None 1443 None 1444 None 1445 None 1446 None 1447 None 1448 None 1449 None 1450 None 1451 None 1452 None 1453 None 1454 None 1455 None 1456 None 1457 None 1458 None 1459 None Name: GarageYrBlt, Length: 1460, dtype: object
