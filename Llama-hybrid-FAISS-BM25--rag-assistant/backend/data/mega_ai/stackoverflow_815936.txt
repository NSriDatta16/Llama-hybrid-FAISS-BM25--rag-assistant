Separation of Concerns : make each object have only one responsibility. The goal here is to make sure each object to it's minimal functionnality and do it well. Then compose your system with your objects. That way you get a system with tiny classes that are composants of bigger classes that "manage" parts of your system and communicate together. The dependencies between those classes are then simple. I'm sure I'm not totally clear here, you should try to look at how is organized some big and complex object-oriented libraries (like Ogre if you're interested in real time 3D rendering).
