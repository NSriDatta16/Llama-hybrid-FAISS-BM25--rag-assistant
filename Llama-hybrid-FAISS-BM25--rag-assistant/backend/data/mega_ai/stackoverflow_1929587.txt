I don't think that we should ignore that this is swing code. GUIs aggregate several disparate objects in an organized way. I would advise you to seriously consider refactoring if you find yourself supporting multiple constructors, because it will be very confusing to understand what is and isn't necessary. But if you are putting seven components into some organizing template, it's not necessarily a bad idea to do that all in the constructor if it is unambiguous what each argument does. If the question is "Does this class have too many concerns?" stop asking "What are the signs that a class has too many concerns?" Why not ask "What is this class's concern?" If the answer is something simple like "It organizes several form elements into a single view," which is what I (and by extension, other parties browsing your code) would logically assume, then stop worrying about cosmetics like constructors. It's obvious enough in this case. Adding more classes is just going to obfuscate that.
