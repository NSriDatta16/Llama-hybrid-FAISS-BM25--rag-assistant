Experimental design and mixed models

I want to test effect of 3 PH on larval development. I would like to know what is the best experimental design and statistical analysis. We can only use 3 compartments of sea water, each one with a different ph. In each compartment, larvae will grow in 4 differents cylinder. Each day, we will take off severals larvae in each cylinder, measured larvae and count proportion of dead larvae. Can I then analyse proportion of dead larvae per day with a GLMM with cylinder as random factor (and LMM for larvae biometry) ? Can I "use" different parents to produce larvae of cylinders and analyse a kind of genetic effect ? In this case, could I use mixed models with family nested in cylinder as random effect ? Thank you.
