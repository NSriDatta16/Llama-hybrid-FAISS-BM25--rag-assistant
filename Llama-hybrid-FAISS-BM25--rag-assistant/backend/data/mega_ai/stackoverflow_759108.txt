Signs of Dying Software

What are signs that software is dying? How does a developer find early warnings to save a piece of software from dying? From user perspective, I think it is pretty clear - What they can not use efficiently, they will trash. Apart from this the software can die because of it's code - the architecture, coding style, size of codebase, codebase organization and quality of the programmers. I want to know how to listen to the signs of a software dying and take corrective actions. Any famous examples software being dead because no developer listened to the signs? Any examples of dying software being saved?
