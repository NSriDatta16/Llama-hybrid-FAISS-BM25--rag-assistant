How to calculate confidence intervals for the overlap coefficient?

One solution for calculating the overlap coefficient for two density plots was given by @mmk here: How to calculate overlap between empirical probability densities? Question: However, does anyone know how one would calculate confidence intervals in R for the overlap coefficient, or a measure of error? I have tried the overlap package - essentially for use with time series data - but I get very different results to @mmk's code when using this package's functions. If one plots the curves, then @mmk's code seems to give a far more accurate estimate of the area of overlap. Therefore, I would like to carry on using @mmk's code, but I do not know how to take it forward to calculate confidence intervals. How can this be done? Code: Here is the code from the above link written by @mmk: # simulate two samples a
