Display subcategories from one category

I'm using Magento and I am trying to display all sub categories from one category (42) in an unordered list. I'd also only like to show those subcategories that are active. I've googled lots of 'solutions', but none seem to work for me. I was wondering if anyone has a definitive answer to this? Thanks, Neil
