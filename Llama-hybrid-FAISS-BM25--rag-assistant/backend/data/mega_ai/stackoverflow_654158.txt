My general view is the ends justifies the means. Pragmatism reigns supreme here. The ultimate goal is to get it to work as quickly as possible on the widest range of browsers as possible. Whether or not to use absolute positioning, whether or not to use tables, whether or not to use pure CSS... all of these questions are, at best, secondary. I actually find it bizarre how much "table hatred" there is out there but, as has been documented countless times, if you want to do some things (like vertical centering) and have it compatible back to IE6 there's no quicker, easier and more compatible solution. I'm not for or against tables, absolute positioning or anything. The only thing I'm "for" is that it works. So in that vein, i find argument about "radical" absolute positioning to be--for lack of a a better description--irrelevant distractions. With all of these things (tables, absolute positioning, pure CSS, etc) in most cases you're not solving all your problems, you're simply trading one set of problems for another. That might be OK because in the context of what you're doing one set of problems might be preferable but there is no magic bullet (be it absolute positioning or anything else). From experience I've had just as many problems getting absolute positioning to do what I want (cross-browser) as any other approach.
