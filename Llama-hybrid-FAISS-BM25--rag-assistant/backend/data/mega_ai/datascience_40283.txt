How to handle “not label Y” in a multi class machine learning problem?

I have a train data set that comprises information in the form: feature 1, ..., feature N, label 1 x1, ..., xn, A 2 x1, ..., xn, B 3 x1, ..., xn, C ... 4 x1, ..., xn, not A 5 x1, ..., xn, not B 6 x1, ..., xn, D 7 x1, ..., xn, E ... In the test dataset, the labels A, B, C, D, E should be predicted. I would like to use the information in row 4 and 5 in order to avoid overfitting. Which techniques / tools can I use to utilize the "not A" and "not B" information in rows like 4 and 5?
