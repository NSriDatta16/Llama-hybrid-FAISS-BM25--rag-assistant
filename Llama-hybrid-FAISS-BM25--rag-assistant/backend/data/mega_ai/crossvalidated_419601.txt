So in total every participant watched 18 clips, 6 of each kind. Every participant evaluated each clip with a continuous variable with values between 0 and 1, and also a likert scale variable from 1 to 5. First you need to understand that neither of these variables are really normally distributed (probably), so you may need a more generalized linear model, a logistic regression model can be used for values between 0 and 1 (modeling probabilities), and an ordinal regression model for the likert scale variable. As for the formulas, you guessed right (1) valence_score ~ valence_category + trial + (1|subject) So here you would estimate the effect of both the categories and the trials, while accounting for the correlation among the subjects. (2) and (3) likert ~ valence_category + trial + (1|subject) Note that in both cases you estimate all the effects simultaneously, not individually (with multiple models). This will avoid wrong conclusions due to confounders, correlations and such.
