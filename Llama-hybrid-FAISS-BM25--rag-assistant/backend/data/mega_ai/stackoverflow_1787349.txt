Why can't you link to the "totals" subreport using Link Child/Master? It should run off the same record source as the main report and aggregate over the records. In any case, if you can specify a filter criteria, you should be able to specify a domain aggregate criteria (dsum, dcount, dlookup etc) that returns the same values. Dynamically editing the filter property in design view to make it work is a kludge. There is a reason that it difficult, not because the Access designers wanted to make it hard for you to embed subreports with dynamic criteria, but because it's a bad idea. Don't do it. There is something wrong with your report record source if you can't either join the subreport on record fields, or get rid of the subreport altogether and aggregate within the main report . You probably already know this, but you can aggregate (sum, count, etc) over the detail in a report in the report/page/group header/footer and give totals that way. For example, if you were writing a report for a printable invoice, you could move everything above the line items into the report header, leave a line item as the report detail, and move everything below the line items into the report footer. Then you could do sum() over the detail fields to generate your subtotal then add tax, shipping etc. Another way to do this would be to use a subreport for the line items then try to calculate the totals externally, not as simple and way more fragile if the subreport changes.
