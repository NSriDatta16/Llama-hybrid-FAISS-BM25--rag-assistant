On websites and in my book it doesn't explain what x(y); does. Java classes have something called a method . It's also called a routine , subroutine , or function sometimes. The main() in the code you posted is a method. In general, a method is a well-defined bunch of code that performs a single task: setBackgroundColor(); clearTemperature(); openValve(); So, x() would be a method, a (hopefully) specific, well-defined task. Now, x(y) means "x() wants to do a task, but it has to do it to something , or it needs something in order to do its task" ... "y" is the thing. So x(y) really means, "x does something, and it wants to do it to, or with, y" Examples: calculateAverageTemperate(temperatureList); Somewhere nearby is a method that calculates an average temperature. To do so it will likely loop over a list of temperatures (you won't know exactly what until you look at the code or javadocs.) setCheese("brazilian beaver"); setCheese() probably sets a variable telling what you're having for lunch. And today, it's Brazilian Beaver Cheese. applyUpvote(1); You voted for this answer! Congrats. Somewhere, the Stack Overflow code will add one to this answer's upvote count. There a little more to it than this of course...
