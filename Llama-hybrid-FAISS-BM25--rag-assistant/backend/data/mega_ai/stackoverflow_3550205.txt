Tomcat (and other application containers) need to be able to handle loading classes from WAR files etc. How would you be able to do that without using user-defined classloaders? EDIT: Basically you need user-defined classloaders if you need to load classes or resources in "unusual" ways... such as from an EAR or WAR file. As another example, you might load classes from a database, or from some secure storage.
