I can't see all your code, but I really think that you should make a function get_categories() { //PSEUDO: $results_array; //PSEUDO: return $results_array = mysql_results; } If you have time, I would suggest Migrating to PDO your HTML would then be: // rough PSEUDO Code $value) { echo(htmlentitites($value); } ?> This way you move your code to a more organized structure.
