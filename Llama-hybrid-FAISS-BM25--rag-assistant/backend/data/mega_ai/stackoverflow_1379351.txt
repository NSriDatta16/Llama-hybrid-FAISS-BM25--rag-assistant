New line formatting when using HTML file as Word file?

I'm writing a PHP application for a client that needs a pre-existing HTML page I've already created to be "exported" as an Word file. Simply, this is how it's done: if (isset($_GET["word"])) { header("Content-type: application/vnd.ms-word"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment;Filename=some_file.doc"); } This, of course, will be called if a "word" flag is located in the page querystring, e.g.: whateverpage.php?somequery=string&someother=test& word Anyways, my question is, despite how complex this HTML page actually is, it actually transfers pretty well to a nicely formatted Word file just by changing the content-type. The only problem I'm having is that new line breaks (HTML tags) aren't formatting properly. E.g.: In my html, if I have something that looks like Aug 01 with a BR between the lines, it always ends up showing Aug 01 in the generated Word file. I've done some Googling and lots of tests with various other things but nothing seems to format properly with a simple new line. Does anyone know how to properly format a new line character in a Word file that's being created from an HTML file? Any help is greatly appreciated. Edit: I've tried wrapping the said line in a P tag, ala: Aug 01 Without luck. I've also tried making a basic document and Word, saving it as an HTML file and looking at the generated (i.e sloppy) Word HTML source. There is some CSS in there that I thought might give me a clue, but I tried everything and nothing seemed to work properly. Word seems to add an 'MsoNormal' class to wrapped paragraphs, I tried adding this but it just removes any font formatting I had and doesn't help. Here is the CSS Word creates itself: p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:10.0pt; margin-left:0cm; line-height:115%; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif"; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-fareast-language:EN-US;}
