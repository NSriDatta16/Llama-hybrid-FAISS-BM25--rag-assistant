Discretize values/binning for missing data

I’m running an experiment where pairs make ratings after answering questions. There are 15 minute intervals where they attempt to answer 12 questions, but each pair makes it through a different number of questions. I would like to average their ratings throughout all the time points, but then I would only have a few pairs’ data making up the last few data points. Is there a way to weight each pair’s ratings equally by sorting their responses into bins/discretizing the values? So if pair 1 made 10 ratings and pair 2 made 5, and I had 5 bins, I could put 2 ratings/bin for pair 1 and 1 rating/bin for pair 2. Except in reality, I’d have imperfect numbers...Any tips for discretizing values/bins in R when I want to average this kind of incomplete data over time where different pairs answered different amounts of questions?
