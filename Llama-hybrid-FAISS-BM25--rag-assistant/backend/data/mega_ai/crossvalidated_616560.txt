Yes, prespecified comparison can easily be misunderstood. What is meant here should be seen in a situation where you can make many tests with the same data. The most common case is: you have two samples, and many variables measured on them, and you want to test if the samples come from the same population. Then you could make a separate test on each of the variables. For example, you measure 100 variables like height, weight, bmi, age, ... on people from town A and town B and want to check the null hypothesis, that it does not matter if you come from town A or B. Then it is not correct to make 100 tests and say, if one of them is significant, then I conclude that A and B are different. For example, if you set significance level to 5%, you would on average in such a situation have 5 tests that are significant, even if A and B are in fact the same population. The Bonferroni correction takes care for that by adjusting the significance level for each of the $m=100$ tests. It requires that you have to have at least one test with a p-value of $\alpha/m$ in order to be allowed to say that A $\neq$ B. In our example, one of the 100 tests would need to reach $p \leq 0.0005$ ! To avoid that you need one test with a very low p-value, it is a good idea to work with fewer tests. Selecting these tests in advance is meant by " prespecified comparisons". One should typically look at the scientific question and decide for which of the 100 variables you would expect a difference at all, if the populations of A and B are not the same. In practice, people often look at the data in advance, but this is not correct methodology. Then the comparison are no longer pre specified.
