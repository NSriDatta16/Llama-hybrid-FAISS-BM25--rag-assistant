I would look at the mouseOut event and determine if its firing when you're moving the mouse during a drag. I have seen cases where the dragged object doesn't move exactly with the mouse, and for a short while, the mouse is actually hovering over another object (causing the mouseOut event to fire, thus changing the cursor).
