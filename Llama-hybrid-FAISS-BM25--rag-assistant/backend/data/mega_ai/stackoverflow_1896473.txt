I fixed this by using the LayoutTransformer provided in the Silverlight Toolkit. I upated placed the XAML to be scaled inside the layout transformer tags as can be seen here: In the code behind I got rid of my RenderTransform and added an event that would fire when the scale should change. The handler looks like: private void MindBubbleScaleChanged(object sender, ScaleChangedEventArgs e) { ScaleTransform.ScaleX += e.Delta; ScaleTransform.ScaleY += e.Delta; LayoutTransformer.ApplyLayoutTransform(); }
