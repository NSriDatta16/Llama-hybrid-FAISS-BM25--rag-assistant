Automatic NN Architecture Configuration

I have to implement 3 Neural Networks, an MLP, an RNN and an LSTM, for a "Future Location Prediction" problem and it's the first time I am in touch with NNs. I would like to ask whether there is a way to automatically find the best configuration for their parametres, aca number of layers, number of nodes in each layer, dropout, activation and loss functions, as well as optimiser. If there is no such solution, would you suggest a better way than blind trying? Thanks in advance!!
