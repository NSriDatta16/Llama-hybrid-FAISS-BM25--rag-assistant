In all realistic problems, observation time $T_O$ and survival times $T_i$ are finite, so "never dies" is defined as the event $T_i > T_O$. If: you really care only about that event, and not about any differences in $T_i$s below $T_O$, AND all plants have been observed for the same duration, then logistic regression provides the same results while being conceptually easier. Otherwise the answer to both of your questions is cure fraction models - they explicitly model a fraction of population as "cured", and allow to test whether your exposure has an effect on this fraction.
