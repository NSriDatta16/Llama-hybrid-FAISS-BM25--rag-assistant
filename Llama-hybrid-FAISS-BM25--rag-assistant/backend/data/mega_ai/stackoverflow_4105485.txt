Most probably you have an encoding problem somewhere. There are several steps here that the path value takes: InstallAnywhere retrieves the path InstallAnywhere puts it into a variable Java reads the variable Java puts it into a String Java creates a java.io.File instance from String Java runtime passes path (via File) to OS Somehwere along this sequence something goes wrong with the path :-(. It's hard to tell where; your best bet probably is to try and print out the value at every step along the path, to see where it goes wrong. At least from inside Java, you should probably print out the String both as text, and as a list of Unicode code points (using String.codePointAt ). That way you can see the real data Java uses. Another approach: Print out the value Java gets from InstallAnywhere (as text & as codepoints, as above) Try to put the path into your Java program as a String literal, and fiddle until you can open the file that way. Then print that String as well. Now you can compare the two results; that should give you an idea where the path gets messed up. Note: Does the path contain characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)? Java handles these a bit awkwardly, so you need to pay extra attention. Maybe you can check this first.
