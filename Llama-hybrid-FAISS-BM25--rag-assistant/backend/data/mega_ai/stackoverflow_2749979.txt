Breaking the SQL Compact 8K Limit?

I am creating a desktop application that stores rich text documents to a SQL Compact database. Documents are converted to a byte array and stored as a Binary column, and I am running into SQL Compact's 8K limit for Binary field length. Is there a simple way to get around the 8K limit? I can come up with lots of complicated ways to do it, such as parsing into 8K chunks for storage and reassembling on fetch. But before I get into something that complex, I would like to make sure I can't solve the problem more simply, such as by changing data type. If there is no simple way of getting around the 8K limit, is thare a best practice for storing documents greater than 8K? Thanks for your help.
