What you're running into is the result of the data being written in one encoding, and interpreted as being another. You need to make sure that you're requesting input to be in the same format that you're expecting it to be in. I recommend just sticking with UTF-8 the whole way through unless you need to avoid multibyte characters, in which case you might want to look at forcing ASCII. Make sure you're telling PHP to use UTF-8 internally: ini_set('default_charset', 'UTF-8'); And make sure that you are telling the browser to expect UTF-8 encoded text, both in headers… header("Content-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8"); …and in your meta tags (html5 below)… Setting this will tell the browser to sent UTF-8 encoded content to you when a form is submitted, and it'll interpret the results you send back as UTF-8 as well. You should also make sure both your database storage and connection encoding are in UTF-8 as well. Usually as long as it is just a dumb data store (i.e. it won't be manipulating or interpreting the data in any way) it doesn't matter, but it's better to have it all right than run into problems with it later.
