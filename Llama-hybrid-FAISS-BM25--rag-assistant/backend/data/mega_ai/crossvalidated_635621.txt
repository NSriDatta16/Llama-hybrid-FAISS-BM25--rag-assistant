Fisher discriminant analysis: finds a linear discriminant function that maximizes the ratio of between groups variance and within groups variance. The result is a single discriminant function that can be used to discriminate two or more groups. Example: The three groups of iris flowers in Fisher, Ronald A. "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems." Annals of eugenics 7.2 (1936): 179-188. For multiple groups this method can also be performed by finding $n(n-1)/2$ pairwise discriminators. Example: classification based on 4 characters for three castes in the United Provinc in section 5 from Rao, C. Radhakrishna. "The utilization of multiple measurements in problems of biological classification." Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B (Methodological) 10.2 (1948): 159-203. Linear discriminant analysis: finds a set of perpendicular discriminant functions that maximizes the sum (or average) of all pairwise generalized distances between the means of the features of the groups. $D^2 = (\mu_i-\mu_j) \cdot \Sigma^{-1} \cdot (\mu_i-\mu_j)$ The results are multiple discriminant functions that can be used to create a graphical map of two or more groups sucht that the distances are maximal. Example: appendix 5 by Rao, C. Radhakrishna in Mahalanobis, Prasanta C., et al. "Anthropometric survey of the United Provinces, 1941: a statistical study." SankhyƒÅ: The Indian Journal of Statistics (1949): 89-324. I've always thought that Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) was simply a multi-class generalization of linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Both are multi class, but LDA can result in more components/functions. The first of the LDA components coincides with Fisher's linear discriminant. (if pooling and prior class probabilities are matched accordingly)
