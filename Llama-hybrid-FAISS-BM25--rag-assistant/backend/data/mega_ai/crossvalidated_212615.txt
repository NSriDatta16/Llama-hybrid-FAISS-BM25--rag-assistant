Your $h_{st}$ is just a weighted arithmetic mean for the heat index across the counties in each state. It makes sense because the more acres there are in a county, the more ice cream will melt in that county. By using $h_{st}$, you are controlling for the size of counties when averaging $h_{it}$ across counties.
