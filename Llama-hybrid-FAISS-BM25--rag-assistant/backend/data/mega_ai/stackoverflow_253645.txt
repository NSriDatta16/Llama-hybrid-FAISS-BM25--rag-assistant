A fellow programmer stuck like me in old Java1.4 ;) As said in my previous answer , code covered is not code tested. And the conclusion was: from a certain point, the only way to improve code coverage is... to delete code! Now, regarding hashCode, it is interesting to have it covered in a unit test design to check the expected sorted mechanism is respected (and not for covering one more function)
