tool for adding parentheses to equations?

Is there an online tool for adding parentheses to simple math equations? For example, a + b * c into a + (b * c) Those who paid more attention in math class might be able to tackle order of operations for huge equations in their head, but I could often use some help (and verification of my thinking). I often encounter other people's libraries having equations and functions I need for my code, and this would be kind of helpful for debugging and understanding. I was hoping Wolfram Alpha would do this, but the output is not easy to plug back into most programming languages e.g. a + (bc)
