Currently an HTML5 API is being developed to do this, but unfortunately IE doesn't support it. Edit: Apparently IE actually does support drag and drop, but I'm not very familiar with how it works. Try Googling "IE drag and drop". Try looking at these sites: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop http://html5doctor.com/native-drag-and-drop/ http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/html5-drag-and-drop-and-file-api-tutorial/ http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/dragdropie/ (Drag and Drop in IE)
