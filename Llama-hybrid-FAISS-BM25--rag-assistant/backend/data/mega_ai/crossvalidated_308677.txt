Why does MCMCpack use normal priors when running Poisson regression?

I thought that since the conjugate prior of Poisson distribution is gamma, we needed to use that when assigning prior distributions to the beta coefficient. MCMCpack and rstanarm both specify a multivariate normal distribution. Can someone explain the reasoning behind that?
