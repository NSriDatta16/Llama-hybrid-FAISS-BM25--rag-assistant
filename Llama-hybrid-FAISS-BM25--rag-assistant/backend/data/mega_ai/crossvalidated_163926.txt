Here is another approach based on the total number of heads in all three throws. Assuming that the coins are fair, the probability of getting $x$ heads in three throws is $$p(x)=\frac{\dbinom{3}{x}}{2^3},\quad x=0,1,2,3$$ Now for each $x$ form the profit function $$g(x)=10x-8(3-x)$$ Using the above probabilities now it is straightforward to show that expected profit is $3$ pounds. If you are interested, it is the law of the unconsious statistician that permits this calculation. But from this we also have to deduct the participation cost. Since on average you will then incur a loss of 12 dollars playing this game, it is advisable that you don't.
