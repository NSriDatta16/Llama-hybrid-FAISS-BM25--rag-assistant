How to approximate measurement uncertainty?

At the moment I use standard deviation of the mean to estimate uncertainty: $$\sigma_\textrm{mean}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}$$ where $N$ is in hundreds and mean is a time series (monthly) mean. I present it then like this: $$O_n\geq \frac{-\log_{10} 0.05}{b}$$ for each element (month) in the (annual) time series. Is this valid? Is this appropriate for time series?
