Put the virtuals into selectable base classes... struct Jumper { virtual void Jump =0; }; struct Crawler { virtual void Crawl() =0; }; struct JumperCrawler: public Jumper, public Crawler { }; template class ICanBoostJumpingAndCrawling : public Methods { T t; }; Now you can use ICanBoostJumpingAndCrawling with Jumper,Crawler or JumperCrawler supplied as the Methods template parameter; realizing that you need to be derived from it so that you can implement Jumping and or Crawling in a subclass. FYI, This makes the name "ICanBoostJumpingAndCrawling" completely misleading because it may or may not be able to do that; which means it should be renamed to something like "Booster".
