The description suggests an analysis with chi-square test of proportions would be appropriate. You can summarize your data with a contingency table of the following form $$ \begin{array}{cccccc} & \mbox{Behaviour 1} & \mbox{Behaviour 2} & \mbox{Behaviour 3} & \mbox{Behaviour 4} & \mbox{Behaviour 5} \\ \mbox{Child} & N_{11} & N_{12} & N_{13} & N_{14} & N_{15} \\ \mbox{No child} & N_{21} & N_{22} & N_{23} & N_{24} & N_{25} \\ \end{array} $$ You would of course look at marginal frequencies to determine where cell specific differences lie. You can alternately calculate proportions as you suggested in point 2, but you shouldn't base inference on those values. It should be noted that, by virtue of having a binary predictor, you can use logistic regression to obtain an equivalent $\chi_2$ test of proportions using the following R code: glm(child ~ factor(behavior), family=binomial) Logistic regression allows us to treat predictors as outcomes. The reason why this works is that odds ratios are conditioning invariant: $$ \frac{\mbox{Odds(Child | Behaviour)}}{\mbox{Odds(No Child | Behaviour)}} = \frac{\mbox{Odds(Behavior | Child)}}{\mbox{Odds(No behavior | Child)}} $$ If you need to bin females by social group, then two options are multivariate logistic regression or Cochran Mantel Haenszel. Example of the first in R is glm(child ~ factor(behavior) + factor(group), family=binomial) . Example of the latter in R is mantelhaen.test(table(behavior, child, group)) . The choice of whether to do this should rely solely upon the scientific question. Aggregating the behavior groups into proportions will not allow you to perform any statistical inference, but would be useful in an inspection of trends. You can determine which proportions are higher. 3-4 are suggestions for applying tests for continuous data in circumstances where tests for categorical data are available, established, well known, and superior.
