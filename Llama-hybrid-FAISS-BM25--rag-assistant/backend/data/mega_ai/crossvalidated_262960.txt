Since one knows the distribution of the data, the likelihood is available as $$L(a|x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \zeta(a)^{-n} \prod_{i=1}^n x_i^{-a} = \zeta(a)^{-n} \left\{\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\right\}^{-a}$$ which shows that the geometric mean $$\exp\left\{\sum_{i=1}^n\log(x_i)/n\right\}$$ [rather than the sample average] is a sufficient statistic for this problem. And the mean of the Zeta distribution is given by $\mu=\zeta(a-1)/\zeta(a)$, which means that a first moment equation can be solved numerically if not analytically.
