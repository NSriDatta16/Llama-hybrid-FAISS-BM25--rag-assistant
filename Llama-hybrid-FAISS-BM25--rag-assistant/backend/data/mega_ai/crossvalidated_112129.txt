I am not sure if this is what you are asking, but one might conceive of an integrated process that looks something like this: $$y_{t} = y_{t-1} + \varepsilon$$ Feel free to define the distribution of $\varepsilon$ according to your needs and whimsy, and you have got yourself a nice little nonstationary random walk process. The "unit root" in the above case is in the invisible coefficient $\beta_{y_{t-1}}$, which equals $1$ or $-1$ ($|1|$ being the "unit" in the unit root). I think you may be asking about the intercept in a model like this: $$y_{t} = \beta_{0} + y_{t-1} + \varepsilon$$ This model is very similar to the above, except for every unit of time, the time series changes by $\beta_{0}$. If you were to eliminate the random portion of this process, what you would be left with is a linear change in $y$ over unit time. So $\beta_{0}$ is the slope of a linear trend over time in a unit root process added to the nice random walk in the remaining portion of the model. Of course, $\beta_{y_{t-1}}$ need not be invisible, and may be estimated from data, and may not equal exactly $1$ or $-1$. When $|\beta_{y_{t-1}}| long memory , or is near integrated (if the value is close to $1$ or $-1$). If $|\beta_{y_{t-1}}| > 1$, then your time series diverges/explodes. The linear trend implied by $\beta_{0}$ remains just that in such cases.
