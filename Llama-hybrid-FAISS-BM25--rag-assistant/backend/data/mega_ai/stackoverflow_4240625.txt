Looking for parallel function to actionscript's BitmapData.draw() but in OpenGL

I have a flash application that I have been working on for 11 months, and would like to translate it to a different language / platform, preferably Python and OpenGL. One of the main features in my program is to draw flash vector graphics (or display objects) and then redraw them to a bitmap texture. Is there any way to do this in OpenGL? Basically to draw some polygons on the screen, and then draw these polygons onto a texture. If the texture is displayed directly below the polygons , and the polygons are in motion, then there is a dragging/drawing/painting effect. http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display/BitmapData.html#draw () --> here is the flash function which I use. Hopefully someone who is knowledgable in OpenGL & Actionscript would be able to answer this question or provide me with some details. Thankyou!
