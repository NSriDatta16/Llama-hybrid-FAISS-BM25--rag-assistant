Tricky problem! Is location fixed or random? Is position fixed or random? I assume that sample is random. Since treatment is assigned to location, location is the sampling unit. Basically, the comparison between treatments is done at that level. $n=8$. The measurement unit is the observation you take on your "samples" at a given time. Location is not nested in treatment. The treatment is applied to the location. Position is nested inside location. Sample is nested inside position. Time is nested inside Sample. Time is crossed with treatment. You have 3 levels of nesting (time within sample, sample within position, position within location). If location, position and sample are random, I think the R formula will look like this: Y ~ Treatment * Time +(1|location|position|sample) You have 1 row in your data frame for each sample observation at each time - with appropriate codings for all of your design characteristics. Would it work to combine the repeated measures into a score such as their average or their difference? That could make the model easier to interpret.
