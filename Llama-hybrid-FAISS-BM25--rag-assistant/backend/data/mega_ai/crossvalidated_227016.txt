Hand-Waving: The logistic regression is some sort of squeezing a linear regression (fitting a line through you samples) into the range [0,1]. Since you have now some numerical value in the [0,1] range you can actually cal it (TADAM!) probability! More Rigorous: What you get is $P(y=white|X)$ or in other words the probability of some sample $y$ to be labeled as $white$ (or whatever two classes that you have) depending on $X$-the data, or more specifically the independent measures of the features represented by $y$. So to sum it up, $logit(y)$ is the probability of $y$ being ${0,1}$. If it is only about semantics, you can always drop likelihood inside.
