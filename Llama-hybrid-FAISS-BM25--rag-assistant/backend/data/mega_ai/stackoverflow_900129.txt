You could try to convert the C++ code to C code and then compile it with your existing C compiler. You should be able to create a Makefile which calls the C++ compiler and then runs the C compiler afterwards. It's not the most elegant solution but it really is pretty unusual to use C++ on small devices such as the 8051. Disclaimer: I have not actually tried this so good luck! If it were me, I'd stick to C and write some robust string-handling functions.
