asp.net mvc partialview

It seems that my understanding of the use of partial views is not quite right. I am trying to add a partial view which builds from a database and use the partial view within a master page. Using the NerdDinner project (wich is great for mvc) I have added the following: Views\Shared\dinners.ascx" : >" %> "> Within "Views\Shared\Site.Master" : ... The above will only currently function on the pages where the dinners object is currently availabe as a list (eg site/Dinners). Is there a way to do this in an elegant and mvc way or is this something that requires a clever compromise?
