Why should one do a WOE transformation of categorical predictors in logistic regression?

When is weight of evidence (WOE) transformation of categorical variables useful? The example can be seen in WOE transformation (So for a response $y$, & a categorical predictor with $k$ categories, & $y_j$ successes out of $n_j$ trials within the $j$th category of this predictor, the WOE for the $j$th category is defined as $$\log \frac{y_j} {\sum_j^k {y_j}} \frac{\sum_j^k (n_j-y_j)}{n_j-y_j}$$ & the transformation consists of coding each category of the categorical predictor with its WOE to form a new continuous predictor.) I would like to learn the reason why WOE transformation helps the logistic regression. What is the theory behind this?
