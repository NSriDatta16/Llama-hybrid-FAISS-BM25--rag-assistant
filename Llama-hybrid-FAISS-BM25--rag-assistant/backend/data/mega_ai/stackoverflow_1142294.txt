How do I plot a classification graph of a SVM in R

I have an SVM in R and I would now like to plot the classification space for this machine. I have found some examples on the Internet, but I can't seem to make sense of them. My R script is as follows: library(e1071) day_of_week I cannot get the plot command to work. I would like a graph something like this http://bm2.genes.nig.ac.jp/RGM2/R_current/library/e1071/man/images/plot.svm_001.png
