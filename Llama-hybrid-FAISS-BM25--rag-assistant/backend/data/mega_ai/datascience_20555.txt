Removing sensitive information from a dataset while retaining its usefulness for machine learning tasks?

I have a dataset that would be useful for training future machine learning models. However, it contains sensitive information (personal identifiers like names and addresses) that make it difficult to store or retain longterm. I'm wondering if there are transformations that could be applied that would remove the sensitive information, while retaining it's usefulness? The dataset is specifically useful for training NLP related models, but I'm also interested in a general solution to this for general machine learning tasks if one exists.
