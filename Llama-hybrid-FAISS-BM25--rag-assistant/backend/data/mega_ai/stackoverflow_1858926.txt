Multidimensional Scaling turns distances into coordinates - if you already have coordinates in a high-dimensional space and want them embedded optimally in a low-dimensional space, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is probably the technique you are looking for. Classical MDS and PCA are closely related: First, MDS converts input distances into preliminary high-dimensional coordinates (the dimension being as high as the number of objects described); second, the dimensionality of these coordinates is reduced in a PCA-like step by getting rid of the least important axes. The point of using MDS is that in some settings the input distances are not derived from existing coordinates, but from something else, which is non-geometric, for example, dissimilarity ratings made by people. Your 3x3 dissimilarity matrix does not obey the triangle inequality needed in metric spaces (because d[1][0]+d[0][2]
