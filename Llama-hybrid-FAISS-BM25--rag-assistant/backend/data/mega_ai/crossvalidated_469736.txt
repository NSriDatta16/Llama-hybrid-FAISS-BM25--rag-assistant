Dimensionality reduction techniques (such as PCA and FA) can be computed via covariance or correlation matrices, where the latter is equivalent to z-scoring the data by each dimension prior to the calculation. The major difference between the approaches is that results for raw data (covariance) are influenced by combination of individual variance and covariance, whereas results for z-scored data (correlation) are explicitly independent of individual variability See here for more discussion
