First, I must admit I don't know exactly what you mean by 'online' logistic regression. Of course, calculation of H is expensive if you really do the matrix operations. However, all that is needed is the diagonal elements of H, who come at much lower cost. Depending on your explanatory variables, you may be able to group your data such that each covariable/outcome combination can be assigned a frequency count. This speeds up calculations dramatically. Both these options are implemented (and used by default) in the current version of our R package logistf.
