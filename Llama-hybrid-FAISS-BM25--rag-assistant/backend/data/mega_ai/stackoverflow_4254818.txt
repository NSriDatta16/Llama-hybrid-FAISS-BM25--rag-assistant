PageRank is still a big factor in organic search result listings. It's a quick assessment of where you stand, but it is definitely only part of the picture. And, in my SEO experience trying to build smaller sites in the PR4 range, you do far better getting 5 or 10 inbound links from sites PR6 or even 5, than hundreds from nothing sites at PR1 or even 3. In my experience (which is mostly e-commerce, btw), getting a startup site into that 4 range is critical, and it does take time. SEO is best approached from the standpoint of getting into the right search results, than trying to always be first or second in the results. As long as your pages contain relevant, fresh content, you'll be on your way to make that happen. ps/btw: This question is probably better put onto one of the other sites, since this is a technical programming forum.
