I wouldn't bother trying to build something SAML compliant. It will take you weeks to use a toolkit and your efforts will probably only handle the one use case. Once you get something custom into place you'll soon realize the rest of your organization needs some type of SAML integration as well (either internal or externally). The quickest (and IMHO) easiest way (and you'll come out looking like a hero) is to use something like PingFederate from www.pingidentity.com. You can have it up and running in less than a day if you know what you are doing. Just my $0.02 HTH - Ian
