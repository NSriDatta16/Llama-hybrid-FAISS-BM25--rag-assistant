adding an error band on a graph when having errors in both x- and y-direction

I have a dataset with x and y values which are both calculated averages from three values and consequently they also have an associated error. I have about 100 x,y points which I want to plot. Adding both horizontal and vertical error bars is a good method, only there are too many points and it doesn't look nice. In this graph (excel example below) I can see that in some zones the vertical error reaches the furthest and in some zones the horizontal error reaches furthest. To make a nicer graph I want to use the largest error and make an error area (instead of error bars). But I am quite puzzled by the mathematics and how I should write a script or use a graphical tool to create such a graph. I would think there should be some kind of solution with a loop going through each x and y value and looking for the min and max for each original xy point, but I couldn't get the maths right to do this. Is there anybody familiar or sees a solution to this problem, preferably implementable in R.
