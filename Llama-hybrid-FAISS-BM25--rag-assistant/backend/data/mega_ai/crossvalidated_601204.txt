Is linear discriminant analysis a supervised classifier or dimensionality reduction?

On page 147 of ISLR 2nd Edition, the author is talking about LDA and comparing it to a Bayes Classifier. This leads me to believe LDA is a machine learning algorithm for supervised classification. However, in this post and various other posts online, LDA is compared to PCA as a technique for dimensionality reduction. So which is it, a supervised classifier or a dimensionality reduction technique? You also have on page 148 (below) a confusion matrix of the results of the LDA classifier, which is further evidence that it is a supervised classifier and not a dimensionality reduction technique?
