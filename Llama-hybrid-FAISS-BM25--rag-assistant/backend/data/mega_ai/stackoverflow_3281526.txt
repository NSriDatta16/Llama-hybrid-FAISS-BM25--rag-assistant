Are you uploading directly to your web server or uploading to a video service then embedding? AllVideos is great for the latter and essentially helps you control the content and plugin environment rather than inserting a video player per se linking to a progressive download. AllVideo Plugin Rather than being a "Component" this is a plugin, which allows you with a small simple script to insert into any content item. If you have collection of videos, organize the content items like any other pages and just insert the tags where necessary. When installing a plugin, be sure to publish it prior to testing.
