GWT FlexTable - drag selection how?

I am trying to get a proper method for days to select multiple cells in a flextable's column. So far i only managed to do it with clicks which works well, but a drag selection would be much better. I have been reading docs and searching, but all the stuff i found was based on deprecated code. I use GWT 2.0 . I know i need some event handler which would run when drag selection mouse gesture occurs, and that handler needs to know the cell's index where the selection start and of course the cell's index where the selection ends. Any advice || code would be much appreciated.
