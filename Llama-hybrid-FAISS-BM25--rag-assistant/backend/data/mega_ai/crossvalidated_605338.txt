Can I compare the coefficients of the ramp function between two groups in ARIMA model?

I analyzed the impact of a celebrity's disclosure of mental health condition in the monthly incidence of the diagnosis of the celebrity using an interrupted time series analysis (ITA) with the ARIMA model. In the model, a ramp function represented the disclosure event, and auto.arima in R gave an output about the best model with coefficients and standard errors for the level and the slope of the ramp function. I did a subgroup analysis by dividing the total population into males and females and reran the analysis in each group. I want to see if the impact of the disclosure is different between males and females. What statistical analysis can be done? Below are the summaries of the ITA: 1st group Regression with ARIMA(0,1,1)(1,0,0)[12] errors Coefficients: ma1 sar1 stepCha stepLee rampCha rampLee -0.3657 0.3172 -6.3662 0.4706 4.2881 -1.1185 s.e. 0.0947 0.1005 6.1895 5.9199 1.2267 1.4131 sigma^2 = 43.99: log likelihood = -391.63 AIC=797.26 AICc=798.26 BIC=816.71 2nd group Regression with ARIMA(0,1,3)(2,0,0)[12] errors Coefficients: ma1 ma2 ma3 sar1 sar2 stepCha stepLee rampCha rampLee -0.7872 0.6552 -0.2714 0.0540 0.5509 -49.2338 -15.8339 23.6277 -7.0684 s.e. 0.1159 0.1203 0.1393 0.0944 0.1043 14.8209 15.1400 2.9894 3.2334 sigma^2 = 324.8: log likelihood = -513.18 AIC=1046.36 AICc=1048.4 BIC=1074.16
