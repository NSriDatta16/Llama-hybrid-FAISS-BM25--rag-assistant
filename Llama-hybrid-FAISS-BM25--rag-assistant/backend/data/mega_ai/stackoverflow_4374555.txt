AppEngine as WebService and S3 as storage

If the client side upload a picture and send to (Google) AppEngine based WebService, can the AppEngine in turn push the file to (Amazon) S3? Also, can the link returned by S3 be stored on AppEngine, such that when the response to the client side from the AppEngine can have those links. Is this achievable? or overkill? Has anyone done this?
