Solution folders can help organizing your projects. And they have one big advantage: If you want to build some sets of projects then you can mark them and right-click them and select "Build selected projects". If your solution folder organization fits you can simply right-click on a solution folder and select "Build". We have sln-folders for "MainApps" and "Test" (and some other). If you need all Apps, you build the complete solution. But if you don't want waiting for the Test projects to build you can simply right-click and build the "MainApps" folder!
