loglog regression with 0's in IV's

Assume we have 2 predictors $X_1$ and $X_2$ and an outcome $Y$ that we wish to model with the following function $y = e^{\beta_0} * X_1 ^{\beta_1} * X_2^{\beta_2}$ Also assume that we have some priors for our parameters $\beta_0,\beta_1, \beta_2$ and we run MCMC as to generate posterior samples of our parameter estimates thus we do not need to linearize the equation as is normally done in loglog regression. The values for $X_1, X_2$ is in general in the interval $[0,100]$ . My question is now; how should i deal with zeros in $X_1, X_2$ and maybe $Y$ . My idea is to add $1$ to solely the zero entries in $X_1, X_2$ but i assume this also creates some sort of bias. Is it better to add a small positive float instead like $0.01$ or maybe even getting rid of the predictor entirely thus having some sort of indicator variable including the term or not when having zeros?
