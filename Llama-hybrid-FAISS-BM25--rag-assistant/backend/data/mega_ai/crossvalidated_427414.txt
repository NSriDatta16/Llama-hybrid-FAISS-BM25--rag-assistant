Survey Question Validity

I have a survey that asks the user to report their debt from their undergraduate education and their debt from their graduate education. I intend to add these two averages to measure their average total debt. The population for my survey is 150 students from a past graduating class. I had 70 responses to the question about undergraduate debt and 50 responses to the question about the graduate debt. When finding the average total debt, I was wondering if I should average the debt from people that responded to both questions, or if I can simply add the two averages. I feel like validity improves if I only use those that responded to both questions. But at the same time, I feel like both averages are working point estimates, so I shouldn't need to worry about this issue. What do you think? EDIT: Each individual reports their debt from their undergraduate and graduate degrees. The post originally said that each individual reports their average. My mistake!
