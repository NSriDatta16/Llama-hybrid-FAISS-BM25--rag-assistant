Funny that you ask this question because I just had a meeting last week where i heard some people were using commit/push of non-runnable even non-compilable code on the authoritative repository just to save it! (Note: it's different from what Mark says). It appeared so wrong to me and so getting in the way of Continuous Integration that we decided to install an rsync-based backup server so that the developers would realize how complementary version control and backup tools are! I haven't yet installed the server, but if you have a spare Unix machine with an ssh server running on it, a simple crontab could do the job, e.g. using ssh and rsync (if you have an NFS-mounted partition, it would even be simpler): $ crontab -l # m h dom mon dow command 0,15,30,45 * * * * if `ping -c 1 machine.domaine.com > /dev/null 2> /dev/null` ; then export SSH_AGENT_PID= "`pgrep -l ssh-agent | cut -d' ' -f1`" ; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK= "`/usr/bin/find /tmp -path '*ssh-*' -type s -user name -group gname -name '*agent*' 2> /dev/null`" ; /usr/bin/rsync -avz -e ssh --quiet /home/name/src name@machine.domain.com:/home/name/backup/src ; fi (I assume that you can log in the machine using ssh, that you have an ssh-agent running and have used ssh-add). This way, every 15 minutes, on-going work is saved, and as rsync is quite fast figuring out what has changed, it shouldn't make your workstation too slow.. In case your disk crashes, simply log into machine.domain.com, use your backup-ed credentials :-) and continue to work... Hope it'll help. Cheers, Christophe. = Security is mostly a superstition.
