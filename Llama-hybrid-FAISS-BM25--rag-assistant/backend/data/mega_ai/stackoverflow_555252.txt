Show ContextMenu on Left Click using only XAML

The default behavior of a WPF ContextMenu is to display it when the user right-clicks. I want the ContextMenu to show when the user left-clicks. It seems like this should be a simple property on ContextMenu , but it is not. I rigged it, so that I handle the LeftMouseButtonDown event in the code-behind and then display the context menu. I'm using MVVM in my project which means I'm using DataTemplate s for the items that have the context menus. It would be much more elegant to get rid of the code-behind and find a way to display the context menu using triggers or properties in the XAML. Any ideas or solutions to this issue?
