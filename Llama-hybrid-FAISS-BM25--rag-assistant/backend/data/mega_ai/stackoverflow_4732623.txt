Managed to solved this issue by having same class name for both the listboxes and then passing both the list box objects to the plugin $('select.select_field').custSelectBox(null, $('#EditUsers_Organisations'), $('#EditUsers_AdditionalLanguages')); This might not be the best solution but nothing else worked for me.
