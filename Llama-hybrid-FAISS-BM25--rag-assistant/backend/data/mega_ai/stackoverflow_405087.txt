You mean the position of all elements? How about iterating through them and saving their position? If you use jQuery you could do something like this: var positions = new Array(); function savePositionOfAllDivs() { $('div').each( function(){ $this = $(this); id = $this.attr('id'); position = $this.position(); left = position.left; top = position.top; positions[id] = new Array(); positions[id]['left'] = left; positions[id]['top'] = top; } } And then send the positions array to some server side script which turns it into CSS which you can then embed into the HTML page that the user can download. (With more specefic information about what your trying to do this could be way more easy and effecient. Say it is a order drag 'n drop functionality then you only have to save the order of div s)
