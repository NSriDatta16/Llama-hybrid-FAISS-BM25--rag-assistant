No amount of imputation, time series analysis, GARCH models, interpolation, extrapolation, or other fancy algorithms will do anything to create information where it does not exist (although they can create that illusion ;-). The history of Y's price before X went public is useless for assessing their subsequent correlation. Sometimes (often preparatory to an IPO) analysts use internal accounting information (or records of private stock transactions) to retrospectively reconstruct hypothetical prices for X's stock before it went public. Conceivably such information could be used to enhance estimates of correlation, but given the extremely tentative nature of such backcasts, I doubt the effort would be of any help except initially when there are only a few days or weeks of prices for X available.
