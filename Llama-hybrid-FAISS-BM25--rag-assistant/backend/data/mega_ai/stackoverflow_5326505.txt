The short answer to the question is NO. But there may be ways to meet your requirements... It depends on the capability of your report viewer. Does it understand PDF? PCL? RAVE? If so, leverage that. If you look at a PCL file, for example, you'll find that it's really text with some PCL command sequences. You could make a PCL file that contains basic header information (maybe just ESC+Reset at the top), then your text, and then some fancy PCL for your image. That's what I'd look into, if I was using a report viewer that understood PCL.
