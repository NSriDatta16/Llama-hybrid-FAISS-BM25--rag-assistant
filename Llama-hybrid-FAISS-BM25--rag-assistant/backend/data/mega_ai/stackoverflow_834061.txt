Website security pitfalls and what can I do in ASP.NET MVC to avoid/mitigate them?

I've just started working on implementing my first public-facing website. Since I'm new to this, I think if a list of common pitfalls, what they are, and how to avoid them is warranted. I'm looking for things like: SQL injection (I know this one, but if anyone knows of tools to analyse a website for injection vulnerabilities, that'd be useful). Incorrect storage of passwords. I know I should use salt. What facilities does ASP.NET MVC provide for me to do this? Login rate limiting (Jeff mentioned it on Coding Horror today). How would I implement this in ASP.NET MVC? Can I do this with the standard Membership Provider implementation? What exactly is XSS and what tools are in the ASP.NET MVC toolbox for avoiding it? etc. If a topic has been dealt with in another question, a quick summary and a link to that question would be a good idea.
