@Glen_b and @whuber have gave good answers, and I think the gist is the Bayesian formula. Here is another method: For a single round , the probabilities are: P_A = 1/6 * 3/6 = 1/12 P_B = (1 - P_n_A ) * 1/6 = 11/12 * 1/6 = 11/72 P_Draw = 1 - P_n_A - P_n_B = 55/72 For round n, the probabilities are: P_n_A = P_Draw ^ (n-1) * P_A P_n_B = P_Draw ^ (n-1) * P_B P_n_Draw = P_Draw ^ (n) These are all geometric sequence, and the common ratio is: r= P_Draw The sum of the first n terms in a geometric sequence: Sn = a1 * (1-r^n) / (1-r) So, the probability for A or B wins before round n is: S_n_A = P_1_A + P_2_A + ... P_n_A = 1/12 * (1-r^n) / (1-r) S_n_B = P_1_B + P_2_B + ... P_n_B = 11/72 * (1-r^n) / (1-r) By the way, the probability for draw before round n is: r ^ (n) Because r , so: lim(n->∞)(S_n_A) = 1/12 * (1-0) / (1-r) = 1/12 / (1- 55/72) = 6/17 lim(n->∞)(S_n_B) = 11/72 * (1-0) / (1-r) = 11/72 / (1- 55/72) = 11/17 lim(n->∞)(draw_n) = lim(n->∞)(r ^ (n)) = 0 And we can get common formulas for this kind of games: P_Draw_single = 1- P_A_single - P_B_single P_Awin = P_A_single / (1 - P_Draw_single) P_Bwin = P_B_single / (1 - P_Draw_single) Thus, P_Awin = P_A_single / (P_A_single + P_B_single) P_Bwin = P_B_single / (P_A_single + P_B_single) For example, a more simplified game: Two players A and B roll by turn, who rolls a 1 wins, and A rolls first. So, P_A_single = 1/6 P_B_single = 5/6 * 1/6 = 5/36 And, P_Awin = P_A_single / (P_A_single + P_B_single) = 6/11 P_Bwin = P_B_single / (P_A_single + P_B_single) = 5/11 Further more, I think these common formulas can support more than 2 players. P_Awin = P_A_single / (P_A_single + P_B_single + ......) P_Bwin = P_B_single / (P_A_single + P_B_single + ......) P_Cwin = P_C_single / (P_no_draw) ......
