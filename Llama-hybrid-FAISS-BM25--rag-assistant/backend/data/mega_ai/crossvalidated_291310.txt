You could have a look at this publication , the models are compared by AIC and loss functions. Seems to me the author did pretty much what you are doing with different data / time frames. Also Tsay's (2010) Analysis of Financial Time Series is worth checking out when applying GARCH models. In a few of the examples Tsay uses in his book he plots the conditional volatility from various GARCH models vs a windowed or also known as rolling standard deviation of the return series. He uses 23 or 69 day Windows for an approximate trade month / quarter. He also gives code examples on how to estimate and plot the models.
