Well accidentally I see your question again. (remember me?) Well instead of scaling the image from another domain, you can scale the Loader, so there won't be any cross domain security problem a working sample here: http://matrixoft.infunity.com/agent/calvin/stackoverflow/getScale.swf source code here: http://matrixoft.infunity.com/agent/calvin/stackoverflow/getScale.rar [p.s. see the commented code inside the buttonAction layer, the commented code fails cause it is trying to manipulate the scale of an image from another domain. The code after commented code manipulate the scale of the Loader, not image]
