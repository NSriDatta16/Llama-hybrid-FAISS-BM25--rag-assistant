It is mostly correct but I don't agree with the cookie-option. This way if someone gets the two cookies can move them to a different computer and still use them. The "remain logged in" function should be restricted to that computer. A possible solution is that if the user wishes to remain logged in you set the lifetime of the session to 1 week or so. Also you have to store the user's IP address, User-Agent and possibly X-FORWARDED-FOR header, and check them on every pageload against the stored values.
