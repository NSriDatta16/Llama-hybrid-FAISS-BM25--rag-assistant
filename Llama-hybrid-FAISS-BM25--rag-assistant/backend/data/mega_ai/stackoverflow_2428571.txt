In addition to the already mentioned reasons perl has a (strongly discouraged) -P option that runs the Perl file through a C preprocessor before it is executed. Since most C preprocessor's will use line directives when they include or remove part of a file so any errors will be reported from where they were located in the original source instead of the processed source. Line directives can also be very useful if you are generating code in strings that is then passed to eval . Normally if there is a warning or error in such code you get an error reported like "died at (eval 1) line 1." Using line directives you can supply a useful file name and line number.
