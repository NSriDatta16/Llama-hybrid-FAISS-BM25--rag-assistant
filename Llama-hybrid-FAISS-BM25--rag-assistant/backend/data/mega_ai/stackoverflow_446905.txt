One way to do this would be to serialize the ComboBox's Items property - XML serialization would probably be easiest in this case. You could then save the resulting text to a file, Isolated Storage , or to the registry using the RegistryKey class - as long as the serialized data isn't too large, for 6 items it would be fine. Then simply deserialize the data back to the combo box on app startup.
