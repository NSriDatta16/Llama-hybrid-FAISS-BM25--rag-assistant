Magento: Filtering a getCollection is not working

My getCollection code is providing the wrong query string (i think). I have a table called banner which I can load all records from easy enough. When I try to filter it I'm getting errors. Here is the code: $banner = Mage::getModel('banner/banner')->getCollection()->addFieldToFilter('group', array('eq'=>'search_group')); The page crashes and I get this error: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'group = 'search_group')' at line 1";i:1;s As you can see it seems like the code is messing up the quotes after group. 'group = 'search_group')' Can anyone advice on how to fix this? Thanks, Billy
