Can you not make MatLab call the WEKA and pass data off to it? For very high dimensional data I find the work of Eugene Tuv to be very useful. Random forests of Gradient Boosted Trees can whittle 100k rows and 100k columns to something useful in a very short time. http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee392m/Lecture3Tuv.pdf http://www.journalogy.net/Publication/6491785/feature-selection-with-ensembles-artificial-variables-and-redundancyelimination
