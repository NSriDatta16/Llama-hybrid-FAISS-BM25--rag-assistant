Maybe the GMail app assumes that content delivered by the media store app are always jpg pictures. It might even be the Media store which could provide wrong data to the GMail app. You could try to store your PNG file on the file system and as the GMail doesn't fully support file:// Uris (it works only with files on external storage) you may use a custom ContentProvider to simply provide content from a file with a content:// uri instead. You can find such a content provider here . One other simple test could be to send a PNG file from the filesystem through GMail using a File explorer app like EStrongs or Astro. If GMail still forces the .jpg extension then you may have hard time finding a way to work this around. Last idea, try using a more generic mime-type like application/octet-stream (but this could lead to problems for in mail receivers mail applications which might not understand what kind of file it is)
