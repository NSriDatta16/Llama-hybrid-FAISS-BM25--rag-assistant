Wagner et al. describe what they do in section 5c. They perform PCA on 7x7 pixel image patches (not whole images), treating patches as points and pixels as dimensions. This gives 49 principal components, each with a 49 element weight vector (which is an eigenvector of the covariance matrix). Reshaping each PCA weight vector to a 7x7 matrix gives a basis image patch (i.e. each original image patch can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis patches). Each basis patch is used as an initial filter kernel in the convolutional network, yielding 49 filters.
