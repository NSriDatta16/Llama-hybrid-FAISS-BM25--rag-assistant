McFadden's Pseudo-$R^2$ Interpretation

I have a binary logistic regression model with a McFadden's pseudo R-squared of 0.192 with a dependent variable called payment (1 = payment and 0 = no payment). What is the interpretation of this pseudo R-squared? Is it a relative comparison for nested models (e.g. a 6 variable model has a McFadden's pseudo R-squared of 0.192, whereas a 5 variable model (after removing one variable from the aforementioned 6 variable model), this 5 variable model has a pseudo R-squared of 0.131. Would we would want to keep that 6th variable in the model?) or is it an absolute quantity (e.g. a given model that has a McFadden's pseudo R-squared of 0.192 is better than any existing model with a McFadden's pseudo R-squared of 0.180 (for even non-nested models)? These are just possible ways to look at McFaddenâ€™s pseudo R-squared; however, I assume these two views are way off, thus the reason why I am asking this question here. I have done a great deal of research on this topic, and I have yet to find the answer that I am looking for in terms of being able to interpret a McFadden's pseudo R-squared of 0.192. Any insight and/or references are greatly appreciated! Before answering this question, I am aware that this isn't the best measure to describe a logistic regression model, but I would like to have a greater understanding of this statistic regardless!
