Apache MaxClients when KeepAlive is Off

with apache, is it reasonable to reduce MaxClients when KeepAlive is Off ? currently, MaxClients is set to 150 , which is the default for mpm-worker . nginx serves static files and reverse-proxies to apache we are averaging around 12-15 requests per second cpu load avg is never above 0.8 on a quad-core box thanks!
