It sounds like you want to understand the in-store correlation between the pairs of variables (e.g., worked hours vs revenue). Therefore the mean(average) over the 40 correlations (or any statistic of interest - median, percentiles, etc) should give you the answer. Just note that it is not the same as "regardless-of-store" correlation between the variables --- that is the correlation between the two variables independent of the store. That can be computed by concatenating all the data from all stores and computing the correlation on all of it (assuming there is no importance to time).
