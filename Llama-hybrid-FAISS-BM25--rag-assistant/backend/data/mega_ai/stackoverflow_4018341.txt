Why does the background for some elements extend across the width of the DIV and some don't?

I have a rather colorful background, and to make the text legible, it's set on a semi-transparent background. H1, P both show the background the full width of the divs. span s and a s however only show the background for where they are. This latter behavior is what I would prefer, definitely for the Headings, but also possibly for the paragraphs as well. |-------------width of div-----------| |{Header:BG fills whole div_________}| | {LINK} | |{Paragraph:Same behavior as header_}| | {SPAN} | |------------------------------------| I'm using CSS strict HTML for preference.
