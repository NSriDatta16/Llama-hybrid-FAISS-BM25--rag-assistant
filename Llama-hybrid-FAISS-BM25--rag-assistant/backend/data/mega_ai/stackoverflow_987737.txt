Question about IPhone app bundle reasonable size for App Store. Storage memory!

I plan to submit my new app to App Store. App consist of a lot of image resources (animation) - more than 40M. Is there any formal limits at App Store of the app bundle size? I never see such condition and think it will be ok. Is it right? My major question is.. Is there any negative aspects for usability in case app is a huge? -increase user traffic -problem with installation -etc... Should I try to reduce my app size as much as I can? (actually I've done it already but size still big) I have no statistic on this point. What is the average app size at app store and how many exclusion with big size? Thanks, Mike/
