Binary logistic regression with 3 similar outcomes

I was given three binary dependent variables, which are the following: 1) Paid in Full (Subject paid their full balance) 2) Settled in Full (Subject paid 80% or more of their balance in 1, 3, or 5 payments) 3) Rehab (Subject made 10 or more payments) With these three binary dependent variables, the goal of this project is to build a predictive model to predict the odds of Paid in Full (PIF), Settled in Full (SIF), or Rehab. I have 250k records and ~500 potential predictor variables to work with. My question is how to best capture these 3 types of payers. I was told to simply combine all three dependent variables into one dependent variable, where: Paid = 1 (PIF, SIF, or Rehab) and 0 = Not Paid (All other records), and use the pool of predictive variables to predict this single outcome using binary logistic regression. However, I do not believe this is the best approach as the factors that result in PIF likely differ from factors that result in SIF and/or Rehab. Is there a better way to model this data than using only the single outcome variable/binary logistic regression? Any references or explanations are greatly appreciated!
