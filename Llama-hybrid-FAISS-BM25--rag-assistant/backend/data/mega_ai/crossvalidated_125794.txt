What are the statistical properties of a standard deviation calculated on a series of 'deviations from short term moving averages'?

Say I have a vector of daily price changes for an asset and calculate the standard deviation of daily returns in the usual way (eg. from end of day, daily price changes). Let's call this result A. Now assume that for the same asset, I also have a series of daily average prices (eg each daily average calculated from an hourly data series), from which I calculate the 'deviation from the daily average', once per day, say at the end of each day. Again I calculate the standard deviation (covering the same number of days as in A), and call it result B. What is the mathematical relationship between result A and result B? I assume there must be an easy way to convert between the two, but am unsure how to go about this. Let's assume for simplicity that the returns are standard normal iid (though it would also be interest to hear about how relaxing this assumption affects the answer - eg. if one assumes first order auto-correlation or mean reversion). Thanks, Yug
