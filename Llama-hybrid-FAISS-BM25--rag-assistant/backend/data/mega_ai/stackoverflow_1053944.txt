Uploading to Amazon S3 Services from iPhone App

I am pulling my hair out on this one... I am using the ASIHTTPRequest ( http://allseeing-i.com/ASIHTTPRequest/ ) wrapper library for accessing Amazon S3 storage. I am able to connect just fine and grab a listing of buckets without any problems. My frustration is with trying to UPLOAD (PUT and/or POST) a new object (a photo) to an existing bucket. I am following Amazon's documentation to the letter, (at least I think I am.) but nothing seems to work. Please, someone help me before I jump out of a window. I don't want to die. :-( Thanks in advance for ANY help I can get. L.
