I don't know what I was thinking when I suggested to export and import the files. I think I've been away from TortoiseSVN too long. I recall that tortoise svn actually has a really easy method of moving whole directories. It's not just obvious... but it's not clear why you can't get the result committed correctly to the repository. Presumably you did commit on the parent of all these folders. Here's the summary: You must select the folder and files you wish to move, and after doing so right click on the selection and drag it with the right button to the new location. You will get a context menu asking if you wish to relocate the files in the repository. This retains the history. Now your old files are marked for deletion and your new files should be marked as added. (I've found the status icons to be... not always representative of the true status). Commit this as one commit. I like to be picky and use check for modifications on the root of the checked out files, and then select exactly which changes I want to commit before doing so. In the case of just moving one folder like this, open a window that is a parent to this folder, and another window that will be the new parent of this folder. Right click and drag all in one motion. I can't believe it takes this much text to describe a simple mouse action.
