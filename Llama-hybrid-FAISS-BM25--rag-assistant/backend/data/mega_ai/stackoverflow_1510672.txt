The iPhone SDK provides a large collection of controls that you can leverage in your own application. For example, using the UISlider control in your app will get you a slider that looks like an "iPhone slider". This will give your application a consistent look and feel with respect to other iPhone applications that use the same controls, bringing a familiarity and ease-of-use to the user. In all likelihood Pandora's iPhone app is leveraging these common controls (as well as developing some custom controls of their own.)
