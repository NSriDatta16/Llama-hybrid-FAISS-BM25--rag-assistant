The $\chi^2$ idea only tells you that coin tossing was not involved. It won't get you to what you want to know, which is the rank ordering of the questions in terms of difficulty. The problem here is that you don't have that data or at least not as disclosed here. Imagine that the highest set of grades were 90's and nobody who got a 90 also got question 4 correct. Imagine the people with the lowest grades tended to get question 4 correct. You need to account for talent as well as percent who got the question correct. So you should have a $100\times{10}$ matrix, not a $1\times{10}$ matrix. Furthermore, question 4, if it was multiple choice, was failed at a rate less than chance. The question may not be difficult; it may have been taught badly. You could invert the idea in Item Response Theory, which assesses the ability of the person to instead assess the difficulty of the test items. You would use logistic regression on each item with overall grade by person as an independent variable. The difficulty you will have is that it is unlikely that your questions are independent. If two questions ask about the same concept, then they might be the same question. It may be the case that if you miss question 2, then you are guaranteed to miss question 3. Before you do try logistic regression, you will want to check for internal dependencies. Although inference does not seem to be your goal, you will want to do corrections on your statistical tests for multiple comparisons such as the Holm-Bonferroni. If your questions are reasonably fair, with respect to course content, and have adequate independence, then you will likely just end up with the existing rank ordering. Because you have an endogeneity issue, since getting the question correct determines the grade and not the grade determines if the question is correct, you should bring in some external source of information on talent as an instrumental variable, something correlated with the grade in the class, but not with the specific set of questions.
