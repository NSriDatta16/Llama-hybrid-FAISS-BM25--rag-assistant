Are there any matrix math modules compatible with Python 3.x?

When I began this project, I thought it would be easy to get libraries for common stuff like matrix math, so I chose to work in Python 3.1- it being the most recent, updated version of the language. Unfortunately, NumPy is only compatible with 2.5 and 2.6 and seems to be the only game in town! Even other stuff that I turned up like gameobjects seemed to be based on NumPy and therefore incompatible with 3.x as well. Does anyone out there know of a matrix library that is compatible with 3? I need to be able to do the following: matrix add, subtract, multiply, scalar multiply, inverse, transpose, and determinant. I've been looking all day and all roads seem to lead back to NumPy. I even tried this module: http://www.nightmare.com/squirl/python-ext/misc/matrix.py but it too is for 2.x. Even after converting it using the 2to3 tool, I can't get the yarn module that it refers to (and is probably itself 2.x). Any help is hugely appreciated.
