Rearrange tabs with the mouse in gvim

Is there any way in gVim to rearrange tabs by dragging and dropping them with the mouse? The behavior I'm looking for is that similar to tabs in Firefox and Chrome. I know that it's possible to change tab order using :tabm n but that requires figuring out exactly how many tabs in you'd like to move to. Using the mouse would be more useful for this spatial task. Any methods to move tabs left/right by one position would also be useful, since one could remap keys and move tabs without thinking too hard.
