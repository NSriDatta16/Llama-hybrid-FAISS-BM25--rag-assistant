Predict number of users

I have historical data (daily, weekly, monthly, however I want to slice) for a few years and I want to predict the probability of hitting an end of month target throughout the month. The data follows very similar trends, if you overlay 1 week over any other week in the year, it's practically the same line. I thought of a few ways to do this, but don't know if they're correct. Using a poisson, I can plug in the historical average values from any day $X $ to end of the month. I also have a target from day $X$ to end of month, and with the historicals, I will know how many successful times that amount has been reached. So using $P = \frac{(e^{-u})(x^u)}{x!}, ~u = $ average historicals, $x = \#$ times those historicals exceed the remaining target. since every day has a very similar outcome, I could count how many Mondays, Tuesdays.... are left in the month, calculate an interval in which I'm 99% sure each day will come in between $ X $ and $ Y$ . Add the lower and upper limits on each day and by the end of the month can I say I'm 99% sure value will be between $X_1+X_2+\ldots$ and $Y_1+Y_2+\ldots.$
