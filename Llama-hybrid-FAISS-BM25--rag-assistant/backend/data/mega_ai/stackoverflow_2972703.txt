Is there any thorough, broad documentation of Twisted that is better than the official site?

I've been looking at twisted for a while now. It looks interesting - it seems like a good way to leverage a lot of power when writing servers. Unfortunately, in spite of writing a few web servers using twisted.web (from reading other people's source and an extremely dated O'Reilly book) I've never really felt like I had reached an affinity with twisted... a level of understanding that actually gave me some of the power it seems like it has. I think I need some good documentation to arrive at a better level of understanding - I simply don't have time to pore over the source, and other threads on SO have mentioned twisted's official documentation , which is patchy at best, absent at worst, and occasionally very out of date. Is there anything else out there that is more thorough, more forgiving, and more useful, or am I stuck with another classic, boring STFU and RTFM even though TFM is not helpful? Update In response to JP Calderone's comment that I'm just having a bitch, to some extent I guess I am, but I think the breadth of the question is valid considering the breadth and value of Twisted and the lack of obvious, thorough documentation. I have a few things in mind that I wanted to investigate, but I've been getting OK results just hacking things together and asking for specifics when a deeper, broader understanding is what I'm looking for is, in my mind, not helpful. The contrast that immediately springs to mind is Django... I can read over the (very thorough) Django documentation and not necessarily know how to do everything it can do immediately, but I can get a really good overview of how I might do everything I needed to do, and know exactly where to look when the time comes.
