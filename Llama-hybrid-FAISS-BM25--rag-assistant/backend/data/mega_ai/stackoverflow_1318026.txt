Non-Data Classes Part of Model?

Are non-data classes (that are not representing anything in the database) still considered a part of an application's domain model or not? Would you put them together with your Linq2Sql domain model or somewhere else?? Edit : Info about classes: For example, I have a "StatusMessage" class which is instantiated under certain circumstances, and may be discarded, or displayed to the user. It has nothing to do with data from the database (neither retrieval nor storage). Another example is an "Invitation" class. Users on my site can 'invite' each other, and if they do, an Invitation class is created which will encrypt some information and then output a link that the user can give to someone else. I have >25 of those classes. They are not for data transfer, they do real work, but they are not related to the database, and I wouldn't say they are all 'helpers'?! ....
