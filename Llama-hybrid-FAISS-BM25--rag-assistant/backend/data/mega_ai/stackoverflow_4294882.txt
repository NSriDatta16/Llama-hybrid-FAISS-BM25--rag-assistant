Drag Files From ListView

It seemed farily straight forward learning how to process files dropped onto a ListView control. But I can't seem to find anything about dragging files FROM the ListView control. To complicate things, the ListView control is displaying an FTP directory. So I don't want to actually download the files until I confirm they have been dropped on a window that will accept them. I know that it's possible to provide the actual data for a drag-and-drop operation only after the drop has taken place. But I'm having trouble finding anything about doing this from a ListView control using C# and Webforms. Any tips? Thanks!
