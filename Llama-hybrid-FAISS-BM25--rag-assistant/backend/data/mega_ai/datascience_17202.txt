Explaining instances of a machine learning regressor

I trained an XGBoost regressor, and I'm looking for a way to interpret new instances that the model will receive in production. There's a nice solution for classification models ( Lime ), but it doesn't offer explanations to regression problems. Does anyone know of an existing "explainer" for regressions?
