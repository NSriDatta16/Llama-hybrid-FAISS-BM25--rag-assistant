reclaim space after moving indexes to file group

I have an extremely large database and most of the space is the index size. I moved several indexes to a different file group (just to experiment) but no matter what I do I cannot reduce the size of the MDF. I tried shrink database, shrink files, rebuilding clustered index. What can I do to reclaim that space in the MDF? I've moved 25GB worth of indexes to a different file group. Is it even possible to reduce my mdf by that same 25gb (or close to it)? SQL Server 2008 Enterprise Group Total Space Avail Space PRIMARY 388485.000000 27126.3125000 Index 24778.375000 26.6250000 Options I tried for shrink: TSQL: 1. DBCC SHRINKFILE (1, 10); 2. DBCC SHRINKFILE (1, TRUNCATE_ONLY); UI: Shrink database: 1. Without 'reorganize files...' 2. With 'reorganize files...' 2a. set max free space = 10% 2b. set max free space = 90% 2c. set max free space = 75% UI: Shrink files: (type =data, group = primary, filename = db name) 1. Release unused space 2. reorganize pages... setting shrink file = 2GB (max it allows) 3. reorganize pages... setting shrink file = 361,360 (min allowed) did not try 'Empty file' option because that doesnt seem like what i want.
