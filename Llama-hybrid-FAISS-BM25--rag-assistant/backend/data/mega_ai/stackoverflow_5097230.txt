I am in the same spot you are at the moment. We never get the Request.QueryString populated becasue of the "fragment" or # in the url. Love to know if you solved this and how. It does not look like the FacebookOAuthResult class was written to be used in web applications of any sort. you can change the response type in you scope paramas to be "code" then it will send back a code in the querystring in which you can swap for a token.
