How to Set formulas for a range of cells in Excel

I have started learning Excel more recently. I am learnng to use Excel Formulas. In Cell C8 I type the formula = (C8*DividedShares)/TotalShares. Divided Shares and Total Shares are named cells and I have plugged in values 12345 and TotalShares as 21000. Now I want to apply this formula from cell C9 to C1000. What is the quickest way to do it using keyboard keys.
