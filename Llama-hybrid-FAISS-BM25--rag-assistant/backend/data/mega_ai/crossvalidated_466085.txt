How to train a model with time series to predict an object's weight?

Let's say I have an object, like a ball and I want to predict its weight. I have a bunch of different sensors that record a time series of the event. Each event is a different ball I would like to predict. Here is a hypothetical dataset: This is an idea of how my data looks. I have much more sensors (s) and a lot more timestamps for each event. What I am trying to do is train a model to predict the weight of the object using the time series. What confuses me is that the weight of the object is constant, so I thought that in order to incorporate it into the model, I should just create a column with the rows being the same. Is this valid? What kind of algorithms/models should I look into for predicting a single target variable from time series records? Any advice is greatly appreciated!
