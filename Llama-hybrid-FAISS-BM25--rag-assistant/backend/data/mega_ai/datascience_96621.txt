Looking for papers within particular deep learning domain

I have labels for training data e.g. regression / classification on top of it I have some supplementary information only for the training data that shows more detailed information on the labels (how the labels were defined). I don't have this additional information for the test / dev and real life inference scenario. I wouldn't call this additional info a weak label either but I want to use that additional information to boost the model performance. I am looking for papers (in particular transformers) that show how to solve such problems... I don't know though how to find them as such problem as far as I know does not have its own name...to be used as a key-word. If I get few of them then I can easily go through references to build knowledge around this domain. Titles are not descriptive enough though to figure such use case. Any thoughts how to find them?
