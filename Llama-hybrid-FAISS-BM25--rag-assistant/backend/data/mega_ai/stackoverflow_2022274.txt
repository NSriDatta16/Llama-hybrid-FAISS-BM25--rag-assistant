Editable content area for user with restricted access

I'm building a blog for a client and they need to be able to edit a paragraph of text in the sidebar. I currently have it setup as a 'Better Text' widget which I can quickly edit for them. I don't want to give them access to the widgets, etc but they want to be able to edit it themselves. Is there an easy way to add a custom write panel kind-of-thing that's independent of the post & page structure? I know I could create a separate post category and pull the particular post into the template but i'm looking for something different. Anyone got any ideas? thanks in advance, Greg.
