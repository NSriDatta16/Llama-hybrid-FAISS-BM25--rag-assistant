The supporting code is important, but you want not to be distracted by it when you don't want to. There are two technologies that can help. A language with first-class functions will help you modularize your code so that logging, timing, and so on can be implemented once and then combined with many other modules. It will also help you write unit tests. Some good ways to learn the techniques are to read the paper Why Functional Programming Matters and to learn about the QuickCheck tool. (No, I am not a shill for John Hughes, but he does do wonderful work.) If you cannot use a programming language with powerful capabilities for modularization and reuse, or if you don't want to, Don Knuth's Literate Programming technique will help you organize your code so that you can split up parts the way you want and pay attention only to what you want, when you want. The Noweb literate-programming tool supports any language that can be written in ASCII, and also combinations of those languages.
