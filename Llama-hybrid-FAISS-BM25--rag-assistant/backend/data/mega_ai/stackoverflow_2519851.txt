How to deal with Warning C4100 in Visual Studio 2008

For some reason my Visual Studio 2008 began to show warnings for code like: "int main( int argc, char **argv)", which is really annoying. The detailed warning ouputs are (you can ignore the line numbers): 1>.\main.cpp(86) : warning C4100: 'argv' : unreferenced formal parameter 1>.\main.cpp(86) : warning C4100: 'argc' : unreferenced formal parameter I wonder if there are settings in Visual Studio 2008 that have been accidentally changed. Or how should I deal with this warning?
