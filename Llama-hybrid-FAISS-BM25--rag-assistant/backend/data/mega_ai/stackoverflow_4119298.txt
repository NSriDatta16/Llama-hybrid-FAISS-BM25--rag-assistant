Are you using a CSS reset? Browser default styles can cause irritating problems like paragraphs with differnt top margin heights or other quirks of layout. This particular case may not be fixed with a CSS reset, but it would eliminate the possibility. Sadly, the CSS3 option to set a background image scale is not yet available in any reliable way, or you could set the image as a repeating background image scaled to 50%, which of course would have no gaps. That won't be an optin for quite some time, most likely.
