Time series in an industrial environment might be difficult, as there could be several external features (such as the ambient temperature that might change with seasons), in addition to the heat sources you've mentionned. Consequently I would suggest to modelize the heat conduction with a thermal physics library (ex: https://github.com/ElsevierSoftwareX/SOFTX_2018_105 ) in order to have an accurate understanding of the influence of each heat source, and not doing mistakes mixing impacts on the system. Then, it should be much easier to evaluate the impact of each source and make reliable time series predictions, as you can accurately estimate the heat impact later on the system. This conduction heat modelling doesn't need to be very detailled: as long as the conductive components can be represented in a simple way and be able to make accurate results, it is good enough. However, in order to modelize the impact of the heat source, it would be better to know the influence of each heat source separatelly, and then evaluate the impact using both sources at the same time: the physical behavior is generally not linear when there are 2 different sources in parallel.
