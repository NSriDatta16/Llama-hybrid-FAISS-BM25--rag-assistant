EDIT: If you want more exposure to time series forecasting specifically with count data I would recommend these slides . Main things to remember: Check your data first. To use any model you generally have some assumptions that the model imposes on you. Plot your response variable, your time series, etc. Count models are useful for skewed data (that isnt normal given some transform: log, power, boxcox) when normal models arent appropriate. Check if the your timeseries data meets the assumptions of the poisson model. For example, that the variability is equal to the mean. Check for equidisperion. There are several other tests you should check before modeling: Correlograms, Augmented Dickey Fuller Test, PACF Plots, ACF Plots Do the main point of your question: How is my model performing? Standard performance metrics: MAE, MAPE, MSE Given that you may not have a bunch of exposure to timeseries modeling, maybe check out Facebook's Prophet package. It was specifically designed for data analysts who dont need/want to worry too much about model selection. That being said, prophet also has a lot of tuning parameters and things. At the very least make sure you research the assumptions of these models before you use them!
