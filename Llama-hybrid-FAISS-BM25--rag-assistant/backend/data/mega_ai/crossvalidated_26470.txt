First of all, you shouldn't use backwards selection (nor forwards nor stepwise). The p-values will be too small, standard errors too small, parameter estimates biased away from 0. Not good. Second, I notice that the facility_or_organization variable has 65 DF, indicating that you had 65 different facilities. It also looks like you had two incidents per facility - this is drastic overfitting Third, in the pdf, note the ominous warnings Warning: The maximum likelihood estimate may not exist. Warning: The LOGISTIC procedure continues in spite of the above warning. Results shown are based on the last maximum likelihood iteration. Validity of the model fit is questionable. SAS' notes are often ignorable, it's warnings rarely are. Finally, to properly fit this model, you have to either forget about the facility variable, or group the facilities somehow, so the model isn't overfit.
