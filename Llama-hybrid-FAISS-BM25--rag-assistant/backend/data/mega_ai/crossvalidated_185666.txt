A simplistic approach: The one on the top is easy, you just put a threshold $t$ (e.g. at t=15) on the data itself, i.e. you discard any points that have a value $y_i > t$. The other one can be caught with a threshold on the first order difference of the points, since it is several times further away from its neighbours than all the other points. That means you would discard any points that have a value $d_i = | y_i - y_{i-1} | > t$. This would also catch the first error. The second idea can be extended to the comment of tho_mi, where you would not only calculate $d_i$ but $\left | y_i - \sum_{j = i-10}^{i+10} y_j \right|$, i.e. the difference between $y_i$ and a running average around it.
