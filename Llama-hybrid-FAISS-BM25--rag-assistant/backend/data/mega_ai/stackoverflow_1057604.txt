Depends entirely on your visitors behavior. If you anticipate/get a very low repeat visitor rate over the course of a month, or you have an average number of page views per-visitor between 1-2, you should place all JS and CSS directly on the page to cut down on HTTP requests. However if most of your visitors are looking at 2+ pages that use the same resources, you'll want to put everything in external js/css files. Whether you separate your resources into multiple files will depend on how often visitors land on pages using the same resources. For instance, you might want to place the CSS/JS for a contact us or similar not-so-often visited page in its' own files.
