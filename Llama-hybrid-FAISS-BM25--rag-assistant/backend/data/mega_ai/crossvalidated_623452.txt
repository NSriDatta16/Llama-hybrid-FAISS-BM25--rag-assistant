By sampling from the data, bootstrap tries to mimic how you sampled the data from the population . By repeating the procedure, you simulate the distribution of different possible samples could you have taken from the population. The same as you can take the actual data $\mathbf{x}$ and calculate some statistic or use an estimator $T$ using the data $\hat \theta = T(\mathbf{x})$ , you could do it with the bootstrap sample $\mathbf{x}^*$ to get $\hat \theta^* = T(\mathbf{x}^*)$ . So yes, it can be applied to nearly † anything. As a result, you obtain a sample from the distribution of the estimates $\boldsymbol{\hat\theta}^* = \big\{ \hat\theta^*_1, \hat\theta^*_2, \dots, \hat\theta^*_R \big\}$ . Now, you can use different statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, quantiles, histogram, etc) to summarize or visualize the distribution. Usually, you would be using bootstrap to estimate the uncertainty due to sampling of the estimate $\hat \theta$ , so you would be calculating things like quantiles or variance. The mean or median of the bootstrap distribution would not be very interesting, because the distribution would be centered at the original estimate $\hat\theta$ , but perturbed due to random sampling. The confidence interval is around the original estimate $\hat\theta$ , not around the mean or median of the bootstrap distribution. So in this case, it appears that the above Bootstrap procedure I described will be calculating and placing bounds on the "Average Median" - and not on the Median of the Medians. I do not think it would be correct to take the median of all bootstrapped medians and then calculate the Confidence Interval around the "Median of the Medians". What you would usually do is you would take quantiles of the bootstrap distribution, i.e. the 95% confidence interval around the median calculated on the raw data $\hat\theta$ would be $\big[Q_{0.025}(\boldsymbol{\hat\theta}^*),\, Q_{0.975}(\boldsymbol{\hat\theta}^*)\big]$ where the $Q_{q}$ is the $q$ -th empirical quantile of the bootstrap distribution. As @Silverfish noticed below, bootstrap however would not help you to find the “variability of medians” but the variability of some statistic due to sampling. If your data is medians and you want to find the variability of it, just calculate the variance of the medians. † - see comment by @whuber below.
