Not sure if I completely understand the question, but ultimately, if you want your MyString to have all the same methods as String , then at some level your class must also have all of the same methods defined. You can't really get around this. You can probably come up with neat ways so that for every method you don't have to type return text.blah() , something more elegant than that; but I don't see any way how you could avoid having the method definitions in your MyString at all.
