How can I read a directory in Perl with one statement?

I'm writing a script that looks for certain files in a directory and processes them. I keep on writing the following: opendir DIR, $dir; @files = readdir DIR; closedir DIR; While I could (and in fact should ) wrap this in a function, I was wondering if there's a more elegant way to do this?
