authlogic crashes with infinite recursion

I have some trouble with using authlogic in my rails app, so I began using the blank example from github.com/binarylogic/authlogic_example which doesn't work either. I spent a day installing ruby 1.9.1 and 1.8 and jruby1.8, neither did work. The fun thing is that another rails app worked on my server. That said, I just cannot see where the code breaks or where the difference is. Here's the output that gives shared/log/mongrel_debug/threads.log: Mon Oct 12 19:23:53 +0200 2009 REQUEST /favicon.ico 0.0.0.0:7102 -- THREADS: 1 ----- KEYS: -- # : [:started_on, :__recursive_key__] After some time after the request it times out with a 500. Am I right assuming that it's an infitite recursion in some piece of code? My server config is: Linux xxxxxx 2.6.28-11-server #42-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 17 02:45:36 UTC 2009 x86_64 ruby 1.8.7 (2008-08-11 patchlevel 72) [x86_64-linux] gem -v: 1.3.5 rails 2.3.4 (any lower version doesn't change it) So far it doesn't depend on the database or the rails version. The only thing that enables the app again is commenting out the #acts_as_authenticated, so I assume that there's some kind of trouble with authlogic and my server conf. Locally it still works (OSX 10.6.1) I searched google for some hours and built an authlogic app from scratch. If you have any idea what else I could search on or what I could check out, give me a hint! Thanks a lot in advance! Till
