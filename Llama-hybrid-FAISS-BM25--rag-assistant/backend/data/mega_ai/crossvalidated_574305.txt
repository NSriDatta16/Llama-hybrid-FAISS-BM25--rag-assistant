Z - Score between average scores

I have a test that gives students a score between 0 and 10. Students can be black, white, asian or hispanic. I want to compare the average score of each race against the overall average, and I want to compare pairwise averages e.g. Average score of Black candidates vs Average Score of White candidates. To do this comparison, I would like to calculate the Z-score. Is this the correct way to do so: (Average Score of Black students - Average Score of White Students) / (Standard deviation of test scores)? My main concern is with the denominator. I don't know if using the standard deviation of test scores applies when I compare averages?
