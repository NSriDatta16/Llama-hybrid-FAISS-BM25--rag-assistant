The first thing I see is that the acceptance height for in reviewscript.js is oX 84 || oY 19 which tells me that you're only paying attention to the upper 19 pixels. You're using stars as uls in the page you linked But in style.css, you assert that these stars are 25 pixels high #star ul.star, #star ul.star0 { ... width: 85px; height: 25px; ... So automatically you're ignoring mouseovers on the lower quarter of your image. Also, given the behaviour of the stars (in my Firefox) where I can start changing a stars rating and continue changing it while waving around in the white space about the stars, going about as far vertically as the 0-19 range would lead me to expect that either the star image is padded with white space at the top or you're star-drawing code is drawing the star lower than it's supposed to.
