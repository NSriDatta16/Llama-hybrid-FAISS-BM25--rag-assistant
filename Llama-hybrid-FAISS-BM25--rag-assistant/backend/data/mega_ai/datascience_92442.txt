3 images as one input in CNN (U-Net)

I have been advised by my supervisor that if my U-Net segmentation network has RGB images at the input then I could use the channels for different images - median filter for R, normalization for G, canny-edge detection for B (example). I have no idea how to do that. Tried to find something similiar here but unfortunately without a success. Would be greateful if somebody could explain me this in detail, I'm new in DL. Thanks
