It makes sense if you remember that X is a statistical ensemble , which has associated with it some probability distribution. For instance, the Wikipedia article for information-theoretic entropy consistently uses the notation $H(X)$ . In that sense, it’s actually the Q that’s extraneous. I can speculate two reasons your instructor includes the Q there. The Q could be there to remind you what the associated probability distribution is. It could also be a preface to introducing concepts like cross-entropy, where you may take your average over a different distribution P. (The cross-entropy Wikipedia article exclusively uses distributions over the same support as arguments to the cross-entropy function.)
