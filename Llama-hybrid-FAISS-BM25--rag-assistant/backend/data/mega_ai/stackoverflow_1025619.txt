Update 2010, as pointed by the OP and in this answer , the special string // @formatter:off in Eclipse 3.6 is enough. It was not available at the time of the question. Original answer: June 2009, Eclipse 3.4/3.5 With the Java Formatter ( Windows > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter ), you can create a new Formatter profile. In the Comments tab (in eclipse3.5), you can make sure, in the " Javadoc comment settings ", to uncheck " Format HTML tags ". Check also the " Never join lines " in the " General settings " section. Then your comment should be written as: /** * PSEUDOCODE * Read in user's string/paragraph * * Three cases are possible: * * Case 1: foobar * do case 1 things * Case 2: fred hacker * do case 2 things * Case 3: cowboyneal * do case 3 things * * In all cases, do some other thing */ Note: I have made a Javadoc comment, and not a simple comment, as I believe a comment with that much text in it may be better placed in front of a method. Plus, Javadoc sections have more formatting parameters to play with. If it is in front of a method (true Javadoc), the HTML tags , and will help to present it properly within the Javadoc view.
