Embedding Windows media player in C# any other alternative?

I am using embedded version of Windows media player 11+ using C# in a windows application. Is there any better alternative to play audio? I am looking to play audio and will not be playing videos at all. Windows media player plays well but I am curious about other alternatives as well.
