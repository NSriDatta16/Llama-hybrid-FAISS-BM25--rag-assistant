Rather than try to use a dll file directly I suggest you re-build it using Matlab's MEX functionality. Yes, a mex file is a dll and you can build dlls outside Matlab and use them successfully, it's a lot easier, for a beginner such as I guess you to be, to use MEX. One way in which it is easier is that, if you build a mex file, the system won't ask you for a header file which is, as you know, a rather foreign concept to a Fortran programmer. Another way in which MEX will make your life easier is that you can then call the function exposed by the dll directly from Matlab's command line, without loadlibrary. Study the Matlab documentation on MEX files, pay particular attention to how to integrate Fortran this way.
