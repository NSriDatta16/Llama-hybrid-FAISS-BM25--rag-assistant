If you specify a linear relationship between current consumption and past government spending, and assume a stochastic relation (otherwise you should not be asking this question in CV), you will have $$Y_t \equiv C_t + I_t + G_t$$ $$C_t = a + \sum_{i=1}^k\beta_kG_{t-i} + u_t$$ Combining your model becomes $$Y_t = a + \sum_{i=1}^k\beta_kG_{t-i} + G_t+I_t+u_t$$ which is a standard distributed-lag formulation, rather than a time-series model (for which we expect lagged dependent variables in the RHS). If we want to view the above as a regression specification, $$Y_t = a + \sum_{i=1}^k\beta_kG_{t-i} + \beta_{0}G_t+\gamma I_t+u_t$$ we have two a priori restrictions on the parameters, $\beta_{0} = \gamma =1$. Estimating such a regression, the fitted values plus the residuals will always equal the dependent variable, thus respecting the initial identity. The residuals are to be interpreted as consumption fluctuations, while the constant term is the average value of the part of the consumption that does not depend on past government spending (essentially, the constant term is the mean value of the error term).
