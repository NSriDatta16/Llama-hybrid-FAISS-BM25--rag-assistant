Some curiosity about dice coefficient calculation

In semantic segmentation task evaluation with the following properties : batch size of the test set : 4 shape of a target mask/predicted mask : (1, 512, 512) number of batches in the test set : 30 used dice score calculation formula : Sum of [(2 x (target_batch * pred_batch).sum + 1e-8) / (target_batch.sum + pred_batch.sum + 1e-8)] In order to evaluate a model's performance with the Dice Coefficient, which one is a proper way to do it? evaluate summed DL(according to the formula given above), and divide it with 30 (# of batches in the test set) to give an averaged final Dice Score evaluation of the model. Set batch size of the test set as 1 (single sample), and evaluate summed DL(according to the formula given above). Then, divide it with the sample size of the test set to give a final Dice Score evaluation of the model. Also, I would like to know why is that a proper way to do it.
