Using Sentence-Bert with other features in scikit-learn

I have a dataset where one feature is text and 4 more features. Sentence-Bert vectorizer transforms text data into tensors. I can use these sparse matrices directly with a machine learning classifier. Can I replace the text column with tensors? Also how can I train the model. Below is the code I used to transform the text into vectors. model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/LaBSE') sentence_embeddings = model.encode(X_train['tweet'], convert_to_tensor=True, show_progress_bar=True) sentence_embeddings1 = model.encode(X_test['tweet'], convert_to_tensor=True, show_progress_bar=True)
