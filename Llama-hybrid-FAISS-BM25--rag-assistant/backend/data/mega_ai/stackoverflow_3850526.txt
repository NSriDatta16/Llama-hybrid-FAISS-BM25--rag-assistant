Well, after almost a month without an answer, I decided to go with manual tab key handling. Works like a charm but it now ignores the url bar in the tab cycle (fine by me). I used this blog post to get going: http://albertattard.blogspot.com/2009/11/capturing-tab-key-in-gwt-textarea.html I simply added a focus panel at the root of my dialog.
