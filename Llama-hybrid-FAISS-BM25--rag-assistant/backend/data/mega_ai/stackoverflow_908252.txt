Detecting SSDs is not as impossible as dseifert makes out. There is already some progress in linux's libata ( http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2009-04/msg03625.html ), though it doesn't seem user-ready yet. And I definitely understand why this needs to be done. It's basically the difference between a linked list and an array. Defragmentation and such is usually counter-productive on a SSD.
