Relations and differences between time-series analysis and statistical signal processing?

I was wondering what relations and differences are between time-series analysis and statistical signal processing? I found some recommendations of books in time series including some books in statistical signal processing. But I am not sure how these two areas are related and differ? Thanks and regards!
