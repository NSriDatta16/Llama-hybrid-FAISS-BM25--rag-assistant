Number of trees for Random Forest optimization using recursive feature elimination

How many trees would you suggest to pick to perform recursive feature elimination (RFE) in order to optimize Random Forest classifier (for binary classification problem). My dataset is very high-dimensional (> 200 000 features), and I usually select ~ 10 000 trees while running a classification without feature selection. But I am just wondering whether it is enough to set it as ~ 500-1000 for RFE in order to save time and RAM. P.S.: I use 'randomForest' and 'caret' R-packages if it makes any difference.
