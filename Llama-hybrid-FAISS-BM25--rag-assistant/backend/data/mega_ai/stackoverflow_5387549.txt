Sure, because it is more performant in this query: you need to read full index and after that iteratively read row by row from data. This is extremely unefficient. Instead of this mysql just prefers to read the data right from the data file. Also, what kind of storage engine do you use? Seems like mysam. For this case innodb would be more efficient, since it uses clustered indexes over primary key (which is monotonously growing in your case).
