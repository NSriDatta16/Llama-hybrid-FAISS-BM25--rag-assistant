The Android docs say ldpi is for "for 100 to 140 dpi screens." and mdpi is for "140 to 180 dpi", which indicates 140 could be correctly reported as mdpi (to something does not necessarily mean that it includes that something). The compatibility test suite does, however, appear to indicate 140 should be classified as LDPI, so it's probably worth raising this in b.android.com as a bug stating the platform your running on.
