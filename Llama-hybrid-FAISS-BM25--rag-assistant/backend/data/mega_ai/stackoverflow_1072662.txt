By Emacs, how to join two lines into one?

I am new to Emacs. I have googled this but no good answer there. One of them is Ctrl-n Ctrl-a Backspace This works but is stupid. Is there a quick and simple way to join a block of lines into a single line? Actually, I can use Esc-q to auto-fill a paragraph now, but how could I get it to revert without UNDO?
