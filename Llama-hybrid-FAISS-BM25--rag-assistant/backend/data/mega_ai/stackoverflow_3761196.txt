Iphone : detecting drag / swipe direction starting from a button

I trying to make a swipe mechanism for a view that might have buttons on it. Without a button its a piece of cake. However if your finger starts on the button, you can trigger an event (drag outside) but that does not tell me the direction. So how can I detect the direction of a swipe / drag where your fingers starts on a button? Any ideas? Thanks Simon
