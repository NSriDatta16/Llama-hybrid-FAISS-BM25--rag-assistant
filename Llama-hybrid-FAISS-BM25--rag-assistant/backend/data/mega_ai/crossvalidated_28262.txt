Differencing an i.i.d. time series

Why differencing a normal, i.i.d. time series $X$, generates a negatively correlated series $Y$? > Acf(rnorm(5000, 0, 40)) > Acf(diff(rnorm(5000, 0, 40))) I stumbled on this problem while looking at a time-series that I wanted to predict using an ARIMA model. The original series appeared to be non-stationary by looking at the plot, so I decided to apply a difference at lag 1 and check the acf/pacf. This seemed to indicate an MA(1) model but obviously there is something I'm missing.
