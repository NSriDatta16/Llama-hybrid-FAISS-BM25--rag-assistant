Adaptive optimization of django transaction size

I'm bulk loading data into a django model, and have noticed that the number of objects loaded into memory before doing a commit affects the average time to save each object. I realise this can be due to many different factors, so would rather focus on optimizing this STEPSIZE variable. What would be a simple algorithm for optimizing this variable, in realtime, while taking into account the fact that this optimum might also change during the process? I imagine this would be some sort of gradient descent, with a bit of jitter to look for changes in the landscape? Is there a formally defined algorithm for this type of search?
