Shawn Wildermuth gave a talk last night in Atlanta and he discussed some of the potential compatability issues with the Elevated Trust ( not Full Trust) on the Mac. He mentioned that Drag-and-Drop support is going to be difficult because of the way Safari/Firefox (can't remember which one) is used to run out-of-browser on the mac. HTML embedding on the Mac might also be an issue. Shawn is speaking at notatpdc.com tonight about SL4 features. You might want to attend and ask: http://www.notatpdc.com/Schedule/Detail/20 (note, time is central time).
