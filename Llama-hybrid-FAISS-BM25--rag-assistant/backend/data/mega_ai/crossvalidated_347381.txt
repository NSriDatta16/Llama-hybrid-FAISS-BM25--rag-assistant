A common approach to handle many zeroes in a time series is to use a Croston Model . To implement this model with your time series there are two R packages forecast and tsintermittent . The tsintermittent package optimizes the Croston model $\alpha$ parameter whereas the forecast package produces a forecast for a given $\alpha$ value. This is not the only approach to forecasting a time series w/ a sequence of zeroes but is a common approach. Another approach would be to fit a zero-inflated or hurdle model. However, as mentioned in the comments of the post by the OP, the measurements could be continuous on the positive half-line. With non-negative measurements and a zero point mass the most likely approach would be a Tweedie regression.
