Using SHAP or LIME to explain new predictions?

I've previously used SHAP and LIME to explain predictions from a training set, i.e. I have the actual target value. Is it possible to do the same to explain new predictions, i.e. I don't have the actual value to know how accurate my prediction is yet? A use case could be forecasting a future value using a model trained on an existing time series. Whilst I can't tell how accurate the model is yet - it would be useful to know which features are contributing to a particular prediction.
