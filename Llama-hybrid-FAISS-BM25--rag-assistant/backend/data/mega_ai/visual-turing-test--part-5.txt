m the region being referred to in the proposed question, are dropped with the assumption that the uniqueness questions with a positive response if dropped can alter the response of the future instantiation questions. The history of questions obtained after this first stage of pruning can be referred to as H q ′ {\displaystyle H_{q}'} . In the second stage an image-by-image pruning is performed. Let q i {\displaystyle q_{i}} be a uniqueness question in H {\displaystyle H} that has not been pruned and is preserved in H q ′ {\displaystyle H_{q}'} . If this question is in context of a region which is disjoint from the region being referenced in the proposed question, then the expected answer to this question will be 1 {\displaystyle 1} , because of the constraints in the first stage. But if the actual answer to this question for the training image is 0 {\displaystyle 0} , then that training image is not considered for the probability estimation, and the question q i {\displaystyle q_{i}} is also dropped. The final history of questions after this is H ~ ( q , I ) {\displaystyle {\tilde {H}}(q,I)} , and the probability is given by: P ^ ( X q = 1 ) = # { I ∈ T , H ~ ( q , I ) = 1 , X q ( I ) = 1 } # { I ∈ T , H ~ ( q , I ) = 1 } {\displaystyle \quad {\widehat {P}}(X_{q}=1)={\frac {\#\{I\in T,{\tilde {H}}(q,I)=1,X_{q}(I)=1\}}{\#\{I\in T,{\tilde {H}}(q,I)=1\}}}} Attribute questions: The probability estimator for attribute questions is dependent on the number of labeled objects rather than the images unlike the instantiation questions.Consider an attribute question of the form : ‘Does object ot have attribute a?’, where o t {\displaystyle o_{t}} is an object of type t {\displaystyle t} and a ∈ A t {\displaystyle a\in A_{t}} . Let A {\displaystyle A} be the set of attributes already known to belong to o t {\displaystyle o_{t}} because of the history. Let O T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}_{\mathbb {T} }} be the set of all the annotated objects (ground truth) in the training set, and for each o ∈ O T {\displaystyle o\in {\mathcal {O}}_{\mathbb {T} }} , let T T ( o ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}_{\mathbb {T} }(o)} be the type of object, and A T ( o ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}_{\mathbb {T} }(o)} be the set of attributes belonging to o {\displaystyle o} . Then the estimator is given by: P ( X q = 1 ) = # { o ∈ O T : T T ( o ) = t , A ∪ { a } ⊆ A T ( o ) } # { o ∈ O T : T T ( o ) = t , A ⊆ A T ( o ) } {\displaystyle \quad P(X_{q}=1)={\frac {\#\{o\in {\mathcal {O}}_{\mathbb {T} }:{\mathcal {T}}_{\mathbb {T} }(o)=t,A\cup \{a\}\subseteq {\mathcal {A}}_{\mathbb {T} }(o)\}}{\#\{o\in {\mathcal {O}}_{\mathbb {T} }:{\mathcal {T}}_{\mathbb {T} }(o)=t,A\subseteq {\mathcal {A}}_{\mathbb {T} }(o)\}}}} This is basically the ratio of the number of times the object o {\displaystyle o} of type t {\displaystyle t} with attributes A ∪ { a } {\displaystyle A\cup \{a\}} occurs in the training data, to the number of times the object o {\displaystyle o} of type t {\displaystyle t} with attributes A {\displaystyle A} occurs in the training data. A high number of attributes in A {\displaystyle A} leads to a sparsity problem similar to the instantiation questions. To deal with it we partition the attributes into subsets that are approximately independent conditioned on belonging to the object o t {\displaystyle o_{t}} . For e.g. for t = {\displaystyle t={}} person, attributes like crossing a street and standing still are not independent, but both are fairly independent of the sex of the person, whether the person is child or adult, and whether they are carrying something or not. These conditional independencies reduce the size of the set A {\displaystyle A} , and thereby overcome the problem of sparsity. Relationship questions: The approach for relationship questions is the same as the attribute questions, where instead of the number of objects, number of pair of objects is considered and for the independence assumption, the relationships that are independent of
