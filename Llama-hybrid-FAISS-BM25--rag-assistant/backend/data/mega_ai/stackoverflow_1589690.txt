What to use for C# SlimDX Game UI

I am currently developing a 3d game using C#/SlimDX (The target is Direct3D 9). I've been looking for a suitable Game UI toolkit for a while, but I was unable to make up my mind. The Game UI will be for a roleplaying game, so it'll be fairly complex and will involve quite a few controls (text boxes, inventory grids, list boxes, select boxes, scrollable areas, etc.). I previously (When i was still using C++/OpenGL) looked at GameSWF and very much liked the idea, but for my current game it's out of the question. Does anyone know a good GUI toolkit for use with SlimDX? I would be especially interested in using WPF/Silverlight for this, since there are good IDEs available for both. But a quick google search didn't reveal any information on embedding these.
