RNN to model DNA sequencing classification

I have a DNA sequence dataset each mapped to a certain class. e,g TCAGCCGAGAGCTCATCGATCGTACGT 2 ATGCAGTGCATCGATCGATCGTAGAAC 3 Where the number after the sequence specifies the type of protein this sequence belongs to. So my question can I use KMers and 1-HOT-Coding to classify these sequences through biLSTM. Or this is not a possible concept and I would appreciate your feedback and suggestions on this task as I am new to Deep Learning. Thank you.
