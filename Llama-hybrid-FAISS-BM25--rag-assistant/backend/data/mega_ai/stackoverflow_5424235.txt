No, the copy() function is not recursive : it cannot copy folders and their contents. But if you take a look at the **users's notes** on that manual page, you'll find some propositions of recursive implementations. For example, here's a recursive function proposed by gimmicklessgpt (quoting his post) : Edit after the edit of the question : You are calling your function passing it parameters : recurse_copy($src . '/' . $file,$dst . '/' . $file); But your function is defined as taking no parameter : function recurse_copy(){ $src = dirname(__FILE__).'/themes/'; $dst = dirname( STYLESHEETPATH ).'/'; ... You should correct your function's definition, so it takes parameters -- and not initialize those $src and $dst inside the function, but on its first call.
