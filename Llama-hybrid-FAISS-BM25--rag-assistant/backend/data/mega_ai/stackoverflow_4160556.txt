The point of the salt is not to make a single password stronger. It is about preventing the attacker from scaling up, when attacking several passwords. With the salt, the attacker cannot reuse his efforts into attacking another password; he must rehash his dictionary. Rainbow tables are nothing magical; they are just a special case of a precomputed table, which is akin to a simple dictionary attack with slightly distinct space-time modalities. Building the rainbow table implies more or less going through the complete dictionary. Precomputed tables are a gain for the attacker if he can use them to attack several passwords. If passwords are salted, then precomputed tables, rainbow or not, will not gain him anything. That being said, a single password is often weak and can be brute-forced, because the average password will fit in the average user brain, and, as such, cannot be very complex. To mitigate that risk, one should use repeated or iterated hashing. A salt does not help here (but it does not harm either). See this answer for details.
