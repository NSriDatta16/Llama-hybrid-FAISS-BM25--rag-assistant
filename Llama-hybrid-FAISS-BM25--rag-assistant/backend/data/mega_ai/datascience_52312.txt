The problem is a case for "deep learning", I think, and I would start with boosting. I have good experiance with catboost (in Python). It can handle factors very well ("catfeatures", encoded as dummies) and it is relatively fast. Also lightgbm might be a good option. Also xgboost is an option. I think data-wise one hot encoding and scaling is the first thing to do. Things beyond that is a bit try and error. The most important part might be that you tune your hyperparameter well (during boosting).
