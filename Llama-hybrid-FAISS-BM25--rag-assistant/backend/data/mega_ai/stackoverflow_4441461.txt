I can't install RouteMe in Xcode

I'm trying to install the Route-Me library in Xcode so as to convert coordinates in my iphone application. I have follow this page : https://github.com/route-me/route-me/wiki/Embedding-Guide However, I don't have a "MapView.app" (in paragraph "Configuring build dependencies"). I don't know how to install this library. Xcode can't compile. Is there someone who can help me ? Thanks Best regards Etienne
