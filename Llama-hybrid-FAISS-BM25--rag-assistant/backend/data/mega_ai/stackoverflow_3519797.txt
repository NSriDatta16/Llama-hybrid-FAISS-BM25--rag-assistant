LWP::Parallel http://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::Parallel "Introduction ParallelUserAgent is an extension to the existing libwww module. It allows you to take a list of URLs (it currently supports HTTP, FTP, and FILE URLs. HTTPS might work, too) and connect to all of them in parallel , then wait for the results to come in." It's great, it's worked wonders for me...
