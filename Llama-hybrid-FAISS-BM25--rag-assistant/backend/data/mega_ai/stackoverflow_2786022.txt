No need for anything fancy. Any platform with a good C99 math library (like the iphone) already has everything you need -- specifically the erfc function, which is a slight variant: #import double cumulativeNormal(double x) { return 0.5 * erfc(-x * M_SQRT1_2); } Note this is for the standard normal distribution (i.e. mean = 0, variance = 1), you'll need to use the appropriate scaling -- so for some mean and variance, it will be: return 0.5 * erfc(((mean - x)/sqrt(variance)) * M_SQRT1_2); If you don't need double precision, change the doubles to floats, use the erfcf function, and change the literals to single-precision literals. Remember, Objective-C is an extremely light extension to C. Every C function is an Objective-C function, with no wrapping or other shenanigans required.
