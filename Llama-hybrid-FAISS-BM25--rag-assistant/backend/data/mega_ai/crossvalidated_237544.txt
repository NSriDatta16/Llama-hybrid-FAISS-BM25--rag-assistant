I'm adding this as an answer as the discussion was getting too long for chat. Your original question has to do about how to use k-fold cross-validation. As the name suggests, it is a technique for validation of a specific model. If as you require you want to combine the five models to produce an "average" model this is independent of k-fold and moves into the realm of ensemble models. Use k-fold to assess stability of your model based on standard deviation. Build a model using the entire training set. Predict on test set and assess model performance. The question of reporting "average performance" is a personal choice. There is no right or wrong approach, however doing so you would be advised on researching ensemble models instead of k-fold cross validation. In fact, you could end up doing a k-fold cross validation of an ensemble model too!
