Setting up a Bayesian Model using Titanic data

Trying to set up a Bayesian model using the Titanic data available online, specifically making inferences on the data using a Bayesian approach. I want to investigate how survival of a passenger is affected based on characteristics like sex (male and female; 2 levels) and passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd; 3 levels). The data denotes whether a passenger survives or not (1 or 0). What I would like to find out Is survival of a passenger affected by a passenger's sex? For example: Is a passenger more likely to survive if they are a woman? Is survival of a passenger affected by passenger class? For example: Is a passenger from 1st class more likely to survive compared to a passenger in 3rd class? Is survival of a passenger affected by sex and passenger class together? Example: Is a man from 1st class more likely to survive than a woman from 3rd class? I initially thought to set up priors and likelihood so that I can obtain a posterior distribution to make inferences on (following a Bayesian setup). But that was not a great approach. I also thought I could assume that survival followed a Binomial distribution (since the outcome was either 1 or 0) but that is not the case since the probability of survival for each passenger is not the same. I think I am headed towards Bayesian inference on a logistic regression or a multilevel model. I have an idea of how this would be setup using frequentist methods, but Bayesian model setup is giving me a lot of trouble and I'm not sure where to begin.
