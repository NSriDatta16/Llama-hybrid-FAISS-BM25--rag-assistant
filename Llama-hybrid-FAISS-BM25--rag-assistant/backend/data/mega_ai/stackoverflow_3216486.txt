Really strange behavior when trying to implement touch events

I'm working on my first iPhone application, and I'm getting some very strange behavior when I try to implement touch events. I set up touchesBegan:withEvent: and its sister methods under a subclass of UIViewController , but they aren't registering. What's even weirder is that when I try using touches on the simulator while running the console, the console logs my touches, even though I have no NSLog statements in my program at all! At one point, I set up NSLog statements under touchesBegan:withEvent: etc., but I deleted them soon after. I have no idea where these logs are coming from. Is this some issue with the responder chain? Why is the console behaving so weirdly? Any ideas?
