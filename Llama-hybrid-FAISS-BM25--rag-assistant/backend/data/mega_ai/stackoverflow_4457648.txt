Are you using AOP for your beans, probably for transaction demarcation ? If No, please remove because those are indicating spring to do load time aspect weaving and it's failing because Tomcat's classloader does not support the method addTransformer. If Yes, Probably you will have to follow the instructions given at http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/instrument/classloading/tomcat/TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader.html or and if you are ok with runtime proxy based AOP, you can go ahead with simpler method described at http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/transaction.html (Section 9.5 onwards)
