A scatter plot matrix (SPloM) is an elegant solution to the problem. Combined with the brushing interaction technique you will be able to see what is going on in your data. In your case, you may probably want to encode the categorical variable through color in each scatter plot forming the splom. As a tool, I would suggest vega-lite but there are also dedicated R packages for this special purpose, for example the recent DataExplorer package. Find here a link to an actionable vega-lite example .
