1) I try to get involved with my local user groups for c# it would be a Microsoft Technical User group http://www.microsoft.com/communities/usergroups/default.mspx They are usually a bunch of like minded individuals who want to learn about the new features in certain tools. Microsoft are generally very good at helping to fund these groups and talks and seminars are held frequently. Often with the developer who created the tools you want to learn more about. 2) Get some RSS Feeds/News letters to c# sites such as C# Corner or Channel 9 They are usually the places 3) Oh and as mentioned by others, read a LOT and try stuff out . It's not easy to keep up with the new features but read about them, try them out on small little stand alone projects and have fun with them. I don't know about you but I derive great satisfaction from getting something new and cool to work. As the Pragmatic programmers would say, improve your tool belt all the time.
