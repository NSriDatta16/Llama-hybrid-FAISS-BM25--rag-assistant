Tracking down a performance issue like this can be tricky, but there are a few things you can do to improve / fix things. First off, starting PowerShell cold versus warm. At least on my workstation, the first time I run PS in the morning, it takes a bit longer to launch than subsequent times. Is there a way you can keep it warm to minimize the load times? Second, use a tool like Process Monitor from the fine folks working for Windows Sysinternals . Set it to monitor the powershell.exe process and see what it is doing that is taking so long. For me, I have a number of mapped network drives and shared scripts that get sourced from the network. In my testing, I measured about a two second delay in starting per remote script I was loading. PowerShell does need to load a bunch of resources from disk into memory, so it should go without saying that having your I/O system perform optimally will help as well. Defrag, make sure you have ample free RAM, etc. It even queries quite a bit from the registry so you may want to ensure your registry is completely defragged - though that is quite a long shot.
