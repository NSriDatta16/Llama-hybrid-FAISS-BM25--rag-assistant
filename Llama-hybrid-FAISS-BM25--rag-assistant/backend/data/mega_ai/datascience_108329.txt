Extracting Public Page Posts from Facebook

I am a data science student working on my capstone research project. I am trying to collect posts from a number of public organization pages from facebook. I am looking at the graphs api and it does not appear to have an endpoint for this use case. The page/feed requires either moderation access of the pages(which i do not have) or public page read access which requires a business application. The CrowdTangle process is not accepting researchers outside of very specific subjects at this time. Is there a process to get these posts that does not involve scraping page data or having people manually record each post? I do not wish to break any terms of service.
