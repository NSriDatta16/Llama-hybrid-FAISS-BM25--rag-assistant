Given the domain is a digital card game, deck value and game play strategy can be simulated. The wide space of options can filled in with synthetic data. Classic machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression and boosted trees, will have limited success given the sequential nature of the problem. It would be more useful to frame it as reinforcement learning problem which has built-in modeling concepts of sequential decision and "exploration" of different strategies.
