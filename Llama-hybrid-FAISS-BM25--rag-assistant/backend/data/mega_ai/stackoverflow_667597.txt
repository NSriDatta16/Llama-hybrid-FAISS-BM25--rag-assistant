If you want to simulate a hard crash such as a bluescreen, you'd pretty much have to yank the power cord. NOT recommended. In case of a crash, anything not saved to persistent storage will be lost. If you want to simulate a crash for purposes of logging, write a "kill switch" into your logger, which stops the logging. Now you can simulate a crash by killing the logging and making sure you have the data you would have wanted in case of an actual crash.
