Your concern is in the independence part, and the reason is that the trees are generated from a same training dataset. To this point, the equation (15.3) and the paragraph just below that states that (emphasis added and typo fixed): $$ \hat{f}_{rf}(x) = \mathrm{E}_\Theta T(x; \Theta) = \lim_{B\to\infty} \hat{f}^{B}_{rf}(x)$$ ... The distribution of $\Theta$ is conditional on the training data . Conditional on the training data, the randomness of trees only comes from the sampling process of the learning algorithm. So tree estimators can be seen as samples from an identical and independent and distribution.
