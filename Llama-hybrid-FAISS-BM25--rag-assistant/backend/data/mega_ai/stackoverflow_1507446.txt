I do not see any "obvious errors" that previous posters did not mention, other than the fact that, with the break, you no longer need both "i" and "numGuess" as they would always have the same value. Just use numGuess instead of "i" in the while's condition. But I would like to highly recommend you to make your code more readable - the best time to get into the habit of good coding style is now, before you acquire and solidify bad habits. Always use self-describing identifyers (variable/function names). E.g. your "x" should really be called "maxGuesses". Don't skimp on white space. E.g. "}while(i You seem to have already gotten into the habit of not skimping on comments - good!!! Just remember that the comments should always describe the purpose behind what the code does instead of the mechanics of how it does it unless the mechanics is so tricky and clever that it also needs explanation. The reason that this is important is two-fold: 80-90% of development time/efforts are usually spent on maintaining existing code, your own or someone else's. That task is VASTLY easier with well documented and easily readable code. (you have no idea how much brain damage someone can sustain from reading unfamiliar code at 2am during production problem just because the bozo who wrote it didn't indent the code consistently). Having well documented and readable code makes it easier for you to write it, since it clarifies your own thoughts and discourages stupid typo-originated bugs ("oups, i meant to use x instead of y").
