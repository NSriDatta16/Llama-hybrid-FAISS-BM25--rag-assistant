I would say, go with multiple databases AND multiple schemas :) Schemas in PostgreSQL are a lot like packages in Oracle, in case you are familiar with those. Databases are meant to differentiate between entire sets of data, while schemas are more like data entities. For instance, you could have one database for an entire application with the schemas "UserManagement", "LongTermStorage" and so on. "UserManagement" would then contain the "User" table, as well as all stored procedures, triggers, sequences, etc. that are needed for the user management. Databases are entire programs, schemas are components.
