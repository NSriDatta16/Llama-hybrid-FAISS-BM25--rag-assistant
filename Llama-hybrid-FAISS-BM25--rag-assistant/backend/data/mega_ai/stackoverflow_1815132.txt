I think you are mixing two terms. System testing is a testing phase while Use Case Testing is technique of designing test cases based on use cases, that can be used on many testing levels. For example: 1) In Use Case Testing you create Test Cases based on Use cases. The system, or at least components involved in given use case should be developed, build and integrated. One may want to check if two modules involved in given Use Case are working together properly. So in your Integration Test you prepare test case based on use case that exposes cooperation of those two modules. 2) When you are doing System Tests as part of them you can do Use Case Testing - to confirm that behavior specified by Use Case works as it should. But as Robert Harvey pointed out, System testing is to examine compliance with requirements so it makes both positive testing and negative testing. Therefore System Testing not only covers expected behavior described in Use Cases, but also tries to 'break' the system from specific requirement point of view. 3) Additionally it should be mentioned that as Use Cases contain some expected user actions they make good starting point for User Acceptance Testing . On the other hand as user don't want to check Login Use Case but rather Login and do some stuff and observe some effects part of their business process so merely checking Use Cases is not enough. Use Cases Are some starting point but UAT usually will require tests going deeper into the buisness process that given software should support.
