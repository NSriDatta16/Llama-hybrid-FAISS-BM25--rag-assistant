If you really need all these routes accurately calculated and stored in your database, it sounds like (and I would believe) that you are going to have to spend the money to obtain this. As you can imagine, this is expensive to develop and there should be renumeration. I would, however, probe a bit about your problem: Do you really need all 5000! distances in a database? What if you asked google for them as you needed them, and then cached them (if allowed). I've had web applications like this that because of the slow traffic ramp-up pattern, I was able to leverage free services early on to vet the idea. Do you really need all 5000 points? Or could you pick the top 100 and have a more tractable problem? Perhaps there is some hybrid where you store distances between big cities and do more estimates for shorter distances. Again, I really don't know what your problem is, but maybe thinking a bit outside the box will help you find an easier solution.
