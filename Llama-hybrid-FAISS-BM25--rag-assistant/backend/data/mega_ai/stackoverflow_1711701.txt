WPF Dynamic Binding X and Y Co-ordinates

I have a question on WPF dynamic positioning. I want to place Elipses on the screen based on X and Y co-ordinates that i have stored in a collection in C#. I have been made aware of the drawing ability in WPF which you do from C# using the Windows.Media and Windows.Shapes. Now what i actually want to do is use these namespaces to draw the elipses in the first case in a canvas all done in c# using my datasource that i have in c# to position the elipses using the x and y co-ordinates. Now the complex part which is confusing me is what if the data in the datasource is changed as the data in the database changes, i will implement some sort of routine that checks the database every few seconds pulling back back any data that has changed since the last retrieval. Now i have seen the IPropertyChanged interface which i will inhert from for my class that i expose as my datasource for the page so when i retrieve the updated dataset i can call the PropertyChanged event which will notify WPF that the datasource has changed. How would i bind the elipses in the UI when i was laying them out originally in C# to certain items from the datasource so when the datasource changed the elipses would automatically change as required to reflect the changed datasource as long as the ID for each x and y co-ordinate remained the same. So can i bind to specific rows from the collection for each elipse in my canvas when i'm setting them out? I don't even know if its possible to bind a datasource to a Canvas inside which i can use the collection as i require to begin with but i thought i'd put this question out there incase someone has done something similar so i have a good starting point. Thanks Iffy.
