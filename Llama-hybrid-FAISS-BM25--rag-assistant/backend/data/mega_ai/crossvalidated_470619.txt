Omitted variable bias in ordered logistic regression query

Including too few variables in OLS regression means that the coefficient estimates can be biased, e.g. if we aren't controlling for a variable in a model that should be there, it is instead captured by the error term, so an estimated coefficient could be overestimating the effect of an independent variable on the dependent variable. When it comes to ordered logistic regression (dependent variable has an ordinal ranking of say three categories), does the effect of an omitted independent variable follow the same logic as in OLS, where the estimated coefficients can be biased? Help appreciated!
