How to add a UserControl to a Window in BlendDesigner?

I am a beginner in using Blend and WPF in general. I created three user controls. I also created a Window which should house the user controls. Is there any designer way, like drag dropping the user control into the Window which will make it appear automatically?. Or typing in the XAML is the only way to include it?
