Use XPath with PHP's SimpleXML to find nodes containing a String

I try to use SimpleXML in combination with XPath to find nodes which contain a certain string. Test Find me! Find me! EOC; $xml = simplexml_load_string($xhtml); $xml->registerXPathNamespace('xhtml', 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'); $nodes = $xml->xpath("//*[contains(text(), 'Find me')]"); echo count($nodes); Expected output: 2 Actual output: 1 When I change the xhtml of the second paragraph to Find me! then it works like expected. How has my XPath expression has to look like to match all nodes containing 'Find me' no matter where they are? Using PHP's DOM-XML is an option, but not desired. Thank's in advance!
