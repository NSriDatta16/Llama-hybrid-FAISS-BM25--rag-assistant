Accuracy of election polls

There are a number of questions about election polls and margin of error that have been covered in CrossValidated over the years, including one regarding the 2016 US election polls. That one however only addresses validity based on members of a particular poll knowing each other. In so many cases the state polls showed Clinton beating Trump above the margin of error. Yet states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida and Michigan were predicted to be won by Clinton but subject to recount all went to Trump. Of course there are many factors that could affect the accuracy of the polls and the validity/lack of validity of the margin of error. Among those that I can think of are: difficulty selecting a random sample of likely voters the election was volatile and hence present opinion may not reflect future opinion selection bias could exist Which of these possibilities do you think caused the inaccuracy of the polls or do you have another explanation? What assumptions about statistical surveys are most commonly violated.
