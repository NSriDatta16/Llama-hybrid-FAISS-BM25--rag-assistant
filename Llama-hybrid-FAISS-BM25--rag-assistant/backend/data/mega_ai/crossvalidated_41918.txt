Negative number of parameters in hierarchical bayesian model

I'm using Deviance information criterion to assess the fitness in my Bayesian hierarchical model. The functional form of this criterion is as follows: $$DIC=p_{D}+\bar{D}$$ where $p_{D}=\bar{D(\theta)}+D(\bar{\theta})$ is effective number of parameters and $D(\theta)=-2log(p(y|\theta))$, $p(y|\theta)$ is sampling distribution and $\theta$ are unknown parameters. And the problem is that the effective number of parameters when I use expectation as an estimes of $\theta$ is negative, however if I plug in a medians as estimates of parameters - $p_{D}$ is positive. I know that negative $p_{D}$ indicates prior-data conflict in non-log-concave distributions, but the the visual inspection of the fitted values indicates very good fit. So, is it ok to use median as paramete estimates instead of expectations in DIC?
