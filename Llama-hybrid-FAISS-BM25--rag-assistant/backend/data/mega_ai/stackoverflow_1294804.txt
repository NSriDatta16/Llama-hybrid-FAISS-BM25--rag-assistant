I suspect the intent of the question is to first define a class Stack as you have which has the capacity to store ints. then declare a class inherited from stack called Queue which has it's own addtoqueue and servefromqueue functions but uses the same storage mechanism as Stack. Given your implementation this may seem a little strange, but they probably intended some kind of linked list implementation of the stack (which has the advantage of not having a predefined upper limit) in which case the queue inherited from stack makes clear design sense.
