It seems like there are three valid definitions in the case of PCA: Matrix-wise L2: Whole matrix $\bf{X}$ $ || \bf{X} - \bf{X_r} ||$ Row-wise L2: Feature vectors on dataset $\bf{Y}$ : $ \sum_i{|| \it{y^i} - \it{y^i_r} ||}$ Elemental L1: Per-element (or pixel) error on dataset $\bf{Z}$ : $ \sum_{ij}{|z^{ij} - z^{ij}_r|}$ Where each of the three cases could wind up being slightly different. The definitive norm and reconstruction error would be the type 3 L1 norm summed per-element. However, the other two may be more forgiving and relevant in different domains. In terms of the LDA, when you go about implementing the LDA you can reconstruct the data with computed intermediate components. But, you will still be using covariances or other computed components that rely on the SVD. So, analyzing a PCA based on your SVD solver that you use for your LDA implies that your LDA has the same reconstructive ability, assuming it is implemented correctly.
