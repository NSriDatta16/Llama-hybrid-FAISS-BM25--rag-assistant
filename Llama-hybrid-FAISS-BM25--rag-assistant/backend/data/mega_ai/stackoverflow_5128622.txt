After some desperation and bad-sleeping nights, trying to discovery memory leaks or some other memory troubles, we concluded for the most practical solution: Extract only the code part needed to load a file and export it as U3D to a small program and make the main CAD application call it. Even though it is not the most elegant solution, it really works well - none of the processes reaches memory usage even close to the 2 GB barrier. I wish I had been authorized to solve things this way earlier. I proposed some other things like: migrating to 64 bits use an option that modern Windows versions support for extending the memory limit of each process to more than 2 GB None of these two solutions were acceptable, because it would be needed to force some customers to reinstall already-running hardware or software.
