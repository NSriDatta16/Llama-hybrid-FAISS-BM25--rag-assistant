Determine time gaps from list of time-spans (not covered by the spans in the list)

I have a list of time-spans (given as Integer-Tuples), e.g.: timespans = [ (1200, 1210) , (1202, 1209) , (1505, 1900) , (1300, 1500) , (1400, 1430) ] I want to find an elegant Haskell solution to determine time gaps which are not covered by the timespans in the list.
