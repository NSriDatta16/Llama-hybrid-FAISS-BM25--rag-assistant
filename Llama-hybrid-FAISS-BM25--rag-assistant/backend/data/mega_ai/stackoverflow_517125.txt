Dynamic xsd and Biztalk 2006

I'm sort of a biztalk newbie and we run 2006 here with plans to migrate to 2006 R2 in the future. I have a schema that I need to work with called Siri, which is public at: link text or link text for the root xsd document. I have successfully imported this schema into my biztalk project, however, I am finding it difficult to get my head wrapped around how to use this since this xsd schema is all xsd:choice and xsd:group nodes. Also there is only one targetnamespace at the root element. My project is to consume estimated timetables of buses and then insert this data into a database table. After working with the schema in Biztalk I'm finding it difficult to promote elements in order to filter and create/work with mappings (haven't really got that far yet). Can anyone point me in the right direction in some documentation/websites or basically how I should approach this? Has anyone worked with a schema like this in biztalk 2006 and if so how did you approach message mapping, retrieval of data from the xml and inserting into the DB? I can post up a sample xml payload if anyone would like to have a look..
