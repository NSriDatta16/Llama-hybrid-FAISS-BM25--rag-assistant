I've always found it tough to handle the multiple (annual, weekly, daily) seasonality of electricity load/price data using time series methods. I use an approach (very) similar to IrishStat's except that I forecast the daily peak (MW) and total energy (MW/h) using machine learning methods (as opposed to time series), and then construct a linear regression model for each hour (1-24) of the day. The forecasted peak/total energy are features in each of the hourly models. The rest of the features are basically the same for all 26 models, with day of week, holiday and season represented as dummy variables. Obviously weather and lagged dependent variable values are also important features. As an aside, six months of data is really not ideal regardless of your approach because this is clearly a process with an element of annual seasonality. Normally I'd say you need three years to properly train and test your model. With less than a year, you can't even fully assess those annual seasonality effects. If you do go the time series route, just dumping the holidays will be a problem if you have a weekly seasonality term, e.g. if you try to explain the following Thursday's load as a function of the load on Thanksgiving.
