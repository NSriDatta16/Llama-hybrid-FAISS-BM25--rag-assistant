Fast data retrieval in MySQL

I have a table of users - It contains around millions of rows (user-id is the primary key). I just want to retrieve user-id and their joining date. Using SELECT user-id, joining-date FROM users requires lot of time. Is there a fast way to query/retrieve the same data from this table?
