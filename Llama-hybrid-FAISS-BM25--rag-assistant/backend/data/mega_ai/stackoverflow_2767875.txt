dismissModalViewControllerAnimated: crashes in Simulator but not on phone

I'm doing the following: [self.parentViewController dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES] This code fails using the Simulator but works with no issues on the phone itself. The Simulator's console shows no erros. I used NSLog statements to pinpoint this line of code as the culprit. When running on the phone, however, the console(window>organizer) shows that the above code is executed and the application proceeds forward with no problem. When running the code in debugger, the following statement appears at the bottom of the Xcode debug window: GDB: Data Formatters temporarily unavailable, will re-try after a 'continue'. (Not safe to call dlopen at this time.) Then a window dispalys stating: Loading 43672 stack frames. (that sounds bad) In the debug window the following line appears numerous times: [UIView(Hierarchy) _makeSubtreePerformSelector:withObject:withObject:copySublayers:] Without getting too deep into my code, does anyone know about or have experience with this type of condition? Thanks
