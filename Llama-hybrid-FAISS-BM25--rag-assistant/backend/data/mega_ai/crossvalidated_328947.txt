How to compare annotations by two groups?

I have two groups of test persons that manually created multiple annotations for different underlying, unknown values (each person created multiple annotations). I'd like to find a statistical test that tells me with a given confidence level that the annotations by the two groups are of the same quality. Quality being expressed in terms of the variance of their annotations. (Artificial) examples for annotations: Annotation by person1: {100, 101, 99, 98, 100, 101} Annotation by person1: {50, 49, 49, 49, 50, 51} Annotation by person2: {12, 12, 13, 12} ... To compare the series individually, one can use the Coefficient of Variation , i.e. $c_v=\frac{\sigma}{\mu}$. This addresses the fact that the series all have different means and describe different true values. And to compare two $c_v$ one can use the Asymptotic test for the equality of coefficients of variation from k populations (Feltz and Miller 1996) . But how do I test for equality of many (hundreds) time series (each with a different mean, but similar $c_v$) from two groups ? What I really want to test is the equality of the annotations by group . What if I simply compute the $c_v$ for all series and treat these $c_v$-values as two distributions. One for group1 and one for group2 . I could test for significant differences in these two distributions using t test . Would this approach allow me to judge with confidence whether the annotations by members of the two groups are of equal quality? If not, can you suggest a better approach? Thank you.
