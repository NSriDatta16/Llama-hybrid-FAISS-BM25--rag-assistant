Example for Boosting

Can someone exactly tell me how does boosting as implemented by LightGBM or XGBoost work in real case scenerio. Like I know it splits tree leaf wise instead of level wise, which will contribute to global average not just the loss of branch which will help it learn lower error rate faster than level wise tree. But I cannot understand completely until I see some real example, I have tried to look at so many articles and videos but everywhere it's theoretical. If someone can share some smal working example or any article that would be really helpful. Thank you so much.
