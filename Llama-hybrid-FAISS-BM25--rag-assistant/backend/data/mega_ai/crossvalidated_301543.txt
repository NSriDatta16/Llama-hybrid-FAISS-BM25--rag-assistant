Your rules may give you a way to perform data augmentation . Copy a positive sample, change the age to 17, and then mark it as a negative sample. This procedure won't necessarily be trivial or useful for all datasets. I work with NLP data and it's tricky to do well in that domain. For example, if you have other features correlated with age, you may end up with unrealistic samples. However, it provides an avenue to expose the system to something like the samples that didn't make it into the dataset.
