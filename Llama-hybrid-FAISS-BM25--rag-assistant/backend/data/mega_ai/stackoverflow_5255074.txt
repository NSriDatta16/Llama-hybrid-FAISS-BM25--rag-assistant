Is it possible for PHP to use the HTML 5 geolocation without using a javascript?

Is it be possible for php to use HTML 5 geolocation? The idea is the navigator.geolocation can be used only using javascript.But what if the device turn off its javascript or no javascript support. PHP can pull out the navigator.userAgent and they do it by $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . I dunno how they do it so there should be a way to use the PHP to access navigator.geolocation without using javascript.The question is how? Thank you.
