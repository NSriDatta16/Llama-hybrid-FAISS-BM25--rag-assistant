The code looks like it works well but the devil is always in the details when it comes to performance. Here are a few thoughts: Consider changing the vector declaration from : from: std::vector &words to : std::vector &words This will create a pointer and assign it an address of the string as opposed to copying the contents of each string into the vector. Try to use vector::reserve to pre-allocate the memory needed to process the string. A rough estimate might be text.length() / maxWidth. Pay close attention to the string operations that are being used. It's very possible that there are alot of temporary strings being generated and immediately thrown away. The best way to find out if this is happening is to step through your string manipulation lines and see if there are extra string constructors and copy constructors ocurring.
