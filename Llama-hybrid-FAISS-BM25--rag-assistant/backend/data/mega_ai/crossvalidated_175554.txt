Each curve shows you the classification error rate versus the number of trees in the forest for a given class. The black curve is just the average error rate over all classes. To find out which class each non-black curve represents, a quick and dirty tip consists in comparing the stabilized error rate (given by the plot) to the class error values of the confusion matrix (returned by a call to your randomForest object). PS1: Annotating plots is not related to statistics and therefore should be asked on Stack Overflow rather than Cross Validated. PS2: remember to use set.seed() to make your example fully reproducible when it involves some degree of randomness (in your case with sample() ).
