Factor analysis and logistic regression

I have done factor analysis on 18 variables and got a 5 factor solution. Denote: $X=(X_{1},X_{2},.....,X_{18})$ as the variables and $F=(F_{1},F_{2},..,F_{5})$ as the factors. Thus we have a loading matrix $L=(l_{ij})$ which is a $18\times5$ matrix where $l_{ij}= {\rm Cov}(X_{i},F_{j})$. So, I computed the factor score component matrix by least squares method which can be computed by using the formula: $\hat{F}=(L^TL)^{-1}LX$. After computing the factor scores for each respondent, I fit a logistic regression model with a response variable (binary variable) on the factor scores and extract the significant factors. My Question: After the loading matrix have been computed we have: $$ X_{i}=l_{i1}F_{1}+l_{i2}F_{2}+l_{i3}F_{3}+l_{i4}F_{4}+l_{i5}F_{5}; i=1,2,...,18 \tag{1} $$ and when we are estimating the factor score component matrix we have: $$ F_{j}= \alpha_{j1}X_{1}+\alpha_{j2}X_{2}+....+\alpha_{j18}X_{18}; j=1,2,..,5 \tag{2} $$ While interpreting the factors I came up with the following: Let's fix $i=1$ in Equation1 and $j=2$ Equation2 , then shall the signs of $l_{12}$ and $\alpha_{21}$ be the same $?$ Could anyone justify why or why not the signs would be the same$?$
