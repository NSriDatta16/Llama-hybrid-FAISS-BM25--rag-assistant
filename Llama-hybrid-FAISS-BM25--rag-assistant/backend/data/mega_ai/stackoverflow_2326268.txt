NGramJ seems to be a bit more up-to-date: http://ngramj.sourceforge.net/ It also has both character-oriented and byte-oriented profiles, so it should be able to identify the character set too. For documents in multiple languages you need to identify the character set ( ICU4J has a CharsetDetector that can do this), then split the text on something resonable like multiple line breaks, or paragraphs if the text is marked up.
