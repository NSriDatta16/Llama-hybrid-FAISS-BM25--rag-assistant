Magento custom attribute default value not showing in front end

I have added some custom attributes to the products in the admin section of our Magento 1.3.2.1 installation and I've given some of those attributes default values. The problem is that the default values aren't being returned when I try to get the attribute from the product object as follows: $_product->getCode() Logically, I would imagine that the default value gets returned if there isn't one stored against the product, but this doesn't seem to be the case (unless I'm plainly missing something). The list below is all the current settings for one of the attributes that isn't returning the default value set. Attribute Properties: Attribute Code: code Scope: Store View Catalog Input Type for Store Owner: Text Field Default value: value Unique Value: No Values Required: No Input Validation for Store Owner: None Apply To: All Product Types Frontend Properties: Use in quick search: No Use in advanced search: No Comparable on Front-end: No Use In Layered Navigation: No Use In Search Results Layered Navigation: No Use for Price Rule Conditions: No Position: 0 Allow HTML-tags on Front-end: Yes Visible on Product View Page on Front-end: Yes Used in product listing: Yes Used for sorting in product listing: No Thanks for your help!
