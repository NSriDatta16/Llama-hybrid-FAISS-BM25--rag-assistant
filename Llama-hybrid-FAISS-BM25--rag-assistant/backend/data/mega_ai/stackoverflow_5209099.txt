There is good basic documentation on how to work with sqllite in android. Check out http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#db to get an overview on how to use sqllite in your application. Basic idea is to extend http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteOpenHelper.html class and from there do the rest of CRUD operations on your database. Also i forgot to mention: preferably avoid using openorcreatedatabase method, recommendation is to keep using sqliteopenhelper instead
