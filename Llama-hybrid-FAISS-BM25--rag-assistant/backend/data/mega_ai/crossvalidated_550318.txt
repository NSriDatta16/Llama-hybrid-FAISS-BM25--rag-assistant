Targeted Maximum Likelihood for ATE, why not just GLM for ATE?

I have been attempting to learn targeted maximum likelihood (TMLE), which is a struggle. The estimand of interest is often the average treatment effect. If we have an outcome $Y$ , intervention $A$ and a set of covariates $W$ this is defined as, $$ATE = $$ $$E_W( E(Y|A = 1, W) - E(Y | A = 0, W)) = $$ $$ E_W( E(Y|A = 1 ,W)) - E_W( E(Y|A = 0,W))$$ where $E_W$ denotes the expectation with respect to the distribution of the covariates. Why do we need targeted maximum likelihood here? For any GLM I can estimate $E_W( E(Y|A = 1,W))$ by first just finding $E(Y|A = 1,W)$ explicitly from the GLM (similarly for $E(Y|A = 0,W)$ ) and marginalizing out over the distribution of my covariates. What is TMLE getting me here that traditional MLE of a GLM is not?
