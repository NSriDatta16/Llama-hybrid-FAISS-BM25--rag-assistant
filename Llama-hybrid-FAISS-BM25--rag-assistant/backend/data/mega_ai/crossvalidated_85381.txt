Use a baseline including all observations in lm()

When using factors in a linear model, I would like to retrieve the 'average' effect as baseline (intercept), rather than level 1 of all factors. Is this possible? tab returns something like (Intercept) pred2 0.5879712 1.8542153 coefficients are on average 1 for both intercept and pred2. I would like to rather have intercept = 1.5, pred1 = -0.5 and pred2 = +0.5 model.matrix(mylm) returns (Intercept) pred2 1 1 0 2 1 0 3 1 0 4 1 0 5 1 0 6 1 1 7 1 1 8 1 1 9 1 1 10 1 1 attr(,"assign") [1] 0 1 attr(,"contrasts") attr(,"contrasts")$pred [1] "contr.treatment" I would like a matrix like this (Intercept) pred1 pred2 1 1 1 0 2 1 1 0 3 1 1 0 4 1 1 0 5 1 1 0 6 1 0 1 7 1 0 1 8 1 0 1 9 1 0 1 10 1 0 1 Does that make sense? if not, why? Is there some command to generate such a design matrix? I've been looking for a way to do this without success...
