MCMC is not needed (or suggested) in order to compute a MAP estimate. In general, you won't be able to solve for the root of the MAP objective's derivative. However, you can use numerical optimization to approximately maximize the objective. As noted, MCMC is a sampling method, whereas MAP estimation is an optimization problem. MAP estimation only requires us to be able to evaluate the (unnormalized) posterior distribution at a given $\theta$ , and only gives us one piece of information about that posterior. By approximately sampling an intractable posterior, MCMC methods allow us to learn all information about the posterior distribution.
