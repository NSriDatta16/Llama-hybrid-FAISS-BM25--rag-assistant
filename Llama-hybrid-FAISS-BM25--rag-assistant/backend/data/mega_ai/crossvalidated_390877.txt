Where to include Dropout in stacked autoencoder

I'm using Keras to implement a stacked autoencoder, and I think it may be overfitting. I wanted to include dropout, and keep reading about the use of dropout in autoencoders, but I cannot find any examples of dropout being practically implemented into a stacked autoencoder. Where would the dropout layer(s) go, between every layer, only after the input layer, is anyone able to let me know/provide some resource implementing this?
