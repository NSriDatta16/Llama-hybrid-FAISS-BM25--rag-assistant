Android: Group notification in status bar but not in notifications list

Does anyone know if there is a way to group a notification in the status bar but not in the list of notifications? I want to show only one icon in the status bar but when the user drags down the "notifications list" it should be several notifications with different intents. As I understood there is only possible to either group both notifications on both places or to create several notifications which will cause several notifications in the status bar. Is this the case?
