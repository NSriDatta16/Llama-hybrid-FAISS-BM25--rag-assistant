Regression for discrete values?

I am a novice in machine learning/statistical algorithms, but I have worked with some simple classifiers and regression. I would like some opinions on whether I am going the right direction or not, given my limited knowledge. My problem is the following: I would like the best prediction for the price of an input item given the known price of the most similar items in a database. At first, this sounded like regression problem, but my features are both discrete and contiguous. For example, item make/model is discrete while year of manufacture is contiguous? Now, I am thinking of finding $x$ closest matches via Euclidean distance, and then weighted average + somehow making sure the certain feature match exactly (like item model type). Thanks.
