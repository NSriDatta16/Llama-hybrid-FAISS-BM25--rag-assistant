I would suggest that it is very unwise to have different code in development and production. Your development, test and production environments should be as similar as possible. In fact, I would go so far as to say the entire point of the different environments is to simply provide an easy system for allowing minor configuration changes between setups. Different databases, different API parameters, different aching options, but the core system MUST be the same. The the issue you will face is doubling your development effort. You still have to write the code. So in the search example you provide above, you will have to develop and test twice - once for the Solr production system and once for you local Sphinx, then you need to be able to switch and test between the two approaches in all of your environments to ensure test coverage and functionality.
