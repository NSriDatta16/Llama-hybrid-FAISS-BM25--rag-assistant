I think that what you have is an 'adjacency matrix' not a truth table and that you are looking for all the 'fully connected subgraphs' of the graph of which the adjacency matrix is a representation. Fully connected subgraphs are also known, if memory serves, as 'cliques'. I'm not terribly sure about what you are looking for; as one of the earlier respondents indicated there are some discrepancies between your words and your matrix. Do some googling around on those terms; right here right now it's too late for me to dig this stuff out of either my head or my library. Note that your graph is symmetric, that is if '1 is compatible with 2' then necessarily '2 is compatible with 1'. Now that's halved your data storage requirements (made them more complex, storing the upper or lower half of the matrix is often more mind-bending than the space it saves warrants). I think also that you should probably have 1s along the main diagonal, to express the idea that '1 is compatible with 1'. Eventually, I suspect, you'll have some elements which are only compatible with themselves. Finding cliques in a graph is, sadly, NP, but for matrices of only 5000x5000 elements a brute-force naive algorithm shouldn't take too long in a compiled language. Regards Mark
