Because renderer's can be very touchy (for good reason), you have to pay careful attention to the overall formatting of any given report. Sometimes page breaks (or even page overflows) appear in the strangest circumstances, a lot of times because the width of the "page" is too large for the format to which you are rendering. This can also happen in the vertical (which is what I think is happening in your situation?), so you might want to see if one of your row elements could possibly be expressing itself in a way that is much larger than seems when viewing in the designer. Generally speaking, you should try to keep things as simple, and conservative (with respect to formatting dimensions) as possible. One of the most common problems with page-breaks/overflows, is that something looks fine in the HTML version (through SSRS report manager), but then the slightest boundary encroachment causes the PDF exported version to go all out of whack. Also, read up closely on what those page break configuration settings are actually doing. The settings in the report designer, can easily cause side effects that cancel out other configurations.
