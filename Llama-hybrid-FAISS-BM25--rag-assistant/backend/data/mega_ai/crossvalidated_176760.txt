A binomial distribution has the standard deviation $\sqrt{np(1âˆ’p)}$. When you find the standard error of $\bar{x}$, you divide the standard deviation by $\sqrt{n}$. You are confusing the Bernoulli with the Binomial. A binomial random variable is a sum of Bernoulli rvs with common mean $p$. $\hat{p}$ is a sample average of iid Bernoulli random variables with common mean $p$ and standard deviation $\sqrt{p(1-p)}$. Therefore, that is the standard deviation you divide by root n to get the standard error of the sample proportion.
