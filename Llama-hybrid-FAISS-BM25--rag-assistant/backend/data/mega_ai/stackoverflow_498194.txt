good open source project using Dependency Injection Framework?

does anyone know about an open source project Implementing Ninject Framework or another one, I haven't work with a DI framework before and Ninject calls my attention because you don't need to have your configuration in XML files. i tend to grasp a lot more when reviewing already implemented code. also if you know about another good projects using different DI frameworks? Thanks,
