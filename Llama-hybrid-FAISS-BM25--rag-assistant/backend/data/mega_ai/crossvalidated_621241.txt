What stats test to use for a time to event analysis for tumor formation in mice in R

I am working on a project where we are injecting mice with a virus to induce gene deletions and cause tumor formation. We developed a new gene deletion method and want to see if it causes tumors to grow faster than the standard method. Would a KM curve be ideal for this? And how can we determine if the difference in time to formation is significant. I am new to stats and data analytics. edit for more details We are injecting mice with two different Ad-Cre recombinase solutions (Injection A (control) and Injection B (test)) to induce genetic deletions to grow tumors. We check the mice once a week for palpable tumor, and once one is felt, we measured with a caliper until the tumor had a volume of 1cm^3. In terms of what data was collected: we have the date of injection, date of when the tumor was at the threshold volume (unfortunately, serial measurements were not collected to determine a rate of growth or anything of the sort), and when the mice expired (either naturally due to the tumor or sacrificed). We have 35 mice in each group, our primary variable of interest was a binary: did more tumors grow with Injection A (12/35) or Injection B (31/35). But, based on a macroscopic view data collected we thought an interesting secondary outcome to evaluate time to tumor formation since the test injection group grew tumors in 2-4 weeks, versus the control groups growth in 250 days. Obviously, at first glance there is an obvious signal there. I was unsure if we could just perform a simple unpaired t-test to see if the average time to tumor formation has a significant difference, but I thought that would be too rudimentary, thus my question about KM curves. Thanks for the helpful tips and advice, much appreciated! We are hypothesizing that this new ad-cre system develops more tumors in a mouse colony, and does so quicker and in the desired location (arm, leg, body, etc). We initially ran a two sample Z test, to determine the the difference in proportion of tumor was significant, and are now looking at if the time to tumor growth is significant.
