Few of the major PHP frameworks implement MVC. Most use some variant of " Passive-MVC " or "Model-View-Presenter". They're following the concept, not the actual MVC pattern (which is a runtime organization for graphical apps, not for generating page output). That's not to say the PHP interpretation of the concept doesn't bring any benefits. It's commonly believed to provide a better structure for large or growing web apps. It's less useful for implementing simple tasks.
