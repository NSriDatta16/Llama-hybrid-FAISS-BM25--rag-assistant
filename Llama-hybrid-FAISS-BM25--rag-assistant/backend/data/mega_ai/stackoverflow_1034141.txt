Excluding Item from DataList

In onItemDataBound event of the ListView I am checking the data and under certain condition I dont want this item to be part of the DataList. If I make it invisible it will still be accounted for in DataList. It will just be invisible and the sepatators and its place in tilibg will still be there. Is there way to exclude the item from DataList like it never existed in the datasource? Thanks, Dragan
