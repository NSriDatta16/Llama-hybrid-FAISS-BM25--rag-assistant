Well, abusing a lot of technical details, DCC GARCH is a "weighted correlation" in some sense ... while your rolling window correlation is also a "weighted correlation" where weights follow a specific pattern ... then significantly simplifying the only difference is in the weighting scheme for modelling association=correlation ... Obviously DCC GARCH employs far more complicated weighting scheme than a simple rolling window (e.g. all observations in DCC are taken into consideration and etc.), so the question is, do you really needs this extra complexity? If you pursue "diagnostics" of association between variables goals then probably rolling window correlation is sufficient ... if refer to the fundamental summary work (at least in the context of volatility modelling) Andersen, T. G., Bollerslev, T., Christoffersen, P. F., & Diebold, F. X. (2006). Volatility and correlation forecasting. Handbook of economic forecasting, 1, 777-878. it all starts with a rolling window weighting scheme and gets more complicated as we move further on. Well, again to non technical audience the difference is how you assign weights to measure your dependence, rolling window is a very rough weighting scheme, only certain period equally weighted observations are taken into consideration. For example (the most simplified one I guess), observations that happened long before have no impact on your association measure while in DCC GARCH they are taken into account, though receive less attention=less weight (maybe even significantly less weight) but still influence your final association estimate. Hope it helps.
