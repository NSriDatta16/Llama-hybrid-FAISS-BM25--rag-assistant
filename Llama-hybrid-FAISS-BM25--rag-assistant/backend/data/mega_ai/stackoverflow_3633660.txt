JSF2: Handling Data between ManagedBeans

I am confronted with a problem I don't find an easy suificiant way: I use different ManagedBeans to organise my views. There are controller that manage actions and passes data from/to persistence layer. Further there are models that lie behind the views and contain their data. Controller which are RequestScoped initialise the model (-managedBean) and fills it with data. Model (-managedBeans) are SessionScoped. That worked well so far. But how can I pass data between two requestScoped controllers? My Controller initialises the model and when I want to work with data it is always gone because with any request data in my models are refilled by empty objects. I would like to extend my question : I'm doing it like Bozho posted it already. But my 'anotherBean' (like he called it) is null after some times? Does JSF recreates beans for some reasons?
