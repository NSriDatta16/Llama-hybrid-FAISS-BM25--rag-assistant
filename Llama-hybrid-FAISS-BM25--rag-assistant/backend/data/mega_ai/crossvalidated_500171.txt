How to do the sensitive analysis for the prior?

I understand bayesian people always do the sensitive analysis for the study. However, I am confused how we set the sensitive analysis. My question is how we set the parameter's for the sensitive analysis? Is there any applied Bayesian hierarchical paper we can see for the sensitive analysis? For example: we have a prior for the m~ dnorm(0,1) the possible sensitive analysis set m~ dnorm(0,100) set m~ dnorm(100,1) set m~ dnorm(100000,100000) set m~ dgamma(0.5,1) which sensitive analysis make more sense? Thanks
