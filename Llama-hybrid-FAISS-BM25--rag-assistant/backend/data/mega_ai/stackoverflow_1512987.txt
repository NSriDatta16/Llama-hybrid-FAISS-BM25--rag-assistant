I see no reason not to compile and run them both at O2. Unless you're doing it as a purely academic exercise (and even if you were it's very unlikely the optimizations would produce fundamental changes in the properties of the algorithm - Though, I think I'd be happy if GCC started turnning O(N) source into O(lgN) assembly) , you'll want information that's consistant what you would get when actually running the final program. You most likely won't be releasing the program with O0 optimizations, so you don't want to compare the algorithms under O0 optimizations.
