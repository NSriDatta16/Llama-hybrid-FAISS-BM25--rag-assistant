rules.out actually has to be an entire class that needs to be instantiated for code to be executed. Since rules.out is generated by third-party application, best thing would be to write your own CppToJavaTransformer that reads file rules.out as input and generates Rules.java . This assumes rules.out is available before compile time and Rules.java will be used at compile time. Drawback of this is that there is an extra transformation required. Alternately you can write code that interprets rules.out and execute required instructions using introspection. This is hard way but rules.out can be changed at runtime as well.
