How can one combine fill-paragraph with supercite?

I am using Emacs 23 and VM 8.1 to write and read email. I am using Supercite 3.1 to get fancy citations in my replies such as Foo> bla bla bla ... When are you Foo> resuming the work on our paper? I would like to get the same features as fill-paragraph but on the citation. I see it working on commented parts in LaTeX-mode (with the same function fill-paragraph)q, so I assume that I just have to set-up the correct regular expression for fill-paragraph to do the job, but which one and through which hook? EXAMPLE I would like that, after editing out "bla bla bla ..." to get the following Foo> When are you Foo> resuming the work on our paper? and pressing M-q, to get a correctly filled citation such as Foo> When are you resuming the work on Foo> our paper? In LaTeX-mode, the equivalent would be to go from % When are you % resuming the work on our paper? to % When are you resuming the work on our paper? Later Addition Supercite documentation suggests the use of filladapt or gin-mode. (http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/emacs/sc_4.html) It is mentioned that "filladapt.el needs a bit rewriting to fit into Emacs today." on http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FillAdapt I tried it anyway without success. Its alternative, gin-mode.el (http://www.gaertner.de/~neitzel/sw.html) is not available on the cvs server of its author.
