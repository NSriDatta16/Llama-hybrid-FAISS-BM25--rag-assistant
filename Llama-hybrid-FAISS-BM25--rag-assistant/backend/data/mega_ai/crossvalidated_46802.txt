Is is ok to use credit spreads to account for a drop in time series for vector error correction model?

I am doing a time series analysis on a quarterly basis from 1990 to the third quarter 2012. Some of the time series had a drop in 2008 because of recession then resumed upwards. This drop is rather steep. I am thinking of using credit spreads since credit spreads follows the economy rather well. Then I can apply cointegration and VECM on the series. Thanks
