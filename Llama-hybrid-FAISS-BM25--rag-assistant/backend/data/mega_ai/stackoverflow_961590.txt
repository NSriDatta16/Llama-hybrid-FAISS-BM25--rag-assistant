I wouldn't use an array of characters. That would get impossible to manage. What I'd suggest is working out a 'default' language from the IP address and using that as the locale for a request. You could also get it from the browser-agent string in some cases. You could provide the user a way to override so that if your default isn't correct they aren't stuck with a strange site. (E.g. provide on the form 'language set to english. If this isn't correct, please change: '. This isn't the nicest thing to provide but you won't get any working validation otherwise as you NEED a language/locale set in order to have a sensible alpha validation (An A isn't a letter in chinese).
