What you will find with WPF is nearly anything is possible from a UI perspective. It is definitely possible having one window and swapping the contents below depending on the button. A pattern I like is PRISM which has some interesting patterns and best practices on achieving composite windows in both WPF and Silverlight. You could also look at the MVVM pattern , which is becoming really popular with WPF. Josh Smith has many great articles for this. Also, if you are really new, have a look as User Controls, as this allows you to easily modularize certain sections. What I found with myself was with my first few WPF applications, I approached it from a Winform's mindset - but then after really getting a second look at Binding, these other patterns really began to shine.
