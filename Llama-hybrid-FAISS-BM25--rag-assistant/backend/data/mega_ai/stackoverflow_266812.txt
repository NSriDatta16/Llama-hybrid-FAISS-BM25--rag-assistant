Load some test data with the same average field lengths as production, then measure how much space it takes. That's what we do. Don't bother loading 100 rows, just load 1M rows, or 10M from the start. Loading more rows into non-production systems is easy - it only takes a little longer. It is really handy to have a large set of test data - that way you can accurately measure the disc space impact (and downtime impact) of database schema changes, for example adding indexes in particular. Make sure your test data are at least as large as production, ideally bigger.
