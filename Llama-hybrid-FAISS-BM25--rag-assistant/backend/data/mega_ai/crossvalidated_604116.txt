If you only have two time points, the lag order can only be zero (no lag, thus contemporaneous relationship) or one. While I have never used cc.test before, I wonder if it is applicable to your data in its current format. Your data is not stored as a time series. The rows do not increase in time; instead, they alternate between session=1 and session=2 . If you want to test $H_0\colon \text{Corr}(y_t,x_s)=0$ for some time points $t$ and $s$ , you can run a linear regression of $y_t$ on $x_s$ and inspect whether the slope coefficient is different from zero. In your case that would be model For your data, I get Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 79.904 23.332 3.425 0.00302 ** data[session == 2, var2] -4.316 3.026 -1.426 0.17090 which means the relevant $p$ -value is 0.17090 , above the conventional significance levels of 0.05 or 0.01 . Thus $H_0$ of zero correlation between var1 in session 1 and var2 in session 2 would not be rejected.
