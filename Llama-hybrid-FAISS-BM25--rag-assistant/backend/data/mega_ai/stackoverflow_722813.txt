Like gargantaun said, start with the DB tables. I'd want an easily overridable layer between the DB and the forms to manage the relationships between the two and make explicit the data relationships you can't get from the DB. Someone will surely want to generate multiple forms from the same table (perhaps one form would be too long, perhaps there are different user levels). The killer feature of something like that is always how well it handles foreign keys in the DB and one-to-one, one-to-many etc. relationships. Not much use if you can't even build a shopping cart with multiple items in it.
