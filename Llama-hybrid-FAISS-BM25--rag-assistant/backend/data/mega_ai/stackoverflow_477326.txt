When the app installs, I would do the following: Create a file in "app-storage" that basically indicates the app has been installed. Fire off a service call and make a record of the install Change a file in the app directory to indicate the app has been installed On subsequent startups, check for the presence of the file as long as the file in the app directory indicates the app has been installed. If you see the customer keeps installing their app over and over, this could be flagged in their account and appropriate action taken. If you want to get fancy, the file in "app-storage" could a one-way hash of some information from the file in the app directory (install date?) plus some value baked into the AIR application. In general, I think the key here is to trust your users and not make the assumption they are trying to steal. You want to make the system as painless as possible. It does not build a good relationship with customers when you treat them like criminals, so creating an "ironclad" approach probably isn't even the best idea.
