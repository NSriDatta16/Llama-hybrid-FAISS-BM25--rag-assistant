Naming convention for Visual Studio solutions and projects

We were thinking about organizing our BIG project this way: \trunk [CompanyName] [Product1] [Project1] CompanyName.Product1.Project1.csproj [Project2] CompanyName.Product1.Project2.csproj CompanyName.Product1.sln [Product2] We were trying to follow Microsoft's recommendation that namespace names follow folder structure, but are there any drawbacks for making it this way? What is the naming convention for solutions and projects that you apply?
