A potential multi-agent system?

For an assignment I have to make a multi-agent system (very open ended, but a short project), something like predator/prey or traffic simulation? It will be written in Jason/Agent speak. I am at a loss for ideas as to what to actually implement (what is feasible?), as it can be anything, the more bizarre the better!
