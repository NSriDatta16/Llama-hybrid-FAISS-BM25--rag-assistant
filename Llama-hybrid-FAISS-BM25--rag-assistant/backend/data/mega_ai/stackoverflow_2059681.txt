I second S#arp Architecture. Take a look at their google groups, they've recently got a very good starting project (from framework users): http://whocanhelpme.codeplex.com/ . If you need jquery/jqGrid for CRUD then I (shamelessly) advertise my solution: http://sprokhorenko.blogspot.com/2009/12/dedicated-to-my-wife.html . It's yet to be updated with lot of fixes and latest features, and is not very well organized (so it's not a "solution"), but the article itself explains how you can get very convenient CRUD out of jqGrid + MVC.
