There is no such thing as a xml flat file database. Flat xml files are non-databases in that they have no higher functions like indices - have fun with larger datasets and searches or analytical queries without any index. XML databases are another topic and may have their needs (content management, document storage in general - complicated schemata you dont care too much from the database point of view). Flat files are fine for things like settings 8smaller files), but a real database is a real database. ACID conditions are hard to guarantee for flat files.
