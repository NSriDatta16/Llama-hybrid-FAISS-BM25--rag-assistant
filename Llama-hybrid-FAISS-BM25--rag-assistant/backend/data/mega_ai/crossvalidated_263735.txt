factorization of a joint distribution

I have a question regarding the factorization of the following joint density: $P(Y, v, \psi , \theta)= P(Y |v, \psi)P(v, \psi| \theta) P(\theta)$ My question is: when I try write each of the conditional distribution as nominator over denominator for example for the first conditional distribution on the right as: $ P(Y |v, \psi)$ = $\frac{P(Y, v, \psi)}{P(v, \psi)}$, and then multiply each of those "numberator and denominator", the multiplication of nominator or cancellation of nominator with denominator don't equal to the term: It is the first formula in this article here: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pierre_Yves_Boelle/publication/8211096_A_Bayesian_MCMC_approach_to_study_transmission_of_Influenza_application_to_household_longitudinal_data/links/548f1e5c0cf214269f26366e.pdf $P(Y, v, \psi , \theta)$ Could someone explain or shine some light? thank you
