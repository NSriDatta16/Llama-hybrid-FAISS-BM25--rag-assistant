Possible data leakage or Overfitting?

I've asked my question in this thread . I've built a classification model using random forests and I'm getting a very high cv accuracy scores which make me belive it is either overfitting or some kind of data leakage occurred. Can someone please explain to me what might be the issue?. Thanks
