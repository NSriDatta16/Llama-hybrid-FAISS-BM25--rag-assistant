Post requests: Correct http header syntax?

Im using TTURLRequest from the cocoa Three20 development library to form a post request. I'm setting the http headers with this: [request setValue:VALUE forHTTPHeaderField:KEY]; I'm getting a 400 response back. I'm also using Charles to capture the requests and responses. The request is getting out (with the headers I had put in) so obviously I'm not forming the headers correctly or I'm missing some important ones. The Headers I am setting are: [request setValue:@"0" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Length"];//0 length?(not sending any raw data) [request setValue:authorizationHeader forHTTPHeaderField:@"Authorization"]; [request setValue:@"CUSTOM/1.0" forHTTPHeaderField:@"User-Agent"]; [request setValue:@"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Type"]; What is the correct syntax and order of http headers in a post request?
