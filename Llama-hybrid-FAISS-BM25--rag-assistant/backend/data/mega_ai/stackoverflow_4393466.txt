The first argument of each python class method must be an instance of the class itself. As a convention , self is the keyword which is used to refer to the class instance. There's no reason to use a different keyword and it is strongly discouraged not to follow the self convention :). When the class method is defined, the self argument must be included, however, when the class method is used, the self argument is implicitly present. Example: class C: def cMethod(self, a1, a2): pass [...] >>> cinstance = C() >>> cinstance.cMethod(x1, x2) I just wanted to point out this two aspects :). Bye.
