How do I compare two columns in Excel?

Our organization has offices in several Zip Codes in all 50 states. Each year, some new offices are opened, some current offices are closed. Almost forgot: we have our own designations for the offices. Year Office Code Zip Code Status 2009 Z10 20701 Open 2009 Z11 20703 Open 2009 Z12 20701 Open 2010 Z10 20702 Open 2010 Z11 moved to 20702 Open 2010 Z12 NA Closed 2010 Z14 20707 Open - Added (didn't exist last year) I have a list of the zip codes in 2009 of our existing offices. This list of zip codes is different in 2010. Is there a straightforward way to compare the zip code lists and report on which respective offices have been closed/opened/moved?
