Cross-sectional analysis using longtitudinal data, what is the best method?

I have a small problem regarding the fact of doing a cross sectional analysis using a longitudinal data set. I have a set of countries (87 countries), with different observations measured in different years (e.g. [Country], [Year], [X]: Netherlands, 1990, 0.5; Netherlands 1991, 0.3; Germany 1991, 0.4). Method 1 Now if I am doing a cross sectional analysis I would be picking all my observations from one year (i.e. $Y_{1990, i}=\alpha + \beta \cdot X_{1990, i}$), am I correct? However the problem is that I will only have about 24 observations, whereas the total amount of observations are 150, meaning that at each year only a subset of the 87 countries are measured. Method 2 So to increase the amount of observations, I could just ignore the years. Giving me 150 observations, however I was wondering what kind of bias this would introduce. I am sure this will introduce some kind of bias, since some countries are sampled across multiple years. Method 3 A different method would be taking the average of the countries that are sampled in multiple years, this would of course result in 87 observations. I am also wondering how this method would influence my estimations and what kind of biases this will introduce. So my questions are, given all these three “methods” which one should I use and what kind of biases do these methods introduce (theoretical, maybe some references). I was also wondering whether there are alternative “methods”. Thanks in advance for your response!
