In general the most common metrics mentioned in several articles ( e.g. like this one ) are the same we also commonly use for non-time series prediction: MAE Mean absolute error MSE Mean squared error RMSE Root mean squared error Outside of linear regressions I have not seen RÂ² used that often to validate prediction models. In fact it isn't even one of the out-of-the-box metrics of xgboost for interval scale prediction tasks. So you should be fine using RMSE for everything. Edit: Prophet at least in the R package covers RMSE, MAE and MAPE so you should be fine.
