Hello I had the same question because I began to learn Python 2 months ago. So after reading some posts and informations, I decided to start with Python, 2.71 , why?: 1/ Python 2.7.1 is really stable and has all the great libraries. 2/ It will be maintened for a long time for all the bugs (but not for the functions) so there will be 2.7.2 2.7.3... 3/ You may use the 3.xx syntax in your 2.7 code with the __future__ statement.
