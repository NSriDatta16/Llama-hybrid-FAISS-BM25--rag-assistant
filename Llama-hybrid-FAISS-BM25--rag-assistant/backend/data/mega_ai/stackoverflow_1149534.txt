Persistent Storage Cocoa/MacOSX

When writing an application for MacOSX, using Cocoa/Objective-C, I'd like to be able to store the data entered by the users. There will only be one user per installation at the moment; however, I'd like to get an idea of how storage methods change if it were multiple users per installation. In the case of 1 user per installation, should I stick to SQLLite for persistent storage, or what's the recommendation? If I were to allow for multiple users per installation, what persistent storage method would be prefered?
