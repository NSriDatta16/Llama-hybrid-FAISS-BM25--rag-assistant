By following mgilbert's excellent answer... If we decide to do the PCA not on the covariance matrix, but rather on the correlation matrix (by dividing asset returns by their standard deviation pre-PCA), will the final reconstructed matrix in the original dimensionality also be a correlation matrix? If it is indeed then a correlation matrix, and if we want to use the full-dimensional matrix for simulations or Value at Risk with interpretable results, do we not have to transform the full-dimensional correlation matrix back into a covariance matrix by computing the following..? $$\frac{\sigma_{xy}}{\sigma_{x}\sigma_{y}}$$
