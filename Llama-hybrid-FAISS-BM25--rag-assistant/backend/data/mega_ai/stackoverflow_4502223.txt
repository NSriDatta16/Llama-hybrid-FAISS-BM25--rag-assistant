I have the same problem. It should be somehow possible by using NSURLCredential, but I wasn't able to figure it out until now. Update: I figured it out, look at the documentation of MPMoviePlayerController, there you can see how it works. For me it worked like this: NSURLCredential *credential = [[[NSURLCredential alloc] initWithUser: kHTTPSUsername password: kHTTPSPassword persistence: NSURLCredentialPersistenceForSession] autorelease]; NSURLProtectionSpace *protectionSpace = [[[NSURLProtectionSpace alloc] initWithHost: @"my.secret.host" port: 443 protocol: @"https" realm: @"secret.host" authenticationMethod: NSURLAuthenticationMethodDefault] autorelease]; [[NSURLCredentialStorage sharedCredentialStorage] setDefaultCredential: credential forProtectionSpace: protectionSpace];
