Since your image is stored in binary format in the database, you want to "stream" this into an image object by leveraging the MemoryStream object. Looking at your code, your solution will look something like this: BitmapImage bmpImage = new BitmapImage(); MemoryStream msImageStream = new MemoryStream(); msImageStream.Write(value, 0, value.Length); bmpCardImage.BeginInit(); bmpCardImage.StreamSource = new MemoryStream(msImageStream.ToArray()); bmpCardImage.EndInit(); image.Source = bmpCardImage;
