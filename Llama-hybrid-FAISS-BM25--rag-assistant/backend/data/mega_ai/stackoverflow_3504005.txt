Have you tried using Weka ? It supports binary, numerical, and nominal attributes out of the box, the latter two of which might work well enough for your purposes. Furthermore, it looks like one of the classifiers that's available is a meta-classifier called OrdinalClassClassifier.java , which is the result of this research: Eibe Frank and Mark Hall, A simple approach to ordinal classification. In Proceedings of the 12th European Conference on Machine Learning, 2001, pp. 145-156. If you don't need a pre-made approach, then these references (in addition to doug's note about the Yahoo SVM paper ) might be useful: W Chu and Z Ghahramani, Gaussian processes for ordinal regression. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2006. Wei Chu and S. Sathiya Keerthi, New approaches to support vector ordinal regression. In Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on Machine Learning, 2005, 145-152.
