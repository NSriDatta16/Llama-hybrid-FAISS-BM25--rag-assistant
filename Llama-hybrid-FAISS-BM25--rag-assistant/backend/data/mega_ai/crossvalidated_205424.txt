If you have accurately characterized your beliefs about a particular quantity in the prior distribution, then YES, you should have "confidence" in your updated beliefs, represented by the posterior distribution (and therefore credible intervals constructed from it), because Bayes' rule provides the appropriate way to update your beliefs upon seeing data. The above statement is for one particular experiment, but more importantly, one particular quantity of interest. It says nothing about what happens to a whole set of experiments or quantities, nor should it, since this one particular quantity is the quantity of interest. It also says nothing about where the true parameter value is, but instead says something about where you believe the true parameter value is. So it says exactly what you should believe based on your choice of prior, your choice of likelihood, and the data you observed. For coverage of confidence or credible intervals, we need to construct a repeatable statistical procedure. The above procedure is not repeatable because the prior construction is specific to the particular quantity of interest. But, we can construct default Bayesian procedures whose priors are constructed to satisfy certain properties. One of those properties is probability matching and credible intervals constructed bsaed on probability matching priors attain the appropriate frequentist coverage over repeated use of this prior. So, if coverage gives you "confidence", then you should probably only use a default Bayesian procedure with a probability matching prior.
