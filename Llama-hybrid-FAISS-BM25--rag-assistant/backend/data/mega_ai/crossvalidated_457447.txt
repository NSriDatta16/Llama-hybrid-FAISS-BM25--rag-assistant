Forecast market development through state space models

Suppose I would like to estimate the following model \begin{align} y_t &= \Lambda f_t + Bx_t + u_t\\ f_t &= A_1f_{t-1} + \cdots + A_pf _{t-p} + \eta_t & \eta_t \sim N(0, I)\\ u_t &= C_1u_{t-1} + \cdots + C_q u_{t-q} + \epsilon_t & \epsilon_t \sim N(0, \Sigma) \end{align} and suppose I want to forecast housing prices. I have a number of exogenous variables but also want to include a latent variable that serves as a proxy for the 'market development'. So in the model above, $f_t$ would be the market development. My question is, can you estimate this model for a univariate time series $y_t$ (and is this a correct way to approach the problem)? Because for instance https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/statespace_dfm_coincident.html states that "Factor models generally try to find a small number of unobserved “factors” that influence a substantial portion of the variation in a larger number of observed variables"
