CakePHP - Custom hasOne Object Association - Using a Join Table instead of in-table foreign keys?

In CakePHP, I'm trying to build a $hasOne relationship, but I can't add a foreign key to the tables (for legacy reasons). Is there any way I can create a join table (object1_object2) and link them together like this? I want to leverage Cake's powerful object relationship functionality, so if there's a way I can make this custom association permanent throughout the model, without always building a custom $options array for each find(), that'd be great. (Maybe a bindModel in the Model's initalize()?) Thanks!
