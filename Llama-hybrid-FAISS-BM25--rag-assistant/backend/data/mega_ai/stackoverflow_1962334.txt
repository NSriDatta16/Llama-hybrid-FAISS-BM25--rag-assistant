There can be performance hits - but usually not on a level that most users would notice. When the size of each field is known in advance, MySQL knows exactly how many bytes are between each field/row and can page forward without reading all the data. Using variable characters diminshes this ability for optimization. Does varchar result in performance hit due to data fragmentation? Even better, char vs varchar . For most uses, you'll be fine with either - but there is a difference, and for large scale databases, there are reasons why you'd pick one or the other.
