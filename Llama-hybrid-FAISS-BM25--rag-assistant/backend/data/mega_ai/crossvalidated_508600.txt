This is similar to a Bernoulli factory problem. However, your problem has a solution only if f ( p ), in the interval [0, 1]— Is continuous, and is either constant on the interval [0, 1] and polynomially bounded away from 0 and 1 (Keane and O'Brien 1994). Functions that meet these conditions are called factory functions , and only factory functions admit unbiased estimators when given an unlimited supply of Bernoulli( p ) random variables (Łatuszyński et al. 2009/2011). Merely being differentiable and concave is not enough for f to have an unbiased estimator. (Although being concave may simplify matters in designing an appropriate algorithm, depending on the function f in question, to Jensen's inequality.) REFERENCES: Keane, M. S., and O'Brien, G.
