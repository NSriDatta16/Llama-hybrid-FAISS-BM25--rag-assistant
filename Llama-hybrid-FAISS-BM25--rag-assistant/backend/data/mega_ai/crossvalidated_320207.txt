Two-part model ordinal data

A response scale has the categories (strongly agree, midly agree, midly disagree, strongly disagree, do not know). A two-part model uses a logistic regression model for the probability of a DK (don't know) response and a separate ordinal model per the ordered categories conditional on response in one of those categoeries. I'd like to fit these two part simultaneously but I'm stucked. I think of it as an Hurdle model for the Poisson situation, where the 0 process is different than the counting process and there's no mixture (so no Zero inflation ). I wonder if it exists a way to deal with situation in R . Someone would told me to treat DK response either as missing values or neutral values (so put them in the central order). But I'd like to use a model like the Hurdle one for counting data. So a logit model (DK versus notDK) and a Proportional Odds Model per the ordinal part. I've looked for some literature on the argument but I have found nothing in particular. Any suggestion? Does it make sense, anyway, as approach?
