A typical weight sharing technique found in CNN treats the input as a hierarchy of local regions. It imposes a general assumption (prior knowledge) that the input going to be processed by the network can be decomposed into a set of local regions with the same nature and thus each of them can be processed with the same set of transformations. With the prior assumption, we could reduce the amount of parameters in the network (as compared with a fully-connected network) and increase the networkâ€™s generalisation ability, given that this prior assumption is a correct one for the problem.
