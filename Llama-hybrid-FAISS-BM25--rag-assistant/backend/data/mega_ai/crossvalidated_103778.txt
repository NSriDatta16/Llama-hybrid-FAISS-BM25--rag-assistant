Check out the work: Nonparametric belief propagation by Sudderth, Ihler, Isard, Freeman, Willsky. They talk about a general graph, with the nodes taking continuous values, instead of discrete states. They show a way to perform loopy belief propagation in this context, using MCMC. http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ihler/papers/_cacm10.pdf
