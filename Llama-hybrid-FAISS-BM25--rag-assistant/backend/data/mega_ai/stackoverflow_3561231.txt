First, the obvious: check the user agent. I use another trick that works pretty good. I map robots.txt to a PHP file and log the IP into the database. Then when logging user activity, I make sure they aren't from one of those logged IPs. If the user authenticates via the login system then I track them regardless. Of course neither solution guarantees any accuracy, but for general logging, it has been sufficient for my purposes.
