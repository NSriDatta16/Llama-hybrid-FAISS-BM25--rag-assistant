Modeling simple longitudinal data, unknown trend

Suppose I have many sensors recording a certain measure at discrete times (not too many times, something around 20/30 max). I want to get an idea of the average trend of the measure over time without necessarely fixing a functional form. Would it make sense to simply have a param for each time and have partial pooling? Something along the lines of $$ Y_t \sim \beta_t + \text{other covariates}$$ With the betas coming, for example, from the same normal distribution. Is there any major flaw/problem with this kind of simple model? Any good reason not to do this?
