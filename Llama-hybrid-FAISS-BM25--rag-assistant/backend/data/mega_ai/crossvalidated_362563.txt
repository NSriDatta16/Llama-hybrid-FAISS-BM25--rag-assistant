The standard error can't be used after you transform, because exp(x)+exp(y)~=exp(x+y) . I find it easier to think in terms of confidence intervals instead: you can exponentiate your lower and upper bound confidence intervals to get the correct confidence intervals. In addition, you should interpret your transformed beta coefficients (and associated confidence intervals) as multiplicative changes once you transform to the original units. exp(.008585) ~= 1.0086 meaning you have a .86% increase for 1 unit of A. However, you cannot simply multiply this number for other values of A: you need to multiply before exponentiation, i.e., exp(.008585 * A). In practice, for a continuous predictor value and especially because you have just one fixed effect, it makes the most sense to think about predictions and prediction intervals of your response as a function of A, and then transform these to create an informative plot. exp(Intercept) should be equal to mean(log response when A==0) only, they will not be equal if you average over all of your responses.
