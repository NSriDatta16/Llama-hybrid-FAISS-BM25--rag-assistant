How to drag and drop rows from jqgrid using only a single column?

I am trying to re-order the jqgrid rows using only one specific column. Currently, the rows can be re-ordered by any column. I have it setup like below: jQuery("#list").jqGrid('sortableRows', { update: function (ev, ui) { SaveRowSorting(); } }); But the above code allows the rows to be re-ordered by all columns, however we want to restrict it to only one column. E.g, if we have 3 columns in a row. Then, we want the row to be re-ordered by only column1 and it shouldn't allow row sorting using the other two columns. How could we achieve this? Any idea? I would really appreciate any help on this. Thanks, Yash
