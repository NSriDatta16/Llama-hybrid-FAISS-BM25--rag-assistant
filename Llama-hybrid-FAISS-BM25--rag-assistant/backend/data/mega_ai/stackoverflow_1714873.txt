SpringFramework JdbcTemplate RowMapper

I am wondering if JdbcTemplate and RowMapper supports complex object retrieval. I couldn't find anything with google on this matter (Wrong criteria?). :( Example: public class Person() { private Long id; private String name; private PersonDetail personDetail; } public class PersonDetail() { ... } Tables will look the same as the objects. What I would like to do is the following: Create a PersonRowMapper, within the mapper PersonalDetail will be also mapped as an object (what hibernate will do for you if you have a relationship defined). Many thanks, Firone
