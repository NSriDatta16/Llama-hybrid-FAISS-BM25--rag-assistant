A part of the Gang of Fours design pattern philosophy is to "Favor 'object composition' over 'class inheritance'." This reduces the tight coupling between ojects. Then changing one class will have less impact on the other classes in the system. This makes changes easier, resulting in a more stable, easy to maintain system. In this case, as a previous poster mentioned, it allows the image to do other things as well, such as display a progress indicator.
