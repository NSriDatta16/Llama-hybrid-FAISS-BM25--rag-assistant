Allowable maximum size of data that goes along with output files in setup project for a windows form application using Visual Studio

I am working on a windows form application using C# and have about 5 -10gb SWF files that are tied in to my windows form application. When I try to build these files along with the project output in setup project, Visual Studio Team system throws me an error "Not enough memory storage available". I am running this on a 32bit OS with 2 gigs ram. My understanding is that you cannot exceed your RAM memory space, if so is there any way to fit in more than 4gb data in your set up project. I have also tried CAB files to no avail. I am looking into memory resource which calls for serialization of the data. If you have any idea please do help, thanks
