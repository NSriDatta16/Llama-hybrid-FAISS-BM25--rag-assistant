Controlling for collinearity with one variable to test effects of second variable?

Here's my situation: Response variable: 0/1 Alive/Dead Bernoulli data Predictor 1: Categorical (Brand of drug) Predictor 2: Continuous (Dose of drug) I want to run a logistic regression to test whether there's an effect of Predictor 1 on the response. However, I wasn't able to control the dose of the drugs that were ingested. I do, however, know how much was ingested after the fact. How can I control for Predictor 2 to test the effects of Predictor 1? My first guess was simply to test for an interaction between the two; if the interaction is insignificant, then the effects of Predictor 1 on the Response must be the same at all "levels" of Predictor 2. Is that inherently wrong? Is there a better way to skin this cat?
