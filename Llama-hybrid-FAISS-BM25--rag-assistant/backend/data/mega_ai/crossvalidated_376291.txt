Calculate Percentage of each sub category in R Programming?

I have the following dataset: Year Type_code Age_group Type Total 1 2001 Causes 0-14 Love Affairs 1 2 2001 Causes 0-14 Other Prolonged Illness 1 3 2001 Causes 0-14 Failure in Examination 1 4 2001 Causes 15-29 Other Prolonged Illness 8 5 2001 Causes 15-29 Family Problems 5 6 2001 Causes 15-29 Failure in Examination 2 7 2001 Causes 15-29 Insanity/Mental Illness 2 8 2001 Causes 15-29 Other Prolonged Illness 3 9 2001 Causes 15-29 Family Problems 3 10 2001 Causes 15-29 Love Affairs 3 11 2001 Causes 15-29 Insanity/Mental Illness 2 143 2005 Causes 15-29 Death of Dear Person 1 144 2005 Causes 30-44 Family Problems 1 145 2005 Causes 30-44 Insanity/Mental Illness 2 And so on. I need to find the "percentage" of deaths (Total column) by cause (Type) in each year (Year). How can I do this in R? Also, I am a beginner so I also need help with hypothesis testing. My null hypothesis is that "More than 20% of people commit suicide because of Family Problems each year." How can I do this? I have referred to this , this , this , and this but I got overwhelmed and now I am really confused. Please help. I am a noob and this is for my school project! For example, 5% of people commited sucide in 2001 because of Love Affairs. I think I do understand the procedure - first, find the percentage of deaths by Family Problems in each year, and then take its average over each year and test if this average is greater than 20 percent or not.
