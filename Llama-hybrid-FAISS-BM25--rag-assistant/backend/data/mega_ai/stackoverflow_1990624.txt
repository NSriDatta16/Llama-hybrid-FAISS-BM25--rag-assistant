WPF / XAML - Can text be auto sized?

For a fixed size wrappable text area, is there any way to make the font size as large as possible based on the amount of text? For example, if you have a 500x500 area with the text "Hello", the font size would be really big. But if you have a paragraph of text the font size would be smaller to fit into the area. I have looked at Viewbox but can't see that it could work with wrappable text. ANY xaml or code that could do this would help (doesn't have to be a specific control).
