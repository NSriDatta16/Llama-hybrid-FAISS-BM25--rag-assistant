How do I raise a custom exception from a package __init__?

I have a package __init__.py that looks something like this: import sys __required_python_version = (2,6, 0) if sys.version_info While I'm certain there is a more elegant way to format those version strings and I could probably get by using a standard exception, my real question is how would I do something like this? Would the best approach be to move my custom exception into a separate file and import it? Or should I wrap the version check in a function that executes when the __init__ is run? I'm just looking for recommendations on the preferred approach. Thanks
