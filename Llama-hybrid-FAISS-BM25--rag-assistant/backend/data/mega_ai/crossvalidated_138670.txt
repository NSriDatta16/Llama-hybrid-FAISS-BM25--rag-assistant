Interpreting case influence statistics (leverage, studentized residuals, and Cook's distance)

I just wanted to clarify some things about leverage, studentized residuals, and Cook's distance: Does a large (in absolute value) studentized residual mean that a case is an outlier? Does a large Cook's distance mean that a case is influential for sure? Similarly, does a small Cook's distance mean that a case is not influential for sure? Can a case have a small leverage but a large (in absolute value) studentized residual?
