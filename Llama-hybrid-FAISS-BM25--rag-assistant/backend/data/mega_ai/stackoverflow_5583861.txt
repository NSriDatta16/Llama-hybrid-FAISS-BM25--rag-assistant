Tables and paging

Would be grateful for any ideas. Requirement (A) a table containing A.1 text columns A.2 one column for HTML content A.3 one column to house a radio button group (B) the ability to page through the records, e.g. by use of SimplePager. Alternatives considered so far FlexTable - can provide all of (A) but not (B) CellTable - can provide A.1 and (B), but not A.2 nor A.3 Can anyone suggest an alternative(s) that provides all of A and B? I have looked also at Smart GWT but don't see anything I can use. But I'm not very experienced in either GWT or Smart GWT. Thank you. [edit 1] Radio button group with three buttons now created as follows ('InterimReport' is my data type): Column radioButtonColumn = new Column (new SafeHtmlCell()) { @Override public SafeHtml getValue(InterimReport object) { String s = " match "+ " no match " + " URL not found "; return SafeHtmlUtils.fromTrustedString(s); } }; [edit 2] But how to capture the user's selection of a radio button? This code fragment doesn't appear to do anything: radioButtonColumn.setFieldUpdater(new FieldUpdater () { public void update(int index, InterimReport object, SafeHtml value) { System.out.println("Reached here"); if (value.equals("match")) { setMatch(object.get("dbIndex"), index); } else if (value.equals("nomatch")) { setNoMatch(object.get("dbIndex"), index); } else if (value.equals("urlnotfound")) { setUrlNotFound(object.get("dbIndex"), index); } } });
