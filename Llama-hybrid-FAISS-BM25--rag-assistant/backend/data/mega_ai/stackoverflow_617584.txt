I tried Miles' excellent suggestion above, but unfortunately it doesn't work because Gmail has already called the original setTimeout function before I have a chance to change it in my Greasemonkey script. The only thing I can do is somehow react to the changes that Gmail makes when it periodically refreshes the inbox. I found that there are several DOM related events that fire when a node is added or removed: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#event-DOMNodeInserted Since Gmail is updating the DOM with my latest emails, I can listen for these DOM events (I'm using DOMNodeInserted) and react to the changes. It isn't elegant, but it works.
