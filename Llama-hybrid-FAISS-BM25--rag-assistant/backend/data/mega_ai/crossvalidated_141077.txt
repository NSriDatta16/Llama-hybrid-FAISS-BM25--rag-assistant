Binomial Question with two probabilities

What we do if we were to figure out the probability of lets say, to pass a certain round of a quiz when there are 2 probabilities involved? Specifically, If in a round there were 2 Multiple choice question (4 choices in each) along with 5 True or false questions, and the contestant required at least 80% to pass that certain round... how would we determine that? Since there are 2 probabilities (0.5 and 0.25) Would averaging the two be accurate? (0.5+0.35)/2?
