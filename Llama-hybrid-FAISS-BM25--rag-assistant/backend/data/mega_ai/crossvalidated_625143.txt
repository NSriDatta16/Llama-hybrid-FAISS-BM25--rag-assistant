Regression analysis and time series data

I'm trying to model the effect of flow at entry and flow at exit on the produced energy in a thermal power plant ,The data is collected every 2h for two years,in my internship they want me to model these time series data but the supervisor told me to go for a simple linear regression without any lagged values , and then run a time series model, i failed to create a regression model because the data suffered so much from heteroscedasticity and serial correlation , when i used WLS i wasn't able to correct for heteroscedasticity and serial correlation , and when i used NLLS with one lagged features , i was able to get rid of serial correlation but not heteroscedasticity , because the data is so noisy . I don't know the goal from this approach ? and what is the goal from this regression analysis ,do i need to find a blue linear regression ?
