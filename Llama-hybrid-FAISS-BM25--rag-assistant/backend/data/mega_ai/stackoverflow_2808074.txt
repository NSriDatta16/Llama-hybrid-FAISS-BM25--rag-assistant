If your cached data is common across all users, using JSTL application scope allows you to cache your JSP fragment. If it per user, then session scope. Along with that, use another variable to record the cache-refresh timestamp, or conversely an expiry time. An example below: " scope="application"/> Later: If (system current time + 5) > cachedRefreshTimestamp, go fetch data again in separate loop, overwrite back into cachedData, and update cachedRefreshTimestamp also
