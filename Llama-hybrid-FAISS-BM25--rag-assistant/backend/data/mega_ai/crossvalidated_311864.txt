The no U-turn bit is how proposals are generated. HMC generates a hypothetical physical system: imagine a ball with a certain kinetic energy rolling around a landscape with valleys and hills (the analogy breaks down with more than 2 dimensions) defined by the posterior you want to sample from. Every time you want to take a new MCMC sample, you randomly pick the kinetic energy and start the ball rolling from where you are. You simulate in discrete time steps, and to make sure you explore the parameter space properly you simulate steps in one direction and the twice as many in the other direction, turn around again etc. At some point you want to stop this and a good way of doing that is when you have done a U-turn (i.e. appear to have gone all over the place). At this point the proposed next step of your Markov Chain gets picked (with certain limitations) from the points you have visited. I.e. that whole simulation of the hypothetical physical system was "just" to get a proposal that then gets accepted (the next MCMC sample is the proposed point) or rejected (the next MCMC sample is the starting point). The clever thing about it is that proposals are made based on the shape of the posterior and can be at the other end of the distribution. In contrast Metropolis-Hastings makes proposals within a (possibly skewed) ball, Gibbs sampling only moves along one (or at least very few) dimensions at a time.
