Image classification with different number of training image for each class

I'm trying to train neural network for image classification with 4 different classes: Cars (22k training examples) Building (8k training examples) Pedestrian (5k training examples) Trees (1k training examples) The problem is that the number of training images is biased toward one/two class(es). I'm wondering if there is a way to train neural network in terms of the number of training examples per class? Do I have to limit the number of training examples per class to the minimum number of all classes?
