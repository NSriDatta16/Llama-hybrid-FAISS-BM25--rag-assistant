Python - (SVM) Why is my Gram matrix not positive definite?

I am writing a support vector machine with 1-norm soft margins in Python, using the quadprog quadratic programming package. As far as I can tell, by using the Gaussian kernel I should be guaranteed a positive definite Gram matrix, but when I pass my Gram matrix (here, labeled "H") into quadprog it is telling me that it is not positive definite. I am unable to figure out why the Gaussian kernel is not returning a positive definite matrix.
