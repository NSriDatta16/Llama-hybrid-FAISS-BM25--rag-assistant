So embeddings for cities can be either loaded from pre-existing models, or created. Some of the most popular embeddings I'm familiar with include Glove and Word2Vec. The easiest way is probably to use gensim to load existing embeddings: from gensim.models.word2vec import Word2Vec import gensim.downloader as api import pandas as pd model_w2vec_news = api.load("word2vec-google-news-300") vec_london = model_w2vec_news["London"] You can test if specific locations exist in the vocabulary of the model: for city in cities_df["city"]: try: vec_city = model_w2vec_news[city] print(f"embedding for city {city} was found in model") except KeyError: print(f"The city {city} does not appear in this model") It's also pretty straightforward to train your own embeddings.
