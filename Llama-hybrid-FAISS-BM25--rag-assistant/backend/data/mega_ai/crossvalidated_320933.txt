You could not possibly rule that out for stochastic processes in general based on any statistical reasoning. I could simply generate a time series from any model without cointegration, and then another from one with cointegration, and stick them end-to-end. At best, you may be able to find domain-specific arguments about certain kinds of data, for example if in a specific application where cointegration is representative of a certain fundamental physical link between physical processes which is immutable once the process is started. In finance, linkages aren't quite so permanent and can in general vary depending on market conditions or technological changes (e.g. in an industrial process that transforms commodity A to commodity B, you might find cointegration between companies linked to A and those linked to B which disappear once an innovation cuts A out of the process). Do you know of any event(s) in the history of Bitcoin that could explain the differences between the two periods? For example, could it be that the earlier BTC price history involves small expert communities and their technological advancements moving prices around, and the later period involves mainstream investors learning about and entering the BTC market? It's likely that the second situation is more tied to google trends around words like "bitcoin". If not, it's possible that the difference isn't really "real". Maybe the first period is too short to detect cointegration (which is a long-term phenomenon) reliably but that it really does exist there, or that neither model is truly appropriate and test assumptions are violated and the test results are unreliable (for example, standard cointegration tests are notoriously vulnerable to structural breaks).
