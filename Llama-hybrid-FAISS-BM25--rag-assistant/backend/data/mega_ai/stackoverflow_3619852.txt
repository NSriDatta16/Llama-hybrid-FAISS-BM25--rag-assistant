When navigating through word-wrapped text in VIM, how to make the selector move onto wrapped line sections?

The behaviour I want is the behaviour in most text editors and office applications (that aren't designed with programmers in mind). This makes it quicker to get to the centre of large paragraphs. Thanks.
