In this answer to a different question, Are there any examples where Bayesian credible intervals are obviously inferior to frequentist confidence intervals , I explained a difference between confidence intervals and credible intervals. Both intervals can be constructed such that they will contain a certain fraction of the times the true parameter. However there is a difference in the conditional dependence on the observation and the conditional dependence on the true parameter values. An $\alpha \%$ -confidence interval will contain the parameter a fraction $\alpha \%$ of the time, independent from the true parameter. But the confidence interval will not contain the parameter a fraction $\alpha \%$ of the time, independent from the observation value. This contrasts with An $\alpha \%$ -credible interval will contain the parameter a fraction $\alpha \%$ of the time, independent from the observation value. But the credible interval will not contain the parameter a fraction $\alpha \%$ of the time, independent from the true parameter. See also the image accompanying that answer:
