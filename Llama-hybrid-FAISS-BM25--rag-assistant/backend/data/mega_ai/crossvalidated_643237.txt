The problem you are observing with lack of significance of GA has nothing to do with zero inflation or with random effects. It is simply a limitation of Wald tests for count models. If you replace the Wald tests with likelihood ratio tests, then the problem disappears: > n count GA Sm light > p fit anova(fit,test="Chisq") Analysis of Deviance Table Model: binomial, link: logit Response: p Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df Deviance Resid. Df Resid. Dev Pr(>Chi) NULL 23 251.906 GA 1 240.079 22 11.827 The problem here is that the GA variable perfectly separates the zero count responses from the non-zero. Hence the maximum likelihood estimate of the coefficient for GA in the linear model is infinite and so is its standard error. The z-statistic, which is the ratio of the coefficient to its standard error, is therefore undefined. In floating point arithmetic, the coefficient never becomes infinite, but the standard error approaches infinity faster than the coefficient as the iteration proceeds, so the z-statistic converges to zero and appears to be non-significant. The solution is simply not to use z-statistics. The likelihood ratio tests depend only on fitted values, which do not become infinite, and hence remain defined. For your data, the likelihood ratio test statistic for testing the GA coefficient equal to zero (minus twice the log-likelihood difference) is 240.079. Under the null hypothesis, this statistic follows a chisquare distribution on 1 df, so the observed value of 240.079 is astronomically significant. Note that the other two covariates Sm and light have finite coefficients. For those covariates, the Wald test p-values and likelihood ratio p-values are almost the same. The same problem occurs with Wald tests for binomial, Poisson and negative binomial generalized linear models with logit or log-link functions when one of the groups being compared has all zero counts and the corresponding coefficient becomes infinite. The problem has been observed many times over the years but strangely the solution never seems to have become well known. We discuss the problem and solution for binomial glms in Section 9.9 ("When Wald tests fail) of Dunn & Smyth (2018). We discuss the same problem for negative binomial models in Section 7.1 of Robinson & Smyth (2008). In that paper we show that the likelihood ratio test p-values are a reasonable approximation to exact tests but are slightly anticonservative. Rainey (2024) is another paper giving the same advice that I have always given. Greenland (1992) also recommends likelihood-ratio tests for logistic regression when the counts are small.
