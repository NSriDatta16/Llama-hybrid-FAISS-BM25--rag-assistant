There are few things that you may want to check. Is training error large? Is training error In the first case, if the training error is large, this means that you are perhaps dealing with non-linearities. This might be difficult to tell with small sample size. Use linear kernel and then Gaussian kernel (for example) and see how this error changes. In the second case, if training error is much smaller than validation error, your model may be overfitting. You may want to tune parameters such as C or \nu (depending which SVM formulation you use). In resume, try to get low training error first and then try to get validation error as close to it as possible. Once you are satisfied, you want to check the error on a held-out set. The error should be in the same ballpark (usually bit higher). If this is the case, you are done. It is easy to get the first but harder to get both training and validation errors low. Even harder to get the test error low as well.
