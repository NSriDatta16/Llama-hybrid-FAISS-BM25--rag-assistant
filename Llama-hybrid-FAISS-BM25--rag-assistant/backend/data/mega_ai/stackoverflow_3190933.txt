I would advise a single table for jobs with a reference job types table; this way you can add job types at will, 6mnth service, 12month service, M.O.T, Repair, Refurbishment etcetera. Mechanics should go into their own table, perhaps staff would be better, then you could have a staff type reference table with manager, senior mech, etcetera. Of course this answer assumes you have a vehicle table. garage_sites (garage_site_id, garage_name, etc) mech_staff (mStaff_id, garage_site_id_fk, name, etc) vehicle_job (vJob_id, vehicle_id_fk, vJob_type_code_fk, mStaff_id_fk) vehicle_job_type (vJob_type_id, vJob_type_code, vJob_type_description) You can find a lot of pointers and base database models at: http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/index.htm
