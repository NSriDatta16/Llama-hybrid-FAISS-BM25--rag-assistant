How should I organize a list of items by their category in Django?

I have a "Category" model, and a "Project" model, which contains a ForeignKey to "Category." So each Project can only belong to one Category. I want to create a list that ends up looking like the following: Category 1 Project 1 Project 2 Category 2 Project 3 Project 4 etc. I think the following psuedocode will work: {% for c in category %} {{ c.title }} {% for p in project WHERE CATEGORY = C %} {{ p.title }} {% endfor %} {% endfor %} The part I'm having trouble with is the "WHERE CATEGORY = C" part. How do I express this in Django template code?
