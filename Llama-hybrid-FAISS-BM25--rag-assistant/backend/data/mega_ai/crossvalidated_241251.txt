Classifier using two distributions

I'v asked this question on the Mathematica exchange here but looking for more formal/rigorous answer. Suppose I have two classes {class1, class2} and have their associated distributions, pdf1(x) and pdf2(x). Then, given an x value, what is the appropriate (statistically optimal) way to classify x ? I feel like there should be some kind of Kalman or Bayesian formalism in optimal estimation to do this in a way which would/should generalize to N classes. Similar questions here and here
