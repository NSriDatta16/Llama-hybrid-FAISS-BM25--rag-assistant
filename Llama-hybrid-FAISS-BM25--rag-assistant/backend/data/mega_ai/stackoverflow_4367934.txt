Android - Drag screen navigation

I have to do the drag navigation in Android. I have added a code for the drag screen navigation. Which is not as smooth as Android default. The following code gives the drag navigation from left to right and right to left but the problem is when you tap at right and then to left then too the screen navigates. What is the right way to achieve it. Do I need to work with same code with calculating the X values? Below the code. // On Drag Navigation public boolean onTouch(View arg0, MotionEvent arg1) { // Get the action that was done on this touch event switch (arg1.getAction()) { case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN: { // store the X value when the user's finger was pressed down downXValue = arg1.getX(); break; } case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP: { // Get the X value when the user released his/her finger float currentX = arg1.getX(); // Going Backward: pushing stuff to the right if (downXValue currentX) { Intent lIntent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), nextScreen.class); startActivity(lIntent); finish(); } break; } } } Please specify the right way of achieving it. Thanks in advance
