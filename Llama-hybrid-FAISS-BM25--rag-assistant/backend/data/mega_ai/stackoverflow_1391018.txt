If I pass in say "someFolder/somepage.aspx" to openPage function, it simply sets the content page to " http://mysite/ " You're doing better than most, then. Changing object.data in IE8 does nothing at all for me, just like it always has in IE. There is a non-standard 'object' property on s in IE, that gives you the document object of the inner HTML page (as you would expect to get from the unsupported contentDocument property). However, navigating that page (through object.object.URL or object.object.parentWindow.location) does the same as writing to object.data: nothing. (IE seems to get confused; if you look at the object.object.location.href, it actually points to the parent URL even though it's the child document.) Basically, it's bugged to hell and you're best off forgetting for HTML embedding today. Swallow your pride and include the iframe, using the Transitional DTD if you want to validate.
