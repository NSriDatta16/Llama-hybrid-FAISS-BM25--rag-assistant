This is just a guess; not sure if this approach will work. If you're looking at phrases and proximity of words, perhaps you can build up a Markov Chain? That way you can get an idea of the frequency of certain phrases/words in relation to others (based on the order of your Markov Chain). So you build a Markov Chain and frequency distribution for the year 2009. Then you build another one at the end of 2010 and compare the frequencies (of certain phrases and words). You might have to normalize the text though. Other than that, something that comes to mind is Natural-Language-Processing techniques (there is a lot of literature surrounding the topic!).
