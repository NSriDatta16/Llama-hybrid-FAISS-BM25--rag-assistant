If you really, really need gpg's output to be a file, you could put that file on a ramfs file system. The file's contents will only exist in non-swappable memory pages. You can attach a ramfs file system to your tree by running (as root): mount none /your/mnt/point -t ramfs You may have also heard of tmpfs . It's similar in that its files have no permanent storage and generally exist only in RAM. However, for your use, you want to avoid this file system because tmpfs files can be swapped to disk.
