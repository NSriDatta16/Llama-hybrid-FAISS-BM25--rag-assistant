Broadly speaking, a dynamical system is ergodic if it has the same behavior averaged over time as averaged over the space of all the system's states. Mean and covariance of white noise can be determined from its time average, hence it is ergodic. Simple noise models are usually ergodic; however, when the noise depends on the system, then its characteristics may change over time. Time average in such a case may not be equal to the ensemble average (hence not ergodic). For example think of a system with two modes. At mode1 let the noise be white. At mode2 let the noise be poisson with parameter λ. Let the system be stuck with one of the modes depending on its initial condition. Then the time average of the noise would either be 0 or λ. You may argue that depending on the initial state probability (i.e. p vs. 1-p) the time average should be (1-p)λ, but that is not true (as you may see, time average definition does not include anything about the initial state probability so the best you can say is that the time average is either 0 or λ.) In fact, (1-p)λ is the ensemble average which is different from the time average by which we may conclude that the noise is not ergodic.
