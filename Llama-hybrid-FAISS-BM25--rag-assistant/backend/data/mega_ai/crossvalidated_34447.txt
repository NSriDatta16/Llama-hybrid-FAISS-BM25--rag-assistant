Finite moving average processes have infinite autoregressive representations if they satisfy the invertibility conditions given in Box, Jenkins and Reinsel (1994) page 70. Mixed models such as ARMA(1,1) have both infinite moving average and infinite autoregressive representations if they are stationary and satisfy invertibility conditions. This is also shown in Box, Jenkins and Reinsel (1994) pp. 77-78 where you can see how the representations are constructed.
