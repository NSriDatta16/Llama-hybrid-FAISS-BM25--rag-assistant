It really depends upon what you're doing with the data once you have it in Oracle. If you're going to be querying it frequently it would be more efficient to use sqlloader. By bringing the data into a regular Oracle table you get the ability to add indexes, a primary key, and so on. Also, since the data is managed by Oracle the performance may be better because the data is organized into a more rigidly defined structure. External tables are really for convenience when you're going to be querying data infrequently on a set of external data. It saves the trouble of duplicating storage (the file and the oracle tablespace) and/or waiting for sqlloader to finish a batch job. However, I would typically use them for full table reads, since Oracle has no way to find a particular row. Short answer: If you query this table with a "where" clause, make a table using sqlloader. If not, try both and evaluate performance.
