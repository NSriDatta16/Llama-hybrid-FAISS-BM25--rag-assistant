Conditional C# Binary Serialization

I am using BinaryFormatter to serialize a class and its variables by condition. For example: [Serializable] public class Class1 { private Class2 B; ... } [Serializable] public class Class2{...} I want the variable B to be serialized only when remoting time, but not when i serialize it to file storage. Questions: 1) I know that in XmlSerialization we can use [XmlIgnore] and {PropertyName}Specified to ignore the property conditionally. Is that a equivalent method for [NonSerialized]? 2) For a class with [Serializable] attribute, how to ignore it at the runtime?
