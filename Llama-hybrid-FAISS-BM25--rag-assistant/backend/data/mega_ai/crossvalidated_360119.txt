What neural network topology is recommended to predict signals?

Assumed I have gathered some measures of a complex system and I want to train a neural network to predict certain measure outcomes based on some simulated inputs, what ANN layout would you recommend? The inputs are unbound FP numbers, i.e. 0 to infinity, the outputs are mixed, i.e. some are ranged FP, others are unbound - so part of the problem is to represent possible outcomes if inputs are outside of the training data space A simple example of the kind of problem I am looking at: Predict the fuel consume of a car based on recorded (speed,consume) tuples, where training data would be various between 0 to 150km/h, and then querying the ANN with input 220km/h
