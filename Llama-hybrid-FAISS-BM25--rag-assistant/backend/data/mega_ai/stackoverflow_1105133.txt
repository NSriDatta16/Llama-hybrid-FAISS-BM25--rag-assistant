How can I get a css position change to take effect during a JQuery UI Draggable element's start event handler?

I have an odd situation in which I need to modify the position of a draggable element as soon as the user starts dragging it. So, during the draggable element's start event handler, I'm trying to set the position. It doesn't respond to the position change unless - and this is weird - I do something to cause a javascript error after I change the position. Here's an example: Drag reposition test #draggable { width: 150px; height: 150px; padding: 0.5em; } $(function() { $("#initialdragger").draggable({ start: function(e, ui) { $('#initialdragger').css('top', 400); x = y; // Javascript error, which weirdly causes a redraw. } }); }); Drag me around How can I legitimately cause a redraw to happen in this context? JQuery's hide() and show() don't work and neither do these methods .
