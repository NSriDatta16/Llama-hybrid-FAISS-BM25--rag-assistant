How can regression trees be fit in WinBUGS/OpenBUGS/JAGS?

There is an R package called BayesTree which can fit regression trees in Bayesian environment. However, this way only simple regression is possible. I would like to use regression trees as a part of a bigger hierarchical model instead of the simple GLM formulas (CARTs are proven to give better results in certain applications, see e.g. Hu et al 2011 ). Is it possible (and how) to fit regression trees as a part of the model in WinBUGS/OpenBUGS/JAGS? Are there any such packages for these pieces of software?
