why accuracy on training dataset is 100% using random forest caret , does it indicate overfitting?

I tried to predict on training set but i got accuracy of 100%. However on the testset, i got an accuracy of 62%. Should i be worried of getting high accuacies on training dataset using caret? why accuracy on training dataset is 100% using random forest caret , does it indicate overfitting?
