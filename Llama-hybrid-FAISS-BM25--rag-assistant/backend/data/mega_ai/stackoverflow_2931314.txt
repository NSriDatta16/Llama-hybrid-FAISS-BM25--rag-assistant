Arduino code is just C++ wearing a dress and hat. You should be able to use that mode in Emacs without problems. You may miss the one-click-compile-and-transfer button, as well as the organization of the libraries from the official IDE. You can replicate either in Emacs of course. There is nothing the official IDE does that Emacs can't do.
