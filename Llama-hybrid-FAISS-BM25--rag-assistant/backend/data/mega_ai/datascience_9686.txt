Mathematics major for data science

So I'm a recent transfer 2nd year student from Computer Science major to Mathematics major. Though I do have a bit of an issue here. I can choose between the applied mathematics, pure mathematics and statistics concentrations. Along with this major, I'm doing a minor in Data Science with courses focused on Economics and Statistics. In the future, I'm interested in doing a master's degree in Data Science and a career in data analysis for businesses. Although I know any degree can be used to get into graduate school, I still want to which would be most beneficial for education in the future as well as opportunities for internships, research, and jobs. Thank you!
