Is there a good date/time API available for Scala?

I'm looking for something akin to JodaTime or JSR 310 for Scala that leverages nice Scala features such as operator overloading and doesn't rely on implicit conversions (I have an irrational fear of implicit conversions). I'm aware of http://github.com/jorgeortiz85/scala-time , but it just pimps JodaTime with implicits.
