Faster RCNN is not able to recognize composed elements

I tried to fine tune Faster RCNN to realize object detection task with bounding boxes where I shall recognize face, eyes and mouth on image. However Faster RCNN seems to fail to recognize objects when they contain another one(face contains nose). I tried the same task on faces only and it worked good. Is it a general behavior? How can I explain that? Is there a trick to get over it?
