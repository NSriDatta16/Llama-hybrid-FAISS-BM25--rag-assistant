It probably won't, at least not if the delivery is due in less than 3 months. Personally I'd assume that for the first month they'll be essentially negatively productive - they'll do almost nothing of use themselves and take away from the rest of the team asking questions, breaking things and so on. The next month they'll be close to breakeven, maybe a little better but basically doing and taking in equal measure. The final month they'll probably make up for what they damaged in the first month. After that they'll be about as productive as anyone else after 3 months on the project (that is competent but not as useful as the guys who've been on it for longer). (Note: this assumes that the developers being added don't outnumber those who can productively get them up to speed. Where you're adding, say, two developers to the project and there's only one who can talk them through things you're potentially doubling the impact on the existing guy and halving the speed the new guys get going). The things which will determine the precise impact will be: 1) technical skills 2) knowledge of the business domain 3) knowledge relating to the specific project 4) size of the overall team, in particular how many extra people are you adding as a percentage You want the first three to be high and the last one such that proportionally the team isn't changing too much. Add one person to a 10 man team and the impact is managable. Make a 5 man team in to a ten man team and you're probably screwed for 3 - 6 months. Why is it this way? More people increase the number of lines of communication, lower the average knowledge level, increase the chance something is going to be questioned (and therefore the debate reopened, possibly usefully, probably not), increase the disruption to a functioning team and so on.
