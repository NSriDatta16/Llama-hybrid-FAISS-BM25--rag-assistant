Bayesian Network: Scoring functions for structure learning?

Which are the widely used scoring functions for structural learning? More, specifically I am interested in scoring function that favours the random variables which have binary possible states. For an example like: A) Bayesian scoring function: - BD - BDe - BDeu - K2 B) Information theoretic function: - LL - MDL/BIC - AIC - NML - MIT Or SparsityBoost scoring function
