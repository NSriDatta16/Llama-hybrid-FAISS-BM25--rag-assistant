You are looking for: FireQuery http://firequery.binaryage.com/ To do it your own, you can always access the events data structure from a jQuery object . Example: $(document.body).bind('click', function(){ alert('I am an event handler!'); }); $.each($(document.body).data('events'), function(i,v){ console.log(i); $.each(v, function(i2,v2){ console.log(' > ', v2.handler.toString()); }); }); That would list all events into your FireBug/Webkit console and print it's event handler functions as plain text. You can remove the .toString() part or just log v2 the get more detailed information. update Like Anurag commented, that will show you only handlers which were bound through jQuery . It will not lookup up addEventhandler() / addHandler or inline-event handlers. You can lookup inline-event handlers by checking for the on-xxx attribute. DOM level3 does implement hasEventListenerNS , but I don't think any browser uses those yet.
