Static Evaluation Function for Checkers

I'm trying to write an evaluation function for a game of checkers that I'm developing but I can't find the right documentation. I've read several documents on the web witch describe different techniques for either writing one or letting the computer find it(using genetic algorithms or Bayesian learning) but they're too complicated for a novice like me. All documents pointed a reference to "Some studies in machine learning using the game of checkers" by A.L.Samuel but I couldn't get my hands on it yet :(. I've only read the follow up "Some studies in machine learning using the game of checkers -II" and found some good info there, but it doesn't explain what the eval parameters mean (I think I don't have the whole article).
