How would I dynamically add a new XML node based on the values of other nodes?

Background: I have an old web CMS that stored content in XML files, one XML file per page. I am in the process of importing content from that CMS into a new one, and I know I'm going to need to massage the existing XML in order for the import process to work properly. Existing XML: true false true false true Desired XML: true false true false true 1,3,5 Question: The desired XML adds the node, with a comma-delimited list of the other nodes that have a "true" value. I need to achieve the desired XML for several files, so what is the best way to accomplish this? Some of my ideas: Use a text editor with a regex find/replace. But what expression? I wouldn't even know where to begin. Use a programming language like ASP.NET to parse the files and append the desired node. Again, not sure where to begin here as my .NET skills are only average. Suggestions?
