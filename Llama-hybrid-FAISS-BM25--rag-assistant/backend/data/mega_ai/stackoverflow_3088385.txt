IMG tag does not display after INPUT tag

Given the html fragment Test JQuery AppendTo Just some text Test Label and given that the add2.jpg image is in the same directory as the html code, why does the image not display? Note that if I move the image tag node to be inside the div node, it will display :( Note the display does not appear regardless of whether I add the img tag at design time as above, or append it using the jQuery.appendTo function when the form loads.
