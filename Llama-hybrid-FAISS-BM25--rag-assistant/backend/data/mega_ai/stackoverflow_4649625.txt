Classifying website type from webpages

Are there any reliable/deployed approaches, algorithms or tools to tagging the website type by parsing some its webpages. For ex: forums, blogs, PressRelease sites, news, E-Comm etc. I am looking for some well-defined characteristics (Static rules) from which this can be determined. If not, then i hope Machine Learning model may help. Suggestions/Ideas ?
