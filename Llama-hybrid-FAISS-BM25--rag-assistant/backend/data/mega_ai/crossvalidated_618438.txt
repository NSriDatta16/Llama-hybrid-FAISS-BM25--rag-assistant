If your dependent variable (DV) is binary (germinated vs. didn't) then you don't want any kind of ANOVA. That's for continuous DV. You have multiple time points. From the data, it looks like different seeds at different time points. If that's the case, then you can do logistic regression with media and time as independent variables. If they are the same seeds tested for germination at multiple time points, then I'd say a nonlinear multilevel model could be good. You say that it's fine to lump the stages -- OK. But then, why did you collect it? If you want to not lump the stages, you can use ordinal logistic.
