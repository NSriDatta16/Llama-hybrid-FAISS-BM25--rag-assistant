Agree with @DJohnson and I will expand on his answer a bit. There has been research on a RELAIMPO-based approach (i.e., dominance analysis ) as applied to logit regression (also similar other approaches ). Given that the Poisson and Logit model differ, in terms of the Generalized Linear Model, only in their link function (log as opposed to logit) and probability distribution (Poisson as opposed to Bernoulli), the solutions applied to the logit regression should hold on Poisson regression when changing these two model specifications. The dominance/RELAIMPO approach here should permit a reasonable way to obtain a rank order and stay within the Poisson model. The only implementation of a dominance approach which accommodates generalized linear models (not specifically logistics), that I know of, is available in Stata . References Budescu, D. V. (1993).
