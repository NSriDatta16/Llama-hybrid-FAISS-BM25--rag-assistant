Discriminant analysis vs logistic regression

I found some pros of discriminant analysis and I've got questions about them. So: When the classes are well-separated, the parameter estimates for logistic regression are surprisingly unstable. Coefficients may go to infinity. LDA doesn't suffer from this problem. If number of features is small and the distribution of the predictors $X$ is approximately normal in each of the classes, the linear discriminant model is again more stable than the logistic regression model. What is stability and why is it important? (If logistic regression provides a good fit that does its job, then why should I care about stability?) LDA is popular when we have more than two response classes, because it also provides low-dimensional views of the data. I just don't understand that. How does LDA provide low-dimensional views? If you can name more pros or cons, that would be nice.
