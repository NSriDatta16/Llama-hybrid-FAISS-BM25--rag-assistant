How can we convert time series data to supervised learning problem?

I am preparing a data for machine learning model. I want to deal with time series data as normal supervised learning prediction. Let's say I have a data for car speed and I have several cars models such as +-----+---------+-------------+ | day | Model | Speed | +-----+---------+-------------+ | 1 | Bentley | 20.47 km/h | | 2 | Bentley | 32.22 km/h | | 3 | Bentley | 23.11 km/h | | 1 | BMW | 37.60 km/h | | 2 | BMW | 27.90 km/h | | 3 | BMW | 40.47 km/h | so I want to deal with several model in training so that predict the speed for Bentley and BMW. I have converted the data for training like this : +---------+------------+------------+-------------------+ | Model | day_1 | day_2 | label == day_3 | +---------+------------+------------+-------------------+ | Bentley | 20.47 km/h | 32.22 km/h | 23.11 km/h | | BMW | 37.60 km/h | 27.90 km/h | 40.47 km/h | +---------+------------+------------+-------------------+ Is it a correct approach?
