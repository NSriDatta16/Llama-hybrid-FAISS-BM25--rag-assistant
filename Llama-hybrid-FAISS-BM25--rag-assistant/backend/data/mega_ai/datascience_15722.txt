Image classification with Neural Network in R

I want to classify images in a few different groups with a Neural Network algorithm in R. I have tried different things but nothing works. So my question is: what is the best way to read in images so that I can put the data in a Neural Network algorithm? Check out my other question as well for things that I have tried already: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40660306/picture-classification-with-neural-network-in-r
