You get those values because you are using %i. The firstTouch.x and .y values are actually floats and so you should use %f in NSLog. For adding a button, you will have to alloc a new button each time (experts, correct me if i am wrong). Other than that, the rest of your code looks good enough to add a button on tapped point. Oh yes, you can get firstTouch.x and firstTouch.y in touchBegan method itself and add a button right there.
