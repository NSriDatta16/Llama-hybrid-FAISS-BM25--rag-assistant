Year or indeed any time dimension is a hard thing to include into a ML model because it begs one question: Are we looking at a time series or not? Time series behave categorically different than data that is not ordered sequentially and we have to model them differently. You could treat year/time like any other dimension and use it as a predictor in a regression-based model. But that would not be ideal! Instead try to use models that are suited to time series analysis like ARIMA or even deep learning models like LTSTM. A straight-forward way to treat this would be to model a simple prediction based on a time-series model like ARIMA and then build a second model on top that takes in all the other predictors and tries to predict the residuals from the time series model.
