You cannot change the runtime type of an object in Java (though you can assign a reference to and object to a supertype, and cast back to a subtype). You would need to construct a new object of the superclass runtime type. I would generally recommend that all classes should be abstract or leaf (conceptually final , if not actually marked as such for pragmatic reasons).
