Removing unclosed opening tags from xhtml document

I have a big xhtml document with lots of tags. I have observed that a few unclosed opening paragraph tags are repeating unnecessarily and I want to remove them or replace them with blank space. i just want to code to identify unclosed paragraph tags and delete them. Here's a small sample to show what I mean: Company Registration No.1 Company Registration No.2 HALL WOOD (LEEDS) LIMITED REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Can some one please give me code for console application, just to remove these unclosed paragraph tags.
