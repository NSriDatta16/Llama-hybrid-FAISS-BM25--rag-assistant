Charlie, I recommend two things. First, have a read through De Boef and Keele (2008) for a really decent overview of different time series models, especially how they relate to one another. Second, consider using a single equation generalized error correction model (described in the preceding paper, and in more detail in Banerjee, et al. 1993), which has several attractive qualities, including: estimation of instantaneous short run effects estimation of lagged short run effects estimation of long run equilibrium effects desirable estimation properties (see De Boef, 2001) model agnosticism as to the stationarity/non-stationarity of model predictors ready correspondence to other dynamic model forms (e.g. ADL(1)). The basic form of the single equation generalized error correction model is: $\Delta y_{t} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{\text{c}}\left(y_{t-1}-x_{t-1}\right) + \beta_{\Delta x}\Delta x_{t} + \beta_{x}x_{t-1} + \varepsilon$ These models can be extended to incorporate multiple predictors, more lags, random effects, etc. References Banerjee, A., Dolado, J.
