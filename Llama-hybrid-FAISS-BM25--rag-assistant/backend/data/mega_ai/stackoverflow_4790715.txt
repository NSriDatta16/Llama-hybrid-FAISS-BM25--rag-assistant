Managing loads of small projects

most of the books about Project Management (if not all of them) describe management of one big project. Sometimes they describe how to manage very few projects in the same time. But I have very different situation. I manage small team (4 people) with very small projects. Usually one engineer works on dedicated project. Some times One engineer work on few projects with different priorities (projects quite often switched to "on hold" state for a several days). So my specific is: Small projects with short lifetime (1 week to 2 month in general) Projects usually are not shared between engineers Number of projects can be 2-3 times higher then number of people (some projects go "on hold" quite often) There are 2 longterm projects with lowest priority which can be shared between engineers Can someone share own experience how to manage projects like this, or if you never had such experience but have an idea how to organize that I'll be glad to read it. Of course if you know book which can help me - I'll be glad to check it as well. May be there is ready methodology for thas kind of projects which I never heard. Thank you.
