(multiple) fractional outcomes & autoregression

Let me start with a broad description of the problem and I will then describe my approach (that might be totally inappropiate). The big goal is to predict the distribution of population of a given age (say 15-24) across "educational states" e.g. undergrad in humanities, undergrad social sciences, high-school student, vocational school pupil in IT etc. (I define ~ 20 such states). I have a 20 years long time series of a small, but representative sample from the population. My approach is to: calculate the ratios of states in the sample (that neccessarily sum up to one), somehow examine how those ratios evolve over time (problem: time-series is short) predict the ratios for the next few years multiply the ratios by the expected total population size Apart from obvious problem with the sample siize and time-series length, how would I approach a question of trends in fractional outcomes? Since I have little intuition on what exogenous variables would explain the changes, I wanted to start with an autoregressive model. But does it make sense here? And how to include the restriction that the ratios must be postive and sum up to 1 in every prediction? (edit) I was suggested to use Bayesian VAR - how sensible it is? (further edit) After a long search and consideration, my current approach is as follows: - transform ratios into log-odds (with logit function) - use Bayesian VAR with Banbura prior to forecast (as it looks robust and consistent with a stylized fact that education choices do not change rapidly) - transform back with inverse-logit to ratios. My questions: does it make sense? What assumptions about the data I implictly employ? What do I need to check (some statistical tests?) to make sure this approach is valid?
