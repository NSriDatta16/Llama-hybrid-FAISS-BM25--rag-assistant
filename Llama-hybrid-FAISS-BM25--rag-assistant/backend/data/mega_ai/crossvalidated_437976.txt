Sampling distribution is not normal. How is that possible?

As central limit theorem suggests, sampling distribution is approaching normal on the large sample sizes regardless of the initial distribution of the variable. And it's always been true for me until I stumbled on this one. I have a sample of 50K observation. I want to bootstrap a confidence interval around the mean. I take a sample of size 20K with replacement, calculate its mean and repeat it 10,000 times. Then I plot a histogram of it and what I expect to see is something like normal distribution (as always). However, what I see is this: Then I noticed that there were 3 huge outliers. Once I filtered them out, the sampling distribution became normal as expected: Now the questions: how come that initial sampling distribution did not have approximately normal shape (1) and, as logic suggests, does that mean that bootstrapping is fragile to outliers even with such a large sample sizes and number of repetitions 10,000 and even 100,000 times (2)?
