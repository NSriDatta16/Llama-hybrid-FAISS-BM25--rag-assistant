More importantly than learning an engine or a language (dialect) is to focus on something you can actually pull off in a reasonable time frame. Biting off more than you can chew (common in indie game development) will just deter you from ever trying again. Game development is difficult, an engine is no shortcut. Aim on a simple, single-player, 2D graphics game. If it's really your first game, you should use generated, ugly-looking content rather than trying to load resources from disk, which probably just complicates things. Build it from the buttom up. You will learn the basics on memory organisation, sprite/bitmap workings, sounds, operating system interaction, to mention a few things. When you know how to do that that and know it well, you can move on to an engine like Torque; and then you might actually put it to some use. And hey - good luck and have fun! Edit: You might also be interested in using a rapid game prototyping tool such as Trabant . With such a tool you can try out game concepts in minutes rather than days. When you know what you want, you build it using UE4 or some other game engine. Disclaimer: I'm the author of Trabant.
