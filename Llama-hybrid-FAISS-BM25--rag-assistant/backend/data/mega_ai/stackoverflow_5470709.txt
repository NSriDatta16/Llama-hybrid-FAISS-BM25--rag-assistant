If you are using 5.3 you can make some use of closures like this: $text = " This is the start of the paragraph This is some more of the paragraph. And some more"; $matches = array(); $text = preg_replace_callback('/ (.*)$/m', function($match) use (&$matches){ $matches[] = $match[1]; }, $text); var_dump($text,$matches); Output is: string ' This is some more of the paragraph. And some more' (length=52) array 0 => string 'This is the start of the paragraph' (length=34) I'm assuming there could be multiple tags in the text, and therefore, I put all the text that follows the tag into an array called matches. As a further example... with the following input: $text = " This is the start of the paragraph Line 2 doesn't have a tag... This is some more of the paragraph. Line 4 doesn't have a tag... And some more"; The output is: string ' Line 2 doesn't have a tag... This is some more Line 4 doesn't have a tag... ' (length=78) array 0 => string 'This is the start of the paragraph' (length=34) 1 => string 'of the paragraph.' (length=17) 2 => string 'And some more' (length=13)
