To calculate the significance of the Pearson correlation accounting for serial dependence of the data (auto-correlation), you can use the "Artificial Skill Method" from Davis 1978 and Chelton 1980, which basically weights the correlation at lags where a deterministic relation is expected with the very long lags (where no deterministic relation is expected). We have implemented the method in functions under R, Fortran and Matlab/Octave which give you the critical value of the correlation coefficient and/or the p-value of the Pearson correlation between time series. Here is the link to the code (please read the description in the readme file before using): https://gitlab.com/ismael_diego/artificial-skill-method And here is the study where we show how good this method performs by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We also show that the method is particularly suitable for time series found in nature (animal abundance, air temperature, etc) or of anthropogenic origin (pollution, CO2 concentration, etc): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722073193 If you find our function useful, please quote this paper in any publication!
