Existence of a common term if time series are pairwise cointegrated

Let's suppose that we have $n$ time series that are integrated of order one: $y_t^i\sim I(1)$ for $i=1, 2, \dots, n$ The difference between any two series is stationary: $y_t^i-y_t^j\sim I(0)$ for $i,j=1, 2, \dots, n$ I can express each time series as the sum of a $I(1)$ common term (which is shared by all of the time series) and an $I(0)$ stationary process (which can be unique to each series): $y_t^1=y_t^\text{common} + y_t^\text{1, stationary}$ $y_t^2=y_t^\text{common} + y_t^\text{2, stationary}$ $y_t^3=y_t^\text{common} + y_t^\text{3, stationary}$ etc. Does a common term always exist if time series are pairwise cointegrated? Is there a simple proof for that?
