Machine learning for imputation?

I am currrently working on a paper where we have two datasets, where I wish to impute variables from one dataset onto the other. The way that I have been currently thinking about this is to use machine learning. The case is as follows: Dataset 1: Linkable, randomly drawn and representative survey data (firm level) Dataset 2: Linkable, high dimension, administrative total population data (firm level) Within Dataset 1, we have a binary variable of interest (Collaborative innovation) which we wish to impute for the entire population in Dataset 2. The strategy that I have applied for this so far is to use LASSO, where a wide array of variables from Dataset 2 have been used to create a predictive model. The problem, however, is that the outcome, "Collaborative innovation" is too rare for the LASSO to stick, despite rich data. My question is hence: Are there other contending techniques (machine learning or otherwise) that could be used to impute these outcomes? Could perhaps Generative Adverserial Networks be applied? (i.e., create a "fake" outcome based on supplementary data). I hope I have expressed myself sufficiently clear. Thank you for your time.
