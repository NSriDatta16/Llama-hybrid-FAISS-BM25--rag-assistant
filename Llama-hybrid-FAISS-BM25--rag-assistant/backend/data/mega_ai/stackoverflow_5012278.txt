Assuming you are avoiding Nick's suggestion for some particular reason, the next best thing would be to include the copying process in your build system. 1 When you build your deploy target, maven/make/ant/"your favorite build tool" should check out copies of your latest revision from your source control system into separate directories, then copy in or rename the appropriate yaml files. 2 You do have an automated build process, right? If not that should be very high on your list if you are striving for elegance. You are using source control, right? I refuse to entertain the notion that you aren't, because that would be downright ridiculous.
