Comparison test for two datasets

I have two sets of data A (n=100) and B (n=10000).Given 40 data points of B match with A, I want to run some tests on the matched and unmatched data points to see if they are significantly different. For example, if the average points and reliability score for the matched and unmatched set is significantly different? I also want to run some additional tests. For example, if the B points detected in peak hours are significantly more likely to be matched compared to off peak hours? What are some suitable tests for these?
