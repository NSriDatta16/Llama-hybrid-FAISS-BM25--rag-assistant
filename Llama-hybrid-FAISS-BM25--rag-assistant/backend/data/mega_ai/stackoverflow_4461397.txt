Yes, this is specified by C99 6.7.8p10: If an object that has automatic storage duration is not initialized explicitly, its value is indeterminate. If an object that has static storage duration is not initialized explicitly, then: if it has pointer type, it is initialized to a null pointer; if it has arithmetic type, it is initialized to (positive or unsigned) zero; if it is an aggregate, every member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules; if it is a union, the first named member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules.
