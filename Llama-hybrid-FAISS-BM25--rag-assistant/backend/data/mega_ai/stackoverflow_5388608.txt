I'd suggest you use public key authentication instead (generate public/private keypair with ssh-keygen on the client, add the public ( .ssh/id.pub by default) key to .ssh/authorized_keys on the serverâ€”see the man page). Than you can either: Give the passphrase for the key in advance using ssh-agent , or use a key without passphrase. In the later case I suggest you limit the key to a particular command. I am not sure how to set a command for scp, but ssh test@172.100.100.143 'cat /tmp/11-03-15_03:00:01.tar.gz' > /tmp/11-03-15_03:00:01.tar.gz is equivalent. You just write command=" the command " in front of your key in .ssh/authorized_keys . Than the ssh server, when authorized with this key, will always run specified command no matter what was given on ssh command line. This limits the damage an attacker could do if they got access to your passphrase-less key. If you need the name of file to get to vary, you will need to write a script on the server side, that will pull out the name of $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND (that's where the server-side script gets whatever was given on ssh command-line), check that it's one of the permitted files and cat it.
