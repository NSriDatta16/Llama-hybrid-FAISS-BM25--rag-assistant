R: Finding relationships between 2 variables to determine any patterns in data

I am working on finding relationships/patterns between 2 variables (Type_A, Type_B). Loc_ID df1: +--------+--------+--------+ | Loc_ID | Type_A | Type_B | +--------+--------+--------+ | 45 | 22.96 | 9.26 | | 46 | 23.36 | 9.28 | | 47 | 23.70 | 9.35 | | 48 | 23.55 | 9.44 | | 49 | 23.52 | 9.42 | | 50 | 23.42 | 9.43 | | 51 | 23.61 | 9.46 | +--------+--------+--------+ Loc_ID is the location ID. Type_A & Type_B are 2 different measurement types. Some Background: This data was gathered from an experiment studying different hard discs. There are some hard discs that failed and some that passed. I determine this metric based on just looking at some contour profile plots of the discs using the measurement types I mentioned above. This is not an efficient process and I want to apply some data mining or machine learning techniques to automate my tasks. I did some extensive feature selection and I am sure that these measurement types tell me something about the potential causes in the process. I want to know how data mining could help determine the failure at the early stage and eliminate it. Note: I have reported a fraction of the data for one of the failed disc here in the example. I have tried the following so far Generated simple stats and plots for initial visualization Calculate key features of the data by performing dimensionality reduction Found correlations in the dataset to determine if any relationships. I would like to know any other methods to efficiently carry out this relationship analysis of these 2 measurement types. For example: profile comparisons with respect to locations, predict both the measurement types for building better models. I am just not able to think of best practices in machine learning to handle this problem. Kindly let me know any other techniques and how I could tackle this? I would like to automate my analysis so that I could use it on all the bad and good discs.
