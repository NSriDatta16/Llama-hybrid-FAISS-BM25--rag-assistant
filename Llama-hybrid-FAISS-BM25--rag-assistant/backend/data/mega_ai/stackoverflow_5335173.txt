Haven't tried that, but just looked it up in the help and it says "You cannot convert special text to a number." I guess that's what's special about it :) Must be something about the inner workings of the view indexing... Anyway, knowing about the limitations of other formulas in the views, the only think I can think of is running an agent that goes through the entries in the view and for document entries uses the NotesViewEntry.DescendantCount and NotesViewEntry.ChildCount to calculate the value and save it in the document. It could be a scheduled agent (sighed with an ID that has access to edit the documents). Does that help?
