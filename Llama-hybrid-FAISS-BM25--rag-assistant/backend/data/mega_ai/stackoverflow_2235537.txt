I would say that the final say on how a site should look (in terms of design, screen flow and usability) should come from the client. However designers and developers should try to frame their ideas from a business sense. Remember that most (ok some) designers have spent a large amount of time at university studying elements of graphical design and know what colours work together and what gets peopleâ€™s attention. Good developers will have some understanding on usability and we all know that usability is important. Whilst the customer should always have the last say we (as service providers) should always be willing to provide input (if warranted).
