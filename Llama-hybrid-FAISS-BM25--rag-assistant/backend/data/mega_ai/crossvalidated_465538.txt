If i go by your problem which can be summarized as follows: Given features - weather (sunny/overcast/rainy) Target - To predict whether one should play or not. Now since we have only one feature, so it makes sense to not train any machine learning model(be it be Naive Bayes, KNN, etc). Your approach will work fine, i.e we can simply calculate the probability using each feature, which is obviously easy to calculate given only one feature, and then by majority vote we can reach to the conclusion. Naive Bayes is useful when we have several independent features, in which we learn the likelihood of different features in training data during the training phase. Hope this helps!.
