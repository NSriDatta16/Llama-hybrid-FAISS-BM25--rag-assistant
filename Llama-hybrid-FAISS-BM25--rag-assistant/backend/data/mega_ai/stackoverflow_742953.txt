Defragmentation: Here's what VMWare recommends: "first, run a defragmentation utility in the VM; second, use the WMware Workstation defragmentation tool; third, run a defragmentation utility on the host" Backup: for my VMs, I use SynbackPro to run a timed backup of my project files to a SHARED folder on my host machine, then on the host I have SyncbackPro running a timed backup to an external drive. That way, no matter which VM I happen to be using, the external drive gets the backups.
