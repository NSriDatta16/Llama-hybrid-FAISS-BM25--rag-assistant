Normality test for non-independent observations

I want to check if my data's distribution is normal. Thought of visual and formal test. One thing I'm not sure about â€“ my observations are respiratory measurements of patient. Each patient measure himself for 5 minutes (inhale, exhale). So the observations are not independent. Is it a problem preforming regular normality test (as I mention earlier)? If so, what would be the solution? tnx all for the answers. i want to check normality, because i want to present a summary value for every measurement (includes around 150 breaths), on a plot over time. so im triyng to decide if a the average will be good fit or maybe the median (?).
