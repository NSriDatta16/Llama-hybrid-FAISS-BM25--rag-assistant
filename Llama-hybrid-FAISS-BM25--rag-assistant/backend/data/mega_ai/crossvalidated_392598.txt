Help examining predicted probabilities from nested logistic models

I am having trouble explaining a recent finding to myself. I'm not sure if I'm asking a redundant question, but here is my situation: 1) Suppose I want to model the estimated probability of some outcome in a logistic model, then compare the estimated probabilities with a second set of estimated probabilities from a second logistic model . I'm doing this in R, and below is a "toy" example using the mtcars dataset. In this example, imagine that I want to summarise the average probability that a car has vs = 1 based on its carb : library(tidyverse) #Let's use a simple model fit1 I can compute the average probability for each level of carb as follows: #Yes, I realize that all cars with a given carb will have the same estimate, so taking the mean is a bit pointless cbind.data.frame(mtcars, pred = predict(fit1, type = "response")) %>% group_by(carb) %>% summarise(mean(pred)) # A tibble: 6 x 2 carb mean(pred) 1 1 1.000 2 2 0.500 3 3 0.00000000322 4 4 0.200 5 6 0.00000000318 6 8 0.00000000318 So far so good. These results are a bit weird, but whatever. (They are easy to interpret, at least) Now I want to fit a more complex model, incorporating a new predictor ( mpg ) that should help me get an estimate of the probability after adjusting for MPG. fit2 cbind.data.frame(mtcars, pred = predict(fit2, type = "response")) %>% group_by(carb) %>% summarise(mean(pred)) # A tibble: 6 x 2 carb mean(pred) 1 1 1.000 2 2 0.500 3 3 0.00000000322 4 4 0.200 5 6 0.00000000318 6 8 0.00000000318 What I can't figure out is: why are the estimates exactly the same? Surely mpg must have some predictive value that assists our estimate. Can anyone help explain what is going on here?
