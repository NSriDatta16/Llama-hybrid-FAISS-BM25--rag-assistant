So, I now found a way to make this work without the header. The navigation section uses the following CSS: float: left; height: 100% overflow: auto; width:185px; The content section uses this: height: 400px; overflow: auto; As well as html, body{ height: 100% } The only problem is that when I insert the header, the site stretches until outside of the browser window. This is due to the use of height: 100% . Do you know how I can make the page still fit the into the browser screen? edit 1: The following JavaScript would do the trick, at least in Firefox: window.onresize = resize; function resize(){ heightWithoutHeader = (window.innerHeight - 85) + "px"; document.getElementById("content").style.height = heightWithoutHeader; document.getElementById("navigation").style.height = heightWithoutHeader; } But maybe there's a more elegant CSS solution ...
