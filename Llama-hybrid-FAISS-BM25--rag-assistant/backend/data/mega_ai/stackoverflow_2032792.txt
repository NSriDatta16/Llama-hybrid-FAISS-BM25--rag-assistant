Thanks for all the help, but I used the solution proposed in this link: http://elegantcode.com/2009/01/17/abstracting-request-state/ This way I dont have to worry about thread static variables retaining their values at the end of each request cycle because of thread pooling and still manage to retain certain objects that are accessible anywhere within a thread which includes user credentials
