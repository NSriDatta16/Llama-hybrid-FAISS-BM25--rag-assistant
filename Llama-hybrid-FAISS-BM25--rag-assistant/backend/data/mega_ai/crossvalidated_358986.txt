Using machine learning model for predictions

I am trying to use my random forest model for predictions. I only want to select important variables(ex:top 50), and use the saved RF model to predict the response variable, changing the predictor values. Do I have to re-train the RF model for top 50 variables and use that model to perform predictions? My understanding is since the original RF model has more variables than 50, I cannot use the original model for predictions.
