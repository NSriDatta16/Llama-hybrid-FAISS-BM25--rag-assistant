Finding a control on a Winforms using LINQ?

I am trying to find an elegant way to get controls on a Windows Forms form by name. For example: MyForm.GetControl "MyTextBox" ... But this has to make sure it goes through all the controls recursively. What's the most elegant way to implement this using LINQ ?
