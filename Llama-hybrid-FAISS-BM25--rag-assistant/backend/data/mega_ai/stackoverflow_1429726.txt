It sounds like you are confusing terminology. HTTPS is the protocol used to request a page from the server using SSL or TLS encryption. That is separate from how you serve the request. In your PHP source includes are processed server-side. All of the includes will be done before PHP hands the page off to your web server to be returned over the TLS link. file.php: In the example above, the user agent (browser) never sees fileA.php or fileB.php. The page request is returned as a single document. You might request it via https://my-server.com/file.php , in which case that is all you need.
