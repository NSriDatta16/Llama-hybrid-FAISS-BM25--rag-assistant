Help Marshaling a C function in C#

I'm trying to call a C function from C#. Here is the function from the C header file : int __stdcall GetImageKN (unsigned short *ndat ); And from the documentation about this function : ndat : Pointer of the grayscale image data acquiring buffer. Always secure the range image storage area using the application program. The size of the range image data storage area should be: 160’ 120 ‘2 = 38400 bytes The grayscales are returned as 8 bit that is doubled from 7-bit. How do I invoke this function and read the image data ? Thanks, SW
