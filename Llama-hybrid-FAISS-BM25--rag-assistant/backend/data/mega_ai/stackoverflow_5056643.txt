The recent versions of http://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/ have added metadata for many new countries and added a lot more detail for some of the countries previously listed. The current source code version is r74 and the .jar file is at version 2.6. Previous .jar files were compiled for Java 1.6, but as of libphonenumber version 2.5.1 onwards they are now compiled for Java 1.5 and above. Don't forget there is also a direct port of the code to JavaScript. It can be found in the source code tree at http://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fjavascript Bug reports are welcome. Updates to metadata are actively encouraged, as even the official government-published area code lists for many countries are either incomplete or out of date.
