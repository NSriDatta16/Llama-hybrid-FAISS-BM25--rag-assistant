I've used both moo.fx and jQuery for AJAX in the past, both are very effective. moo has a very small footprint which is good and it also has quite a lot of graphics functionality in the base package. However if your looking to do a lot with javascript jQuery has more features and is very well documented. There is drag & drop functionality in both as well http://demos111.mootools.net/DragDrop http://ui.jquery.com/demos/droppable
