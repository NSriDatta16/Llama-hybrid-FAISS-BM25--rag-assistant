Since they're independent, you can just find confidence intervals for $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ separately; the only question is what coverage to use for them. The coverage probability for the joint interval, $1 - \alpha$ will be related to the probabilities for each interval, $1-\alpha_1$ and $1-\alpha_2$, as $$ 1 - \alpha = \Pr(\mu_1 \in I_1, \mu_2 \in I_2) = \Pr(\mu_1 \in I_1) \Pr(\mu_2 \in I_2) = (1-\alpha_1) (1-\alpha_2) .$$ If we decide to use the same sub-coverage probability, $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \alpha'$, we get $$ (1 - \alpha')^2 = 1 - \alpha \qquad\text{ so }\qquad \alpha' = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \alpha} .$$ So you can use a $1 - \sqrt{1 - \alpha}$ coverage probability for each of the sub-intervals; for example, $\alpha = .05$ would give $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 \approx 0.0253$. (This is just the Šidák correction . You could use Bonferonni instead if you preferred, which would give $\alpha' = \alpha / 2$.)
