Determining aperiodicity of markov chain

I am trying to show the following markov chain is aperiodic (it could very well not be) $S = \mathbb{Z}$ and $h : S \rightarrow (0,1)$ with $h(i)>0 \space \forall i \in S$ and $\sum_{i \in S}h(i) = 1$ the probabilities on $S$ given by $p_{ij} = (1/4)min(1,h(j)/h(i))$ if $|i-j| \leq 2$ and $i \neq j$, and $p_{ii} = 1-p_{i,i-2}-p_{i,i-1}-p_{i,i+1}-p_{i,i+2}$, and $p_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. ($p_{ij}$ is defined as the probability to go from state $i$ to state $j$) Now I have some reason to think this chain is aperiodic, this is my work so far: Assume $h(i)=h(j) \space \forall i,j \in S$, given $\sum_{i\in S} h(i) =1$ $h(i) = h(j) = \lim_{n \to \infty} (1/n)\sum_{i \in S}h(i) = 0$ with $n$ being the number of elements composing S. Therefore $h(i) = h(j) = 0\space \forall i,j \in S$ implying $\sum_{i \in S}h(i) = 0$ a contradiction, showing $h(i) \neq h(j)$ for some $i,j$. Now what this shows is that for some states in the chain, $p_{ii} \neq 0$ meaning that state is aperiodic. I hope however the whole chain is. Fow now I have the impression that I would have some 100 consecutive states with probability 1/10000 each, making my chain periodic, or is that possibility somehow not possible (pardon my wording)?
