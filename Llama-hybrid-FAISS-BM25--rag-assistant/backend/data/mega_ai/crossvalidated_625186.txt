Machine learning classification: best way to know if my variables are unable to distinguish between two classes

I am working with an imbalanced dataset containing 42 variables and around 136,000 observations, in order to perform a binary classification (96% of the observations belong to one class). I tried several approaches and models, but in the end, my classifier is bad (its confusion matrix is heavily pending to the more numerous class, and AUC-ROC measurements are a disaster). I suspect that the dataset does not contain information enough to split the target variable. How could I demonstrate this? I was thinking about plotting the distributions of each variable for each class, and, if they are very similar or identical, I would say that they do not have the power to predict the output. Reading Distinguishing between two groups in statistics and machine learning: hypothesis test vs. classification vs. clustering , I also believe I could use a k-means in the input dataset and see if it segregates over the two classes. But I don't know how rigorous are these approaches. Are these approaches valid? Is there a better approach?
