You are converting the left join to an inner join by including the b.msg filter in the where clause use. select a.* from TempA a left JOIN TempB B on a.id = b.id and b.msg = 'aa' (Conceptually) the Join Predicate happens, the non joining rows from A get added back in and will have a value of NULL for b.msg then you exclude these rows again with the filter!
