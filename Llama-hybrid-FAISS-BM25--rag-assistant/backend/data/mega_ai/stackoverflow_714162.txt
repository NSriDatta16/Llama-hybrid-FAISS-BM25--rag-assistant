How to sort multi-row entries in Excel?

So I have a document with many entries that follow this general format. Organization Name Title Address Phone Fax Description line 1 Description line 2 Organization's website. Organization Name Title Address Phone Fax Description line 1 Description line 2 Organization's website. Organization Name Title Address Phone Fax Description line 1 Description line 2 Organization's website. What I want to do is to sort them by organization and treat the first rows as one entry so excel essentially thinks: Organization Name Title Address Phone Fax Description line 1 Description line 2 Organization's website. is one row. I should also add that the bottom 3 rows are merged across the cells that form the row above them. Essentially I need it to work as a database but for government workers who are so technically unsavvy they can't upgrade to Office 2007 because the whole ribbon thing is "too confusing." So I am stuck using Excel 2002. I need to be able to sort them and use the top few rows above the actual chart to include a header and sub-heading.
