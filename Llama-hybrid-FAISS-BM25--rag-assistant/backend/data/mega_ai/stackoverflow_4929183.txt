How to use a gem in Sinatra?

I'm building a new version of a Facebook app called Lovers . You can find the Lovers source code on GitHub . I'm also building a custom gem for Facebook alongside it. I want the changes that I make to this custom Facebook gem to immediately go into effect for Lovers. What's the correct way to organize its directory structure? Currently, it looks like so: |- config.ru |- features |- support |- env.rb |- lib |- lovers |= lovers.rb |- vendor | - facebook | - lib |- modules/classes here I added ./vendor/facebook/lib to the $LOAD_PATH from config.ru & env.rb . That's working, but should I be using an init.rb file to do this? What's the best practice?
