Nowadays web programmers don't write this kind of code themselves. These use web frameworks like Struts or JSF or Spring (if you're a Java programmer) which provide elegant implementations of dispatching requests, of mapping from requests to classes that implement the requests. And much, much more. However, if you really want to "roll your own" , then I would suggest, first off, that you don't use an if statment inside your servlet. You should use a map (i.e., HashMap) that maps request URIs to service classes. On servlet init, the map should be populated with instances of the service classes. Inside your servlet add a method, getServiceClass() that return gets the URI and ACTIONS from the HttpServiceRequest and looks up your service class. Better yet, you should map the service classes, not to request parameters, but to URIs: myapp/serviceX maps to ServiceX.class. Define a service interface, Service, with an execute method and call the execute method from the Servlet. To sum up: 1) Load a map of request URIs to service classes when the servlet inits. 2) Define a service interface between the servlet and the service class. 3) From the servlet, grab the URI (relevant portion of the URI) from the request and lookup the corresponding Service and call its execute method (or whatever name you choose to give).
