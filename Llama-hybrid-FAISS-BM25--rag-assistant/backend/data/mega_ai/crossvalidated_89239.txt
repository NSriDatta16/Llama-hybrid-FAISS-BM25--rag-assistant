Evaluating a regression model

For classification problems I have been using Neural Networks and measuring Type I and II error using the confusion matrix and its measures as per this resource ( mirror ), which is pretty straight forward. When faced with an estimation problem, how would one assess the model performance? Assuming that there are no classes and the output is interpreted in real form. Beyond averaging distance metrics, which does not lend much insight.
