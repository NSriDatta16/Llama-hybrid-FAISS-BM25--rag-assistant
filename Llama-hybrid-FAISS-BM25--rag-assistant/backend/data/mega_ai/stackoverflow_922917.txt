0xE800003a Error when I try to install a second app onto my device

0xE8000003A Error: I have developed AppOne for several weeks. I can debug on both the Simulator and on the device. I now want to develop a small test app, AppTwo , with a feature which I later will port to AppOne. This involves text entry into a TextView, so I definitely want to try AppTwo out on the device. I can use the simulator fine, but each time I try to load AppTwo on the device I get 0xE8000003A Error: I clean all, I delete the build folder and still I get this error. My Provisioning Profile (PP) that I have been using, used the following appID : 2QUXJRP5YK.com.CompanyName.AppName I recently went to the portal and created a new PP hoping to solve this program the new PP has appID : 2QUXJRP5YK.com.CompanyName.* As I understand it, this PP will allow me to use the PP for any number of apps, not just the one named AppName In Organizer I now have both of the PPs listed in the Provisioning Profile List Box. I believe this means both PPs are beening loaded onto the device. I copied the Entitlements.plist from AppOne proj to AppTwo proj folder. The Build Configuration Page 1, for Architecture through CodeSigning there are zero differences between AppOne and AppTwo. Since AppTwo still works fine, it seems that I do not want to reset my device , but somehow tickle the Project Config for AppTwo. Do you have any advice for me, please? Thanks very much, Mark
