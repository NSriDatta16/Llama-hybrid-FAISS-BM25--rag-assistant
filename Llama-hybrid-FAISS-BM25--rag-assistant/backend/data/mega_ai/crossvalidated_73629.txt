How to sample using MCMC from a posterior distribution in general?

Assume one has the posterior distribution of a parameter, $p(\theta|y)$ and what I mean by having it is that for each point of $\theta$, one can use Monte Carlo method+MCMC to calculate the $p(\theta|y)$. Now my question is if I want to sample from $p(\theta|y)$, them basically I have to do one Gibbs sampling(for example) to sample from distribution and at any point I have to run Monte Carlo method on the point to calculate $p(\theta|y)$'s value right? i.e. it needs two loops, one inside of the other. Is this correct? As I got an answer to this question and I thought maybe my question is vague I will try to clarify it a bit more: From what I know by reading for a week the whole time about Monte Carlo method and MCMC, I understood(correct me if I am wrong) that: $$p(\theta|y)=\frac{p(y|\theta)p(\theta)}{\int_{\Theta}{p(y|\theta)p(\theta)}\text{d}\theta}.$$ Now if you consider that we only have a sampling algorithm for $\theta$ and we can only calculate $p(y|\theta)$ explicitly(and not the other functions!), therefore to get values from $p(\theta|y)$ one needs to numerically integrate the denominator. And for each value of this posterior one needs to apply a sampling scheme like Gibbs sampling to generate a sample of $p(\theta|y)$; each new transition in the parameter space should then sample from the distribution which is $p(\theta|y)$ here and to calculate that the above proportion should be computed.
