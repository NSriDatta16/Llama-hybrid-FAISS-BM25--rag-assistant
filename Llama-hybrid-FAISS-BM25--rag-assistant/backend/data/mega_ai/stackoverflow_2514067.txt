C# TextBox Autocomplete (Winforms) key events and customization?

I was wondering if it is possible to catch key events for auto-complete list. For example instead of Enter key press for auto-complete use lets say Tab key. Also is it possible to change the colors and add background image for the auto-complete pop-up list? Currently I have my own implementation which is a separate window(form) with a list-box, which works OK, but Id really like to use .net's auto-complete if it can do what I need. Thanks for attention.
