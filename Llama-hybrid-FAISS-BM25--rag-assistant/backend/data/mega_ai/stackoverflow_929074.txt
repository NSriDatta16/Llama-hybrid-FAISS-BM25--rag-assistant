Interesting...A resonable guess would be that your ContentViewData object is being upcast to BaseViewData due to some interaction with your nested master page (if that is indeed the case, someone else will need to weigh in as to why). You could verify trying this: The reason your workaround "works" is because your partial view is typed for ContentViewData, so when you pass in Model it is downcast to that type.
