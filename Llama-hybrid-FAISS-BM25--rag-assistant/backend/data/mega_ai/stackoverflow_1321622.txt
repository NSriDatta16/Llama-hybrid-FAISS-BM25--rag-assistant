Strive for simplicity and conciseness . Never leave cases where your code behavior is undefined . Look for opportunities to leverage the type system and have the compiler check as much as possible at compile time. Templates and code generation are your friends as long as you keep your common sense. Minimize the number of singletons and global variables. Use RAII ! Use assertions ! Automatic testing of some nominal and all corner cases. Avoid last minute changes like the plague.
