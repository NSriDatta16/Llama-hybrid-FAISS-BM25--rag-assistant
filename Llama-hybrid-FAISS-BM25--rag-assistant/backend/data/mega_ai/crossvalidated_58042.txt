Determine the communication classes for this Markov Chain

Say we have a Markov Chain with probability matrix $$ P = \begin{pmatrix} 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.5 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.66 & 0 & 0.33 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 \\ 0.5 & 0 & 0 & 0.25 & 0.25 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.2 & 0.8 \end{pmatrix} $$ I'm confused, it may seem really basic but I don't want to leave it to chance in the exam. What would be the communication classes. I would have thought that there would be only one as all the states communicate, hence it is irreducible. But states 4 and 5 could be a class?
