In short, this method is not statistically valid without further steps. The function sample = mcmc_sampler(log_lkl, log_prior, lkl_scale) should be detailed because, as presented, the method does not appear to be justified. Adding a constant to the likelihood modifies the probability model MCMC simulates from the posterior distribution to a geometric mixture of the prior and posterior distributions. The target of the MCMC is indeed the mixture $$\pi_c(\theta|x)\propto \pi(\theta)f(x|\theta)^c$$This means that the output has to be reweighted by $f(x|\theta)^{1-c}$ or subsampled by accepting only with probability proportional to $$f(x|\theta)^{1-c}$$ Or by using parallel tempering as in Neal (1999). Furthermore, the constant change of the weight $c$ according to the acceptance rate implies that the target is evolving along time, meaning the Markov chain is no longer time homogeneous, hence that the convergence of the MCMC sampler is in jeopardy. To be validated the algorithm must see the rate of update of the constant c decrease with the iteration index (condition of diminishing adaptation).
