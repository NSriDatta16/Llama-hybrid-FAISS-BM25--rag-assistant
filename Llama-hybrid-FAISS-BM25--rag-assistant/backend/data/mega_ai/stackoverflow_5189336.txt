Represent the angles as vectors with Norm=1 and average the sum. x1 = {cos(a),sin(a)} x2 = {cos(b),sin(b)} (x1+x2)/2 = {(cos(a)+cos(b))/2,(sin(a)+sin(b))/2} which means the angle for the mean is atan2((sin(a)+sin(b)) /(cos(a)+cos(b))) Just beware of controlling the possible overflow when the denominator is close to zero.
