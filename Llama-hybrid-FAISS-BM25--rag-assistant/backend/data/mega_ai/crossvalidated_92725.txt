Unsupervised Random Forest using Weka

I am having some issues understanding how unsupervised Random Forest works according to Breiman . I only have unlabeled data, so the thought arose to use unsupervised Random Forest and use the resulting dissimilarity matrix as input for a cluster algorithm. One "constraint" is that I have to use Weka. Can someone explain to me how exactly I have to understand the usage of original and synthetic data? As I understand it right now I have to: artificially add a class attribute with a value of, e.g., "0" for the original data make a randomized copy of the original data resulting in the synthetic data and add a class attribute with a value of, e.g., "1" Questions: Did I understand it correctly? What am I supposed to do next? Do I have to join these two data sets? Isn't that highly impractical for a, say, very large dataset, as I have to store the whole data while running it with Weka? How do I get the resulting dissimilarity matrix in Weka? I'm a little confused right now...
