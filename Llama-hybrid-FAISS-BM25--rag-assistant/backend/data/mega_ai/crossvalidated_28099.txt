Bayesian mixed model regression with a between subjects factor

I'm trying to specify a model in JAGS/rjags with one between subjects factor ( a , with two levels - Y , N ) interacting with one repeated measures continuous variable x plus subject varying slopes and intercepts that correlate. I can specify this model simply enough with the lmer function: lmer(y ~ a + x + a:x + (1 + a | id)) My JAGS/rjags is very rusty (or very fresh). The below seems to me to be fitting a model with subject varying intercepts and subject varying slopes while estimating the slope for both levels of a , but I'm not sure I'm doing what I think I'm doing. There's also no correlation specified between the two. modelstring = " model { for ( i in 1:Ntotal ) { y[i] ~ dnorm( mu[i] , tau ) mu[i] The framework for this comes from Kruschke and this has been of some help too. I would appreciate some pointers or links to examples of similar analyses.
