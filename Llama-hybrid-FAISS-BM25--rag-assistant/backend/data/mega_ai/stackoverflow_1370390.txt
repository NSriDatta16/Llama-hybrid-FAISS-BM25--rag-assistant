Question - are there any Open Source tools that read Flashpaper? Bear in mind that any restrictions that exist in the tool to read the document are only useful when there is no more permissive tool handy. If any tool becomes popular for limiting document use like that, there will be tools to grab the content. They may be illegal under the DMCA, but they will exist. Unless all you want to do is discourage those who are not tech-savvy, you're going to have to go for DRM. BTW, what is the intended use for this?
