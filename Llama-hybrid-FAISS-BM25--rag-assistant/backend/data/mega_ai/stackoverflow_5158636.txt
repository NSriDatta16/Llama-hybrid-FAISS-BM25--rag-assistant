Generating a flat file with SSIS to be read by IBM z/OS program

I am creating a fixed width text file using SSIS. The format of the flat file connection is Ragged Right. The file is generated correctly and passes all local unit tests on my Windows machine. The SSIS package then transmits the file using SFTP to a partner. The mainframe programmer at our partner claims he only can read one record. I checked what I was using for line breaks and I had chosen {CR}{LF}. I did some research and found a couple of articles that stated that non-Windows systems would not be able to recognize CRLF as a row delimiter, but {LF} would be valid. I tried that and the programmer there still says he only detects one record even if the file has over 100 records. Is there any additional SSIS configuration I am missing in my Flat File Connection? Could it be an encoding issue?
