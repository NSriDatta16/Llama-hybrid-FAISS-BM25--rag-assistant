How do you connect the "delegate" outlet of a UITextView to a class that implements UITextViewDelegate protocol?

How do you connect the "delegate" outlet of a UITextView to a class that implements UITextViewDelegate protocol? I can't seem to find an example in the docs The weird thing is the UITextView's "delegate" outlet has that drag 'n drop interface thingy, like you can wire it up to another widget but of course, I don't want to wire it up to a widget, I want to wire it up to an existing class .
