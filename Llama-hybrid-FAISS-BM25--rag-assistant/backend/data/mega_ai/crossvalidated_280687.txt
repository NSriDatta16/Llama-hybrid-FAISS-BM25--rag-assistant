From what I understand in your question you don't want to predict the graduation outcome but rather check which subject (your variables) grade has the most impact on graduation (As for your question regarding if high grade causes more graduation you can easily make a table or plot for that and check, As expected you'll see people getting higher grades have more Y). To check variable importance/impact there are many ways : Model Specific Methods: These are the methods that check variable impact based on the model built. E.g : t-statistic for linear models like logistic regression you said In random forest there is an importance function Recursive Partitioning, it is the reduction in loss function for each of your variables Importance function in xgboost varImp function in Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines(MARS) And there are more. Second category is model independent tests to check which variable has the most impact: The most basic test is to check correlation of the predictors (subject) with your response variable(Y/N). You can see check cor b/w categorical and numeric/categorical columns using the hetcor function in the polycor package in R Chi Squares Tests Information gain tests You can google these methods to know more about them and you'll easily find tutorials on how to apply them in R/Python. As for your second question to do component analysis, I suggest breaking down Math into different columns using one hot encoding(dummy), it will give you 0 if he has not taken the component and 1 if he has, and there will be corresponding graduation outcome for that.( You can find how to do it in R/Python easily on google). Then apply the tests that I said above for each subject individually. For the first analysis(subject importance one) , I have a question, You said not all people have taken all the subjects, So some values will be missing, what is the amount of those missing values (percentage) in each column. You may have to do imputation if it is large, otherwise just delete them.
