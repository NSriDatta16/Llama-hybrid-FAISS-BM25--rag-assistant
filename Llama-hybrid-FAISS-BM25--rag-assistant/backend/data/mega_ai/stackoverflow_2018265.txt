You can get a VPS for barely more than a standard shared host. Or better yet, get two VPS accounts and use one only for the database. You're really limited with what you can do to speed up Magento on a shared host, because so many tweaks rely on server configuration (which you can do with a VPS). Also, turn on every cache that you possibly can. See: http://www.magentocommerce.com/blog/comments/performance-is-key-notes-on-magentos-performance/ http://www.yoast.com/magento-performance-hosting/
