How to write a PowerShell function to get directories?

Using PowerShell I can get the directories with the following command: Get-ChildItem -Path $path -Include "obj" -Recurse | ` Where-Object { $_.PSIsContainer } I would prefer to write a function so the command is more readable. For example: Get-Directories -Path "Projects" -Include "obj" -Recurse And the following function does exactly that except for handling -Recurse elegantly: Function Get-Directories([string] $path, [string] $include, [boolean] $recurse) { if ($recurse) { Get-ChildItem -Path $path -Include $include -Recurse | ` Where-Object { $_.PSIsContainer } } else { Get-ChildItem -Path $path -Include $include | ` Where-Object { $_.PSIsContainer } } } How can I remove the if statement from my Get-Directories function or is this a better way to do it?
