@Jason, you're correct. The syntax "Browsable", and "Category" are Sharepoint 2003 specific. For SharePoint 2007, it's "WebBrowsable", and "SPWebCategoryName" respectively. DefaultValue(false) is also SharePoint 2003 specific. The equivalent in 2007, as far as I know, is to declare it initially beforehand, like this: private string _strMainFolder = "Reports"; //Here is the default value [WebBrowsable(true)] [WebDisplayName("SharePoint List Name")] [SPWebCategoryName("SharePoint List Name Settings")] [WebPartStorage(Storage.Shared)] [WebDescription("You would put the description here.")] [Personalizable(PersonalizationScope.Shared)] public string strMainFolder { get { return _strMainFolder; } set { _strMainFolder = value; } }
