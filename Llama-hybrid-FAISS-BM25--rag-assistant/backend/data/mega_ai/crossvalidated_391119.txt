Your hypothesis does not necessitate path analysis. FWIW a simple logistic regression model is easily fit, described, and tested. Being clear is important in science. The issue of conflating a few basic definitions is kind of a common pitfall of nutritional epi. For instance, you have not assessed "preference" in this case, but rather frequency--if your summaries are correctly labeled. Many healthy people prefer sweets and treats (to, say, pasta al forno, brocolli or nothing) but know to eat them infrequently. Take as an input an indicator variable of decline in frequency of eating sweets: which you may define a number of ways, such as an endorsement of "frequent" at 10y followed by "common" at any follow-up. take as an output variable the yes/no outcome of frequently eating vegetables--or perhaps the discordant case of more frequently eating vegetables than meat. Summarize the association with an odds ratio and 95% CI and you are done. To add to this, your path model is not correctly set up to identify change in candy as an exposure to predict eating at older life. You would define a latent variable like sweets growth as; sweets_g =~ 0 * candy_5y + 1 * candy_10y + 2 * candy_15y + 3 * candy_20y this should be pretty apparent if you read the lavaan documentation on growth modeling.
