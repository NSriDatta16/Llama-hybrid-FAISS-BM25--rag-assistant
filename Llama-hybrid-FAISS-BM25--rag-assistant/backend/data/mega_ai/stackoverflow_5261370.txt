Defining new XCode template tags on a per-project basis

It's well known that you can define the values for tags that are used in new file templates, as described at http://cocoadev.com/index.pl?ProjectBuilderTips . So a typical template looks like this: /* * main.m * «PROJECTNAME» * * Created by «FULLUSERNAME» on «DATE». * Copyright (c) «YEAR» «ORGANIZATIONNAME». All rights reserved. * */ Now, I know how to define new templates and have done so. However, I want my new template to use my own new tag in it like this: /* * «ATTRIBUTIONLINE» */ ... and I want that tag to be definable on a per XCode project basis. Is this possible? I've searched around and can only find the usual stuff about running something on the command line that defines a well-known tag for all projects.
