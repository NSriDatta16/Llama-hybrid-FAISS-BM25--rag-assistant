Kd-Trees , spatial data structure used (amongst others) in Real-Time Raytracing, has the downside that triangles that cross intersect the different spaces need to be clipped. Generally BVH's are faster because they are more lightweight. MX-CIF Quadtrees , store bounding boxes instead of arbitrary point sets by combining a regular quadtree with a binary tree on the edges of the quads. HAMT , hierarchical hash map with access times that generally exceed O(1) hash-maps due to the constants involved. Inverted Index , quite well known in the search-engine circles, because it's used for fast retrieval of documents associated with different search-terms. Most, if not all, of these are documented on the NIST Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures
