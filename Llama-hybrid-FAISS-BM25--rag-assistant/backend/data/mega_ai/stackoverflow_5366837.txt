The maintainers of Selenium, sort of answer this question here: http://www.viddler.com/explore/saucelabs/videos/27/ Look for timestamp 00:56:00 and 00:43:00 Basically, there will probably be IDE support for Selenium 2 eventually. But it isn't there yet and it's not clear what it will look like. You should probably be avoiding the IDE anyway. The tests that you record using the IDE tend to be fragile, unmaintainable and hard to read. Once you've learned the basics of Selenium, it's probably better to write your tests in a real programming language.
