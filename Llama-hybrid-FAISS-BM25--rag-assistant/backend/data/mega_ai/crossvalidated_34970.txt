Sparsity-inducing regularization for stochastic matrices

It is well-known (e.g. in the field of compressive sensing) that the $L_1$ norm is "sparsity-inducing," in the sense that if we minimize the functional (for fixed matrix $A$ and vector $\vec{b}$) $$f_{A,\vec{b}}(\vec{x})=\|A\vec{x}-\vec{b}\|_2^2+\lambda\|\vec{x}\|_1$$ for large enough $\lambda>0$, we're likely for many choices of $A$, $\vec{b}$, and $\lambda$ to have many exactly-zero entries in the resulting $\vec{x}$. But if we minimize $f_{A,\vec{b}}$ subject to the condition that the entries of $\vec{x}$ are positive and sum to $1$, then the $L_1$ term doesn't have any effect (because $\|\vec{x}\|_1=1$ by fiat). Is there an analogous $L_1$-type regularizer that works in this case to encourage that the resulting $\vec{x}$ is sparse?
