Statistical process control, z-scores in the equation of lower and upper control limit

The equation is UCL or LCL is: $$ \bar X \pm Z\times{\rm Standard\ deviation} $$ I read an article about the z-score on this webpage from investopedia. In one of the paragraphs it says: The Z-score, by contrast, is the number of standard deviations a given data point lies from the mean. To calculate Z-score, simply subtract the mean from each data point and divide the result by the standard deviation". Why do we need the Z (z-score) in this equation? Why don't you just remove the Z from this equation to make it more realistic? $$ \bar{x} \pm {\rm Standard\ deviation} $$ What is the function of $Z$?
