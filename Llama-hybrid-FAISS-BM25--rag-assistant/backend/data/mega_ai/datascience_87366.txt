Adding extra feature to word2vec embeddings for use in classification

I have a word2vec model that will transform my text into vectors, and I need to use them to classify the text. My data is essentially a timeseries of chat messages, so I think that the message frequency(Total messages / total time) holds a lot of information that should be used to classify. I was thinking of taking the chat stream, combining them all into a single string, and then averaging all the word's word2vec representations together. But I also want the classifier to be able to use the message frequency. Can I simply append the message frequency value onto the averaged word embedding vector?
