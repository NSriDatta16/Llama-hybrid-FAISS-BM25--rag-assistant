For RESTx , we allow the definition of 'positional parameters' in the URL. So, you could write something like: http://www.domain.com/somepath/myresource/1/aname But you always have the option to also just specify ordinary query parameters in the URL, like so: http://www.domain.com/somepath/myresource?firstid=1&secondid=aname Which option works best for you may depend on the sort of client applications you write. RESTx, for example, does not force you to use one or the other, you can use both of them at the same time. But consider this: Some web caches and other 'smart' web infrastructure elements have issues with parameters in the URL. They might ignore everything after the end of the path (such as query parameters) and therefore, your RESTful resource is not cached or otherwise treated correctly. This might not be an issue in smaller organizations, but if your RESTful resource is exposed on the Internet, this is something you might want to consider. I like to follow the principles that the URL path should identify the resource itself, while any parameters are only used to modify the output for this one request. Of course, if you always use the same query parameters then you might just as well allow them as positional parameters in your URL.
