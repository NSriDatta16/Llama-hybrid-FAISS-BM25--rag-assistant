Linear regression models aren't great for this because they can predict values beyond 1, which isn't very useful for binary classification. Probit or logit regression models would be more suitable because they return a value between 0 and 1. You would still need to come up with some sort of decision rule to perform the actual classification based on your regression output. You can probably achieve good results with a logistic regression + a decision rule, but there are a lot of classification techniques out there that were designed for this type of task. It all comes down to the nature of your data, but I think that you can do better than logistic regression with respect to computational cost, accuracy/precision/sensitivity/specificity, and your ability to correctly classify new data points.
