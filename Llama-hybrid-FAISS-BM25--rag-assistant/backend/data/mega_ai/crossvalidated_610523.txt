You can certainly invent any number of metrics to compare two proportions. Since you mention risk difference, risk ratio, and odds ratio, common comparisons of independent samples, most would assume you are speaking about two sample test of proportions. Other measures of association for binary endpoints include: number needed to treat : $NNT=1/(p_2âˆ’p_1)$ . Population attributable fraction roughly given as $n_1/(n_1+n_2) (RR-1) / (1+n_1/(n_1+n_2)(RR-1)$ In a two sample test, your metric $\theta = p_1/(p_1+p_2)$ could be interpreted as the probability that a randomly selected "case" belongs to group A, and so if $\theta > 0.5$ , there's an excess in group A. Not meaningful for case-control studies without weighting. As an estimator, $\theta$ is almost certainly guaranteed to underperform the MLE, that is logistic regression and inference on the log odds ratio which is the natural parameter of a binomial random variable. The lack of boundedness is what makes logistic regression so powerful. If the events are complementary as @whuber points out then, the test has a conditional intepretation and you can use conditional probability laws to identify their respective "estimators" and tests.
