iPhone drag/drop

Trying to get some basic drag/drop functionality happening for an iPhone application. My current code for trying to do this is as follows: - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self]; self.center = location; } This code has the result of a the touched UIView flickering while it follows the touch around. After playing around with it a bit, I also noticed that the UIView seemed to flicker from the 0,0 position on the screen to the currently touched location. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
