On top of @dipetkov's great and detailed answer, a (not so) small warning : these confidence intervals are accurate and true only for Normally Distributed (independent) random variables, and approximately true for n sufficiently large (but how approximate and how large?). if $\forall i, X_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ and independent then we have $$\frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n X_i = \overline{X_n} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n})$$ So indead if we know in advance the std $\sigma$ , a $1-\alpha$ CI of the mean estimation $\hat{\mu}$ is $\overline{x_n} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ . no limits here, and if you run simulations, fix an $n$ , the average nb of experiments that ends with $\mu \in CI(x_1, ... x_n)$ will tend to exactly $1-\alpha$ when the nb of experiments tend to $\infty$ . math here, no approximations. When you don't know in advance the std $\sigma$ of your normal distribution, you use the Student distribution, which is, by definition, a random variable $\mathcal{T}_m$ ( $m$ number of degrees of freedom) that has same law as a $ Z / \sqrt{U/m}$ when $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $U \sim \chi^2_m$ . Math tells us that $$\sqrt{n}\Big(\frac{\overline{X_n} - \mu}{S_n}\Big) \sim \mathcal{T}_{n-1}$$ Hence the $1-\alpha$ CI for the estimator of $\mu$ : $\overline{x_n} \pm t_{\alpha/2,n-1} \frac{s_n}{\sqrt{n}}$ . Again, this is true for all n, not just approximately true when n is large or anything Now the warning : when $X$ does not have a Normal Distribution, these CI on the mean estimation are wrong : the probability of the real $\mathbb{E}[X]$ (if it exists! see Cauchy distributions for an example without it) being inside the CI computed on a particular experiment of n samples is not $1-\alpha$ . Yes, the TCL says that when n tends to $\infty$ , the r.v. $\sqrt{n}\frac{\overline{X_n} - \mu}{\sigma}$ converges in distribution to $ \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ but we don't actually know starting from what $n$ this approximation will be "almost true" (or at least negligeable to have almost $1-\alpha$ experiments ending with $\mu \in CI$ . One usually says $n > 30$ as a rule of thumb, but be careful : try experiments for n = 100, $ X \sim \mathcal{B}(p)$ a Bernoulli distribution with variable $p$ between 0 and 1. see this article for detailed work, fun figure nÂ°3. Do reproduce it at home.
