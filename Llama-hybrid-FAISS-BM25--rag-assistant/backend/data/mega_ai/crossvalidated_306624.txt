A simple approach could be to cast the unit of observation as the edge, and the node as a covariate to be treated as a grouping factor. Your outcome would be the accuracy score. The model would thus be $$ \text{accuracy score}_{ij} = f(X_i, X_j) $$ where $i$ indexes outgoing node, $j$ the incoming node, and $X$ characteristics of that node. Perhaps you have other covariates, but at minimum you can calculate various sorts of centrality measures. The $f$ could be most anything, from a mixed effects regression to a random forest. Or, if you want to predict linkage based on an accuracy score, you could fit a model like $$ pr(\text{linkage})_{ij} = f(X_i, X_j) $$ with accuracy scores among the $X$'s. Fitted values of this model would create a probabilistic graph. More detailed suggestions are probably possible with more info on your data.
