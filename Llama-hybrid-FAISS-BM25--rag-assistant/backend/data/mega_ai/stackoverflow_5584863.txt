You could use MSMQ Triggers. See MSDN here . From the first paragraph: Message Queuing triggers allow you to associate the arrival of incoming messages at a destination queue with the functionality of one or more COM components or stand-alone executable programs. These triggers can be used to define business rules that can be invoked when a message arrives at the queue without doing any additional programming. Application developers no longer must write any infrastructure code to provide this kind of message-handling functionality.
