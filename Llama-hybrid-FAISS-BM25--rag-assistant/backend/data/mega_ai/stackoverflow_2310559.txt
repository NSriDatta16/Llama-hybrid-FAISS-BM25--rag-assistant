Best practice for the user authentication on JSF 2.0?

i search for the best way how i can make a user authentication in my JSF Webproject. I have found this very good Example from BalusC at stockoverflow (by the way Thank you BalusC). But i dont understand this System. I have written a registration page. After the registration the user is into my database. But who can i use the j_security_check to check the the user from my database? In my webproject i don't have a site for users and for non-users. When a user is loged in so he see more options for example he can post a text. Who can i check this? Can i save the User Class with the userdata at the login and check: if(user != null){ } But i think this way is not very elegant. Also my Question is what is the best way to make a user login and show the valid user more options on the webpage than a non-user. Thank you and sorry for my bad english.
