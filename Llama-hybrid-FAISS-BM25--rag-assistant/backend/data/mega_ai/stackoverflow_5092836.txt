One way would be to use TabPage to organize your controls into several pages, and show/hide only tabs that are in use. The benefit of this is that all of the pages are available to you in design time, but you might not want the user to see that he's on a tab control... If that's not what you're after, than organizing them inside a UserControl (as Danial Hilgarth suggested) is the way to go. Basically, you create a user control for each of the "page" that holds all of the controls and behaviors for that page. When you need to switch between them - just use the 'visible' property. The other way (if you really don't like user controls) would be to place everything on panels, but that would obscure you in design time...
