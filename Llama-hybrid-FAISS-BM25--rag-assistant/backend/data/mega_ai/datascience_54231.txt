Automating Logistic Regression

I have $3$ datasets I'd like to run a logistic regression on split into $X_1, y_1$ $X_2, y_2$ $X_3, y_3$ How can I run a loop so that I can run an automated logistic regression using the X_train, X_test split function from SkLearn and in doing so printing 3 separate accuracy results for each dataset? To run on one data set of X, y is as follows: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, shuffle=False) logreg = LogisticRegression() logreg.fit(X_train,y_train) y_pred = logreg.predict(X_test) print('Accuracy:',metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
