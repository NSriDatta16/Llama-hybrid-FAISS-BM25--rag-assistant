Apache Camel does everything an ESB does - but allows you to start simply by embedding it in your application code. Its very simple to use - as it uses a DSL to define routes. If at a later point you want to run it in an managed container - you have a number of options - run it embedded in Apache ServiceMix, or Apache ActiveMQ - or standalone - on top of Apache Felix Karaf (OSGI Container).
