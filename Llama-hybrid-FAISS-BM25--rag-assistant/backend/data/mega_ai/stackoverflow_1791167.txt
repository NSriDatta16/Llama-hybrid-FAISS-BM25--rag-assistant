I think I understand the problem better now... If a is the data read from your file (of size N-by-27 , where N is ideally 43,200), then I think you would want to do the following: nRemove = rem(size(a,1),300); %# Find the number of points to remove a = a(1:end-nRemove,:); %# Trim points to make an even multiple of 300 Avg = mean(reshape(a,300,[],27)); AvgF = squeeze(Avg); This will remove points such that the number of rows in a will be a multiple of 300. Then your reshape and average should work. Note that I use [] in the call to RESHAPE , which lets it figure out what the number of column should be.
