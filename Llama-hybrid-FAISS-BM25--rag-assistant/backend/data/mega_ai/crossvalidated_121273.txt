Machine Learning and Biostatistics

I am interested in a few areas with biostatistics, and was reading the course catalog at a university that offers machine learning. I am taking topology now, and i think machine learning uses topology (not sure), but is machine learning very useful with cancer analytics? if so, is what fields of math does it require to study machine learning? does it only require probability theory? For me right now I am going into graduate studies in biostats, and am interested in learning Markov modeling, regression modeling, and linear algebra. I think linear algebra is very very useful for doing multivariable analytics and large data sets...etc. my concern is that I can not master everything! It would be too difficult to master linear algebra, machine learning.... statistical regression etc... So I just am inquiring about input regarding machine learning, and how to prepare for it, if and only if, it is highly regarded ... thank you AC
