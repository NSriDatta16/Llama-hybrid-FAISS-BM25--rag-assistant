I don't think this question is at all trivial. To answer, I'll first discuss a couple things to consider and then offer a partial solution based on your post that may help. Also, do check out @Ryan Volpi's linked posts, they are probably quite relevant to your question. Couple considerations What does 'best' mean in your context, and more generally how do you evaluate performance? Is it simply based on highest contribution to your team's score? Or is it based on whether your team wins, and the score does not matter except as it factors into winning? Or is your performance a combination of your team's score relative to the other team's score? From your writing, it seems like you care about score for your own team, which I'll revisit soon. How are you going to think about modeling this as a statistical process? First, do you care about estimating performance in the sample of games you observe, or are you interested more generally in determining the true value of everyone. This difference matters: in the simplest case, if I just observe you once, and you do really well, it means you did really well in that one game, but maybe you just got really lucky that one game and you're actually not a good performer. Second, how do you think about teamwork? Can some people work better together? Maybe John and Joe are a power team, but John hates playing with Robert. And how do the other team's player affect your team's score? How are you going to model that, and how will it further affect the error terms.. maybe they are now correlated depending on the players. A partial (potential) solution From your writing, it seems like you care about best in terms of the highest score, and seem to not care about relative score or winning, and it also seems like you don't want to factor the effect someone has on maybe lowering the other team's score. In that case, you don't really care at all about the games, and you can actually just consider a vector of scores and team members (so each game is really two observations: home score and the 2 home players, and away score and the 2 away players... since we assume they dont affect each others' scores, we can just consider them independently, somewhat like every team is just doing their own thing. This kind of approach to modeling individual performances is a simple version of modeling that is relatively common in some empirical research, and can be extended to model some of these factors I assumed away, but I will present this basic model to introduce concepts. As mentioned in the comments, it may hold in games like darts or bowling where teammates and opponents have little to no effect on each other. Since we care about individual score, let's assume we are interested in their mean performance. Every player $i$ has some mean score performance $s_i$ that we want to know. Let's suppose that for every team/game $j$ (recall that games are really two team/game observations from our assumptions), their performance may be different from this performance due to random noise $\epsilon_{ij}$ where $\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0,\sigma_i^2)$ (in your example, scores are discrete, so you may want to model it somewhat differently, but the same ideas will hold). Then, since we assumed away teamwork and other team's member's effects, $i$ 's contribution to game $j$ is $s_i + \epsilon_{ij}$ , and every $j$ team/game's observed score $s_j$ is $$s_j = \sum_{i\in K_j} (s_i + \epsilon_{ij}) = \sum_{i\in K_j} s_i + \sum_{i\in K_j} \epsilon_{ij}$$ where $K_j$ is the set of $i$ individuals in team/game $j$ . Since each $\epsilon_{ij}$ is independent of each other and normal, we have that $$\sum_{i\in K_j} \epsilon_{ij} \equiv \epsilon_j \sim N\bigg(0,\sum_{i\in K_j} \sigma_{i}^2\bigg)$$ Additionally, instead of summing only over those in $K_j$ for team/game $j$ j, we can define an indicator variable $W_{ij} = \mathbb{1}[i \in K_j]$ that denotes if the player $i$ was in that team/game $j$ . Then we can re-write the previous equation as $$s_j = \sum_{i\in K_j} (s_i + \epsilon_{ij}) = \sum_{i\in K_j} s_i + \sum_{i\in K_j} \epsilon_{ij} = \sum_i s_iW_{ij} + \epsilon_j$$ and from here, it's clear that $s_i$ for each individual corresponds to the beta coefficients of a linear regression of $s_j$ on the full vector of indicators ${W_{ij}}_{i}, so running the regression $$S_j = \sum_i \beta_i W_{ij}$$ on all your data will identify $\beta_i = s_i$ for each $i$ . The estimated performance rankings can then be determined by ordering each $\hat{\beta}_i$ , and you can also test for significant differences between them and other tests. Here is a simple example using R n = 100000 x1 = 5 x2 = 2 x3 = 8 x1_err = .1 x2_err = .5 x3_err = 1 dt = data.table("x1" = rep(x1,n), "x2" = rep(x2,n), "x3" = rep(x3,n), "x1_err" = rep(x1,n), "x2_err" = rep(x2,n), "x3_err" = rep(x3,n)) dt[,n := 1:.N] dt[, ':=' (x1_ind = ifelse(n 60000,1,0), x3_ind = ifelse(n>= 30000,1,0))] dt[, score := x1*x1_ind + x2*x2_ind + x3*x3_ind + rnorm(n,mean = 0, sd = x1_err*x1_ind + x2_err*x2_ind + x3_err*x3_ind)] #Note that I am omitted the y intercept since I know I fix it at 0 lm(score ~ -1 + x1_ind + x2_ind + x3_ind,data = dt) Call: lm(formula = score ~ -1 + x1_ind + x2_ind + x3_ind, data = dt) Coefficients: x1_ind x2_ind x3_ind 5.054 1.929 7.964 As you can see, in each game, I had two individuals perform together, and the coefficient estimates for each indicator is very close to their true mean performance! You can extend this toy model in many ways, but it's up to you how you want to explore your data. The assumption that individual performances follow normal means is relatively common in a lot of research (for example, value added models in the context of teachers' effects on student test scores, use this same idea), and you can introduce correlation between players and other factors such as the effect of the other team. One way could be to think that individuals are defined by their own team performance and also have a negative effect on the other team's performance, and so you want to jointly estimate those. And what does performance mean here? Well again, up to you, but maybe some weighted combination of offense and defense. But that will introduce other complications, since not everyone may benefits from the 'best' player: if a player is really good at offense but awful at defense, maybe you don't want him with someone who is similarly skilled.
