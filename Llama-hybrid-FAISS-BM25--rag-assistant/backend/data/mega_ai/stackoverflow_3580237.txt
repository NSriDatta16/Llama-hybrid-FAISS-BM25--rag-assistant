Best way to fill DataGridView with large amount of data

I have a windows form that has two DataGridViews (DGVs) that will hold 25,000+ records and 21 columns each. I have successfully loaded each with the data from the DB using a DataAdapter and then I tried simply filling the DGVs using for loops. Each method took roughly the same amount of time. The first time the data is filled into the DGVs it takes too long (7+ mins), and then the subsequent times the time is much more reasonable (~30 secs). So my question is, what is the best way to load a DGV with a large amount of data that will take on average
