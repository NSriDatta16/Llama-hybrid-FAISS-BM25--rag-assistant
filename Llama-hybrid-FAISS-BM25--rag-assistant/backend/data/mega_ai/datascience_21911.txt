Step-by-step construction of an RBF neural network

I have started to look at Radial-Basis-Function Neural Networks (RBF-NN), and would like to solve the following task as an exercise: Given is the data in the image below. Each output $Y_j$ of the network is defined as: $(*)$ $Y_j = \sum_{i}^N w_{ij}* exp(-\frac{||x-\mu_i||^2}{2\sigma_i^2})$ for the -ith neuron. The task is to draw an RBF network that perfectly classifies the data, with suitable means, covariances and weights. In a second step a point has to be taken and classified in the worked-out model. My ideas We have two nodes in the input layer, one for each dimension. The hidden-layer has as many neurons as there are training samples. Each of these calculates the activation given by the exponential above. The output layer has three output nodes as there are three classes. I would determine $\Sigma$ and $\mu$ as follows: For each class and training-sample $x_i$ of this class, $\mu_j$ is just the centroid of the training samples, $\sigma = \frac{1}{m}\sum_i ||x_i-\mu||$, and $\Sigma = \sigma*I_d$. Questions That does not seem to be correct however - if I have the same $\Sigma$ and $\mu$ for all the hidden nodes of the same class, each new test-input would result in the same activation for all these nodes..so what exactly are the particular $u_i$ and $\sigma_i$? Also, for perfect classification, I would set all the weights which belong to the correct class to 1, and all the others to zero - would that make sense?
