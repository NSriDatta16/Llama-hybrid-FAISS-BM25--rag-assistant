Creating a unique, auto assigned variable with Microsofts Extensible Storage Engine

I'm using Extensible Storage Engine and want a unique column (32bits wide). I need the values in this column to be auto assigned by the database I'm hoping to find something like JET_bitIndexUnique that I can mask in? if there isnt such a mask whats the proper way to achieve the goal?
