NHibernate Session gets disposed off on each wcf service method call

I am using Wcf in Sharp Architecture. I have configured my project following northwind sample using WcfSessionStorage etc. I have a method in the wcf service that gets a list of business object using Repository<>.GetAll(). I am testing the service method using WcfTestClient. When the method is called the very first time, everything works fine. However on the subsequent call, I get the following exception on the Repository<>.GetAll() method [System.ObjectDisposedException] Session is closed! Object name: 'ISession' It seems like the NHibernate session gets disposed after each call. I have got around this problem by decorating my service with the following attribute [ServiceBehavior( InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.PerCall )] public class WcfService : IWcfService { } However this means, an instance of the service will be created on each call that in turn will create a new nhibernate session etc. In my scenario there is no need of creating a new service instance per call and I think its an expensive process and not the right solution. I would like to know what is the best practice in my scenario and how to get this thing work with creating a new service instace per call. Thanks Nabeel
