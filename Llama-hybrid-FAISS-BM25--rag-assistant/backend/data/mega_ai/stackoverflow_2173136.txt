Is this the best way to dynamically load a UIViewController object based on item selection?

My root view contains three sections in a table view. Depending on which section is selected a corresponding view controller will be popped onto the view stack. The following didSelectRowAtIndexPath method is from my code and it works as I expect, but I was wondering if this is the correct/most elegant way to do it. I'm an Objective-C newcomer so I'm not sure if I should be intitializing the viewController to nil first. - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { UIViewController *viewController = nil; if (indexPath.section == 0) { viewController = [[FirstViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"FirstViewController" bundle:nil]; } else if (indexPath.section == 1) { viewController = [[SecondViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"SecondViewController" bundle:nil]; } else if (indexPath.section == 2) { viewController = [[ThirdViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"ThirdViewController" bundle:nil]; } [self.navigationController pushViewController:viewController animated:YES]; [viewController release]; }
