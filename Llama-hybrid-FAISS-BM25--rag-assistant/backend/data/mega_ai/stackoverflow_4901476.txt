What is statistically significant latency variation?

Consider the case where I have four identical routers, A, B, C, and D, running busybox and ptpd. A and B are connected by cable 1; C and D are connected by cable 2. I have a small C program on routers A and C that sends a very small packet over UDP to the opposite router, and I use pcap to detect the times that the packet was sent, and the times it arrived at the other end, and calculate the average and deviation for a thousand of these tests. How do I tell if these cables are different? Obviously if one is 500μs and the other is 10ms, they're different. But what if the results for one have average 200μs with standard deviation 8, and the results for the other have average 210μs and standard deviation 10. How probable is it that they are different? What calculations should I do to test this? And, on a more technical note, what is the expected variability in latency? I understand any intermediate switches, hubs, routers etc will add to the latency and the variability of it, but if they are directly connected by a single cable, what is a normal variance? Edit: Just to clarify a point - this isn't just a statistics question. I can use a t-test to determine probability of difference (thanks), but I'd also like to know how much variance can normally be attributed to different qualities in the network equipment. For example, if the average of the two means are 208.4 and 208.5, I would suspect that whatever the t-test might say, the cables are the same and the difference comes from the test machines. Or am I wrong? Do cables often vary by small amounts? I don't know - What's a normal variance between latencies? What test do I need to distinguish between a difference in the cables, and the equipment? (I can't switch the cables)
