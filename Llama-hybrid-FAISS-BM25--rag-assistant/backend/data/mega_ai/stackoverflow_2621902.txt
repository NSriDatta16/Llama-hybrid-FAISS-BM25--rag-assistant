I don't know how fresh this question is... but the model I would like to see is CPAN. I also don't know Rubygems but it sounds similar to CPAN. CPAN is a perl archive + library management system. When I need to write a perl program that requires... FTP or SOAP or JSON or XML or ZIP, or...etc, I can run the CPAN package manager, select the requisite package for download, view and verify the dependencies, then install everything. CPAN is mirrored .."everywhere". CPAN works wonderfully for my purposes, and something similar for emacs would be nice to have. It also supports building C/C++ code on demand. That's what I would like to see in emacs. Some further comment on requirements. explicit download of packages. No auto install. No invisible downloads. I want to ask for new libraries or new function. I should be able to list the name/version/timestamp of installed packages. If my friend gives me his list, I should be able to diff his emacs state against mine. check-for-updates function. What updates are available? What do they fix? depedency checking, verification, and download. If I install csharp-mode and it requires v5.0.28 of cc-mode, then it should confirm with me, that I must also download cc-mode. there should be some sort of community ranking of these packages, like ranking torrents on isohunt. I want to see if a package has 3 upvotes or 3000. "transactional" behavior. If an install goes boom, it must unwind to a last-known-good state. failsafes. If I've put custom mods in linum.el, it should refuse to install a new version over my changes, unless I explicitly allow it. It should warn me before even starting. Do this with checksums/md5's over the existing install. have the option of running some packages from compressed archives, like zip files. So I never have any doubt that I have not updated any of the embbedded elisp. ability to use mirrored hosts for package distribution. all this function should be accessible through M-x library-manageemnt or something. Finally, it would be nice to have a way to segregate or organize libraries of functions. Hierarchical namespaces. Emacs' flat namespace is very dated. This is sort of independent but complementary to the core function of package management. I'm not a lisp guru so I don't know how hard this would be; maybe there is already a way to do it.
