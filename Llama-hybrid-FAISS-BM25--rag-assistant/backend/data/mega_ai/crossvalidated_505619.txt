RNN vs ResNet for multivariate time series prediction

All others being equal, would a ResNet-based or RNN-based neural network (with/without an attention mechanism) perform better for forecasting a multivariate time series? Related: Deep learning for time series classification: a review explains that a ResNet performs rather well on multivariate timeseries classification (and I assume thus also on forcasting). Yet a comparrison with a RNN based network is missing. Forecasting Multivariate Time Series Data Using Neural Networks (link downloads a .pdf) seems to conclude that a Convolutional Neural Network outperforms a LSTM-based network for time series forecasting. CNN vs RNN for time series classification asks the same question about RNN vs CNN (altough for classification, not for forecasting), yet no conclusive answer is given. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation for Multiple Short Time Series Forecasting with Recurrent Neural Networks describes a LSTM with skip connections (so basically a RNN/ResNet hybrid) which also seems to perform well.
