Can someone help me to understand if i am using this in correct way? Oh, that's easy. No, you're not using it correctly. First off, you're using a rather small data set. Trying to tease out statistical behavior from this size set is certainly possible, but the confidence bounds are (ahem) rather large. For small data sets, deviations from the expected distributions are par for the course, and the smaller the set the greater the problem. Remember, "The Law of Averages not only permits the most outrageous coincidences, it requires them." Worse, the particular data set you're using simply doesn't look much like a normal distribution. Think about it - with a mean of .498 you've got two samples below 0.1, and three more at .748 or above. Then you've got a cluster of 3 points between .17 and .22. Looking at this particular data set and arguing that it must be normal distribution is a pretty good case of Procrustean argument. Does that look like a bell curve to you? It's perfectly possible that the larger population does follow a normal, or modified normal, distribution, and a larger sample size would address the issue, but I wouldn't bet on it, particularly without knowing more about the population. I say modified normal, since as Kevin Li has pointed out, technically a normal distribution includes all real numbers. As was also pointed out in comments to his answer, this does not prevent applying such a distribution over a limited range and getting useful results. As the saying goes, "All models are wrong. Some are useful." But this particular data set simply doesn't look like inferring a normal distribution (even over a limited range) is a particularly good idea. If your 10 data points looked like .275,.325,.375,.425,.475,.525,.575,.625,.675,.725 (mean of 0.500), would you assume a normal distribution?
