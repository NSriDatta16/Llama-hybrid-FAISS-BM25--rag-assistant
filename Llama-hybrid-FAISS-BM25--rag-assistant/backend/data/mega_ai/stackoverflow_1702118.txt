I usually organize such code in a file structure that looks (in a simple case) like this: apps app1 app1module1 app2module2 app1tests app2 app2module1 app2tests components comp1 comp1module1 comp1module2 comp1tests common_test_stuff There is no single right way to do this, but this seems to be a common practice that keeps production and test code separate and attempts to remove the out-of-sight, out-of-mind problem (mentioned by zac) at the same time.
