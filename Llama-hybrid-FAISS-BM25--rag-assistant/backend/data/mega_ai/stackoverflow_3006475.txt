Using Java server-side with PHP-generated front-end

Does anyone have a real-world experience in building such a project? I'd like to move away questions about "is it good idea or not", but focus on possible solutions. I see one simple way - HTTP GET/POST + xml/json - and one more elegant - AJAX/DWR. As for the first one - I understand that it is possible, but needs quite a lot coding. As for second way - is it possible to use Java DWR engine with PHP front-end? Is DWR language-independent for client side (as it uses just JavaScript)? Would it be a problem, that client page was generated by one web server (for example, apache+php) and served on server-side by another (for example, tomcat)? I suspect, that Tomcat will complain about sessions. Can this problem be fixed with allowing cross-domain AJAX? Thank you in advance. Denis.
