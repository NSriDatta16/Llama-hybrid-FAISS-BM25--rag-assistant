Cookies in UIWebView

I have a UIWebView, and I don't want it to store an cookies, so just before the webview is loaded I do: NSArray* cookies = [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] cookies]; for (NSHTTPCookie *cookie in cookies) { [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] deleteCookie:cookie]; } Checking the count of cookies is 0 so they are all deleted. But when I go to stackoverflow it still recognizes my Google Account and logs me in. How does this happen? I though it worked with cookies?
