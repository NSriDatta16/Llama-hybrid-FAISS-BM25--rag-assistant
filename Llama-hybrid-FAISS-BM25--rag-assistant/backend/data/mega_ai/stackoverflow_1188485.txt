getting into sentiment analysis

I've got a requirement of determining whether the entered sentence is positive or negative.... First I thought it is something to do with Social Network analysis and later I realised that it is Sentiment analysis. My first question is what is the difference between these two? I think SNA itself uses SA... plz correct me if i am wrong... Regarding this I got a very good discussion by Alexander @ NLP: Qualitatively "positive" vs "negative" sentence ... I want to get into this field with the power of open source and preferably with Java (but I am open to others too). Can anyone pls guide me on how to get started and move ahead Thanks in advance Siva
