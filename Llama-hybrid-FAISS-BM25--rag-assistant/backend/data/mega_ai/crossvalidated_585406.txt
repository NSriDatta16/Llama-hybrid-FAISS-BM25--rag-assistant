Independence-violation issue in pairwise measurements: Which test?

Here is another problem in which independence might be an issue (however, the question might be very basic). Suppose, I have a rowing team and I have two boats (B1 and B2, for brevity). I have strong reason to believe that the team performs better with B1 than B2, so I want to compute a significance test. This is would be the design: First, there is a (balanced) measurement of the team's performance over the course of a two days, i.e. either B1 on day 1 and B2 on day 2, or B1 on day 2 and B2 on day 1 (there is sufficient time for the team to recover between the two measurements). Then, there is a period of training. Subsequently, the measurements are repeated. With this procedure, I obtain two "time series" with race times; one for B1 and one for B2, over time. Is it permissible to compute a simple dependent measures t-test? Normally, a repeated measures ANOVA would be the method of choice, but since for each time point, there is only one data point, it is not feasible. However, the pairwise t-test assumes samples to be statistically independent which they are not, given that they originate from the same athletes and each measurement captures a cumulative amount of training. Conversely, it could be argued the measurement pairs are somewhat independent, because e.g. fatigue from one measurement does not influence the next one, etc. Alternatively, it might be possible/permissible to compute a permutation test, i.e. in which I keep the time points constant, however, I switch 50% of the (B1 and B2) labels randomly. As a measure, I take something simple like the sum of the element-wise difference between my B1- and B2-curve. Here, independence might not be such a great problem, as I only take into account pairwise differences, and I carry whatever dependence they may have over the time of measurements into every random sample I generate. Therefore, my p-value should be somewhat valid, shouldn't it? If so: How can I compute a (reliable) effect size, based on this test? Thank you for taking the time to read. Best wishes
