This is one of the points of time series analysis . The third edition of "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, freely available on-line , is a superb introduction to practical analysis of time series. Chapters 5 and 10 are perhaps most directly related to your question, showing how to generate plots showing prediction intervals into the future based on your model of the time series. This page , a bit old now, has many other suggestions for study.
