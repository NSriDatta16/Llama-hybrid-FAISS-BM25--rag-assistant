Why do you want to transcode it on-the-fly? Do you think you will be able to transcode it quickly enough? Think about a movie in a HD format... Also, there are different protocols of requesting the stream, meaning that some protocol could request the middle or the end chunks of data. If I were you, I would save the video file in different formats and serve to the user the appropriate one. I don't think storage space should be a constraint for a video serving platform.
