XmR charts for several measures at the same day/month

Xmr charts are often used in statistical process control (see for example ). They make sense, but I wonder what one does, if one has several measure per day/month etc. Should one just use the average (e.g. arithmetic mean)? This code taken from here simulates 12 measurements, one for each month: library(ggplot2) library(ggQC) set.seed(5555) Golden_Egg_df
