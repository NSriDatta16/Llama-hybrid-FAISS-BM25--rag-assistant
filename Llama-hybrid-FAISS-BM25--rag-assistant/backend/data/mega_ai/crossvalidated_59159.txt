Measuring spatial overlap in 2 different ways - paired t-test?

I have collected spatial data (GPS points and foraging heights) for a bunch of territorial animals. Until recently, these types of data were only analyzed in two dimensions (2D). However, 3D analysis is now available and I'm working on a paper that compares 2D and 3D estimates of spatial overlap. I define spatial overlap as being simply the area (2D) or volume (3D) of space overlapped divided by the total area or volume of the territory. This produces a proportion which I convert into a percentage. So basically for every bird I have a 2D percent overlap and a 3D percent overlap. I would like to compare these two different measures to see if one overestimates overlap compared to the other. It seems to make sense to me to use a paired t-test or the non-parametric equivalent (Paired-Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) as opposed to a normal t-test or Mann-Whitney U. Anybody have thoughts?
