Lazy Learning given Submission Files in Competitions

In machine learning settings where you get the "real data" beforehand ( e.g. a submission file in competitions like Kaggle ), models can be "build around the data" that actually has to be predicted. Isn't this a huge advantage in applied lazy learning? - The drawback of having computational time during classification and not training does not matter . Still, I've only seen algorithms like knn at best being part of ensembles ( for some diversity, not primarily because of performance in itself ).
