Language modelling for Spell Checker

I am working on spell checkers, I want to create a spell checker, I am confused about which model to use Word-Level modelling Character-Level modelling plus I am preferring neural networks over Peter Norvig or N-gram/K-gram or any other "Vanilla" algorithm so that networks capture context Example: Input: I have aplied fo r credit cart Output: I have applied for credit card I have gone through models which use character level BLSTM with noise makers/error models and attention mechanism but not satisfied by result. https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-a-spell-checker-with-tensorflow-d35b23939f60 One of the article I have gone through is to use OpenNMT, but results were disastrous. https://medium.com/scribd-data-science-engineering/neural-spelling-corrections-and-the-importance-of-accuracy-977c0063d20f
