Categorical Data Analysis or ML methods?

What is the difference between classical categorical data analysis (as taught by e.g. Agresti's book Categorical Data Analysis) and the classification-related methods from ML (as taught by e.g. The Elements of Statistical Learning: SVM, Bayesian classifiers, etc )? Based on what little I know, they both seem to deal with statistical regression-like problems where $Y$ is categorical, so what are the differences in the methods taught and their applications? Somebody told me that the ML-approach is the modern approach that everybody is using these days, and the Agresti-book is outdated, theoretical stuff that I shouldn't bother with. Is this correct?
