UI Editor for .NET application

I need .NET UI control that acts as a designer/editor window similar to what you see in some of these applications: - Visual Studio - Visio - Balsamiq - Windows Workflow - Photoshop I hope to use WPF, but will settle for WinForms. I need to create custom widgets that I can drag, drop, and edit in the designer/editor window. I am open to building or buying. After looking at the common third-party .NET tool providers I cannot find anything. Ideas?
