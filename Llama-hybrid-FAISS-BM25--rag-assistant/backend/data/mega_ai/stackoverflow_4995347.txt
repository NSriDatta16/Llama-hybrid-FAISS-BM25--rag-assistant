As Darin mentioned, local storage may be an option but cookies are more widely supported and the fallback mechanism would certainly work. However, depending on what you need to store, you probably don't want to be storing any sensitive information in a cookie or any sort of complex data, so data in the cookie would not scale if you begin adding additional pieces of data you need to track. I generally only use cookies for keying off something I need to query for from the db or a server-side cache. If you using an ORM, such as NHibernate, explicit caching within the application is probably not something you would need to greatly concern yourself with as the data would be cached by the ORM's caching provider (local or distributed options available). Since this is user-specific, another option is to store this information in the session state server-side when the user authenticates (which can optionally use a cookie).
