Building a suitable mixed effects logistic regression model taking into account gender (R)

I'm new to regression analysis but I'm currently building a mixed effects logistic regression model having Pitch as the dependent variable and DurationZ , PitchMax , IntenMax , Gender as fixed effects and Subject (person) as a random effect. Pitch is a binary yes / no and other variables are either numeric or factors . I have a few versions of the model and I don't know which one of them will be the most accurate one. And how should I treat Gender if I know that it has an effect on other independent parameters ( PitchMax*Gender or (1+PitchMax|Gender) ?: library(lme4) testModel1 Or testModel2 Or testModel3 Or testModel4 str(TotalOutlScaled5) 'data.frame': 66917 obs. of 6 variables: $ Pitch : Factor w/ 2 levels "no","yes": 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 ... $ DurationZ : num 0.516 0.356 0.351 0.268 0.26 ... $ PitchMax : num 0.2638 0.3348 0.2603 0.1732 0.0703 ... $ IntenMax : num 0.74 0.734 0.718 0.626 0.647 ... $ Gender : Factor w/ 2 levels "F","M": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ Subject : Factor w/ 8 levels "A","B","C","D",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
