Configuration Log4j: ConsoleAppender to System.err?

I saw that one of our tools uses a ConsoleAppender to System.err next to System.out in it's log4j configuration. Fragments of the configuration: .... In Eclipse this results in double messages to the console, so I believe that is of no use, right? On the Linux server I see only one message to the PuTTY console, so where would that System.err message go to?
