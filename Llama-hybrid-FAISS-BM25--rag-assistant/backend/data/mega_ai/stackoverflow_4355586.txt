Algorithm to find out if a website is a blog?

This is a creative one :-) I'll be receiving a list of hundreds of new URLs regularly and want to find out if they are linking to a blog or not - between 80% and 95% accuracy would be sufficient. Obviously I need to analyze the HTML of the page - but how exactly would you approach this (e.g. meta tags, structural analysis, pattern matching, machine learning ...)?
