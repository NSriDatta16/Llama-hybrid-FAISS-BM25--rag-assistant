I think you're kind of making the assumption that our idea of how neural networks work is a good model for the brain at a large-scale level; I'm not sure that is a good assumption. Hell, not too many years ago we didn't think the glial cells were important to mental functions, and it was the idea for a long time that there is no neurogenesis after the brain matures. On the other hand, neural networks do seem to handle some apparently complex functions pretty well. So, here's a little puzzle question for you: how many teraflops or petaflops do you think a human brain's computation represents?
