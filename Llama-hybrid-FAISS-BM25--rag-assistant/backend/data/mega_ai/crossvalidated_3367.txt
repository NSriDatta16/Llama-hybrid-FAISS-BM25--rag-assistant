Gilles Celeux also worked on the problem of label switching, e.g. G. Celeux, Bayesian inference for Mixture: the label switching problem. Proceedings Compstat 98 , pp. 227-232, Physica-Verlag (1998). As a complement to @darrenjw's fine answer, here are two online papers that reviewed alternative strategies: Jasra et al., Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods and the Label Switching Problem in Bayesian Mixture Modelling Sperrin et al., Probabilistic relabelling strategies for the label switching problem in Bayesian mixture models
