Hover over any paragraph, append div with little message, hover off, it fades out, is this right?

http://jsfiddle.net/nicktheandroid/3AraQ/ When a P is hovered over, #both is appended to that paragraph and centered. When i hover off and then onto a new paragraph, it fades out on the first P and fades in on the now hovered P. is this the best way to do it? Later on i'll use this to allow people to click a bookmark image, then when they hover a P it will do what my code below does, then when they click on that P it will create a bookmark to that paragraph, but I really just need help with the code below. THANKS! $('p').hover(function() { $(this).append(' BOOKMARK THIS ') $('#both').animate({opacity: 1.0}) }, function(){ $('#both').fadeOut(600, function(){ $(this).remove() }) }); it's not working smoothly, it's just not right....
