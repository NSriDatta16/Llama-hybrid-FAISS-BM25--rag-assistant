A better way of representing File Attachment into a list(c#3.0)

I have written List lstAttachment = new List (); //Check if any error file is present in which case it needs to be send if (new FileInfo(Path.Combine(errorFolder, errorFileName)).Exists) { Attachment unprocessedFile = new Attachment(Path.Combine(errorFolder, errorFileName)); lstAttachment.Add(unprocessedFile); } //Check if any processed file is present in which case it needs to be send if (new FileInfo(Path.Combine(outputFolder, outputFileName)).Exists) { Attachment processedFile = new Attachment(Path.Combine(outputFolder, outputFileName)); lstAttachment.Add(processedFile); } Working fine and is giving the expected output. Basically I am attaching the file to the list based on whether the file is present or not. I am looking for any other elegant solution than the one I have written. Reason : Want to learn differnt ways of representing the same program. I am using C#3.0 Thanks.
