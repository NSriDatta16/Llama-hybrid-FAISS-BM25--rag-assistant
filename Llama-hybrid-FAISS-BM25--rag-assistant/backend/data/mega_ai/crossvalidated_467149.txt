Testing for homoscedasticity using the Breusch Pagan Test

I am trying to figure out how to test for homoscedasticity. But run into a small issue. I am using this r-bloggers article as a learning resource. According to this article there is no homoscedasticity in a certain model. That is expressed in the image below. According to the article this is due to the red lines (in both left plots) not being straight lines. It then continues on how to perform the Breusch Pagan Test. From what I read this tests whether or not there is homoscedasticity. The result from the test are shown in the following code fragment: lmtest::bptest(lmMod) # Breusch-Pagan test studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: lmMod BP = 3.2149, df = 1, p-value = 0.07297 What I see is a p-value of 0.07297 which would confirm the presence of homoscedasticity as it is greather than 0.05. Am I understanding this wrong?
