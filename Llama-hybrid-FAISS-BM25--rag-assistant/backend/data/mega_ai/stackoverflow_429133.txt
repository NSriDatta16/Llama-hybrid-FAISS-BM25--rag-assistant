I'm an fMRI researcher at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati, and for years radiology researchers here have used IDL to develop an image processing package (called CCHIPS). It is a very well developed package, and has had quite a few people expanding its utility over the years. Even though I'm pretty much a hardcore MATLAB user, and therefore have a tendency to lean towards packages like SPM for fMRI image processing, I still end up using CCHIPS and writing/editing a few IDL scripts quite often. It's not as "comfortable" to me as MATLAB (we all have out favorite "blankies", after all!), but it's fairly easy to learn. I guess my point is this... If a programming resource works well, is well established, is used well by many, AND (most importantly!) there are still people within your organization willing to maintain/debug/modify/expand the resource, then there's no need to take an alarmist stance that changing to something new must be done immediately. If there were no one at all at your institution willing to maintain a resource any more, that may be cause for urgent concern. Otherwise, I would suggest getting a little more familiar with what you don't like, then applying gentle pressure to introduce what you feel is a better option, backing it up with clear reasons for change.
