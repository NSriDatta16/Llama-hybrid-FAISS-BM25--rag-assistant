I think that you can solve this pretty easily using some simple methods which are commonly used in survival or time-to-event analysis. For each kit that we have not received, we know that a duration $d$ has elapsed, and we want to know the probability that the total duration will be between $d$ and $T=d + k$ for some $k>0$ . In other words, we've waited $d$ days to receive it so far, and we want to know the probability that we will have to wait $d+1, d+2, d + 3.17, \dots, d + 59.9, d+60$ days. We can do this if we can estimate the probability distribution of $t$ the total time elapsed between sending the kit out and when the kit is returned. For simplicity, we can assume this is an absolutely continuous random variable. From probability theory we know that $$p=\mathbb P(t d) = \frac{F(T)-F(d)}{1 - F(d)} $$ for $F$ the CDF. So we just need to estimate a suitable distribution $F,$ whence we can compute the probability of receiving each kit on each day between $k=1$ and $k=60$ given the $d$ that we know for each kit. So you need to estimate $F$ . If you wish to use a parametric distribution, my recommendation for $F$ is to choose a distribution that has support only for positive values (because you're measuring duration). Some suggestions: Exponential Gamma Weibull Of course, there are lots of other parametric options. You could also use a non-parametric estimate of $F$ , such as the ECDF; see empirical-cumulative-distr-fn . You'll have to decide what to do about the censoring that is present in your data. The simplest option is to estimate $F$ using only the returned kits. This might work well enough if the number of non-returned kits is very small. However, the simplest option will bias the estimates to be smaller than if you had complete data; estimating the distribution in a way that accounts for the censoring effect for non-returned kits seems more prudent. You can find a worked example in A. Clifford Cohen (1965) " Maximum Likelihood Estimation in the Weibull Distribution Based On Complete and On Censored Samples ", Technometrics , 7:4, 579-588, DOI: 10.1080/00401706.1965.10490300 I would not expect the data about states to change any aspect about this -- my assumption is that all states would have essentially the same distribution $F$ . If you find that is not the case, then the simplest thing is to build 50 models, one for each state. While this is simple, these models might wildly differ, especially for the states where data are scarce. A hierarchical-bayesian model might ameliorate that. After we have $F$ , then estimating the number of kits we receive each day is trivial. If we assume that all kits are independent, then the expected number of kits received on a given day is the sum of the probabilities of receiving the kits (each kit $i$ is a Bernoulli trial with probability $p_i$ ). The easiest way to get an interval estimate is to do a Monte Carlo simulation, but there are probably better ways.
