EXE not running, accidental change in configuration?

I've been working on a simple project that uses some common .NET classes, isolated storage, some resources and no external libraries. Somehow the EXE generated (either in debug or release mode) no longer runs (stops working as soon as it's opened) without giving any details or displaying any exceptions. It runs normally in visual studio, and there's a .application in the same folder that when clicked starts in install process. I'm not interested in installation files, I just want it to be the way it was: running an EXE (it's easier to get testers when all you have to do is running it). I have previous versions of the program, and all of them run normally through the EXE's. I don't recall changing anything regarding framework, deployment or build. I revised it and there's nothing changed apart from using new objects from the .NET framework. --[Update]-- Just checked the event viewer. Event data "not available" and answer "not available".
