The likelihood function you have is actually based on $f(p,\rho,\widehat{y(t)}^{MLE})$. Then, instead of having $Likelihood(p,\rho;Data)$, you have $Likelihood(p,\rho;SS)$, where $SS$ denotes a summary statistic which is the sequence $(\widehat{y(1)}^{MLE},\ldots,\widehat{y(s)}^{MLE})$. If the summary statistic $SS$ is sufficient, then the estimator is in fact the MLE. Otherwise, they are different. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufficient_statistic#Fisher.E2.80.93Neyman_factorization_theorem There is an area that uses summary statistics to obtain inferences on the parameters called ABC: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_Bayesian_computation
