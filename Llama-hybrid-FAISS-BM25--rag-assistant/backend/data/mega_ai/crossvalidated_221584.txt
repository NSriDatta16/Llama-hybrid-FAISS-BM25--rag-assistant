xgboost: does it support stochastic gradient boosting?

What function/parameter needs to be set to enable stochastic gradient boosting in XGBoost? I ask because in https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/stobst.pdf , Jerome Friedman shows that stochastic gradient boosting outperforms regular gradient boosting. Thanks.
