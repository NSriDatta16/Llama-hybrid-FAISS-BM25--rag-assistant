As Christian says, "It is not possible to import all functions from a module." The compiler has no import_all directive and I think this is done deliberately to discourage excessive function importing. Importing functions instead of fully qualifying them M:F(...) is usually bad style. There is a semantic difference between calling a module-local function and a function in another module (code-loading rules), so I think it's best to make foreign calls explicit. One could possibly make exceptions for importing dict/lists/sets module functions, as those are commonly understood and are unlikely to change during a code upgrade.
