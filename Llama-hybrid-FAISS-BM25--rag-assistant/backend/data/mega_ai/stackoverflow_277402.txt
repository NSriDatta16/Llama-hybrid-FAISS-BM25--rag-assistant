At one customer site we used the CRAP metric which is defined as: CRAP(m) = comp(m)^2 * (1 â€“ cov(m)/100)^3 + comp(m) Where comp(m) is the cyclomatic complexity of a given method and cov(m) is the level of unit test coverage for that method. We used NDepend and NCover to provide the raw information to calculate the metric. It was useful for find particular areas of the code base where attention should be paid. Also rather than specify a particular value as a target, we aimed for improvement over time. Not perfect by any stretch, but still useful.
