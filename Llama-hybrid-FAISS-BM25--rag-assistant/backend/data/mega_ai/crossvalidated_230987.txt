Many people who self-describe as "Bayesians", however, seem to reject using maximum likelihood estimation under any circumstances, even though it is a special case of (mathematically) Bayesian methods, because it is a "frequentist method". Such people would be rejecting MLE as a general method for making point estimates. In particular cases where they had reason to use a uniform prior & wanted to make a maximum a posteriori estimate they wouldn't be at all bothered by the coincidence of their calculations with MLE. Apparently Bayesians also use a restricted/limited number of distributions compared to frequentists, even though those distributions would also be mathematically correct from a Bayesian viewpoint. Perhaps sometimes, to make their calculations easier, but not from any point of principle. I have the impression that there are at least two different definitions of the term Bayesian commonly in use. The first I would call "mathematically Bayesian" which encompasses all methods of statistics, since it includes parameters which are constant RVs and those which are not constant RVs. Then there is "culturally Bayesian" which rejects some "mathematically Bayesian" methods because those methods are "frequentist" (i.e. out of personal animosity to the parameter sometimes being modeled as a constant or frequency). There are certainly distinctions to be made between different approaches to Bayesian inference, but not this one. If there's a sense in which Bayesianism is more general, it's in the willingness to apply the concept of probability to epistemic uncertainty about parameter values & not just the aleatory uncertainty of the data-generating process which is all that frequentism concerns itself with. Frequentist inference is not a special case of Bayesian inference & none of the answers or comments at Is there any mathematical basis for the Bayesian vs frequentist debate? are implying that it is. If in a Bayesian approach you were to consider the parameter a constant random variable, you'd obtain the same posterior whatever the data areâ€”& to say it's constant but you don't know what value it takes wouldn't be to say anything worth saying. The frequentist approach takes an entirely different tack & doesn't involve the calculation of posterior distributions at all.
