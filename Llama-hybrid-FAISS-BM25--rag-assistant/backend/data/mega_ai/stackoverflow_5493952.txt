Can a single page can be used for multiple skbs which are not fragments

I have a networking hardware which does Rx coalescing , in which frames partaining to a nic device are combined and send as a big chunk ( Greater than mtu) to the driver. In the driver i have to split them according to mtu size and need to sent up to the stack. I want to know is there a way to allocate a page so that i can split that after the device DMA's the frame ? Can a single Page can be shared across multiple skbs (not accross frags in a same skb)? If so what special care i need to take which unmapping the page? Is there a mechanism to allocate sgs and map them to a page and after the device does DMA , split this sgs and point to skb and send to the stack Waiting for the reponses Thanks pradeep G
