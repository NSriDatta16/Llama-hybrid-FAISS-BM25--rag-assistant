Linker error with Duplicated Symbols, SWIG and C++ Vectors

I came across this error trying to compile a shared object from 2 sets of objects. The first set contains one .os object compiled from one cpp file generated by SWIG. The second set is contains all of the .so files from the individual files that make up the interface to be wrapped. $g++ -shared *.os -o Mathlibmodule.so ld: duplicate symbol std::vector >::size() constin Mathlib_wrap.o and Capsule.o The swig c++ wrapper (Mathlib_wrap.o's source file) is machine generated and nasty to look at, with lots of #defines to make it extra hard to trace. It looks like the redefinition is present in all of the object files in the second set. I've traced through the headers included in all those files, and the seem to be #pragma once'd. What advice do people have for tracking down what/where the problem is?
