How is the feature interaction different in XGBoost vs. a fully connected neural network

When you know your features could interact with each other, will you choose XGBoost or NN-based models? My friend is training with an XGBoost, and he manually adds interacted features (X1 * X2) as new features to the model even though the XGBoost can learn interactions by itself. He said that adding in interactions that we are aware of a priori could still help the model to learn sometimes. Is that true? and why don't we just use a fully connected NN model? Won't that do the same thing for you automatically, plus you don't need to manually add all interacted features?
