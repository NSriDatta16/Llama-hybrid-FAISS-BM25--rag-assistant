Testcase with multitouch on Android?

The TouchUtils class in the android documentation has functions like drag() : https://developer.android.com/reference/android/test/TouchUtils.html#drag(android.test.InstrumentationTestCase,%20float,%20float,%20float,%20float,%20int) but they do not support multi touch gestures, like a two finger swipe. Looking at the MotionEvent.obtain() methods, there does not seem to be any way of invoking a "virtual" multi touch event from a testcase. Anyone has got it working?
