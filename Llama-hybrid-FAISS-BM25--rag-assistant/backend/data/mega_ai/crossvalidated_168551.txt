Disclosure: I know almost nothing about bandits. Still, my suggestion seems like a natuaral generalization of the case you presented. It does not consider the experimental design step in detail (since I don't know what people ususally consider as a loss function in this scenario), so might fail in this respect. Let me ignore the fact that we have two web pages. You have a web page and your prior for "profit per call" (denoted $\theta$) is (say) Gaussian- $p(\theta) = (2\pi)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp( -\frac{\theta^2}{2})$. Lets also say that you believe that if you know the average profit per view, your gains are distributed according to another normal $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta, 1)$. Then you have a valid (and very simple) bayesian model. Now, use the same model for both web pages. After observing $n$ (potential) clients' reactions, you have the distributions for the posterior of $A$ and $B$ which are both Gaussian. Based on whatever target you choose for the experimental design step, you can choose which web page to present next. Calculating and differentiating the target should not be too hard, since we know how to integrate Gaussians.
