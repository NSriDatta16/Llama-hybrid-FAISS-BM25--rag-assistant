Proportion of explained variance for a probability model(binary logistic regression)

in the article written by Frank Harell ,Statistically Efficient Ways to Quantify Added Predictive Value of New Measurements,( https://www.fharrell.com/post/addvalue/ ) Harell is writing: For a probability model, the natural way to express the proportion of explained variance is through the predicted probabilities that Y=1, denoted by $(\hat{P})$ . The $(R^2)$ measure for a binary Y model is then $\frac{\text{var}(\hat{P})}{\text{var}(\hat{P}) + \sum_{i}^{n} \hat{P}_{i} (1 - \hat{P}_{i}) / n}$ where $\text{var}(\hat{P})$ is the sample variance of the $(n)$ $(\hat{P}_{i})$ I cannot understand this term in the denominator: $ \sum_{i}^{n} \hat{P}_{i} (1 - \hat{P}_{i}) / n$ . How do I interpret it. Is this some kind of residual variance not explained by the model?
