Monte Carlo rolling forecast of time series - details needed

I know I'm doing a short term forecast of a volatile time series using Monte Carlo, but I'm unsure as to the details - for example, I'm sure I had a very good reason for naming a term 'drift', but I can't recall why! I can't seem to find anything similar to what I'm doing when Googling for Monte Carlo forecast. Would anyone kindly help me by pointing me to some literature? The pseudo-algorithm is: Given highly volatile time series data $x_0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ Define $z_1, z_2, ..., z_n = ln(x_1/x_0), ln(x_2/x_1), ln(x_3/x_2),..., ln(x_n/x_{n-1})$. Define $\mu =$ average of $z$; $\sigma^2 = $ variance of $z$; drift $= \mu - \sigma^2/2$. Forecast using $x_{n+1} = x_n e^{d + \sigma R}$ where $d$ is the drift and $R$ is a random number generated from the inverse of the normal cdf with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
