What disables #pragma pack(push)?

I have a code that uses #pragma pack(push,8) but it does not seem to take effect somehow but I can't figure out what's causing this problem. For example, look at the following code. #include #include #pragma pack(push, 8) typedef struct _MY_DATA { LARGE_INTEGER a; LARGE_INTEGER b; ULONG count; } MY_DATA; #pragma pack(show) #pragma pack(pop) int main() { MY_DATA data; printf("data size:%d\n", sizeof(data)); return 0; } This would return "data size:24" but I use the same code in other application that is managed by Visual Studio and there I am getting "data size:20". So I am assuming it has to do with some settings but could not figure out. I will really appreciate it if anybody could give me some hint. Thanks.
