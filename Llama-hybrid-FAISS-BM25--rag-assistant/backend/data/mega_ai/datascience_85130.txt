Repeated features in Neural Networks with tabular data

When using algorithms like linear regression or least-squares methods, having repeated or highly correlated features can be harmful for the model. For tree based models, they are generally not too strongly affected by highly correlated features. There are no numeric stability issues as with least squares. But what happens with Neural Networks? Most of the literature on NN is made for images, signal and there is not too much about tabular data. Having repeated features in a tabular data Neural Network model, does it harm the accuracy? Or NN are able to select features?
