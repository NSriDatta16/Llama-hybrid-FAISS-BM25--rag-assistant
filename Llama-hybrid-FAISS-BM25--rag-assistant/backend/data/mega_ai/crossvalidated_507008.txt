Another R package that meets these options (and can be implemented online) is changepoint.geo . It reduces the multivariate time series down to a bi-variate (angle and distance) series. These are designed to identify changes in mean and variance. Currently, all other projection-based (for dimension reduction and time efficiencies) approaches only consider changes in the mean behaviour. In contrast to BCP, geomcp uses PELT as the optimizer for the bivariate series and so it is an exact solution to the optimization problem. As with BCP it doesn't model auto- or cross- correlations though. Most changepoint algorithms are in R at the moment but you can easily use rpy2 to interface to them from Python. Although if you enjoy coding, the transformation is simple to translate to Python and the code for PELT is already available in Python in the ruptures package. I'd be happy to guide on which lines need changing.
