Unable to start subversion using Launchctl

I'm trying to use Launchctl to launch svnserve process but I keep getting an error saying "no plist was returned for:/Library/LaunchAgents/org.tigris.subversion.svnserve.plist". This is where svnserve is /opt/local/bin/svnserve and this is the plist file Any thoughts what might be wrong here ? Disabled Label org.tigris.subversion.svnserve ProgramArguments /opt/local/bin/svnserve --inetd --root=/Users/Sunit/Repositories ServiceDescription SVN Version Control System/string> Sockets Listeners SockFamily IPv4 SockServiceName svn SockType stream SockFamily IPv6 SockServiceName svn SockType stream
