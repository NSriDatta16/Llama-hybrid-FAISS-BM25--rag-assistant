jQuery clone : should it clone DOM Level 0 Events?

While reading the book jQuery in Action and playing with the first events handling example, I discovered that jQuery doesn't consistently clone DOM Level 0 events. It clones the inline events, but not those defined as a property. It could be a good thing to discourage the use of inline event handlers, but is is by design? What is one wants to clone something from a legacy page ? Here is an alteration of the example given in the book, to demonstrate the behavior. DOM Level 0 Events Example $(function(){ $('#testElement')[0].onclick = function(event) { say(this.id + ' Click ASSIGN [DOM 0]'); } $('#testElement').click(function() { say(this.id + ' Click JQUERY [DOM 2]');}); $('#testElement').clone(true).attr('id',"clonedElement").insertAfter($('#testElement')); }); function say(text) { $('#console').append(' '+text+' '); } &nbsp;
