After the paragraph of this answer . Hastie further explains p.245 : "Here is the correct way to carry out cross-validation in this example: Divide the samples into K cross-validation folds (groups) at random. For each fold k = 1, 2, . . . , K (a) Find a subset of “good” predictors that show fairly strong (univariate) correlation with the class labels, using all of the samples except those in fold k. (b) Using just this subset of predictors, build a multivariate classifier, using all of the samples except those in fold k. (c) Use the classifier to predict the class labels for the samples in fold k."
