Creating a high and low game in python and need a lot of help!

Here is the Pseudocode Print instructions to the user Start with the variables high = 1000, low = 1, and tries = 1 While high is greater than low Guess the average of high and low Ask the user to respond to the guess Handle the four possible outcomes: If the guess was right, print a message that tries guesses were required and quit the program If the guess was too high, print a message that says “I will guess lower.” If the guess was too low, print a message that says “I will guess higher.” If the user entered an incorrect value, print out the instructions again. I don't even know where to begin.
