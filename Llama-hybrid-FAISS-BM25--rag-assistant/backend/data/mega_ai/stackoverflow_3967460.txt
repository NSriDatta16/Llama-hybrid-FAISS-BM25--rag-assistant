Can an SVM learn incrementally?

I am using a multi-dimensional SVM classifier (SVM.NET, a wrapper for libSVM) to classify a set of features. Given an SVM model, is it possible to incorporate new training data without having to recalculate on all previous data? I guess another way of putting it would be: is an SVM mutable?
