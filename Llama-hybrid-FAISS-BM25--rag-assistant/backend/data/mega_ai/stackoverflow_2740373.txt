"Open" has several meanings. In this case, you can get as many copies of the standards as you like, no matter who you are. You can implement them freely, without any further difficulty. You can, if you like, join the Committee and work on it yourself, and influence it in that way. In all these respects it's open. Now, you'll need money to get copies of the standard. I don't know about sitting on the committee, but for practical purposes there will at least be expenses in going to meetings. Personally, I don't think it's all that useful to insist that "open" also mean "free". There's a clear distinction here between open and closed (in which you might have trouble getting a copy, or not be able to freely use it, or in influencing its development), and muddling this with whether it costs money will confuse things. There's also the problem that the standardization process costs money that has to come from somebody, even considering the tremendous amount of volunteer work. Should it come from taxes? That's what the alternative looks like to me, either taxes or fees from people and organizations using the standards. Finally, I don't see it as a real problem. The Standards aren't really useful to most people. They are worthless unless the reader already knows the language, and they aren't even very good as general references. They aren't for the casual reader. The people who actually have a use for them will probably be willing to spend a few bucks on them, and that will go to support the standards-making process.
