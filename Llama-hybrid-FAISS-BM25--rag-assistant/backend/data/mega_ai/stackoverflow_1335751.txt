Ruby abstracts away the internal storage of integers, so you don't have to worry about it. If you assign an integer to a variable, Ruby will deal with the internals, allocating memory when needed. Smaller integers are of type Fixnum (stored in a single word), larger integers are of type Bignum . a = 64 a.class #=> Fixnum; stored in a single word a += 1234567890 a.class #=> Bignum; stored in more than a single word Ruby is dynamically typed, so you cannot force a variable to contain only unsigned 8-bit integers (just as you cannot force a variable to only contain string values, etc.).
