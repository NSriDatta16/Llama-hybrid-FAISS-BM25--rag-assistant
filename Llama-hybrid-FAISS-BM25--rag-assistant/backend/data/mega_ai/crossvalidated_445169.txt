Comparing means of 2 time series

My question is about comparing means of 2 different populations. Characteristics: the data points are not independent of each other [within each process]; the data points do not form a uniform distribution. I have 2 data sets (one for each process: Real data / Model data); each point represents number of patients in a clinic by minute of the days: TIME (R, M). An example of non-independence: 10.00 (9, 13); 10.01 (10, 12); 10.02 (12, 10). Thus, for the Real data, in 10.01, 10 patients is dependent on 10.00 (one patient more from 10.00), and 10.02 is dependent on 10.01 (+2 from 10.01). The same goes for the Model data. From my understanding, I cannot use z or t tests because it is not a normal distribution; furthermore, the data points are not independent. What statistical tools are there that I can use in order to compare the 2 means? How do I make sure, statistically, that the 2 (Real vs. Model are similar? [visually, they are and they follow the same fluctuations]
