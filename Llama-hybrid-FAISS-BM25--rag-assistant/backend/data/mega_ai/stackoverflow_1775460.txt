My personal favorite is the CodeLite 2.x IDE. see: http://www.codelite.org The decision to use CodeLite was based on a research regarding the following C++ IDE for Linux: Eclipse Galileo with CDT Plugin NetBeans 6.7 (which is also the base for the SunStudio IDE) KDevelop4 CodeBlocks 8.02 CodeLite 2.x After all I have decided to use CodeLite 2.x . Below I have listed some Pros and Cons regarding the mentioned C++ IDEs. Please note, that this reflects my personal opinion only! EDIT : what a pity that SOF doesn't support tables, so I have to write in paragraphs ... Eclipse Galileo with CDT Plugin Pros: reasonable fast also supports Java, Perl(with E.P.I.C plugin) commonly used and well maintained also available for other OS flavours (Windows, MacOS, Solaris, AIX(?)) Cons: GUI is very confusing and somewhat inconsistent - not very intuitive at all heavy weight Only supports CVS (AFAIK) NetBeans 6.7 (note this is also the base for the SunStudio IDE) Pros: one of the most intuitive GUI I have ever seen also supports Java, Python, Ruby integrates CVS, SVN, Mercurial commonly used and well maintained also available for other OS flavours (Windows, MacOS, Solaris) Cons: extremly slow heavy weight uses Spaces for indentation, which is not the policy at my work. I'm sure this is configurable, but I couldn't find out how to to that KDevelop4 (note: I did not much testing on it) Pros: commonly used on Linux integrates CVS, SVN, Mercurial Cons: the GUI looks somewhat old fashioned heavy weight very specific to the KDE environment CodeBlocks 8.02 (note: I did not much testing on it) Pros: reasonable fast Cons: the GUI looks somewhat old fashioned (although it has a nice startup screen) the fonts in the editor are very small some icons (e.g. the debugger related icons starting/stepping) are very small no source control integration CodeLite 2.x (note: this is my personal favorite) Pros: the best, modern looking and intuitive GUI I have seen on Linux lightweight reasonable fast integrates SVN also available on other OS flavours(Windows, MacOS, Solaris(?)) Cons: no CVS integration (that's important for me because I have to use it at work) no support for Java, Perl, Python (would be nice to have)
