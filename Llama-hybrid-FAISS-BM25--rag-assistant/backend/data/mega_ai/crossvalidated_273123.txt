MCMC Bayesian approach - centering and standardizing

Why is centering and standardizing generally recommended in the Bayesian approach (MCMCregress) ? Does it apply equally for non-informative as well as informative priors? EDIT: We have been working on a specific example. The following screen shots provide the summary from the R output. Does the centering and standardizing improve the prediction? How will the parameters be interpreted once they have been centered and standardized? mcmc.logmod Centered and standardized: mcmc.logmod2
