Graph API - FB - Getting crazy already. :s - Getting profile pictures

I can get the profile pictures from this: data": [ { "id": "11111111111_22222222222", "from": { "name": "Some Name", "category": "Non-profit organization", "id": "11222131212211" }, I'm doing like so: $.each(json.data,function(i,fb){ html += " "; } No problems. However, later on the graph I have: "id": "11111111111_2222222222", "to": { "data": [ { "name": "Some Name", "category": "Non-profit organization", "id": "11222131212211" And I need to grab this id but I've tried: alert(fb.to.data.id); got nothing. If I do: alert(fb.to) I got "undefined". Has anyone had this sort of problems or similar. As you may notice I'm not at all versatle onto programing matters, however, I will do my best to solve this issue. 1) How can I display the profile image on the second case? 2) How can I say: use the fb.from.id only when the graph has that. About 2), please note that if I comment the line: //html += " "; no images will be show and all post information (except the profile picture) is displayed on the viewport. If I deal only with the first part of this graph (the one with "from:") I get the picture for that post. SO, the issue must be, indeed, on the second graph part. The one with the "to:" that I can't grab the ID. I've tried, as well, to avoid rendering the image on the second case but, at least run the first one. No luck at all. if (fb.from.id != undefined) { //do something; } The second part of the graph still returns an error. With all this mess, that I can re-arrange, can I please ask your help. :S ** Update: ** The js code: function fbFetch(){ var url = "https://graph.facebook.com/125120007543580/feed&callback=?&limit=2"; var i = 0; //Use jQuery getJSON method to fetch the data from the url and then create our unordered list with the relevant data. $.getJSON(url,function(json){ var html = " "; //loop through and within data array's retrieve the message variable. $.each(json.data,function(i,fb){ var idTotal = fb.id; var ids = idTotal.split("_"); var href = "http://www.facebook.com/"+ids[0]+"/posts/"+ids[1]; var msg = fb.message; //adicionado if (msg == undefined) { msg = 'Cick here to see the post title'; } else if (msg.length > 150) { msg = msg.substr(0,200)+"..."; } //ISSUE HERE. IF I COMMENT THIS LINE ALL GOES WELL BUT NO PROFILE PICTURES ARE DISPLAYED. html += " "; html += " "; html += " "; //adicionado fb.name em vez de fb.from.name: if (fb.name == undefined) { html += " " + fb.from.name + " - " + msg + " "; } else { html += " " + fb.name + " - " + msg + " "; } html += " "+ dataFinal + " "; html += " "; html += " "; html += " "; }); html += " "; $("#coluna2").append(html); }); }; fbFetch(); And part of the graph: ({ "data": [ { "id": "125120007543580_150880001634837", "from": { "name": "Some Name", "category": "Non-profit organization", "id": "125120007543580" }, { "id": "125120007543580_111122368963254", "to": { "data": [ { "name": "Some Name", "category": "Non-profit organization", "id": "125120007543580" } ] }, I need to display the profile from fb.to.data.id, I now notice, however, that data has [ instead of { , and that could mean that, in order to access id, I need to use another syntax perhaps?
