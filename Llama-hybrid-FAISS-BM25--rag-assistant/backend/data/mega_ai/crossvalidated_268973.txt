I'll argue that the distinction between machine learning and statistical inference is clear. In short, machine learning = prediction of future observations; statistics = explanation. Here is an example from my field of interest (medicine): when developing a drug, we search for gene(s) which best explain a disease state, with the goal of targeting it/them with the drug. We use statistis for that. In contrast, when developing diagnostic tests, for example predicting whether the drug will help a patient, the goal is strictly finding the best predictor of the future outcome, even if it comprises many genes and is too complicated to understand. We use machine learning for this purpose. There are multiple published examples [1], [2], [3], [4] showing that presence of the drug target is not a good predictor of the treatment outcome, hence the distinction. Based on this, it is fair to say that one is doing machine learning when the goal is strictly predicting outcome of future/previously unseen observations. If the goal is understanding a particular phenomenon, then that is statistical inference, not machine learning. As others have pointed out, this is true regardless of the method involved. To answer your question: in the specific research that you describe, the scientists were comparing the factor roles (weights) in different linear regression models, not comparing the model accuracies. Therefore, it is not accurate to call their inference machine learning. [1] Messersmith WA, Ahnen DJ. Targeting EGFR in Colorectal Cancer. The New England Journal of Medicine; 2008; 359; 17.
