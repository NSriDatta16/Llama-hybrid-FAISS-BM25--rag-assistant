Softmax regression or $K$ binary logistic regression

For a multi-class classification problem, we can use $K$ binary logistic classifiers, or one softmax regression classifier, so how to make the choice between the two? IMHO, the $K$ binary logistic classifiers is just the 1-vs-all scheme for multi-class, but softmax classifier inherently handles multi-class problem. Why should I prefer one over the other?
