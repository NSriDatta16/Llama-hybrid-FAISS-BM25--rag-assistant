The AJAX call you are making, is making a request to a domain outside of the domain of the top level url(the url in the address bar). This results in it being a 3rd party cookie, by default Internet explorer won't persist a 3rd party cookie. Meaning that the cookie will come back in the Set-Cookie header on the first request, but subsequent requests that you make to that server will not have that cookie sent in the request. Like you said, if you go directly to the url in your browser it works. This is because in this case it's a first party cookie. In order for IE to accept 3rd party cookie's the server that is sending the SET-COOKIE header on it's response, must also have a P3P Policy Header set. Here is an example, when you navigate to CNN, you will notice one of the requests it makes is to a domain name of b.scorecardresearch.com, scorecardresearch is dropping a tracking cookie, but this cookie is considered a 3rd party cookie. So in order to make it work they had to also in include a p3p header, see headers below: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 43 Content-Type: image/gif Date: Thu, 02 Dec 2010 19:57:16 GMT Connection: keep-alive Set-Cookie: UID=133a68a4-63.217.184.91-1288107038; expires=Sat, 01-Dec-2012 19:57:16 GMT; path=/; domain=.scorecardresearch.com P3P: policyref="/w3c/p3p.xml", CP="NOI DSP COR NID OUR IND COM STA OTC" Expires: Mon, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: private, no-cache, no-cache=Set-Cookie, no-store, proxy-revalidate Server: CS If you were to copy this header and add it to the response, you would notice that the cookie's start working, P3P: policyref="/w3c/p3p.xml", CP="NOI DSP COR NID OUR IND COM STA OTC" It's best that you craft a P3P header specific for your business, but the above should work for testing purposes.
