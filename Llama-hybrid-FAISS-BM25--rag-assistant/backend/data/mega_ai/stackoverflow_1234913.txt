Have a look at the C bible, a.k.a. K&R C ( sanitised Amazon link ) as they have a discussion about the advantages of both techniques. Either way, "there be dragons ahead, arr!" so tread very carefully as the road of good pointer arithmetic intentions is paved with the abundant corpses of buffer overflow exploit victims! (-: In fact, for an excellent discussion and a "wander out on to the thin ice of advanced pointer manipulation" (his term), have a look at Andy Koenig's excellent book "C Traps and Pitfalls" ( sanitised Amazon link ) Edit: One thing I forgot to mention, is that I tend to prefer the usual "for (int i = 0; ..) style purely because it is such an ingrained idiom that anyone can see what you're doing with a quick glance. Using pointer arithmetic requires a bit more of a deeper look. HTH
