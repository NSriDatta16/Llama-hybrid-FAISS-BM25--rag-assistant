Must a JCP/SCJP exam question be complete (i.e. compilable)?

Just reading Kathy "Sierra/Bert Bates: JSCP Java6 Study Guide" and found contradicting mock exam questions: In one of the self-test questions, the correct answer was "Code does not compile" due to the fact that there were no import statements in the code nor was "given the correct import statements" in the question itself. They tell you explicitly afterwards to expect such tricky questions. In a question later, where the code contained only a correctly defined main method, I picked "code does not compile" because there was no surrounding class declaration. However this wasn't the correct answer, the code was supposed to run. So my question: how to know which questions are expected to compile if source code is not fully provided? Another question about the exam: are the questions grouped by any means (e.g. topic, difficulty etc.) or do they come completely at random?
