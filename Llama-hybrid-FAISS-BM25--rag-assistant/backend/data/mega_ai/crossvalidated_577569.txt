The overfitting could be the reason if you are referring to the drop in accuracy on the testing or validation data. However, even the training accuracy will drop after increasing the polynomial degree beyond a certain threshold. That's why we always need to use the simplest model that fits the data, and avoid "suspicious coincidences" as is referred to in the domain of concept learning. This is called the Bayesian Occam's razor principle, which I have answered similar question about here .
