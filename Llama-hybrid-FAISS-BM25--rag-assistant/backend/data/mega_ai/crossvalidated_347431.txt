Do neural networks learn a function or a probability density function?

The question might sound a bit strange because I am new to statistical inference and neural networks. When in classification problems using neural networks we say that we want to learn a function $f^*$ that maps the space of the inputs $x$, to the space of the outputs $y$: $$f^*(x; \theta) = y$$ Are we fitting the parameters ($\theta$) to model a non-linear function, or to model a probability density function? I don't really know how to write the question in a better way. I have read several times both things (probability density function, or function just like that) so therefore my confusion.
