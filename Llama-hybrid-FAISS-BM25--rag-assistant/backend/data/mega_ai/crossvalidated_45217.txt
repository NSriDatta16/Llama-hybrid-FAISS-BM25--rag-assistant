The book Bayesian Econometric Methods is quite perfect for your need: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bayesian-Econometric-Methods-Exercises/dp/0521671736 Take a look at the table of contents and you will see that it covers all subjects you're interested on. It presents several exercises with answers. In fact, the book is alll about exercises with answers. I have it and it's really good. They even have a website with matlab code to implement gibbs sampling described in the book. I was able to adapt the code into R, even knowing nothing of matlab.
