Keras ImageDataGenerator.flow_from_directory doesn't find images

I'm working on a deep learning (CNN) problem. I have structured my images into folders correctly (I think), like this: train_dir: - class 1 - class 2 validation_dir: - class 1 - class 2 test_dir: - class 1 - class 2 The images are PNG in a (196,256,3) format but will I'd like to convert them to (196,256,1) because they are grayscale. I do this with the flow_from_directory argument color_mode='grayscale' As such the code I have so far to get on with this is: train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255) # re-scale pixel values between [0,1] test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255) train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory( train_dir, target_size = (196,256), color_mode='grayscale', batch_size=20, class_mode='binary') validation_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory( validation_dir, target_size = (196,256), color_mode='grayscale', batch_size=20, class_mode='binary') With train_dir and validation_dir being strings with the equivalent path of the correct folders I mentioned earlier above. However I get this error when running this section of the code: Found 0 images belonging to 2 classes After trying for sometime I can't figure out what's wrong. Does anyone have a clue?
