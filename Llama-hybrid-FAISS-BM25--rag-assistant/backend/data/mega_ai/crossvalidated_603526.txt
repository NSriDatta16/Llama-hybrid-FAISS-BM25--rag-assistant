Bayesian calibration of computer simulations - Likelihood function calculation

I am starting to study Bayesian calibrations of computer models. I am not a statistician and just starting to learn so bear with me if I do not use the correct terminology. The general approach is based on Kennedy and O’Hagan, ‘Bayesian Calibration of Computer Models’ , but I am following specifically Van Oijen, Rougier, and Smith, ‘Bayesian Calibration of Process-Based Forest Models’ as it is a bit easier to follow. For one single calibration parameter $t$ and boundary condition $x$ , the approach states that the observation values can be described as $$ y(x) = M(x,t) + \delta(x) + E(x) $$ Where $y(x)$ is the measured data, $M(x,t)$ is the result of a computer simulation, $E(x)$ is the error of the measurement, $x$ is some boundary condition and $\delta(x)$ is the error of the model. If I assume that the model is ‘precise’ than I can rewrite $$ y(x) = M(x, t) + E(x) $$ If the set of $n$ measurements is Y and the prior pdf is $p(t)$ I can write $$ p(t|Y) = \frac{p(Y|t) p(t)}{p(Y)} $$ To calculate the likelihood $p(Y|t)$ , the paper states that, for a specific value of $t$ , $\theta$ : $$ p(Y|\theta) = p(E = Y - M(\theta)) $$ This is because (quote): “A common assumption when choosing the likelihood is that θ, were it to be known, would provide a perfect match between the process model output and the true value from the system. In this case the observed differences between the two are attributable to measurement error in Y.” The way I read it, but do not understand it, is: the probability of obtaining those observation, given $\theta$ , is the same as the probability of the error being equal to $Y - M(\theta)$ Questions: Is the statement correct? Can it be rephrased more clearly? If so, how can I derive it more formally? I do not know the error. How can I can calculate the probability? If I understand correctly, the above methodology is not related to approximate bayesian computation, because we do have an expression for the likelihood, albeit not analytical. I hope the above makes sense.
