Using awk for a table lookup

I would like to use awk to lookup a value from a text file. The text file has a very simple format: text \t value text \t value text \t value ... I want to pass the actual text for which the value should be looked up via a shell variable, e.g., $1. Any ideas how I can do this with awk? your help is great appreciated. All the best, Alberto
