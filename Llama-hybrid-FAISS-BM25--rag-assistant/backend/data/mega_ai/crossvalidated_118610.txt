You could map $(1,2,3)$ to $(1,3,5)$. That is easy, as a one-by-one recode or $\text{new} = 2 \times \text{old} - 1$, depending on your software. I can't see any reason for doing that unless you want to average the 3 point scale and present results comparable to those for a 5-point scale. If you wanted to do that, you could naturally work on the averages rather than the raw data. It would be a bad idea if the goal was to persuade or fool yourself or anybody else that you really had a 5-point scale, whereas you don't. @Peter Flom has a very good answer to your more general question.
