Can we use TypeIdentifierAttribute in .NET without COM?

I am curious if it is possible to make 2 interfaces in .NET (either in the same assembly or in separate assemblies) that can be treated as equivalent, using the new TypeIdentifierAttribute attribute. I have not found a way. I've seen some stuff on the internet that suggest this eventually would be possible, but it kinda looks like the current implementation is only for COM interops. I understand the immediate intentions for this were for embedding COM interops. I am not dealing with COM interops. Also, I am not interested in discussing why I would want to do this, I don't want to lead this question to other types of solutions. Let's just say that I'm experimenting and I want to see if there is anything we can do with TypeIdentifierAttribute.
