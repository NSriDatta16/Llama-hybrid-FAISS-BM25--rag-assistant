adding a UIScrollView as a superview of 2 UITextview made no view can be scrolled

i have 2 textview in a viewcontroller. the 1st textview is not editable, but the 2nd is editable. i want to make both of them scroll in the same position and size when the keyboard is appear. I think i have to use UIScrollView as base of both of textview. And then i add the UIScrollView in xib (bot of textview are made in xib too). and this is the picture if this hierarchy : in the viewDidLoad method, i add this code : - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; [scrollTextView addSubview:lineNumberTextView]; [scrollTextView addSubview:_codeTextView]; [lineNumberTextView bringSubviewToFront:scrollTextView]; [_codeTextView bringSubviewToFront:scrollTextView]; } but after that i can't scroll anything. What i have to do? thx for the advices UPDATE this my code after do some advises like mac gave to me : - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; scrollTextView.showsVerticalScrollIndicator = YES; scrollTextView.showsHorizontalScrollIndicator = YES; scrollTextView.scrollEnabled = YES; _codeTextView.showsHorizontalScrollIndicator = NO; _codeTextView.showsVerticalScrollIndicator = NO; _codeTextView.scrollEnabled = YES; _codeTextView.tag = 0; _codeTextView.delegate = self; lineNumberTextView.showsVerticalScrollIndicator = NO; lineNumberTextView.showsHorizontalScrollIndicator = NO; lineNumberTextView.scrollEnabled = YES; lineNumberTextView.tag = 1; lineNumberTextView.delegate = self; } but just the _codeTextView scroll, the lineTextVew stil didn't scroll...somebody know why??
