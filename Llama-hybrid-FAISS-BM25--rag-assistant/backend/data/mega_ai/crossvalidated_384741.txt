59% is correct. You can caluclate it like this: (30 * 83.3% + 80 * 50%)/110 = 59% The problem with averaging percentages directly is that you don't take into account the numbers that these percentages refer to. If you had the equal number of elements in set1 and set2, you'd get the same result, but since one set has more elements than the other, the percentage has to be weighted.
