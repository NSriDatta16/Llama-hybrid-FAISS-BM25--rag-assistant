Others have already pointed out the correct solution using XOR operations... This isn't exactly an answer, but I thought I'd point you that the Interlocked.Exchange method is very suitable for this sort of task. (It performs the swap as an atomic operation and therefore works across threads, though that seems irrelevant here.) Nonetheless, I would almost always consider it the simplest/most elegant solution for swapping two variables. Here's an example of how to use it with the code you posted. char[] a = { 'o', 'r', 'a', 'n', 'g', 'e' }; for (int i = 0; i Hope that helps, even if it isn't specifically an answer to your question...
