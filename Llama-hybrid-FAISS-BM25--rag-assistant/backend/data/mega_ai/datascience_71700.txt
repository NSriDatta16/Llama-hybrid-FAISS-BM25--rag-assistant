You could take averages piecewise. Ideally, is like sliding a window of size k on the trend, taking the average of these points (it could be 3 or 5, for example). Alternatively, you can use exponential smoothing functions, such as savgol filter available in scipy , LOESS smoothing, or Holt-Winters smoothing. The statsmodels.tsa submodule made many smoothing techniques available.
