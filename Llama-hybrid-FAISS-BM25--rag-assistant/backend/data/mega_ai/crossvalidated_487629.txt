What is the best way to overfit a model with accuracy?

I need to overfit a model to specific data. (These data have been created from simulation of complex multidimensional models.) The final goal is to extract coefficients (betas) to retrieve with accuracy the results of the database, without any complication, any assumptions, any need for extrapolation, just math. I thought about a regression that try to maximize the adjusted R-squared, as it represents "the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by a regression model". But it may exist some other method, maybe machine learning method, that are more relevant and easy to apply ? An important point is that the method have to be easily replicable on a non professionnal software like Excel , that why regressions (that contains coefficients ) interest me. Thank you a lot !
