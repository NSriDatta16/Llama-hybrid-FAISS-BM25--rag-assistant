WPF PropertyPath Issue - Cannot resolve all property references in property path

I'm struggling to get a PropertyPath to work - I've got a Transformation in the Window Resources that I'm trying to affect via a StoryBoard - also in Window Resources ... Heres the property path i'm using ... (Viewport2DVisual3D.Transform).(Transform3DGroup)[0].(RotateTransform3D).(RotateTransform3D.Rotation).(AxisAngleRotation3D.Angle) EDIT: Thanks to Anurags suggestion I've got a bit further ... (Viewport2DVisual3D.Transform).(Transform3DGroup.Children)[0].(RotateTransform3D.Rotation).(AxisAngleRotation3D.Angle) but now it errors with "Rotation property does not point to a DependencyProperty" Can anyone please put me back on track? Heres the code in full ... Blah
