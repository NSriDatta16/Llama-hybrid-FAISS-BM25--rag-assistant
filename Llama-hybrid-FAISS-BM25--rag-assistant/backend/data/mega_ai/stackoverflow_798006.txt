Spoofing IP addresses is not possible (or at least not easy at all) in windows because of the raw socket limitations .. etc. You might use hping tool under linux, or WinPcap library for windows to generate raw packets, but you gonna spend lots of time for nothing. I guess the best way is to set the IPs of your 5 machines manually into different IPs (one from each range you use).
