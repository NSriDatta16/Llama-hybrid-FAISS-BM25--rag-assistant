How to use R package caret to build a model and get the internal validation result?

I am a learner of R and machine learning. I don't really understand caret's train function. To make it simple, for example, I want to build a model and get the internal validation result. At the beginning, I don't use package caret. # 1 prepare data_table library(tidyverse) library(mlbench) data("PimaIndiansDiabetes") data_table My first question is: is the above method correct to get the internal validation result? Now I want to use package caret as following: # 4 caret library(caret) train_control $finalModel$ coefficients) caret_predicted_prob % arrange(rowIndex) %>% pull(pos) caret_roc This way to use caret is much simpler than my own method. My second question is: is the caret method correct to get the final model and internal validation result? By the way, since caret's train function already has the option of cross validation, why the following web page still split data into training and testing before calling train function: https://topepo.github.io/caret/model-training-and-tuning.html#basic library(caret) inTraining My third question is: do I need to split data_table into training & testing data when using caret to do cross validation? Thank you very much!
