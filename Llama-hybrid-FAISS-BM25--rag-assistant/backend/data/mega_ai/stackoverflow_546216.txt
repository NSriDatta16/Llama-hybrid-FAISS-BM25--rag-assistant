To test existing code, you should assume that the code is (mostly) correct. So you just give it some data, run it and record the result. Then use that recorded result in a test case. When you do the next change, your output should change too and the test will fail. Compare the new result with what you'd have expected. If there is a discrepancy, then you're missing something -> write another test to figure out what is going on. This way, you can build expertise about an unknown system. When you ask for coverage, I assume that you can't create coverage data for the actual calculations. In this case, just make sure that all calculations are executed and feed them with several inputs. That should give you an idea how to proceed.
