Adobe AIR: Windows Application Directory Access

While I realize Adobe discourages use of the application directory for reading/writing, I have been able to successfully write data there on OSX, so long as the user selected the file. However, this same application is giving me trouble in Windows 7. Even a browseForSave() doesn't seem to allow the FileStream to write to the file. Is there a workaround for this? Or at least can anyone confirm that it DOES work for them? If you know a way to accomplish this, example code would be appreciated. I've tried a few different methods to no avail. This is for an internal development tool, and for our purposes it makes more sense to have the file in the application directory rather than app storage at the moment.
