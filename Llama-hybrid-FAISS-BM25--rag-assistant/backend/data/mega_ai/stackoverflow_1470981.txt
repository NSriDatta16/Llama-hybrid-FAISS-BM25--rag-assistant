Hosting Javascript/CSS file on CDN similar to Google hosting jQuery

I am wondering if there are any hosts or if I can host my file (JS & CSS) on Google so that they are cached and load real quick (due to CDN and gzip). A number of my customers use these files and I would prefer if they could somehow include this to file to receive the JS file. Ideally with filename.js?publickey=sdfgsdfg (which will be tied to a particular domain name). The problem is that my hosting needs are very small- only about 100kb. Any suggestions? My problem is that the customers using the JS & CSS file, have no clue about gzipping content or caching (as their shared hosts do not support it), as a result causes the JS/CSS to take forever to load. Am wondering if I can leverage an existing free service, or I do not mind paying either.
