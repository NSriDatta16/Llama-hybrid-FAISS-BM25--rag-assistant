I think what you're looking for in the specific case is Enumerable.Range() . From there, if you want to you can filter the list by using Where s and such. For instance, if i wanted all the numbers from whose power of two is below 100 i'd do something like Enumerable.Range(1,100).Where(i => i * i . This is very common in functional languages like Haskell where something similar is this: filter (\i -> i * i A specific example to replace your function: Enumerable.Range(1,10).Where(x => x%2 == 1).Sum(); //add separate sum and averages here
