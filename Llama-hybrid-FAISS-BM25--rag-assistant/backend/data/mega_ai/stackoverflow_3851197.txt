While compression is certainly a viable option, you might also want consider simply serializing less. Could it be that your objects contain a lot of data that could easily be rebuilt from other data they also contain? For example, if you have attributes that are lazily build from other attributes (e.g. using Moose's lazy + builder or lazy_build ), there is not much point in storing the values of those attributes at all unless the recomputation is incredibly expensive. And even then it might be worth considering, as reading lots of data off disk isn't the fastest thing either. If you find that you want to serialize only parts of your objects, and still want to use Storable, you can define custom STORABLE_freeze and STORABLE_thaw hooks, as described in the Storable documentation. However, there's also alternative serializers available. MooseX::Storage is one of them, and happens to support many serialization backends and formats, and can also be told easily about which attributes to serialize and which to skip for that purpose.
