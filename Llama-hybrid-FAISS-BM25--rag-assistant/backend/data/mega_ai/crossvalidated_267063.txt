As other answers have mentioned, more background information on your data is needed to draw a reliable conclusion. With that being said, an R 2 value of 1 does mean that your model is potentially "too good to be true" as another answer mentioned. From your output, I am assuming that your regression is of the Ordinary Least Squares form. I would be inclined to do the following: Run a Variance Inflation Factor test on your independent variables to test for multicollinearity . This is where two or more independent variables have a strong correlation (and could be theoretically linked). Therefore, the dependent variable is accounting for the effect of this multiple times, but your R 2 value is still rising, giving an overly optimistic result. It may be the case that you need to drop certain multi-collinear variables if the theoretical nature (or lack of it) behind them justifies doing so. If your data is a time series one, then it is possible that a trend in your data is producing a high R-Squared due to high correlations between the dependent and independent variables, even when this is likely due to the trend which does not have any theoretical foundation. I would be inclined to test your model for autocorrelation (if indeed your data is time series, if not ignore this step) using a Durbin-Watson test, and if this problem is present then try first differencing the values and run the regression again. Overall, an R 2 value of 1 - while possible - indicates perfect collinearity and certainly warrants further investigation before a conclusion can be drawn.
