Finding an approximate local maximas with noisy data in Matlab

The matlab FAQ describes a one-line method for finding the local maximas: index = find( diff( sign( diff([0; x(:); 0]) ) ) But I believe this only works if the data is more or less smooth. Suppose you have data that jumps up and down in small intervals but still has some approximate local maximas. How would you go about finding these points? You could divide the vector into n pieces and find the largest value not on the edge of each but there should be a more elegant and faster solution. A one-line solution would be great, too. Edit: I'm working with noisy biological images which I am attempting to divide into distinct sections.
