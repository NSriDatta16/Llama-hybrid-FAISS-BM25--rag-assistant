Funny thing... we just implemented a jQuery Plugin that has the purpose to ease the implementation of graph editors. However, it is not officially published yet. (we use SVG by the way - we had to, was a semester project). You can try it out here . (No IE support (SVG, as mentioned), and kind of beta). You can drag the nodes from the Shape box to the canvas. To draw connectors, click on the yellow helmet in the top menu and drag a connector between two nodes. If this comes close to your requirements, feel free to have a look at the sources .
