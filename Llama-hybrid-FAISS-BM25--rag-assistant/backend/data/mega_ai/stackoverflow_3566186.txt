Actionscript 3.0 cross-project folder/package structure best practise

I'm currently looking at structuring my teams projects into a consistent manner that properly utilises packages and is easily version-controlled (via SVN). I'm interested in any 'best practise' with regards to project structuring and how to use consistent packaging without lumping everything into a gigantic com.domainname.projects folder structure whilst maintaining that package structure. I'm also keen to use the src/bin/lib folder structure within each project. I guess I'm asking 'how do you do it?' and 'why?'. Sorry if this is a bit abstract for Stack Overflow but you guys give the best answers I've found.
