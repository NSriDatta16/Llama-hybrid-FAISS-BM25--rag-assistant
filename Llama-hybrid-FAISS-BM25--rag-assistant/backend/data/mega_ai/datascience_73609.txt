It looks like there are two part to your question , You want to explore data before predicting the values to gain insights about the data which falls under Visual analytics in which EDA (Exploratory data analysis) helps. Regarding the question of choosing right kind of plot to see the distribution for categorical data please refer below links which gives a very basic understanding of choosing the right chart type. Later on you can move to reading papers on visualization. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization is a good starting point. Also I prefer reading articles on Medium papers are getting too heavy to start, few are below https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-of-graphs-for-data-visualization https://eazybi.com/blog/data_visualization_and_chart_types For this specific data I would be much more interested in seeing the count plot () of target variable and scatter plots for co- relation. Seaborn has nice feature of seeing pair plots after converting these features to numeric types as suggested in first answer. On availability of models for classification, your data comes under supervised classification problem since it has labels, there are choices like, based on probabilities (Naive Bayes), neural network, logistic regression etc. In practice we try different models, tune the parameters see the performance and do the model evaluation to see if the model is working well on unseen data, which is called generalization performance. Feel free to try libraries like Ski-Learn which gives options you to implement and see the performance of each one of it. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html#classification Specifically for Logistic regression in order to under please refer- https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/5.pdf To understand Classification in very simple words please refer- Introduction to Data Mining by Vipin kumar, MICHAEL STEINBACH, PANG-NING TAN Classification chapter is available for free.
