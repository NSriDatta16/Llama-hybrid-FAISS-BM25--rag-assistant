In my opinion you're looking into the wrong methods to solve your problem. You have strictly no numeric data. Statistics based machine learning has a very hard time with such problems. Your problem sounds more like one of the problems which should be solved with rule based systems. My first instinct would be to try to understand the rules and put them into code leading to a classification. There are however methods for learning such rule based systems based on logic. They are only quite unfashionable for machine learning today. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_system
