Unicode will be with us, in increasing quantity, for a long time. If an HTML or XML document is written in UTF-8 encoded Unicode, then you should expect any and all of these to appear. In Unicode (Unicode Character Database) the following codepoints are defined as whitespace: U+0009–U+000D (control characters, containing Tab, CR and LF) U+0020 SPACE U+0085 NEL (control character next line) U+00A0 NBSP (NO-BREAK SPACE) U+1680 OGHAM SPACE MARK U+180E MONGOLIAN VOWEL SEPARATOR U+2000–U+200A (different sorts of spaces) U+2028 LS (LINE SEPARATOR) U+2029 PS (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR) U+202F NNBSP (NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE) U+205F MMSP (MEDIUM MATHEMATICAL SPACE) U+3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE
