VAR model: many parameters, but short time series

We are wondering how many degrees of freedom are sensible in a model and if there is a rule of thumb. We have a time series of 57 periods, with 4 endogenous variables and 3 exogenous variables in a VAR model. Preferably, we would like to use a lag length of 4 (since our data is quarterly). We were wondering if that is sensible.
