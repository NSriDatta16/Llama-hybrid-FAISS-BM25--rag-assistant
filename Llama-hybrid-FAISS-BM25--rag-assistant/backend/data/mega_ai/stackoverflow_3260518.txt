The line my $garage = @_; assigns the length of @_ to garage. In the call to the testDriveCars method you pass a single arg, hence the length is one, hence your error message about "1" . You could write my ( $garage ) = @_; or perhaps my $garage = shift; instead. There's a missing semicolon in the posting too - after the assignment of @garage . See perldoc perlsub for the details.
