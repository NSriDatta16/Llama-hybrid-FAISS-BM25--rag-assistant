How to organise a php based website

I am putting my php /mysql website up and this is my scenario The users are grouped into sites each site with their own unique database. There will be about 40 users per site. the two options I'm trying to decide between are have a central website running the php and directing the users off to their own database using sub domains for each user each with their own php in htdocs I dont even know if 2 is possible/stupid but if it was, would it make any difference to performance as they're all being run by the same server. Any other ideas/ advice much appreciated as I want to organise it the best way from the start
