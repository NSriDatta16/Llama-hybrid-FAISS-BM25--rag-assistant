XgBoost often does better than Logistic Regression. I would use CatBoost when I have a lot of categorical features or if I do not have the time for tuning hyperparameters. You should invest time in a boosting model for sure (they will always take more time than Logistic Regression) because it is worth it. If you are impatient, try CatBoost instead of XgBoost to see the improvement in accuracy. That will definitely give you the motivation to spend more time tuning your boosted trees.
