What is the use of the variable importance in a classification problem which use Random Forst, XGBoost or other Decision Tree models?

When someone uses a RF, XGBoost or other Decision Tree model for a classification problem, what would you do with the calculated variable importance (that most algorithms provide)? Would you use it in a way to prune the tree (for data-volume reasons) or if the model performs well you just neglect it? To me it seems weird to compute the model, use the variable importance options and use the same model/algorithm for your classification model..., how weird are these steps to build a model?
