Achieving such accuracy is hard but not impossible, especially when you test your model in real life to see if the model can achieve the same accuracy or not. Here are some tips that help to improve your model accuracy: 1- Change the algorithm that you used to train your model, for example, if you use a traditional machine learning algorithm like SVM, try using one of the deep learning algorithms such as CNN. 2- Obtain more data, change the quality of your data, do augmentation for your data, do some pre-processing on your data, or try other pre-processing techniques if you did already.
