BulkInsertCommand failed in Sync Framework 2.1

On occasion I get the following error when trying to synchronize from SQL Express to SQL Server using Sync Framework 2.1. Once a client gets this error they have to reinitialize the scope. There can't be anything wrong with the syntax like the error states because it runs no problem for long periods of time (with inserts happening). Any thoughts? 11:18:21 AM Failed to execute the command 'BulkInsertCommand' for table 'XXX'; the transaction was rolled back.
