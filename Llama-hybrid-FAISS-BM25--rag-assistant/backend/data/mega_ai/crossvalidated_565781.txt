Interpreting mediation effects on survival outcome using the mediation package in R

I am interested in performing a mediation analysis using R's mediation package. I am fitting the following two models: mod.y And I get the following output: Causal Mediation Analysis Quasi-Bayesian Confidence Intervals Estimate 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper p-value ACME (control) 0.5964 0.3212 0.90 I know how to interpret this table with continuous/binary responses in my outcome model, but am unsure as to what exactly these effects mean in the context of a survival model. For example, is ADE (control) the expected average direct effect on years lived in the control arm, had they switched to the treated arm? (i.e., are the units of the Estimate here time lived?).
