After researching this a bit, my instinct is to say that this is just buzz speak for saying that we need to have a platform-indpendent way to pass messages back and forth You are correct, partially because the term ESB is always nice word that fits well with another buzzword, legitimate or not - which is governance (i.e. helps you manage who is accessing your endpoints and reporting metrics - Metrics btw is what all the suits like to see, so that may be a contributor) Another reason they might want a platform neutral device is so that any services they consume are always exposed as endpoints from a central location, instead of a specific machine resource. The ESB makes the actual physical endpoints of your services irrelevant to them, which they shouldn't care much about anyway, but that enables you to move services around however they will only consume the ESB Endpoint. Apart from a centralized repository for Discovery , an ESB also makes side by side versioning of services easier. If I had a choice and my company had the budget, we would have purchased IBM's x150 appliance :( Thirdly, a lot of more advanced buses, like SoftwareAG's product if I recall, is natively able to expose legacy data, like from data sitting on main frames as services without the need for coding via adapters I don't know if their intent is to leverage all the benefits an ESB provides, or as you said, make it buzzword compliant.
