You can find trunk FNH builds here: http://hornget.net/packages/orm/fluentnhibernate/fluentnhibernate-trunk (I haven't tried it as I don't use Fluent) NHibernate 3.0 is pretty stable and the new Linq provider is very good, with an excelent coverage of the possible Linq constructs and clever, non-intrusive support of NHibernate specific concerns ( caching , fetching ) I'd use it in production without much concern; being in a "pre-alpha" state only reflects the seriousness of the project team, as the current state is more similar to that of a Visual Studio RC than a CTP or Beta. Update (2010-12-05) : NHibernate 3 was released yesterday.
