Python truncate lines as they are read

I have an application that reads lines from a file and runs its magic on each line as it is read. Once the line is read and properly processed, I would like to delete the line from the file. A backup of the removed line is already being kept. I would like to do something like file = open('myfile.txt', 'rw+') for line in file: processLine(line) file.truncate(line) This seems like a simple problem, but I would like to do it right rather than a whole lot of complicated seek() and tell() calls. Maybe all I really want to do is remove a particular line from a file. After spending far to long on this problem I decided that everyone was probably right and this it just not a good way to do things. It just seemed so elegant solution. What I was looking for was something akin to a FIFO that would just let me pop lines out of a file.
