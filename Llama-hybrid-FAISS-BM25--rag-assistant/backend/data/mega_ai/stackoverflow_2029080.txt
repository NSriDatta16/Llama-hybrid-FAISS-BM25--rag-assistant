I have not personally been required to find a solution to this, but one way to tackle this (from an SAAS perspective) would be to prefix the username with an organizational identifier (presuming unique organizations). For example: subdomain.yoursite.com would equate to a user with the username: subdomain_username. You would just have to code some business logic on login to a subdomain to tack that onto the username.
