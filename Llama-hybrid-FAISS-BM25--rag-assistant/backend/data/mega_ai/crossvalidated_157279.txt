Of the $5! = 120$ distinct sequences that can be formed of those five numbers, $4\times 2!\times 3! = 48$ of them will have the small values $41.9$ and $32.2$ next to each other. (There are four places for this pair to occur, $2!$ ways of ordering them, and $3!$ ways to order the other three numbers.) Yet another $2! \times 3! = 12$ sequences will alternate between a high value in $\{102.6, 110.2, 113.3\}$ and a low value in $\{32.2, 41.9\}$. Another $2! \times 3! = 12$ will bracket the three high values with a low value on either end. I have enumerated $72$ so far, which is $60\%$ of all the possible sequences. Thus, depending on what kinds of patterns might catch your notice (which is a matter for your psychologist to explore), the total number of such "clearly something significant" sequences could easily be more frequent than sequences that do not clearly have something significant! From this we may draw two conclusions: Not a single one of these patterns is rare enough to be considered "statistically significant" at a conventional ($5\%$, or $6/120$) level. Any conclusion about "significance" derived after recognizing a "clear, significant" pattern when exploring dataset must be considered subjective. (This is not to say such conclusions are without value. It only maintains that statistics, correctly applied, will not sanctify the conclusions of an open-ended exploratory analysis with any level of "significance," because it cannot.) Such quantitative reasoning leads generally to the following statistico-psychological metatheorem: In any collection of random patterns, the majority will be unusual. Those of you familiar with Garrison Keillor may recognize an echo of the Lake Wobegon population: "... and all the children are above average." However, I privately refer to this as the Shirley MacLaine principle, in honor of her well-known work as a "spiritual missionary," a seer of things and causes that do not exist.
