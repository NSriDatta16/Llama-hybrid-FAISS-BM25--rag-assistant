Finding the right joint distribution

I'm starting a research on Multi-Object-Tracking, the current state-of-the-art real-time methods have a detector that outputs a bounding_box and an embedding vector: $$ e \in \mathbb{R}^n $$ When a new target is found the embedding is saved and a new Kalman filter is created and together they form a tracker . Each frame the the detections and the trackers are matched in the following manner: the embedding distance (i.e. cosine distance) and the Mahalanobis distance(Kalman to bounding box) are measured between all the trackers and detections. the distances are merged using a simple blending: $$d = \lambda e + (1- \lambda) m ; \lambda \in [0,1] $$ what I'm trying to investigate is to what is the proper representation of these two distances (if I can do any thing to improve their performance). what I reached so far is that there is some correlation between these values: $$ \rho_{x,y} = \frac{E[ (x - \mu_x) (y - \mu_y)^T]} {(\sigma_x \sigma_y)} = 0.23$$ the histograms: How should I approach this problem?
