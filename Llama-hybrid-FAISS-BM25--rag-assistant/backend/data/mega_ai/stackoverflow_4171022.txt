Yes, you can write to gl_FragData, which is an array of outputs (size depends on your implementation). Or with newer versions of GL, both gl_FragColor and gl_FragData are deprecated and you declare your own out variables for the fragment shader to write to. Declare multiple such out vars for multiple output buffers.
