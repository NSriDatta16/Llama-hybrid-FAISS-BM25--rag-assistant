Bias-Variance Tradeoff with SVMs

I know that larger values of C in SVM cause the classifier to attempt to classify more points at the expense of a wider margin (and vice versa for smaller values of C). Therefore, is it correct to say that, in terms of a bias-variance tradeoff, larger values of C increase the variance and decrease the bias of the model?
