A Bayesian Network, by definition, is a collection of random variables $\{X_n: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\}$ and a graph $G$ such that the probability function $P(X_1,...,X_n)$ factors as conditional probabilities in a way determined by $G$. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_graph . Most importantly the factors in the Bayesian Network are of the form $P(X_i| X_{j_1},..,X_{j_n})$. A factor graph, even though it is more general, is the same in that it is a graphical way to keep information about the factorization of $P(X_1,...,X_n)$ or any other function. The difference is that when a Bayesian network is converted to a factor graph the factors in the factor graph are grouped. For example, one factor in the factor graph may be $P(X_i| X_{j_1},..,X_{j_n})P(X_{j_n})P(X_{j_1}) = P(X_i| X_{j_2},..,X_{j_{n-1}})$. The original Bayesian network stored this as three factors but the factor graph stores it only as one factor. In general, the factor graph of a Bayesian network keeps tracks of fewer factorizations than the original Bayesian network did.
