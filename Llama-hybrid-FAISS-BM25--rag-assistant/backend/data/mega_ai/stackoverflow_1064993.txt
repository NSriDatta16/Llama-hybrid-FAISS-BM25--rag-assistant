If you really want to go crazy but want things to at least be slightly familiar (I know that sounds like a contradiction but it's true), look at F#. It's a type-inferred language but it supports a lot of dynamic type properties. It's a functional language built on top of the CLR so you get full use of the .Net object system which is cool. Because it's a functional language, there are enough novel concepts to really work your brain. If you really want to go for "biggest departure", Clojure might be of interest. It's a Lisp dialect built on the JVM. It's getting some pretty serious attention both in the Java and Lisp world. It might suit your purposes.
