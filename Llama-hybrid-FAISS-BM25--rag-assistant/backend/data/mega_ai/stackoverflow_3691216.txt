In Yii controller

I'm newbie and learning Yii framework where Im designing first small application and got stuck on this position where I need your attention as your guys are guru. I have a 'City name' list on main layout in header section where a user select a 'City' then I would like to pass that City_id to 'PostController' and search for that city post and display the last Postonly. Any idea how to handle this. I look forward to hear from you guys soon and will appreciated an early reply. Khan
