Benchmark data sets for anomaly detection algorithms in multivariate time series

as per title, which datasets are commonly used to benchmark novel methods to detect anomalies in multivariate time series? I'm particularly interested in moderately high-dimensional (10-40 components), very long time series (preferably, from 10^4 to 10^6 samples).
