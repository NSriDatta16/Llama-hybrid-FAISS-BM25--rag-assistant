Reason behind performing dot product on Convolutional Neural networks

I was recently exploring CNNs and came to know that initial step consists of multiplying pixels of the input image with the corresponding value in the kernel(dot product of kernel and input image). What exactly is the reason or intuition behind multiplying individual pixel value and why not add or subtract or divide ?
