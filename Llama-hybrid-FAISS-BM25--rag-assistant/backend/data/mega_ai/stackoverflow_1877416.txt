GOCR seems to be a good choice at first, but from what I can tell from my own "research", quality isn't quite sufficient for daily use. Maybe this could lead to a problem, depending on the image input. If it doesn't work out for you, try the "new" feature of Google Docs, which allows you to upload images for OCR. You can then retrieve the results using some google api ( there are tons out there, I'm using gdata-ruby-util which requires some hacking, though. You could also use tesseract-ocr for the OCR part, it's also open source and in active development. For the retrieval part, I would as well stick with hpricot, super-powerful and flexible.
