Is there a way to embed curves into smaller vectors?

I know about embeddings for words, but I would like to know if it is possible to do something similar for curves. What I mean by curves is a curve of a function. Say I have 1000 points corresponding to a curve for 0% to 100% every 0.1 and I would like to use this in a ML model but I don't want to use those 1000 points, but rather embedded them into a smaller vector so that two curves that are 'close' will have a vector closer. I don't know if I explained myself clearly, so tell me if it is not the case ! Note : I would like to do this in Python
