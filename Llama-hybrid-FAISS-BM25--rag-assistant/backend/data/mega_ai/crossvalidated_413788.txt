how we can constraints in dual of lagrangian?

I am confused about the general rule of Lagrangian multiplier. (which usully use for SVM). I could not find a good book or paper that explain it completely and clearly. Suppose we have $$minimize: w^{2}$$ Subject to $$f(x) \leq 0$$ Lagragian multiplier say we can solve the following $$min : \; \; w^{2}+\lambda f(x) $$ subject to $$ \lambda \geq 0$$ Then we solve gradian equations and substitute back in Lagrangian. 1- how we make sure the solution satisfy f(x) 2- what is extra constraints in dual representation?
