(Ruby,Rails) Multiple simultaneous drag-and-drop items...?

I'm looking for a mechanism in Rails by which to facilitate multiple drag-and-drop items simultaneously. Basically I want to select multiple and drag. Obviously I'd prefer to stick with standard HTML items and javascript, but if this isn't possible I'll consider a straightforward Flash implementation. Thoughts?
