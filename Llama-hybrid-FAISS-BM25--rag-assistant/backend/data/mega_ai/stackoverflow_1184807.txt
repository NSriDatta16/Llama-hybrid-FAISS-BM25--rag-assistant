To read .doc files you can use the structured storage API . A .doc is basically a structured storage repository with various streams corresponding to the various parts of the document. Be warned that it is quite a hairy API and that even using this API, a .doc file can be quite messy to look at. Ofcouse this is still windows only but atleast it's not COM. just a plain old C API.
