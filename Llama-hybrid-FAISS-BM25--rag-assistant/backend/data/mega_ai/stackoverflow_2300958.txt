How to organize files in the filesystem for an upload-type site?

I'm wondering if there are any best practices for organizing files on the filesystem for a site that centers around users uploading files. (Not a hosting site like Imageshack, more like addons.mozilla.org) Or am I over-analyzing this and should put everything in one folder?
