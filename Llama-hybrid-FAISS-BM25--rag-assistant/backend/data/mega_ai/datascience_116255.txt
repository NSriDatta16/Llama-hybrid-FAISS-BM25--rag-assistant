preprocess unbalanced skewed data

I am trying to find a way to preprocess my data. The data is as follow: study person_id energy_1 energy_2 y study_id A 2.3 -1.05 1 study_id2 B 1.03 0.04 0 Statistically speaking, we can see that for each study, the value of energy_1 and energy_2 brings a lot of value to determine wether the person is 0 or 1 in the y column: We can mostly only use them to make the prediction. But when we are using the whole dataset and mixing the studies together, the model used (a binary XGBoost classifier) is no longer able to properly predict the label. Can you give hints on how to preprocess/transform my data so that the model could react properly independently of the study? I am aware that XGBoost do not need normalized data.
