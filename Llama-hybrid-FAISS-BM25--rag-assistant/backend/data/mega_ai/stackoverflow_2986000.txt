I have a good "poster child" (I like this term) for you. I assume, you have never seen it before, but you've probably heard it. I think, almost all the modern digital syntehisers and samplers have some kind of dataflow architecture inside. Let me tell you how they work. I'm not sure if Roland JV-1080 was the first, but it was the most famous synth with 4-layer sound generator scheme. When you press a key on the keyboard, a Patch is starting. It consist of 1..4 sound generator. A sound generator is a line of components: oscillator, filter, envelope, amp. JV-1080 is able to play 64 sound generator at a time. The active sound generators' output goes into the effect configuration. The sound generator path is "hardwired", you can select the entry points of the effect bus, and amounts. Roland JV-1080's effect bus have 4 entry points: dry, custom effect, choir, reverb, and there is the main output. The effect bus is fixed, but all the effects' output is wired to all other effects, which is standing rightmost to it, so you can "delete connection" between them by setting the amount to zero. Alesis QS series (QuadraSynth, QS6-7-8-R and x.1 versions) have near some sound architecture, and the effect system is similar... except, that you can choose one from the 3 FX configuration. One FX config is for organs (QS have incredible Leslie emulation): Leslie, Choir, Reverb; another FX config has two Reverbs. You have more freedom on how to utilize the horsepower of the gear. These synths are great, but you will forget them, as you meet Clavia Nord Modular . It has no 4-layer architecture, nor FX configs. It comes with a win32 program, a dataflow editor. There are various components: oscillators, filters, envelope generators etc., and you can draw your configuration. You should draw a traditional 4-layer sound generator, but you can even draw a 99-layer one, if you want. It just simply rocks. (Has to say, that DF is not everything: Roland JV has 44.1 kHz sample freq, QS has 48k, Modular has 96k.) Clavia have anoter line of their synths: Nord Lead. There are Modular's engine inside (the parameters and the sound is the very same), but you can't use the dataflow programmer for that models. They have a fixed path, with plenty of parameters, but you can't change the route. Also, there are Nord Lead patch-set for Modular: all the pathces looks same in the editor, only paremeter varies. Here's a Modular patch example http://www.clavia.se/pictures/nordmodular/patchwindowlarge.jpg If you are not statisfied by the synth example, say, because you're C programmer, here is another, which is more familiar: make -j It was surprise to me, that make is a dataflow system, so it can run "components" simultaneously, which means faster compiling on multi-core machines. Try it!
