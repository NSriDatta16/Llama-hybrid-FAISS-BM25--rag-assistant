Why do we take +1. -1 for support vector hyperplane in SVM?

In the SVM, we have 3 hyperplanes , one for separating positive class and negative class The other two lying on the support vectors. In the figure - The equation of hyperplanes lying on support vectors is given as $w.x + b = 1$ and $w.x + b = -1$ Why do we choose +1 and -1 as their values , It means that from the decision boundary the hyperplanes lying on the support vectors have 1 unit distance (perpendicular from the x-axis). So the length of the margin is fixed. So how can we maximize it if the margin is fixed?
