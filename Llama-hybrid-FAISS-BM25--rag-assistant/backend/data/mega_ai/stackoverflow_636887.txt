Unable to make each sentence to start at a new line in LaTex by AWK/Python

I have a long document in LaTex, which contains paragraphs. The paragraphs contain sentences such that no subsequent sentence start at a new line. How can you make each subsequent sentence to start at a new line in my .tex file? My attempt to the problem We need to put \n to the end of Sentence B where Sentence B has Sentence A before it. We must not put \n to the situations where there are the mark \ . I see that the problem can be solved by AWK and Python.
