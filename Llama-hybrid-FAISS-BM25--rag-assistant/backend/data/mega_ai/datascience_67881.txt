Machine Learning - How to predict set of fixed fields based on past features

I have quite a large dataset (> 100k rows), which contains information for logistical shipments. (export shipments) The dataset looks like this: |shipper|consignee |origin|destination | |-------|-----------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------| |6409292|288882 |USSFO |CNPVG | |6409292|288882 |USSFO |CNPVG | |6409292|182724 |USSFO |HKHKG | |6409292|182724 |USSFO |HKHKG | |8201922|948292 |USSFO |FRCDG | |8201922|948292 |USSFO |FRCDG | |8201922|948292 |USSFO |FRNIC | |8201922|291222 |USEWR |AEDXB | So what we have here is a list of past shipments. It shows the relationship between shipper and consignee, and from where the shipment was from and where it was sent to. Based on this past data, I wish to be able to predict when a new shipment is added by looking at the consignee code and origin . Example Take below new booking as an example: |shipper|consignee |origin|destination | |-------|-----------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------| |1234567|948292 |USMOB |? | How can I train a model to predict the destination ? And what is this area in ML referred to?
