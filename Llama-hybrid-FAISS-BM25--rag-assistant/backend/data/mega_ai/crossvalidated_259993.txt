Why would Quadratic Program in SVM not work for very large or very small lambda?

I am wondering why Quadratic Program in SVM gives inversion error when I take $\lambda$ to be really small. $\lambda$ is really only changing the upper bound for the argument so I do not see how an inversion error would arise. I used ipop in kernlab and solve.QP in quadprog. If anything, a smaller $\lambda$ should make the problem easier because it is equivalent to making the range of the argument smaller.
