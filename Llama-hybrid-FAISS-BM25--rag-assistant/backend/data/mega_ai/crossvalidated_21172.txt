Nonparametric credible intervals

I have a small ( n â‰ˆ 15) IID sample from a continuous distribution that I have no reason to believe (a priori or a posteriori) belongs to a familiar parametric family. I do know a priori that the distribution is bounded, and I know its bounds, but that's about all I know. I'd like to construct 95% credible intervals for the population mean and standard deviation. I'm at a loss as to how to do this because it appears that credible intervals require a posterior PDF, which requires a likelihood function, which requires a parametric model. The term "nonparametric Bayes" seems to refer to techniques that use a parametric model whose number of parameters is allowed to grow with the sample size. I don't think that's what I want. I can imagine using something like the set of all piecewise linear functions with integral 1 and n pieces as a parametric model, but a bit of preliminary work in this direction makes me think it would be very messy. If what I want here isn't really possible, then what would a conscientious Bayesian do in my situation? Is there perhaps a way to frame the problem so that I can say that I'm 95% sure the population mean is in some 95% confidence interval?
