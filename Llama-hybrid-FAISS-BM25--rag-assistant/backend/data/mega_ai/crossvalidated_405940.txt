A default answer for getting a CI for a quantity you do not have a simple CI-formula for is to bootstrap. You repeatedly draw the total number of records with replacement from your data and then you calculate the metric of interest on each of these bootstrapped datasets. With this list of calculated metrics you calculate a bootstrap confidence interval. For fraction correction, sensitivity and specificity, any method for getting a binomial CI will also do just fine. For the F1 score this is not as simple. You come close to the bootstrap CI, if you use the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of a beta distribution with parameters F1 score*(TP+FP+FN) and (1-F1 score)*(TP+FP+FN) (or perhaps adding 1/3 or 1/2 to each of these). That is motivated by taking a Bayesian approach with very vague priors.
