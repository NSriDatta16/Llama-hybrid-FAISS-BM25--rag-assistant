Is Regression objective in XGBoost invariant to feature attributes' scaling?

I am relatively new to using XGBoost. Classification problems clearly don't get affected by the feature scaling as the new splits would take care of that. But when doing regression in XGBoost, aren't we 'fitting', say, a linear regression (objective "reg:linear" in xgboost) model at some step? If so, that step might fail if the feature attributes involved aren't of similar variance. Is it or is it not?
