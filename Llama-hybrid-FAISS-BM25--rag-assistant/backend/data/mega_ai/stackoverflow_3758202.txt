You can compute the value of the number modulo 7. That is, for each digit d and value n so far compute n = (10 * n + d) % 7. This has the advantage of working independently of the divisor 7 or the base 10. I solved this problem exactly the same way on one of programming contests. Here is the fragment of code you need: int sum = 0; while (true) { char ch; cin>>ch; if (ch '9') break; // Reached the end of stdin sum = sum*10; // The previous sum we had must be multiplied sum += (int) ch; sum -= (int) '0'; // Remove the code to get the value of the digit sum %= 7; } if (sum==0) cout This code is working thanks to simple rules of modular arithmetics. It also works not just for 7, but for any divisor actually.
