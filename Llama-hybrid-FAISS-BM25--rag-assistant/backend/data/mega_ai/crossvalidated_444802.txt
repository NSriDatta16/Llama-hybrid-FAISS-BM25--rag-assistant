Multigroup multinomial logistic regression in R?

I am using multinomial logistic regression (nnet package in R) to predict a categorical outcome (four categories) with three independent variables. As my data come from different countries, instead of using a pooled sample, I would like to run multi-group multinomial logistic regression and check if the effects are different across countries. Is it possible to run multi-group multinomial logistic regression in R? I know this is possible in MPlus, but I was not successful in finding a way to do it in R. Thank you
