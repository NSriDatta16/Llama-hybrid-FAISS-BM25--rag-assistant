Get Continuous Distribution from Discrete Variable: Problem 6.77 of Wackerly, Mendenhall, Schaeffer, 5th Ed

Problem Statement: $\newcommand{\szdp}[1]{\!\left(#1\right)}$ Let $v$ denote the volume of a three-dimensional figure. Let $Y$ denote the number of particles observed in volume $v,$ and assume that $Y$ has a Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda v.$ The particles might represent pollution particles in air, bacteria in water, or stars in the heavens. If a point is chosen at random within the volume $v,$ show that the distance $R$ to the nearest particle has the probability density function given by $$f(r)= \begin{cases} 4\lambda\pi r^2 e^{-(4/3)\lambda\pi r^3},&r>0\\ 0,&\text{elsewhere.} \end{cases} $$ My Answer So Far: We will work from the density, and imagine a sphere around a single particle. Note that the distribution info for $Y$ is \begin{align*} p(y)&=\frac{(\lambda v)^ye^{-\lambda v}}{y!},\; y=0,1,2,\dots \end{align*} This is a discrete distribution. Now the density of particles is given by $\rho=Y/v,$ measured in particles per length unit cubed. Now let's take a sphere of radius $s$ and determine how many particles $n$ are in the sphere. We would have $$n=\rho\szdp{\frac{4\pi s^3}{3}}.$$ What we want to do now is shrink the sphere down until, on average, it has only one particle in it. So we could set $n=1,\;s=r,$ and solve for $r:$ \begin{align*} 1&=\rho\szdp{\frac{4\pi r^3}{3}}\\ \frac{v}{Y}\cdot\frac{3}{4\pi}&=r^3\\ \sqrt[3]{\frac{3v}{4\pi Y}}&=r. \end{align*} Now here's the difficulty: $Y$ is discrete, but $r$ is continuous. My Question: The method of distribution functions, the method of transformations, and the method of moment-generating functions either seem not to apply or don't look like they would work. (The target distribution is a Weibull, for which the mgf does not exist.) Is my approach sound? If so, what's the next step? If not, what's a better approach?
