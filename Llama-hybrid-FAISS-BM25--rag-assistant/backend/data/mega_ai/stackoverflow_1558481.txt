self-taught compiler courses / good introductory compiler books?

Does anyone know of online course / university lectures that comprise a typical compiler course? I've had theory of computing but unfortunately my school didn't offer a course in compiler construction. I know there are lectures out there; I was hoping for recommendations for particularly good offerings. Also, are there books for newbies to the field? Something besides the dragon book, at least. Beginners level is fine, I know there are a lot of intermediate-advanced texts on the market. Thanks!
