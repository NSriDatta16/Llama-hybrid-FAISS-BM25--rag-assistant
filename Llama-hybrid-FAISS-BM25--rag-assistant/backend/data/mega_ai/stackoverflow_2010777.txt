You're about to go down the "skintone detection" path of preventing porn. This is a mistake since any solution, even if possible, will be hideously expensive to get right. And wouldn't work on porn images of the character from "Avatar", for example :-) The two approaches you could take (I prefer the first). Don't allow immediate publishing of those images until they've been cleared by a trusted party. Allow your users to mark them as offensive and check out the ones that get votes. The reason I prefer the first is because the second still allows the images to be seen by the general public and this will almost certainly damage the company rep. You should take that rep seriously. I am reminded of a system we set up many years ago to measure water skiing jump lengths. There were three stations on either side of the river where the people tasked to measure would point their sights at where they thought the skier landed (hexangulation, I guess). These six locations were basically averaged (after removing outliers) to get the actual position (hence length) and this was all calculated by the computer and sent back to a base station. However, the TV stations which were transmitting the event had a person read the length off the screen and then manually type them into their own computers. When told that we could automate the process, they made it clear that they would not allow unchecked data to be sent to their viewers (in case we inserted profanity, I guess). While I thought this a little paranoid, I could understand it.
