disallow certain url in robots.txt

We implemented a rating system on a site a while back that involves a link to a script. However, with the vast majority of ratings on the site at 3/5 and the ratings very even across 1-5 we're beginning to suspect that search engine crawlers etc. are getting through. The urls used look like this: http://www.thesite.com/path/to/the/page/rate?uid=abcdefghijk&value=3 When we started we add the following to our robots.txt: User-agent: * Disallow: /rate Is this incorrect or are googlebot and others simply ignoring our robots.txt?
