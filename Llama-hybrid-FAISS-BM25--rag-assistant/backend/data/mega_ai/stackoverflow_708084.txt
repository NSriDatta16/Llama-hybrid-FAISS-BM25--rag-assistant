Would bridgehead ( archive ) as a separator between paragraphs, work? For example, ** * ** . This appears to be what I want. In reading the DocBook documentation for the bridgehead element, I see that DocBook isn't so much designed to do old-fashioned, non-hierarchical layouts. Some documents, usually legacy documents, use headings that are not tied to the normal sectional hieararchy. These headings may be represented in DocBook with the bridgehead element. Bridge heads may also be useful in fiction or journalistic works that don't have a nested hierarchy. But such legacy documents are at least supported. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!
