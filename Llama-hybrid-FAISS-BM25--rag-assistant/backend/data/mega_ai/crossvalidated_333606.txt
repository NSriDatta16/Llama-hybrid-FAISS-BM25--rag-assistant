First of all, dataset is too small to forecast future value. If you have more information about the sales volume(Such that trend can be seen), then you can use ARIMA model. ARIMA model is used for doing time-series foresting, you need to tune the model with historical dataset and after tuning ARIMA forecasts future values. For this you need to find suitable parameter of ARIMA model(p,d and q). If you have some significant data, then you need to plot graphs from your data. You'll need to plot ACF (Auto Correlation Function) and PACF (Partial ACF), which shows the correlation between observations of a time series separated by k time units (lags). Means after how much time the pattern is repeated. So, based on ACF and PACF plots, you can decide parameters(p,d and q) of ARIMA model (From PACF plot decide q and from ACF plot decide q). There are good tutorials available for this. Python and R has library for the ARIMA model.
