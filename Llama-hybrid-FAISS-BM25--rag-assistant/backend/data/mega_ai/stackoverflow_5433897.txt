Django: Django QuerySet with Date SELECT working erratically

Up until a couple days ago I have been using the following query succesfully. The following query has always returned the data it was supposed to return: try: totals = MyObject.objects.get(date=report_date) except MyObject.DoesNotExist: return HttpResponse('Could not find totals from %s' % (report_date)) A couple days ago this query began returning an empty QuerySet, even though data Does exist for the day I am requesting. I am getting the date from report_date = date.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d') or from a form if request.method == 'POST': form = DateForm(request.POST) if form.is_valid: report_date = request.POST['date'] The Model is simple datefield() class MyObject(models.Model): """Total numbers for a specific day""" date = models.DateField() ... remaining fields ... I have verified through the shell that there is in fact data for todays date in TotalTransactions. I have been using this code for months with no problem. I made a work around yesterday by querying totals = MyObject.objects.get(date__gte=report_date, date__lte=report_date) but this morning it no longer worked!! This morning I then tried the original query of date=report_date and that worked! So my question is: Has anyone had this problem before?? Can anyone see something in my code that i am missing? Any suggestions on more workarounds? I appreciate your time.
