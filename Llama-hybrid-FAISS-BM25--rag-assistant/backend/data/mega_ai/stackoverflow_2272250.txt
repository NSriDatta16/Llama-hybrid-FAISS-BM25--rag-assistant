I don't know about elegant, but depending on (a) some machines can be set to not respond to pings as a potential DoS attack and (b) what kind of access you have to the machine, perhaps a PowerShell script can be of use. PowerShell can be used on an intranet to determine if a machine is powered on, determine state of various machine services, access SQL databases on that machine, bring up/down application services, etc. Again, depending on what you need to do, C# may not be the right tool for the job.
