target variable prediction among possible answers

I have a dataset on which I would like to apply a Machine Learning algorithm for multi-class classification. An example of my target variable (in string format, will be later OneHotEncode -d): | target | +-------------------+ | (Mike, Michael) | | (Anne, Annabelle) | | (Joe, Joseph) | | (Mark, ) | | (Aaron, ) | +-------------------+ I want to have a model that, for example, predicts Joseph but does not consider it wrong because it is one of the two possible answers. Is this a multi-class or multi-label problem? Can the two definitions go alongside or is it one or the other? I am a bit confused, though I propend towards the latter. In case my guess was correct, would it be sufficient to just pick one of the models that supports multi-label classification, fit() it and score() it?
