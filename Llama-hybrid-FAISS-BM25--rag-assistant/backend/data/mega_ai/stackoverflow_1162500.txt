Multiple users accessing certificate file at a time

This is kind of not a question, but need a clarification. Here is the code. All this code is doing is sending sending a cer file to server in httpwebrequest which is placed on a local drive. My question is, what happens if multiple users try to access the application at a time. I mean 5-10 requests reading the same cer at a time. will it break saying that the cer file is locked by some other thread to read/or will it not break because it's just read only? //You must change the path to point to your .cer file location. X509Certificate Cert = X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFile("C:\\mycert.cer"); // Handle any certificate errors on the certificate from the server. ServicePointManager.CertificatePolicy = new CertPolicy(); // You must change the URL to point to your Web server. HttpWebRequest Request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("https://YourServer/sample.asp"); Request.ClientCertificates.Add(Cert); Request.UserAgent = "Client Cert Sample"; Request.Method = "GET"; HttpWebResponse Response = (HttpWebResponse)Request.GetResponse(); // Print the repsonse headers. Console.WriteLine("{0}",Response.Headers); Console.WriteLine(); // Get the certificate data. StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(Response.GetResponseStream(), Encoding.Default); int count; char [] ReadBuf = new char[1024]; do { count = sr.Read(ReadBuf, 0, 1024); if (0 != count) { Console.WriteLine(new string(ReadBuf)); } }while(count > 0);
