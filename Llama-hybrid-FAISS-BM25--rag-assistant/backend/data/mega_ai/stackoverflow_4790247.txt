Do you just need something that's thread-safe or something that scales well? If you don't need very high performance in your PRNG, you can just wrap a lock around uses of the rng object. For higher performance, you need to find or write a parallel pseudorandom number generator -- http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mhoemmen/cs194/Tutorials/prng.pdf has a tutorial on them. One option would be to put your mt19937 objects in thread-local storage, making sure to seed different threads with different seeds; that makes reproducing the same results in different runs difficult, if that's important to you.
