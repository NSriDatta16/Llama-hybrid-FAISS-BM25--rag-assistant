Get product link from Magento API

I am new to Magento and using their API. I need to be able to get the product url from the API call. I see that I can access the url_key and url_path, but unfortunately that's not necessarily what the URL for the product is (ie it may be category/my-product-url.html) where url_key would contain my-product-url and url_path would only contain my-product-url.html. Further complicating things, it may even be /category/sub-category/my-product-url.html. So, how would I get the full url with the category and everything as it is setup in the url rewrite information? Seems like this should come with the product information from the product.info api call but it doesn't.
