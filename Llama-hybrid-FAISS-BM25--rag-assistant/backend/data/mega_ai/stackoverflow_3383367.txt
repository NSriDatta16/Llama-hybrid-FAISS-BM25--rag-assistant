How to send a cookie along with HttpGet in Java

I am trying to send a cookie along with my HttpGet request, but everytime I try I havent been able to successfully send it. I also tried to modify the headers directly, here is my code: DefaultHttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient(); CookieStore store = new BasicCookieStore(); store.addCookie(MyCookieStorageClass.getCookie()); httpClient.setCookieStore(store); HttpGet httpGet = new HttpGet("http://localhost/); try { // Execute HTTP Get Request HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httpGet); String responseData = ResponseHandler.getResponseBody(response); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
