DateTime2 vs DateTime in SQL Server

Which one: datetime datetime2 is the recommended way to store date and time in SQL Server 2008+? I'm aware of differences in precision (and storage space probably), but ignoring those for now, is there a best practice document on when to use what, or maybe we should just use datetime2 only?
