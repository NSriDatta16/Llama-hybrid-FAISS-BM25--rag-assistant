Shifting mysql database values from a couple of columns to rows of entries

Easier to describe by showing a simplified view of the existing data structure and the desired result... CURRENTLY... Element Response ElementType ElementNumber EntryVal.1 1234.56 EntryVal 1 EntryDes.1 'Current Value' EntryDes 1 EntryVal.2 4321.0 EntryVal 2 EntryDes.2 'Another Value' EntryDes 2 EntryVal.3 6543.21 EntryVal 3 EntryDes.3 'Final Value' EntryDes 3 DESIRED... Name Value Current Value 1234.56 Another Value 4321.0 Final Value 6543.21 (split element column into ElementType and ElementNumber column in the hopes it might help) Have tried various sub-selects but have not found the secret. Could do some looping in PHP but hope there is a more elegant sole single MySQL query approach. There is other columns like location involved so trying to keep it clean.
