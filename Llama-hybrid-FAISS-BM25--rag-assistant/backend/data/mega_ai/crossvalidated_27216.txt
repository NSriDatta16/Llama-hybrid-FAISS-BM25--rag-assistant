I think your bigger issue is actually not census v. sample (and for that, see my comment) but the appropriate way to compare proportions. I'd drop any idea of approximating to normal and use logistic regression, treating the households as trials and those with toilets as a success. Breaking your nice proportion data into categories is a shame as you lose a lot of information.
