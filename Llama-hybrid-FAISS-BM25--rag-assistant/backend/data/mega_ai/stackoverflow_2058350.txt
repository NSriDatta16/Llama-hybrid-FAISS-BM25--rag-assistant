You should take a copy of Robert Pickering's "Beginning F#". The chapter 13, "Parsing Text", contains an example with FsLex and FsYacc , as suggested by Noldorin. Other than that, in the same book, chapter 12, the author explains how to build an actual simple compiler for an arithmetic language he proposes. Very enlightening. The most important part is what you are looking for: the AST parser . Good luck.
