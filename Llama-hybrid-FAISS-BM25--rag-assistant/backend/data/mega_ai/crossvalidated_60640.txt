How to analyse a risk assessment questionnaire where each risk is rated for both probability and impact?

I would like your opinion on how to analyze a questionnaire on risk assessment in construction projects. For each question, concerning a specific risk for the project, there are two answers: An estimate for the probability of occurrence for the risk (on the scale from 1 to 5) and one for the estimated impact of the risk to the project (also in the range 1-5). A common way to combine these two values is by multiplying them. Then, according to a chosen (by the organization) "Probability/Impact" matrix, I could determine which combinations of probability and impact result in a riskâ€™s being classified as "high risk", "moderate risk", or "low risk". I could then use these qualitative responses to analyze my data. However, I do not want to lose the information about a risk's probability because a risk classified as "high" should be treated differently, if this arises from high probability instead of high impact. The impact cannot be changed but the probability might be reduced by taking appropriate measures. What would the form of the data matrix be, if I want to keep a qualitative and a quantitative response for each question?. What methods do you suggest for the analysis?
