Estimate number of bad actors

This might be a silly question, but it's got me stumped. I am trying to estimate the number of bad actors in a system. Let's suppose we have 100 users, and some percentage of them are bad actors. In our system, the users are generating clips, say everyone on average generates 100 clips. The bad actors will, some percentage of the time, generate a bad clip. I want to figure out how many bad actors there are. What would be the most efficient approach for sampling clips from our database to estimate how many bad actors there are? Can I randomly sample 100 clips and figure out the percentage of bad actors? I have tried this problem a couple of times, and I keep getting tripped up by the fact that you don't know the distribution of clips a bad actor will generate. I'm not sure how to overcome that and generate an accurate estimate through sampling. Do you first need to find bad actors, and calculate the percentage of bad clips they might generate?
