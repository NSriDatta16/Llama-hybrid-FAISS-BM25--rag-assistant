how to extract features when observations and feature set are almost equal?

I need to do a regression where I have in total 750 observations and nearly 500 features. I am struggling to come up with feature engineering technique that gives top 10 or 15 non col-linear features with enough predicting power. I have used things like Recursive feature elimination but I do not get anything meaningful out of it. On a cross validated test I sometimes get an R squared of -10. Can someone please give me some pointers on what algorithm/technique to used when dealing with such problems? I am using python as my chosen platform for analysis. Thanks
