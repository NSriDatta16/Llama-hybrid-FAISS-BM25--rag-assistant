iOS Objective-C Image file name/path different behavior betwewen simulator and device

I have an app in which the app bundle contains an image file (I mean that the file is dragged into XCode and appears in "Other Sources"), and I am using code like: [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"Auto" ofType:@"jpg"] to get a path to the image. I found that when running on a device (iPod Touch), the name is case-sensitive, so that if the file is "Auto" and I use "AUTO", the poath returned is "file://(null)". However on the simulator, if I use "AUTO", it works the same as if I use "Auto". I am thinking that the fact that the simulator has such a clear difference in behavior from the device is a bug. Do the more experienced users out there think that it is, and that I should report it to Apple? Thanks.
