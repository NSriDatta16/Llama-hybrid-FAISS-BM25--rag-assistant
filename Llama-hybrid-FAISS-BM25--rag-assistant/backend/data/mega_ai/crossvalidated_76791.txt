machine learning model with 50% chance to be deterministic

I am trying to predict auction prices from a self gathered data set. I have titles available, and the price it was offered for. Now I noticed that whenever there is a 3 digit string of numbers in the title, there is about 48% that this is the actual price offered (I constrained to only gather data of the price between 100-800). How can I use this information in a further model, where I will make features of other text attributes (where 1 will mean the word exists in a training sample, and 0 will mean it does not exist in a training sample)? Is the best way to split the data up into where there exists a string in the title with numerical value between 100-800, versus where it does not exist, or is there a way to combine it in a single regression? i think what makes it different is that there is a 50% chance to be deterministic.
