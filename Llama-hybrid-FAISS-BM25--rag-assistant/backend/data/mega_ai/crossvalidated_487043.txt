As $N \rightarrow \infty$ the hypergeometric distribution converges to a binomial distribution (with size parameter $n$ and probability $K/N$ ), so that distribution would be a natural approximation in the case where $N$ is large. Since $K$ is unknown, one reasonable approach would be to give the probability parameter a prior distribution and proceed from there. The conjugate Bayesian approach would be to give the probability parameter a beta prior, leading to a beta-binomial distribution for the obervable value $k$ . If you were to use this approach then your distributional approximation would be: $$p(k|n) = \text{BetaBin}(k|n,\alpha,\beta) = {n \choose k} \frac{\text{B}(k+\alpha,n-k+\beta)}{\text{B}(\alpha,\beta)},$$ where $\alpha>0$ and $\beta>0$ are hyperparameters. (One simple case is to use a uniform prior with $\alpha=\beta=1$ .) Based on your updated information, which specifies that $n$ is also large, you could take the Poisson approximation to the binomial if you wish, and this would lead to a different approximating distribution (e.g., Poisson-gamma). In any case, you can compute probabilities from the beta-binomial distribution in R using the pbetabinom function in the rmutil package.
