In TensorFlow's Computational Model, is it possible to implement general machine learning algorithms?

https://www.tensorflow.org/ All the projects on TensorFlow I have seen in GitHub implement some kind of Neural Network model. Given TensorFlow is an improvement over the DAG (it's not acyclic any more), I was wondering if some inherent shortcoming makes it unsuitable for general machine learning model? In TensorFlow's Computational Model, is it possible to implement general machine learning algorithms?
