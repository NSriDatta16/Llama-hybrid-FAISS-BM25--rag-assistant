BSTS package cannot capture seasons in simulated data

I am self-learning about structural time series, and for me the best way to understand topic is to simulate the data myself. I want to simulate a time series of local level model with seasonal components: $$y_t = \mu_t + \gamma_t + v_t$$ $$ \mu_t = \mu_{t-1} +w_t$$ Where both disturbance terms are normally distributed. My code to simulate the time series is: require(bsts) set.seed(1234) y2 I intentionally put really strong seasonality and small disturbance variances, so the model could capture it easier: ss Unfortunately, the predictions don't seem to capture the seasonality at all: What did I do wrong? Did I poorly simulate the time series? Or did I mis-specify the model? Or boht?
