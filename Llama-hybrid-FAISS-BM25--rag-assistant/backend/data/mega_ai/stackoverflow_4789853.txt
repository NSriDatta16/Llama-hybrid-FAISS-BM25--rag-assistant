CSS3 box-shadow causes scroll-lag (slow performance) on Safari 5.0.2?

Hey there, this time I have a quite rare issue that's occurring only in Safari 5.0.2. When using CSS3's box-shadow parameter, Safari's performance is that bad, you can't even scroll down properly or interact as expected with the site . I have a which has an average size (960x320 pixels), and these are its relevant CSS settings: -moz-border-radius: 4px; /* FF1+ */ -webkit-border-radius: 4px; /* Saf3-4 */ border-radius: 4px; /* Opera 10.5, IE9, Saf5, Chrome */ -moz-box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 140px #dfe1e2; /* FF3.5+ */ -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 140px #dfe1e2; /* Saf3.0+, Chrome */ box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 140px #dfe1e2; /* Opera 10.5, IE9 */ I tried setting the CSS3 box-shadow with jQuery (.css()) but the outcome was the same (lag). Oh and, the border-radius does not cause this (I've discarded it by testing it several times). So, is there any solution to this? Honestly, I am shocked that a WebKit browser such as Safari even presents these sorts of issues. I know there must be a way, since several websites use inset&outset shadows and run just fine in Safari. I found a post here in StackOverflow which mentioned the box-image as a solution.. however, that post was quite old. I really, really appreciate your time and any support given. Thank you so much in advance! Chris
