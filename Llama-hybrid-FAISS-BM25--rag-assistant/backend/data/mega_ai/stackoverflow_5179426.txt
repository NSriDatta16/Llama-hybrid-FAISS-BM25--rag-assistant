Tap pressure strength detection using accelerometer

Yesterday, in the presentation about the new Garageband for iPad 2, Apple demoed an interesting feature: The detection of the tap pressure by using the accelerometer. (See the drums section on the Garageband page .) I'm wondering how that's supposed to work if the iPad lays flat on the table. No movement, no measurable acceleration, no?
