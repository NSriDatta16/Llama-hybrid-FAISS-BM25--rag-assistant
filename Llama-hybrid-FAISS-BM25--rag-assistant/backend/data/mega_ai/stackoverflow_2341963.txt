I think there's some great ideas here; from the scalability perspective I'd say that externalizing the check (e.g. Paul Sasik's answer) is probably the best one so far (+1 to him). If, for some reason, you don't want to externalize the check, then another option would be to use the HttpCache to store a watcher and a callback. In short, when you put the record in the DB that you want to watch, you also add it to the cache (using the .Add method) and set a SqlCacheDependency on it, and a callback to whatever logic you want to call when the dependency is invoked and the item is ejected from the cache.
