Rank ordering xts objects representing some property of equities using R

I am trying to rank order equities (by return for example). As a result I would like to receive a table containing names of stocks in ascending/descending order (parameter to this rank order function) with proper handling of NAs (moved at the end of each row). I really can't figure out an elegant way to do this. Below is an example of what I want: This is coredata of xts object representing some property at different times: john joe tina jack suzie sasha sven luca 2003-05-29 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2003-06-27 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2003-07-30 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 2003-07-31 NA 2 3 4 5 6 1 NA I need a dataframe which in each row (for each date) displays the column name from previous dataframe of best ranked (based on a property) in column 1, second best in column 2,... Please note that for the last row I need cases with NAs moved to the end (last two columns) or skipped... [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] 2003-05-29 "john" "joe" "tina" "jack" "suzie" "sasha" "sven" "luca" 2003-06-27 "luca" "john" "joe" "tina" "jack" "suzie" "sasha" "sven" 2003-07-30 "sven" "luca" "john" "joe" "tina" "jack" "suzie" "sasha" 2003-07-31 "sven" "joe" "tina" "jack" "suzie" "sasha" "john" "luca" Thanks in advance for your help. Being a beginner in R this poses to hard of a problem for me... Kind regards, Samo.
