So I finally made it work. This is the correct code for training: T_dist = {T_dist}; steps = 500; [Y_dist,Pf,Af] = sim(net,{num_letters steps}, {}, T_dist); Y_dist = Y_dist{1,steps}; And I messed up with shape of target arrays. Pay attention for shape of the input when creating the net and training it.
