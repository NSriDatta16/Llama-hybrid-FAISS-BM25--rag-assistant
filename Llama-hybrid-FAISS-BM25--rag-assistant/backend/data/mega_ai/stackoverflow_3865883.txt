Changing screen brightness in Android emulator

Can screen brightness changes be tested in the Android emulator? I've tried various examples that all use the following code snippet: WindowManager.LayoutParams lp = window.getAttributes(); lp.screenBrightness = (*some float percentage*); window.setAttributes(lp); But I don't see any change in brightness in the emulator. I've tested it in cupcake and 2.2.
