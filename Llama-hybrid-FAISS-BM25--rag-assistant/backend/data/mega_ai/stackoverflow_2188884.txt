How can I mix LaTeX in with Markdown?

I've been using Markdown for class notes, and it's great. I even do some preprocessing on the Markdown so I can do things like tables. But this term I'm teaching a class with a lot of math, and I'd love to be able to put LaTeX formulas with Markdown, something like this: The refinement relation is written $a \sqsubseteq b$, which can be pronounced "$a$ approximates $b$" or "$b$ is at least as defined as $a$". I'd like to be able to take each fragment of LaTeX and preprocess it into a nice antialiased PNG file which I could then include in my Markdown via the HTML tag. But I have absolutely no idea how to take a fragment of LaTeX and get a nice image that Has the right bounding box Is antialiased All I know how to do is get full pages in DVI, PostScript, or PDF formats. I'm sure this problem has been addressed, but I haven't been able to guess the right search terms. Any suggestions how to solve it or where to look for an existing solution? EDIT : Having installed mathTeX, I can say that the code is inflexible, that it violates the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy standard, and that it is amateur workâ€”in both the good and bad senses of that word. The code is so complex that there are no obvious faults. I will be looking for alternatives. Also, it's clear that at bottom, solutions are based on dvipng . ONE YEAR LATER : I never did get the seamless integration I had been hoping for, but I am limping along on a script of my own devising. It turns out that instead of dvipng it is a little easier to use dvips -E and the convert program of ImageMagick. The benefits are slightly more control of things like scaling, and ease of making a transparent background. The curious can inspect this example . I can't recommend this solution to anyone. But I can't recommend MathTeX either.
