Autoencoder can be used for finding anomalies (via the reconstruction error) and therefore are also applied in fraud detection. One example with the goal to detect accounting fraud with autoencoder is this paper: Detection of Anomalies in Large Scale Accounting Data using Deep Autoencoder Networks However, you need some way to validate the results you get from this approach. If you have no labeled data at all, someone with expertise would need to look at the anomalies detected to check if they are really fraud or not.
