To resolve this I just ended up copying the git repository into a newly created project, but upon revisiting the issue I found a link here that suggests something slightly more elegant (but functionally similar). After creating a new project, use Import -> Filesystem and Select All . In my case, my repository already had a proper /src/com/... directory structure which merged nicely into the one set up by the new eclipse project.
