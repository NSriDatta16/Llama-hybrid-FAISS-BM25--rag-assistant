Save an edited image to the SD card

I'm opening an image from the gallery, resizing it, and attempting to save the resized version to the apps data file so I can grab it in future. My problem is I keep getting a FileNotFoundException when I try to write it with an input stream. This is the file it's trying to write too. "/mnt/sdcard/Android/data/foundcake.myslide/files/IMG_20100918_133128.png" Am I missing any important steps here? File storagePath = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/Android/data/foundcake.myslide/files/"); storagePath.mkdirs(); Debug.print("STORAGE PATH " + storagePath); Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("/([^/]+)\\.[^/]+$"); Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(filePath); String fileName = ""; while (matcher.find()) { fileName = matcher.group(1); } Debug.print("FILE NAME " + fileName); File cached = new File(storagePath, fileName + ".png"); Debug.print("NEW FILE " + cached.toString()); try { FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(cached); bitmap.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.PNG, 100, out); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
