WPF Drag-to-scroll doesn't work correctly

I am tying to realize a drag-to-scroll functionality in my application and have problems on my way. Can anybody help me? I have a ScrollViewer and inside it an ItemsControl and within ItemsTemplate I have a UserControl. I want to drag that UserControl within ItemsControl. I want the ScrollViewer to scroll down, when I am dragging to the boundaries of the ItemsControl. protected override void OnPreviewMouseMove(System.Windows.Input.MouseEventArgs e) { if (this.IsMouseCaptured) { // Get the new mouse position. Point mouseDragCurrentPoint = e.GetPosition(this); if (Math.Abs(mouseDragCurrentPoint.Y - this.ActualHeight) When I start dragging by calling DragDrop.DoDragDrop() scrolling don't happens. But when I disable dragging, the ScrollViewer scrolls down dependong on mouse position. Maybe there's something that I don't take into accont about dragging and Capturing the mouse? Thanks for attention. Garegin
