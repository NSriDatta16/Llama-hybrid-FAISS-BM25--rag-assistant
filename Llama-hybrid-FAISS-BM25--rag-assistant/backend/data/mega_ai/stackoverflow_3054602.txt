I have to wonder what the real intent of the question is... Is the Get method supposed to retrieve a value of the specified key from some kind of storage? In that case, I would imagine something like public T Get (string key) { // GetValue(key) returns a value of type object. return (T)_storage.GetValue(key); } would be more appropriate. The answers proposed so far make no use of the key parameter at all (I suppose that is legitimate, given that the original question seeks to hard code some kind of return value based on the type of T , regardless of what key represents). You normally use generics to provide a generic behavior regardless of the type you're dealing with. If you start introducing a switch statement to modify behavior based on the Type of the method, you likely aren't using generics properly, and/or you should look into implementing separate, type-specific methods.
