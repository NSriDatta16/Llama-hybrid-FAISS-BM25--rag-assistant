The domain name in your example doesn't include parentheses. The URL does. You can replace the parentheses using sed like this: sed -e 's/(/%28/g' -e 's/)/%29/g' You may also need to replace the space: sed 's/ /%20/g' . However, curl should be able to handle parentheses in the URL just fine. You say it "does not work" which conveys no information at all . You should post exactly what you're doing, exactly how the result differs from your expectations and exactly what error messages you're getting. Guessing that you may be getting an error such as "-bash: syntax error near unexpected token '('", that can be fixed using proper quoting: curl "api.themoviedb.org/2.1/Movie.search/en/xml/key/Fargo (1996)" However, when I try it, I get an "400 Bad Request" message from the host. When I do the substitutions above in various combinations (including trying an underscore for the space), I get no response at all (but that's probably because I don't have an API key). In any case, it doesn't appear to be the parentheses that are problematic, but the space. Anyway, looking at their documentation , they give an example of how to include a date: http://api.themoviedb.org/2.1/Movie.search/en/xml/APIKEY/Transformers+2007
