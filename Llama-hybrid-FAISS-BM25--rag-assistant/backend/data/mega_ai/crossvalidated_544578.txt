Comparing 2 sample means

I'm trying to quantify the difference between two sample means. I'm not sure if I can use the standard two sample t-test. The first sample comes from the difference of two time series (inflation rate & 5Y-breakeven rate over time) The second sample also comes from the difference of two time series (inflation rate & 7Y-breakeven rate over time) I assume the two samples are independent, however, I'm not sure what I can say about the populations they come from, since they're derived from time series'. The distributions of both samples are pretty far from normal and skewed, and I can't say much about the normality of the population. Can I use the two- sample means test or should I investigate into non-parametric tests?
