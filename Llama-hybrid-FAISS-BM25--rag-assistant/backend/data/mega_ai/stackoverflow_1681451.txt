My approach solves the problem backwards. Why not use ToolSet to create a group of use statements that includes Moose , along with your additional pragmas? The code should look something like: # MagicMoose.pm package MagicMoose; use base 'ToolSet'; ToolSet->use_pragma( qw/feature :5.10/ ); # perl 5.10 ToolSet->use_pragma( qw/autodie/ ); # define exports from other modules ToolSet->export( 'Moose' => undef, # get the defaults ); 1; # modules must return true I haven't tested this. Frankly, I just found ToolSet a few days ago, and haven't had a chance to try it out yet. FWIW, the reviews are positive.
