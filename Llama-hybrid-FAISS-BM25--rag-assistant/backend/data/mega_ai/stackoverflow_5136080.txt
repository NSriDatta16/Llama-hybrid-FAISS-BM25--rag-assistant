define-match-expander

about the define-match-expansion, there are rare materials and example codes to illustrate the concepts. I am having a hard time to "decode" what the documentation says: (define-match-expander id proc-expr) (define-match-expander id proc-expr proc-expr) Binds id to a match expander. The first proc-expr subexpression must evaluate to a transformer that produces a pat for match. Whenever id appears as the beginning of a pattern, this transformer is given, at expansion time, a syntax object corresponding to the entire pattern (including id). The pattern is the replaced with the result of the transformer. A transformer produced by a second proc-expr subexpression is used when id is used in an expression context. Using the second proc-expr, id can be given meaning both inside and outside patterns. Can anyone give some example codes to illustrate the two usages of the define-match-expander here?
