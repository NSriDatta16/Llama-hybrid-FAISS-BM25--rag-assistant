Cocoa Move Mouse

I'm writing a Mac OS X application on Snow Leopard. I have a step method which is fired at a regular interval by a NSTimer. In this method I would like to move the mouse to the center of the screen, with no buttons being pressed or released. Here's what I have: -(void) step: (NSTimer *) timer { NSRect bounds = [self bounds]; CGPoint point = CGPointMake(bounds.origin.x + bounds.size.width / 2.0f, bounds.origin.y + bounds.size.height / 2.0f); CGEventCreateMouseEvent(NULL, kCGEventLeftMouseDragged, point, 0); } This doesn't do anything. Can somebody tell me what's wrong?
