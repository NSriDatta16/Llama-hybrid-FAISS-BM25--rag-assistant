Feedforward Neural networks for Regression confusion

I’m a bit confused about the concept of using feedforwrd neural networks via backpropagation to model a nonlinear relationship between the input and output variable in a regression setting. Can this be done? I.e., could such an ANN deduce a relationship like $y = \sin(x^2) + x^3$? If it’s not easy to do this, does it have to do with the fact that in regression problems the output layer activation function is linear? Thanks.
