The center of the circle can be determined by making a perpendicular line to two neighboring "sides", and intersecting them. If there are an even number of vertices, just pick two which are opposite to each other, and "avarage them" - calculate the midpoint. Then, you can just rotate all the vertices to either way by 180Â°/No.vertices around this center, so you get the ones you are looking for. Of course, you should keep the existing ones too.
