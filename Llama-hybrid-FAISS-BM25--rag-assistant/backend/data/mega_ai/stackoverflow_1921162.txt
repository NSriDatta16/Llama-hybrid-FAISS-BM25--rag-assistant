BizTalk Memory Usage per item

I recently began outbalancing our host instance memory usage because we had a lot of throttling problems. Now I used performance counters to view the memory usage of each host instance. And I also used a tool called the MsgBoxViewer to get to see which ports/locations/orchestrations run per host instance. Now I was wondering if there is a way to see how much memory each of these subitems use? So I can outbalance it even more. If no, is there a way to see how much traffic each host processes? I could then just use simple math to accomplish it.
