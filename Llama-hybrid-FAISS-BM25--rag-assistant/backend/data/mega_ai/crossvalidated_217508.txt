Apart from an abuse of notation ($f$ having multiple meanings), there is no true difficulty in defining $$ k(x,y|x^\prime, y^\prime) = f(x|y^\prime)f(y|x) $$ as a density on the pair $(X,Y)$ since The conditional density of $Y$ given $X$ is $f(y|x)$, which integrates to one; The marginal density of $X$ is $f(x|y')$, which also integrates to one. What may sound confusing is the parametrisation in $(x',y')$ but this simply indicates that the distribution does not depend on $x'$. A standard occurrence of this setting is in Gibbs sampling or slice sampling (which is possibly where you found this description): when using two full conditionals for the Markov transition, one simulates [at iteration $t$] $X_{t+1}|X_t,Y_t\sim f(x|y_t)$ $Y_{t+1}|X_t,Y_t,X_{t+1} \sim f(y|x_{t+1})$ or $$(X_{t+1},Y_{t+1})|(X_{t},Y_{t})\sim k(x,y|x_t,y_t)$$ and the move does not directly depend on the value of $X_t$. Note that this is not incompatible with $$(X_{t+1},Y_{t+1})\sim f(x,y)$$ in the stationary regime of the Markov chain, since $f(x,y)$ is the stationary density while $k(x,y|x_t,y_t)$ is the conditional density at iteration $t+1$.
