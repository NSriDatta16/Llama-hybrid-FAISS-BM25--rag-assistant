There's no assumptions you can make about the user agent string. RFC 1945, section 10.15 User Agent specifies the format and the section 3.7 Product Token specifies how product tokens should be formatted. As you can see from these two, user agent string can be pretty much anything the HTTP agent wants it to be. Note : strictly speaking, using an URL in the product token can be treated as a violation of that RFC, since the / should be treated as a separator between the product identifier and the product version.
