Just wanted to clarify for you that the DOM does in fact changes itself when you move stuff around with draggable-ui. So that might help you find what you are looking for. You can do something like: $('#flashbanner').prev() // For previous siblings Or iterate through all the divs. $(#blue).find('div').each(function(){ $(this).blahblah // current div }); Or even iterate through all previous siblings, and look for heights etc. But this should be last resort stuff... $('#flasshbanner').prevAll().each(function(){ var height = $(this).height(); if(height == blahblah){ //do stuff } }); But the key is the DOM, it shifts when you move stuff around, so if you know what happens, you can find it 'automatically' with jQuery. The Firefox plugin FireBug should help you look at the new DOM as you are shifting it around. (I believe most web developers use FireFox while developing because of FireBug's pure brilliance btw) You could try uploading your code to http://jsfiddle.net/ so we can help you further with actual source codes. :) Good luck mate.
