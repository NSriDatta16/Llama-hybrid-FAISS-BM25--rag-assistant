Label/Texbox separation in Microsoft Access 2007 forms

I'm trying to create a very simple form in an Access database. Whenever I drag a textbox on the form, a label gets created with it. I want to be able to move the label without moving the textbox,but whenever I try to do that, the textbox moves with it. Its like they're linked with each other. Is there a way to separate them from each other so that they can be moved separately?
