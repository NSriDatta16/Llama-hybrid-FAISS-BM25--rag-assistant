You’re trying to model an opinion, not a fact. If you want to model the sign of the return, that is a fact: the asset gained, lost, or held its value. However, you want to model what kind of trade to execute. That is an opinion, and if you buy or sell, someone else must have the opposite opinion to be selling to sell you the asset or buy it from you. Consequently, you need to come up with some kind of strategy to express your opinion about what to do. Once you do that, you can apply it to the rows of your data, but you don’t have to do that to make predictions about the times to buy, sell, and hold, as you already have that assignment rule. Just apply that rule, perhaps in a loop or with some vectorized code. Unless you want to phrase this in terms of being a game where the goal is to profit given some rules of the game and then train using reinforcement learning (which does not require the kind of labeling you describe), I do not see this as a machine learning problem. You just need to develop a rule about when to buy, sell, and hold, and then you apply that rule.
