There are multiple ways to set the scaling of latent variables: Reference/marker variables : Fixing the loading of one item per factor to a value of one--the default of most CFA/SEM software. Fixed-factor : Fixing the variance(s) of factor(s) to one (in essence, standardizing it/them). Effects-coding : A lesser-known approach (see Little et al., 2006, for an overview). Loadings are fixed to average one, and intercepts are fixed to average zero; this gives the latent variable(s) the same ("non-arbitrary", in Little's words) scaling as their indicators. It's described as a useful strategy when comparing latent means is the primary goal of an analysis. Anyways, while reference/marker variable scale-setting is the default for most software, it prevents you from estimating all the factor loadings (as some are fixed). And since the focus of EFA is generally to estimate exploratory factor loadings, the latent variables are standardized instead (and this is why EFA software usually provides standardized factor loadings).
