Accuracy is not a single binomial proportion, so the Clopper-Pearson interval does not apply. In contrast to Normal and Poisson, the sum of two binomial random variables with different means is not (in general) a binomial. You can use a confidence interval based on the Normal approximation, preferably after some transformation like logit. Or you could bootstrap -- it won't be much better than an appropriately transformed Normal approximation, but at least you don't need to work out the transformation. There isn't a straightforward alternative: in contrast to the problem of a confidence interval for a single binomial proportion, this problem has nuisance parameters: it's a two-parameter problem and you want a confidence interval for one parameter, so for better accuracy than the Normal approximation you have to do something with the other parameter. It principle it would be possible to reparametrise so that you had the accuracy and a second parameter orthogonal to it, and then do some sort of profile likelihood, but it isn't easy. Update: I've just worked out a profile likelihood for the special case of so-called balanced accuracy , the average of sensitivity and specificity, and it seems to work well on a first look. The idea is to rewrite the likelihood in terms of the average and the difference of sensitivity and specificity, then maximise over the difference for each value of the average to get a profile likelihood just depending on the average, then do a likelihood-based confidence interval. Of course, it would need more study before one could actually recommend it
