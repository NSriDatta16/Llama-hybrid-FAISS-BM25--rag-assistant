Mysterious relative path library dependency

After loading an existing MFC application in Visual Studio 2008, I am left with one linking error: LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file '..\..\xpressmp\lib\xprm_rt.lib' I have looked "everywhere", but I can't figure out where the relative path is set. The lib file is located in C:\xpressmp\lib, and I have added this directory both under Tools-Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++Directories->Library files and Project->Properties->Linker->Additional Library Directories. I also searched all files in the project to no avail. I have the library file (xprm_rt.lib) listed under Additional Dependencies for both Debug and Release. I also tried adding the path there, but that did not help. I cannot find any #pragma comment-directives. About the LNK1104, the file clearly does not exist in the location that the linker is searching. But I can't see why it is searching there ( ..\..\ ...) as I have not specified any relative paths. Any help appreciated :-) UPDATE: In the project .vcproj file, I found the following xml: After deleting these lines (where were they set?), I was able to link successfully. Thanks for your help, it seems the relative library path was indeed being appended "automatically" by VS.
