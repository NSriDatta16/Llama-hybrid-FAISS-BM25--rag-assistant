Fastest way to import text file into database

I've a text file containing record of a dump of database table in a custom format, this text have a character in a specific position that identifies the operation with the record : M = Insert or Update D = Delete Record Therefore if i find a D record in text file i need to delete record into database, instead if i find an M record i need to Insert the record if not exist in the database, if already exist i need to update it. What is the better and fastest way to import a similar text file in a database table using .NET Framework and c#? I have 300000 record of average in this text file. Thanks
