What should I do with a test and train set not having same classes?

Assume we have a train dataset with 5 classes a,b,c,d,e but the test dataset have only d and e with extra class f not present in train set. If i want to do machine learning with this datset in weka or python what should I do with this dataset? should I transform them and how should I do it? Should I remove classes form train set which are not in test set? (it's a multi-class classification, and the letters a-f are the target classes)
