To get the name of the anchor from the URL, use the following line: var anchorName = document.location.hash.substring(1) That retrieves the hash portion of the URL, then trims the first character out (the first character will always be the hash symbol, "#"). Here's some documentation on that: Javascript Tutorial, Location.hash . Once you have that, do something like the following: jQuery("#area p:has(a[name=" + anchorName + "])").show(); This will show any paragraph in #area that contains an anchor with the name specified in the URL's hash portion. EDIT To solve the problem of jQuery being to fast, you can use a fancier selection to only hide the ones that will end up hidden, like so: $("#area > p:not(:first)").filter("p:not(:has(a[name=" + anchorName + "]))").hide(); That says to take all paragraphs except the first one, then take the subset of those that don't contain an anchor with a given value for the name attribute, and hide whatever remains. The first paragraph, and any that contain an anchor with the give name will remain visible. Here is a live demo: http://jsfiddle.net/JDQxP/ Because we can't get the hash from the URL on jsFiddle, I've replaced that line with static values. Uncomment them one at a time to see the effect of each. Note that the "phasellus" anchor is in a wrapper span, but the selector still works properly on it.
