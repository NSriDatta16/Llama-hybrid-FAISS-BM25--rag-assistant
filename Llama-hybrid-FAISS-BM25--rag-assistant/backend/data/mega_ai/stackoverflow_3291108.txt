You might want to try WWW::Mechanize::Timed , which extends the WWW::Mechanize module. The ::Timed features will allow you to collect information on how long your requests take. The underlying ::Mechanize module, which is itself a subclass of LWP::UserAgent, would give you access to your response, including headers, body content, and images. From these you could compute total page "weight", number of requests, etc. This doesn't cover everything YSlow does (exposing the DNS internals underlying gethostbyname would be a good trick!) but I hope it's a place to start, if I've understood your question properly.
