Does experience with Keras count as experience with Tensorflow?

Many Machine Learning job postings I've seen request experience with Tensorflow. If I have experience with Tensorflow, but only through building neural networks using the Keras API. Does that count? I have yet to see a tutorial or any code anywhere that uses Tensorflow without the Keras API, so I don't see how one learns Tensorflow strictly. But then why don't employers just request experience with the Keras API?
