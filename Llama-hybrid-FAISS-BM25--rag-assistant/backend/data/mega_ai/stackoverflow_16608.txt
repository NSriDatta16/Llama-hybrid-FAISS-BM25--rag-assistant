When we used to work in MSSQL 2000, we did what we called the "triple-flip": EDITED DECLARE @InnerPageSize int DECLARE @OuterPageSize int DECLARE @Count int SELECT @Count = COUNT( ) FROM SET @InnerPageSize = @PageNum * @PageSize SET @OuterPageSize = @Count - ((@PageNum - 1) * @PageSize) IF (@OuterPageSize @PageSize) SET @OuterPageSize = @PageSize DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(8000) SET @sql = 'SELECT * FROM ( SELECT TOP ' + CAST(@OuterPageSize AS nvarchar(5)) + ' * FROM ( SELECT TOP ' + CAST(@InnerPageSize AS nvarchar(5)) + ' * FROM ORDER BY ASC ) AS t1 ORDER BY DESC ) AS t2 ORDER BY ASC' PRINT @sql EXECUTE sp_executesql @sql It wasn't elegant, and it wasn't fast, but it worked.
