If the focus is purely on predictive accuracy, then the overfitted model is most probably better. Take e.g. a random forest: On the training data set, by construction, it extremely overfits. Still the results on the test data set are often quite reasonable (and the test performance close to the stated out-of-bag performance). This works only if the test data set reflects "real cases" and the assumptions of the underlying models are met reasonably.
