AR(1) selection using sample ACF-PACF

The following graph shows the ACF (sample autocorrelation function) and PACF (partial autocorrelation function) of the residuals in a linear regression. There is a sinusoidal decay in the ACF and two spikes at lag 1 and 4 in the PACF. Considering the spike at lag 4, can we still assume AR(1) for these residuals? I should add that, the best model based on AIC is ARIMA(2,0,1) and based on BIC is AR(1) using the auto.arima function in package forecast . Here are the codes: auto.arima(resid(lm.3),ic=c("aic")) Series: resid(lm.3) ARIMA(2,0,1) with zero mean Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 0.0579 0.5125 0.8500 s.e. 0.2228 0.1981 0.1753 sigma^2 estimated as 0.0008776: log likelihood=207.36 AIC=-406.71 AICc=-406.29 BIC=-396.33 auto.arima(resid(lm.3),ic=c("bic")) Series: resid(lm.3) ARIMA(1,0,0) with zero mean Coefficients: ar1 0.7771 s.e. 0.0616 sigma^2 estimated as 0.0009202: log likelihood=205.11 AIC=-406.23 AICc=-406.1 BIC=-401.04 The time series plot of the original residuals is And the ACF and PACF plot for the first difference is
