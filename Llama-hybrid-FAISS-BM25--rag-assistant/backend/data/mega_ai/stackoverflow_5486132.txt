No, i don't think canvas does not integrate well witch all the other godly goodness of HTML5 (whatever that is) Embedding of other websites... Or i'm not getting your point or this is really a very very strange feature to want. Circular text editor? Embedding HTML Elements inside Canvas?? I'm losing you here... I suggest you to read the Canvas specs and to look into some libraries like EaselJS
