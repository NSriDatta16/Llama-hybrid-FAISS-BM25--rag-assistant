What statistical test would I use with 2 groups and a control to show significant difference?

Question I would like to answer: To encourage more referrals, the product team is running an experiment on the iOS app, called “ios_referral_experiment”, that tests adding new links to the referral invite page. The experiment has 3 groups: the “control” group has no new link; the “tab_only” group has a new navigation tab that links to the page; and the “tab_settings” group has both a new navigation tab and a new link in the settings. What are the results from this experiment and what would you recommend? I have a table that looks like so: event_type test_group Total_Impressions referrer_page_invite_action control 1892 referrer_page_invite_action tab_only 4009 referrer_page_invite_action tab_settings 2995 referrer_page_viewed control 25382 referrer_page_viewed tab_only 63372 referrer_page_viewed tab_settings 44473 My goal is to determine if the split_test_group have significant differences on total impression when compared to control. I would do two seperate tests for each event_type variables. I was thinking a simple t-test but was unsure and would appreciate any help.
