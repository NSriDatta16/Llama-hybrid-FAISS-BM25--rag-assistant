What is a dangerously high number (or rate of increase) for Handler_read_rnd_next?

This is related to the queries I'm running from this question , namely: SELECT CONCAT_WS(', ', city, state) AS location, AVG(latitude), AVG(longitude) FROM places WHERE state='NY' AND city='New York' GROUP BY state, city I've been looking at phpMyAdmin and they have one value red-flagged, Handler_read_rnd_next. I think it makes sense; given the above query, if a location has multiple zip codes, the AVG() functions are going to group by city/state and then scan through each zip code. My question is, when does this become a terrible thing? Should I be caching these averages to begin with, or is an increase of a few thousand Handler_read_rnd_next every few minutes an acceptable thing for a database? It seems like this would number will increase for any query that uses GROUP BY, so I'm wondering if this is just standard fare.
