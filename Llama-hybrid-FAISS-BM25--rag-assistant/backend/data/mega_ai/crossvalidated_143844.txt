Sample size when fitting categorical survey data

I have a model which fits data from repeated surveys: at time $t$, a number $n_t$ respondents is asked a question and can give one of $K$ answers ($k=1, ..., K$). This is repeated $T$ times ($t = 1, ..., T$). The model treats each survey response as independent (the respondents are randomly selected every year) and calculates the log likelihood of obtaining a given number of people choosing answer $k$ at time $t$ ($n_{kt}$) for $1 \le k \le K$ and $1 \le t \le T$, i.e. $\ell = \sum_{t=1}^T n_t \sum_{k=1}^K p_{kt} \log \hat{p}_{kt}$, where $p_{kt} := n_{kt} / n_t$ and $\hat{p}_{kt}$ is the probability predicted by the model. My question is: what is my sample size if I have $N = \sum_{t=1}^T n_t$ surveys? Is it $N$ (number of surveys) or $T (K - 1) + T$ (number of independent quantities ``seen'' by the model)? It is important to me because I do not know what to use in Bayesian Information Criterion formula when comparing different model variants.
