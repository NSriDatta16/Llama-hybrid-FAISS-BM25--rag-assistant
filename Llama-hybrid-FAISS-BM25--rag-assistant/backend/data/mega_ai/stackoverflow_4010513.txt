Cruise Control .NET, .NET 4.0, WS 2008 R2, NUnit seems to require COMPLUS_Version?

Trying to configure NUnit 2.5.8.10295 in Cruise Control.NET on Windows Server 2008 R2, .NET 4.0, my NUnit task times out, and nunit-agent.exe seems stuck running. It works fine from the command line. The only solution I've found is to define the environment variable COMPLUS_Version. Is there a better solution to this problem? C:\builds\nunit\bin\net-2.0\nunit-console-x86.exe C:\builds\testLogs C:\builds\build\NUnit.Tests\bin\Debug\NUnit.Tests.dll /nologo /framework=4.0.30319 10 0,1,3,5 COMPLUS_Version v4.0.30319 I tried various edits to nunit-console-x86.config, but nothing worked but this awkward looking "solution". Thanks
