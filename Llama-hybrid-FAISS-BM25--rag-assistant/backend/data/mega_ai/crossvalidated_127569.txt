As written in numerous places on this site, logistic regression is a probability estimator. Any decision you want to make takes the predicted probability from the fitted logistic regression model, applies a utility function you specify, and chooses the decision with the highest expected utility. The utility should not be incorporated by playing with thresholds for the model (at least not usually). Having probabilities also gives you the luxury of making no decision at all for class calls.
