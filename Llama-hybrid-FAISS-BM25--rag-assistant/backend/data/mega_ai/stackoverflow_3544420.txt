cdef extern from "stdint.h": ctypedef unsigned long long uint64_t Any ctypedef that's extern 'd won't have a typedef generated in the .c file. Cython will include stdint.h and your C compiler will use the actual typedef from there. The only thing that the type provided matters for is when cython generates code that automatically converts between C types and Python types. Using unsigned long long means that Cython will use PyLong_FromUnsignedLongLong and PyLong_AsLongLongAndOverflow . This way, you hopefully won't get any truncation on conversion.
