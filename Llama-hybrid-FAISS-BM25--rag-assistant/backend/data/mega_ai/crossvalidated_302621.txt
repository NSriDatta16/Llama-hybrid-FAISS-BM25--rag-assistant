Can you use Interrupted Time Series analysis across 4 weeks, with 12 time points?

We have had some collaborators suggest interrupted time series analysis as a method for analysing some observational data, that investigated the effect of an intervention on an observed outcome (lunch bought or brought from home). However, we only have a 2 week baseline (observations occurring on 2 days for the first week, and 3 days for the second), and a 2 week intervention period (with 3 days per week of observations). Will this be sufficient for this kind of analysis? All the examples I've seen have been population level observations across a much larger time period.
