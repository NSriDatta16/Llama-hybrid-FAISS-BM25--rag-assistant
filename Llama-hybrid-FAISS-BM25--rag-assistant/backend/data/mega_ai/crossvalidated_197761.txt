Random effect vs fixed effect in logistic regression

I have a logistic regression model: $y \sim x^{\top}\beta $. One of the covariates represents the doctor ID, as in this example . I wondered if I would obtain very different results by considering the doctor ID as another covariate (fixed effect) instead of a random effect as in the link provided above. I thought of this since another covariate is also "male" or "female", among other categorical predictors, then, why wouldn't these variables be also considered as random effects?
