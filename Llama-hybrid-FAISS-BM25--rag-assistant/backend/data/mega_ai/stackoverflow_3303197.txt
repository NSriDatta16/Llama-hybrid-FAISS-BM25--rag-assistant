I've contributed a lot to the phonegap-blackberry project, and in all of my tests, for some reason the XmlHttpRequest object always raises an empty exception when you call the open() function on it. I'm not sure why - phonegap-blackberry in its current form leverages RIM's proprietary, non-WebKit browser, so maybe that has something to do with it. What I've done though is implement a very basic, native, Java-based approach to making HTTP requests and retrieving the response. It is bridged back into JavaScript in your PhoneGap app as part of the 'network' PhoneGap API. Some information about that is here: http://wiki.phonegap.com/Known-issues-(BlackBerry) NOTE: this is most definitely a stopgap measure. The implementation is rough and could definitely use some work. Currently, it only works with API endpoints that return JSON. Example usage: navigator.network.XHR('http://www.mysite.com/myapi', 'This is my POST data, or I could pass in "null" for empty POST data', function(response) { // This is my success callback. // Do something with the JSON response object here. }); Hope that helps.
