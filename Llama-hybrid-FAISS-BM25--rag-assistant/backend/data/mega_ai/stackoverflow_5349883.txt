You can embed an other application in the bundle of your application. You will usually do this to embed an other application you also created, like an helper, or a daemon. It sometimes is helpful, but doesn't seem to be what you want. If you want to let the user play with a pdf inside your application, read the PDF Kit Programming Guide . Especially look into the class PDFView . You can drag and drop an instance into your xib, and load content into it with this code (from Apple documentation): PDFDocument *pdfDoc; pdfDoc = [[[PDFDocument alloc] initWithURL: [NSURL fileURLWithPath: [self fileName]]] autorelease]; [pdfView setDocument: pdfDoc];
