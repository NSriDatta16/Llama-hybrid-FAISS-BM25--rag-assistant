Do you have a valid iPhone Distribution certificate in your Keychain? Does the Xcode Organizer Provisioning Profile window show your Distribution provision? Does your distribution provisioning profile have an app ID that is the same or compatible (wildcard) with the Identifier setting in your Target Info Properties setting? Edit: added: Do you have exactly one iPhone Distribution certificate in your Keychain? Did you do a Build Clean in Xcode before your distribution build? (or rm -rf ./build)
