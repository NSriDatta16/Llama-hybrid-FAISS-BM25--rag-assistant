Cross-Validation: Use results of a single fold

The common way to summarize results in cross-validation is by taking the average of results of all folds. But in case there is a deviation in the results of individual folds, can we use the results of a single fold? For example, the MSE of a 3 folds CV are 4, .556, and .03. Can I use the least MSE of .03 as the final result?
