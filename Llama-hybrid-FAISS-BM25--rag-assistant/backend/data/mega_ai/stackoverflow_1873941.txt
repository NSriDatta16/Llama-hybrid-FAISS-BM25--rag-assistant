Using css in a StringTemplate Email

I'm currently using StringTemplate to create my emails on the fly and its proven very easy to use in creation of the email. However, I'm trying to apply some styling to my emails and dont seem able to do this in the normal manner. I can style parts of the mail if I write it inline, eg. Hello again, $name$ ! will print the message in a red text. But if I express a class like the following in my template: Notification .myClass { text-decoration:underline; color:blue; } Hello again, $name$ ! Here is your daily update The paragraph with the "myClass" class isn't outputted in blue with an underline. I've tried importing stylesheets also but this didn't work. Any help much appreciated, -gearoid. UPDATE: Looks at though it could be a gmail issue. If I view the mail on my iPhone it displays as expected...looks as though it'll have to all be done inline :( Useful for future reference: http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/
