How do you visualize Decision boundaries?

My features for a problem are just a single feature, so X_train has just a single dimension. Now, I have used SVM , naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. So now How do I draw the decision boundaries of these classifiers? Is there is a way to draw a one dimension feature vector with the decision boundary using python? I have done many searches but I couldn't find any results. The X_train shape is (489, 1) (489 instances each with a single value)
