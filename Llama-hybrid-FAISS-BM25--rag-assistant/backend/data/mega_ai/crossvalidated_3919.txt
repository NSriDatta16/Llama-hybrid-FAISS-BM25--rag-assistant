Just speaking on a practical level, in my discipline (psychology) I have never seen this done for pure factor analysis. That being said, the significance (fit really) of a statistical model is normally tested by the use of Structural Equation Modelling, where you attempt to reproduce the observed matrix of data from the structure you have proposed through the use of factor analysis. The SEM, lavaan or OpenMx Packages for R will all do this. Technically, the Chi square test will tell you if a factor model fits perfectly, but this statistic is almost always significant with any appreciable (200+) sample size. The psych package for R also gives you the Bayesian Information Criterion as a measure of fit after you specify a factor model, but I am unsure as to how useful this is.
