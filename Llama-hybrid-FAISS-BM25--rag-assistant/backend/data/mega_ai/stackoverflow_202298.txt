Select (not just pick randomly) one or two testers, and let them write the test cases. Review. It could also be useful if a developer working with a task looks at the test cases for the task. Encourage testers to suggest improvements and additions to test sets - sometimes people are afraid to fix what the boss did. This way you might find someone who is good at test design. Let the testers know about the technical details - I think everyone in an agile team should have read access to code, and whatever documentation is available. Most testers I know can read (and write) code, so they might find unit tests useful, possibly even extend them. Make sure the test designers get useful answers from the developers, if they need to know something.
