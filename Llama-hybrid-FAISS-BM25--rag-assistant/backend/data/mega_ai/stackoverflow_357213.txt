Memory Mapped files can be used when you have a large amount of data and don't want to incur the cost of marshaling it across process boundaries. I have used it for a similar purpose. You need to be fairly comfortable with unsafe and pinned memory concepts in .NET to take advantage of MMFs. Apparently , the Enterprise Library's caching block contains code which wraps the underlying C# API. I have seen at least one other implementation elsewhere. If you can live with the marshaling cost, it's probably easier and more elegant to use some kind of .NET remoting solution.
