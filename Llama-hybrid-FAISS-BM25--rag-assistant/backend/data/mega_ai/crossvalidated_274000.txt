How do you define optimal? Typically, the conjugate priors won't be the best choice, but they may be reasonable choices. Typically conjugate priors are chosen for computational efficiency. Jeffrey's priors can often be shown to have many favorable "optimal" properties. In terms of MLE you can think of Bayesian priors as being similar to penalized likelihood functions in frequentist framework. So to answer your question 3: No, consider the lasso model (L1 penalized linear regression) vs ridge (L2 penalized linear regression) the MLE to these models is not the same.
