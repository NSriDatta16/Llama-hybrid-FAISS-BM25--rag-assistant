It's not completely clear for me what you're talking about. If you're asking about an ability to create Range s that map to nothing and exist on their own, then no, there's no way. A Range object is just something that refers to a certain area of a worksheet. It doesn't have any storage of its own or something. Several different instances of Range class can refer to the same worksheet area, too. And if you just want to store some references in an array, then that's fine, go for it. The only problem with your code is that you don't initialize the array elements before using them: as the Range is a reference type, all elements get initialized with Nothing s by default.
