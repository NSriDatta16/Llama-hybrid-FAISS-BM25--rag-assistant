NLP Library in java

Possible Duplicate: Java : Is there a good natural language processing library I need a simple Natural Language Processing library written in java which can be used to process a search query/question. What I want actually is to separate the main subject which is being searched in a query . For an example, considering a query like "What is an apple?", it's perfect if the main search word apple can be extracted. This is for a semantic search engine development purpose. Can anyone please suggest a suitable nlp library for this?? Thank You!!
