You might find it easier to use an ASP.Net Repeater instead, and have multiple rows per DataItem. That way, you get complete control over the layout. It's technically possible to use the ASP.Net GridView to do it, but I suspect this wouldn't be the most elegant solution here. The GridView (and Datagrid) were designed out of the box for one row per DataItem. Here is some sample ASP.Net containing a Repeater that illustrates an approach that might work for you: Col 1 Col 2 Col 3 Note that the ItemTemplate contains two HTML table rows, the second of which contains a td with a colspan of 2. Hope that helps a little.
