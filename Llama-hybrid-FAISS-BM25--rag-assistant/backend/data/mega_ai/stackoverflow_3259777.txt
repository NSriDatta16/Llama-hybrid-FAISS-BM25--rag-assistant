Organize windows in a SDI Delphi Application

In an Delphi MDI application i can use the Tile , Cascade and ArrangeIcons procedures to organize my child windows, this methods only works when the FormStyle property is set to fsMDIForm , How i can produce the same effect in an SDI application , i mean how i can organize my open windows in a non MDI application?
