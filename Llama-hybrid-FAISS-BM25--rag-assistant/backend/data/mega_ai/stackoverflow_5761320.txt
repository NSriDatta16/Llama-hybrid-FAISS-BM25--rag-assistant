Android shared preferences assignments not persisting between emulator sessions

I am using the following code to save data to my Android application's shared preferences: private SharedPreferences getOurSharedPreferences() { return getSharedPreferences(SHARED_PREFS_FILENAME, MODE_PRIVATE); } SharedPreferences sharedPrefs = getOurSharedPreferences(); SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPrefs.edit(); editor.putString(keyName, theString); if (!editor.commit()) throw new RuntimeException("Unable to save new string."); // Get it back as a test. String s2 = getStringFromStorage(keyName); Where SHARED_PREFS_FILENAME is a private final static string and keyName is the name of whatever key I'm currently using as a field name. The commit works fine, I don't get an exception. As you can see I added a test that retrieves the recently committed string and when I check it (s2) the value is fine. So I am not having any problems with shared preferences storage during the lifetime of my app. However, when I relaunch the application in the emulator the shared preferences storage area is empty and I can't find the values I stored in the last emulator session. I did some reading and as far as I can see the stored values should persist across sessions, apparently they are saved in an XML file belonging to the emulator. Yet I am having problems. Can anyone tell me why my shared preferences storage values are not persisting between Android emulator sessions? -- roshcler
