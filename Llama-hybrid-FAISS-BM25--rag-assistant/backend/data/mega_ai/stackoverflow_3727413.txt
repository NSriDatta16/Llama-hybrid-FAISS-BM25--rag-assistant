Code generation with JSP is a baaad idea... And this is definatly the worst code generation I've ever seen. That said... lets see if we can fix your mess... First, all those functions are meaningless, your outputting data in your jsp indiscriminatly, the functions actually only slow down performance. So we better just render the array (mainResults) you want right away. var mainResults = [ { count : " ", id : " ", name : " ", manufacturer : " ", description : " ", numretailer : " ", logo : " ", logoh : " ", logow : " ", lowpriceamt : " ", lowpricecur : " ", highpriceamt : " ", highpricecur : " ", ratings : [ { count : " ", type : " ", average : " ", number : " " } , ], retailers : [ { retailers.count : " ", id : " ", name : " ", purchaselink : " ", logo : " ", leadtime : " ", stock : " ", priceamt : " ", pricecur : " ", sourcetype : " ", sourcedate : " ", shipminprice : " ", shipmincur : " ", shipmaxprice : " ", shipmaxcur : " " } , ] } , ]; I might've made some typos, this was a lot of work to fix... But this is a marginally better setup. But for the love of god, look up how to create JSON with Java and create your model in Java and then parse to JSON.
