If you don't want to retrieve the invoicehistory for an invoice inheritance wouldn't do the trick. Even creating an InvoiceBase would not help. If you are using inheritance nhibernate will always return the most complex object that exists in database. So if there is a foreign key in the invoicehistory pointing to an invoice you will alway get the invoicehistory object instead of a simple invoice. This is a fundamental feature of nhibernate. You could excplicitly fetch only the properties of invoice and map them by hand using a ResultTransformer (see Reference for more infos) or create and map a SimpleInvoice object also referencing the invoice table, but with the latter you may face some stales-state issues is you mix Invoice and SimpleInvoice within the same session. Hope this helps.
