All your icons are in the res/drawable directory. So I think the OS is auto-scaling your icons so that they appear as incorrect sizes. They should be split into different directories based on the dpi level the icon is targeted for. 72x72 icons go in res/drawable-hdpi , 48x48 go in res/drawable-mdpi and 36x36 go in res/drawable-ldpi . Note that they should all have the same name. res/drawable-hdpi/ic_menu.png res/drawable-mdpi/ic_menu.png res/drawable-ldpi/ic_menu.png Then in your menu layout just reference the image using @drawable/ic_menu.png . The OS will then figure out which one to use based on the dpi of the device it is running on. And as Joseph Earl says, they shouldn't be 9-patch images.
