The area of machine learning that you would need to learn about to make an attempt at this would be natural language processing. There are a few different approaches that could be used, bayesian networks (something better then a naive bayes classifier), support vector machines, or neural nets would be areas to research. Whatever system you end up building would probably need to use an annotated corpus (labeled set of data) to learn where names should be. Even with a large corpus, whatever you build will not be 100% accurate, so you would probably be better off setting flags at the names for deletion instead of just deleting all of the words that might be names.
