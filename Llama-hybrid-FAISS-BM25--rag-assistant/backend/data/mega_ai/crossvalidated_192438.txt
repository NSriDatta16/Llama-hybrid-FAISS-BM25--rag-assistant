Precision of bone density measurement

I just did a precision study scanning 30 patients twice. The calculator presented the least significant change score, but how do I calculate my precision? For instance, the ISCD states that the minimum acceptable precision for a technologist at the lumbar spine site is 1.9%. How do I calculate my precision? Do I just average the 30 score changes between each patient's scores?
