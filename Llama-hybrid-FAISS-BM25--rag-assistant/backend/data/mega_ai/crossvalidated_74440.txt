There's a mathematical point of view that is very simple. What you have is a projection problem in a Hilbert space, much like projecting a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ onto a subspace. Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ denote the underlying probability space. For the problem to make sense, consider the random variables with finite second moments, that is, the Hilbert space $L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ . The problem now is this: given $X, Y \in L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ , find the projection of $Y$ onto the subspace $L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F}_X, \mu)$ , where $\mathcal{F}_X$ is the $\sigma$ -subalgebra of $\mathcal{F}$ generated by $X$ . (Just as in the finite dimensional case, minimizing $L^2$ -distance to a subspace means finding the projection). The desired projection is $E(Y|X)$ , by construction. (This actually characterizes $E(Y|X)$ , if one inspects the proof of existence). Edit Re "...,by construction." By definition, the conditional mean of $Y$ on $X$ is a random variable $\psi$ with the following two properties: $\psi$ lies in $L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F}_X, \mu)$ . $E[\psi 1_{A}] = E[Y 1_{A}]$ , for all $A \in \mathcal{F}_X$ , which implies that $E[\psi g] = E[Y g]$ , for all $g \in L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F}_X, \mu)$ , by standard argument use denseness of simple functions. Standard Hilbert space projection arguments show that such a $\psi$ always exists and is unique. This applies to any Hilbert space. The above can be re-phrased verbatim for, say, $\mathbb{R}^n$ : Let $Y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $V$ be a subspace. Then the projection of $Y$ onto $V$ is characterized by the same two properties: $\psi$ lies in $V$ . $\langle \psi, g \rangle = \langle Y, g \rangle$ , for all $g \in V$ . Note This discussion is restricted to $L^2$ random variables, as the original question does implicitly. Conditional mean in general is defined for $L^1$ random variables, which is a larger than $L^2$ . $L^1$ is a Banach space and conditional mean is still a projection, in an appropriate sense.
