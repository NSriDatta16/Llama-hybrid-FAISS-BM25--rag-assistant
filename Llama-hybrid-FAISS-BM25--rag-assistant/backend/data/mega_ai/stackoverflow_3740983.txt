Iphone SDK: Use the same UIImageView at different places in a UIIView?

I would add the same UIImageView at different places to my View. So I could make ten UIImageViews with the same image but with other names. But I got ca. 50 UIImageViews . I make my UIImageView with this code: Code: CGRect dragRect = CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 70.0, 70.0); dragRect.origin = CGPointMake(10, 300); UIImageView *image = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:dragRect]; [image setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"Apple.png"]]; [self.view addSubview:image; Now I would like to change my dracRect.origin point and make a new UIImageView with another name. I would do this in a for loop. Is this possible? Code: int x; for (x=0; x>=3; x=x+1) { CGRect dragRect = CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 70.0, 70.0); //x koordinate wird immer 10 gr√∂sser dragRect.origin = CGPointMake(x*10, 300); //image1, image2, image3 NSString *string1 = [[string1 alloc] initWithFormat:@"image%d",x]; UIImageView *string1 = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:dragRect]; [string1 setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"Apple.png"]]; [self.view addSubview:string1; } Update: I tried it with image%i and with image%d but I get an error: conflicting types of 'string1'
