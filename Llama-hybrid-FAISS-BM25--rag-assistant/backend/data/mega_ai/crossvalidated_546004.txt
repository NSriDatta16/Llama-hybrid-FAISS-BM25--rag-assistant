What type of variable is file size?

Variables can be discrete or continuous. Discrete variables are variables obtained by counting. Continuous variables are generated by measuring something. My variable is "file size" and I believe that this is discrete (smallest measurement unit is one bit). I have read several questions that address types of statistical variables and followed recommended links and now I am confused :). Discrete data are numeric data that have a finite number of possible values. For example my dataset contains data from my disc and smallest file is less than 1 KB and biggest is 7 GB.... but if I think about variable globally as file size it is more limited to storage space. So if there is no upper limit is this a discrete variable? I want to make bins and count my files to see file distribution on my disk. I believe that if I have some time variable (Continuous data .. this is for sure), and use this variable to track something through time it s continuous data (stock market), but if I count how many events happened in time window that this is discrete variable - is this misleading? +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ extension Regarding my dilemma about file size measure. I collected data from one workstation (pc14) about user file size. And according to some previouse research try to fit this data to some distribution from continuous family of distributions. Previous research suggested to use lognormal distribution, while other used mixture of Pareto and lognormal. I did find that Frechet is closest to my dataset but still with high AIC. When I tryed to generate dataset with estimated parameters KS test showed real small P value. Then I observed this as discrete variable. And this are results. > descdist(pc14, discrete = TRUE, boot = 5000) summary statistics ------ min: 714 max: 23599220 median: 54778 mean: 159834.3 estimated sd: 657485.3 estimated skewness: 18.40947 estimated kurtosis: 496.2262 > fitnb $start.arg $ start.arg$size [1] 0.05911125 $start.arg$ mu [1] 159834.3 $fix.arg NULL >s1 $estimate["size"], mu = fitnb$ estimate["mu"]) > chisq.test(s1,pc14) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: s1 and pc14 X-squared = 5267748, df = 5264535, p-value = 0.1611 Warning message: In chisq.test(s1, pc14) : Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect I know that 16% is not high, but H0 can be accepted if p > 0.05% , that data coming from same distribution. My dilemma is greater now :) is this prof that file size is discrete value (since I managed to map to find better match with discrete distribution), or I misinterpret the data and results?
