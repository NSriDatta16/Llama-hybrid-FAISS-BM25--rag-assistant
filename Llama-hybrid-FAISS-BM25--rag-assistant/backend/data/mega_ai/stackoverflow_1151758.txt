We have deployed a large-scale commercial app in the AWS environment. There are three basic approaches to keeping your changes under control once the server is running, all of which we use in different situations: Keep the changes in source control. Have a script that is part of your original image that can pull down the latest and greatest. You can pull down PHP code, Apache settings, whatever you need. If you need to restart your instance from your AMI (Amazon Machine Image), just run your script to get the latest code and configuration, and you're good to go. Use EBS (Elastic Block Storage). EBS is like a big external hard drive that you can attach to your instance. Even if your instance goes away, EBS survives. If you later need two (or more) identical instances, you can give each one of them access to what you save in EBS. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/3630707/141172 Burn a new AMI after each change. There's a tool to create a new AMI from a running instance. If EBS is like having an external hard drive, creating a new AMI is like having a DVD-R. You can save the current state of your machine to it. Next time you have to start a new instance, base it on that new AMI. Good to go.
