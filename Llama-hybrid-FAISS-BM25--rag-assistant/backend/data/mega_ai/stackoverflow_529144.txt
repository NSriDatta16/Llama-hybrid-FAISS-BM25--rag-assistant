Average a time value in SQL Sever 2005

I've got a varchar field in SQL Sever 2005 that's storing a time value in the format "hh:mm"ss.mmmm". What I really want to do is take the average using the built in aggregate function of those time values. However, this: SELECT AVG(TimeField) FROM TableWithTimeValues doesn't work, since (of course) SQL won't average varchars. However, this SELECT AVG(CAST(TimeField as datetime)) FROM TableWithTimeValues also doesn't work. As near as I can tell, SQL doesn't know how to convert a value with only time and no date into a datetime field. I've tried a wide variety of things to get SQL to turn that field into a datetime, but so far, no luck. Can anyone suggest a better way?
