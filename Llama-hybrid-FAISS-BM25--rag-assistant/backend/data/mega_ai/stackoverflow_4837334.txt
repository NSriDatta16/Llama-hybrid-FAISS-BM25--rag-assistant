robots.txt in subdirectory

I have a project that lies in a folder below the main domain, and I dont have access to the root of the domain itself. http://mydomain.com/myproject/ I want to disallow indexing on the subfolder "forbidden" http://mydomain.com/myproject/forbidden/ Can I simply put a robots.txt in the myproject folder? Will it get read even if there is no robots.txt in the root? What is the correct syntax for disallowing the forbidden folder? User-agent: * Disallow: /forbidden/ or User-agent: * Disallow: forbidden/
