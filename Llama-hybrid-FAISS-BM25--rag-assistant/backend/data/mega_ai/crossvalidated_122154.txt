(add a statistical answer complementary to my political comment on top) We have reasonable suspicion that the 'prefer not to says' are not missing at random. We think that the probability of an individual selecting 'prefer not to say' will be higher for individuals who are homosexuals, bisexuals and other(s) Here one wants to reduce the 'prefer not to says' answers to other categories in a statisticaly correct and significant manner. This would be correct under the following conditions: 1) The rest options are independent and elementary events of the sample space 2) The rest options partition the sample space completely (and representatively) 3) The prior probabilities of the rest options can be infered indepentantly Then one can indeed reduce the 'prefer not to say' answers (or other types in same vain) to the elementary options (partitions) using the answer data to calibrate the reduction (within a statistical significant range) For the example question given (and similar examples given in comments) this is not so. If one insists on that effectively endorses the truism that " there are lies, big lies and statistics ". From wikipedia Statistical Imputation [M]ost statistical packages default to discarding any case that has a missing value, which may introduce bias or affect the representativeness of the results i would prefer not to even take such questionares no matter how they are marketed. Let me give another similar example that makes the previous paragraph explicit: If you draft for the war in Iraq: a) Go to front line b) Go to back line c) Goto paramedics d) Prefer not to answer. Better not even take these questionaires!
