Android SDK, Placeing widgets/buttons etc at will?

Hey Im new to android developing and I have a quick question. Is there a way to place buttons where I want them on the view? Right now they only seem to be placed where there is specific spots for them. Why cant i drag and place them where ever I want like in the iphone sdk for example? Is there a way to do so or does this functionality not exist? thanks.
