BlackBerry persistent object /storage nuance question

I'm using PS to store data in my app. I think I have a misunderstanding of how PS works. If anyone could tell me how to make it so that the bill I retrieve from PS is unencrypted as opposed to the encrypted bill I end up with? Note: I originally store and unencrypted bill! From what I can tell, it considers both bills, and both PO objects to be the same objects! When I look at their memory locations in Eclispe, both bill and both PO objects have identical memory locations! What am I missing? Thanks! //create an unencrypted bill BillDAO testBill = new BillDAO(); //store it in PS PersistentObject po = PersistentStore.getPersistentObject(4); po.setContents(testBill); po.forceCommit(); //encrypt the bill testBill.encrypt(); //retrieve it from PS using a different PO PersistentObject po2 = PersistentStore.getPersistentObject(4); BillDAO retrievedBill = (BillDAO) po2.getContents(); //and now for some reason my retrieved bill is encrypted! //it should be unencrypted
