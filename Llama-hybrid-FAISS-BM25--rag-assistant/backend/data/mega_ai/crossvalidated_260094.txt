Output of SVM classification always gives same label when using Leave-One-Out cross-validation

I've trained a SVM in a slightly unbalanced dataset (class '0' frequency is 1.38 times higher than class '1') so I was using a StratifiedKFold cross-validation to measure my classifier's performance. As my dataset is very small, I wanted to to use Leave-One-Out. But, as soon as I tried it, I noticied that something was wrong: StratifiedKFold (k=5): Precision: 0.84 (std: 0.13) Accuracy: 0.83 (std: 0.10) Leave-One-Out: Precision: 0.00 (std: 0.00) Accuracy: 0.57 (std: 0.50) A quick inspection revealed to me that this happened because the classifier always gave the same label to the validation samples (class 0). The same happened when I used Gradient Boost classification method.
