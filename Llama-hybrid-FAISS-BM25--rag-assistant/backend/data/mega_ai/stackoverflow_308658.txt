In a by the book setting you won't use real time for calculation of the burndown chart but rather story points. After a few sprint you will see an average velocity and thus be able to generate a burndown chart and use this velocity for commiting to the sprint items. And I strongly disagree with warrens post on the scale-down point. The main problem I see is a strongly varying velocity between two sprints, since it is only a hobby.
