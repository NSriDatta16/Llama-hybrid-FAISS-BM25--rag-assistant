The answer to your original question is yes for the reasons given that any Component can be added to a Container. The reason you don't see the second label is because by default a JLabel uses a null layout manager and the size of the second label is (0, 0) so there is nothing to paint. So all you need to do is set the bounds of the second label and away you go. You can't use a layout manager if you want to drag components around because as soon as you resize the frame etc, the layout manager will be invoked and the components will be repositioned based on the layout manager of the component.
