Porting a tomcat web project from eclipse ganymede to intellij 8.1

I have a standard (I think) web project developed with the eclipse IDE. I wish to port it to Intellij idea 8.1 - I think that, among other things, it has better taglib support. My project structure is as follows: Project Folder ./src [java source files etc.] ./conf [configuration files - log4j, spring beans...] ./buid [ant files] ./WebContent ./WebContent/images [image files] ./WebContent/META-INF ./WebContent/META-INF/context.xml ./WebContent/pages [.jsp+.html files] ./WebContent/scripts [.js files] ./WebContent/skins [.css files] ./WebContent/WEB-INF ./WebContent/WEB-INF/classes [.class files] ./WebContent/WEB-INF/lib [.jar files] ./WebContent/WEB-INF/tags [.tag files] ./WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml I can't seem to get this project configured with my local tomcat server (version: apache-tomcat-6.0.18). I think that a good answer would be a standard, step by step, cookbook answer as to how to port (and perhaps how to correctly define a tomcat web application within intellij idea). Thanks all!
