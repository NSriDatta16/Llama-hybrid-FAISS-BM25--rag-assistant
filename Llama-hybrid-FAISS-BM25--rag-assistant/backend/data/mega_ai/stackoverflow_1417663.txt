doing textwrap and dedent in Windows Powershell (or dotNet aka .net)

Background Python has "textwrap" and "dedent" functions. They do pretty much what you expect to any string you supply. textwrap.wrap(text[, width[, ...]]) Wraps the single paragraph in text (a string) so every line is at most width characters long. Returns a list of output lines, without final newlines. textwrap.dedent(text) Remove any common leading whitespace from every line in text. http://docs.python.org/library/textwrap.html Question: How do you do this in Windows PowerShell, (or with .NET methods you call from PowerShell)?
