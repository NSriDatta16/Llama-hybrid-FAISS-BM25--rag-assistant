There is no guarantee that this is possible. Adobe supports Flash/Air on a specific set of devices only. http://www.adobe.com/flashplatform/certified_devices/ I don't mean to be discouraging, but here is my experience: back in the day (i.e. Nov 2010) Adobe made available a public beta of "Flash Pro Extension for Air" (this has since been removed from the Adobe site; see http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashpro_extensionforair/ ). That release contained two Air runtimes: one for physical devices and one for the emulator. I remember that the emulator runtime would only work in avd's running Android 2.2 (neither 2.1 nor 2.3 worked). What I'm trying to say is that this stuff is finicky. I wish you luck, but do not think you will get it to work. In particular, Flash may well check for an ARM v7 processor, which the Android-x86 environment does not have. http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/systemreqs/#mobile Here's a little more info; the android-x86 forums are probably a better place to look for help on this than SO: http://groups.google.com/group/android-x86/browse_thread/thread/a5bba0d781773928/7abafab2f9cca714?lnk=gst&q=flash#7abafab2f9cca714 Edit: I like your thinking in re Logitech Revue, but I suspect the Google TV folks just cobbled together a stripped-down flv streamer, not a full, swf-capable flash player. Edit: Any chance you could work with Wallaby? http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/wallaby/ Edit: Maybe try asking Veronique Brossier? (author of "Developing Android Apps w/Adobe Air") email address at top right of this page: http://www.flashgoddess.com/html/spotVBrossier.html Edit: Two other factoids for your edification... Last week Adobe announced CS5.5, with previously beta Android support now officially rolled in. Obviously, this does nothing solve your problem, but should give you some idea of Adobe's strategy (HTML5, multiplatform...). I very much like the suggestion that you buy a device--no one develops for Android for long without one. The "problem" here is that Virgin Mobile's deal is by far the best, but with one big catch: the LG Optimus V does not support Flash/Air. The fact that non-Flash-capable phones are still being sold like hotcakes was one of the factors that made me drop Flash for my current projects. That was painful, but sometimes life is tough. :-)
