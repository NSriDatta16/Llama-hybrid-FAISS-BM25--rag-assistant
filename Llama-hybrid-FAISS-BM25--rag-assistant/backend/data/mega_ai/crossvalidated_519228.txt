Yes, to keep it simple, you can request that the standardized residuals be determined during the regression run. Any standardized residual less than -1.96 or greater than 1.96 will be an outlier. The question you are asking addresses the topic of Regression Diagnostics, which focuses on different types of residuals, and goodness-of-fit (e.g. $R^2$ ) of a regression model. Residuals are basically observations that are "overly influential" on the regression model. One of my favorite types of residuals are called leverage residuals , which are observations whose $x/y$ values "pull too much" on the fitted regression line. This can occur with e.g. a cluster of observations that are far removed from the rest of the bulk of the data. Cook's distance is another type of residual, as well as deletion residuals, studentized residuals, DFFITS, and DFBETAS. But for starters, you should focus on standardized using the criterion of $\pm 2$ .
