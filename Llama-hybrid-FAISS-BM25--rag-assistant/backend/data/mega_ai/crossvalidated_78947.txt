If you include all variables you will almost surely get high collinearity. In my view, the best diagnostic for this is the condition index; however, with non-continuous variables you may be better served by something like the 'perturb' package in R . Or, you can just assume the models would have a problem. (Especially since the levels of condition index that are problematic for logistic regression are, as far as I know, not well established). You can compare models with different combinations of variables: a) Income only b) Family size only c) Income and family size and d) Tier. I would base model comparison at least in part on substantive concerns; supplemented with AIC or BIC or some other IC. However, by excluding tier you can also look at interactions among income and family size.
