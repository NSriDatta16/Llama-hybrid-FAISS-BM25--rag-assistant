You need to parse the JSON-string into a Javascript object first. Most browser nowadays have a native support for that in window.JSON . var myObj = JSON.parse('{"ga:visits":"59","ga:pageviews":"117","ga:timeOnSite":"4775.0","average_time_on_site_formatted":"0:01:20","pages_per_visit":"1.98"}'); After that, you can just loop over the keys : for(var key in myObj) { console.log(key, ' is: ', myObj[key]); } If you want to use that in "old'ish" browsers, like IE7 and below you need to use the json2.js from http://www.json.org to have the same functionality.
