I wouldn't go there either. Especially not through the BDC. If you have to integrate with relational data you might as well do that directly from your .NET workflow code. You could still leverage SharePoint for initiating workflows and maintaining Tasks lists, etc. If your data is relational.. put it in a relational database. It's good with that.
