There is a very simple solution to heteroskedasticity issue associated with dependent variables within time series data. I don't know if this is applicable to your dependent variable. Assuming it is, instead of using nominal Y change it to % change in Y from the current period over the prior period. For instance, let's say your nominal Y is GDP of $14 trillion in the most current period. Instead, compute the change in GDP over the most recent period (let's say 2.5%). A nominal time series always grows and is always heteroskedastic (the variance of the error grows over time because the values grow). A % change series is typically homoskedastic because the dependent variable is pretty much stationary.
