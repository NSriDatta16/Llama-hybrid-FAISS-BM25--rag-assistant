What does the degree of freedom (df) mean in the results of log-likelihood `logLik`

After doing the regression using lm for fixed effect model or lmer for mixed effects model, I pass the results to the logLik . Besides the value of log-likelihood, the function always returns a df , i.e. the degree of freedom. However, the degree of freedom does not equal to the number of parameters in the model, df always larger. So what does the df mean exactly? The reason I care about the df is that later I will use the BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) to do the model selection. The BIC is defined as BIC=-2*logLik+k*log(n) where k is the number of parameters and n is the number of observations. When I pass my logLik value to the expression of BIC , the result is exactly the same when I use the build in BIC function in R if I specify the number of parameters as the df in logLik . Which means, in the build in BIC function, they also use the df as k when they calculate BIC .
