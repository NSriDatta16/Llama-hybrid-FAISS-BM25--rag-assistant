Consider this quote from p. 36 of Darcy Olsen's book The Right to Try [1]: But about sixteen weeks after the [eteplirsen] infusions began, Jenn started noticing changes in [her son] Max. "The kid stopped wanting to use his wheelchair," she says. A few weeks later, he was asking to play outside — something he had not done in years. Then Max started regaining his fine motor skills. He was able to open containers again — a skill he had lost as his [Duchenne muscular dystrophy] had progressed. Max's mother Jenn is building a coherent picture of his improvement, by pulling together evidence from multiple outcomes that individually might be dismissed as 'noise', but that together are quite compelling. (This evidence synthesis principle is part of the reason pediatricians as a rule never dismiss a parent's instinctive inferences that "something is wrong with my child". Parents have access to a 'multivariate longitudinal analysis' of their kids far richer than the 'oligovariate' cross-sectional analysis accessible to a clinician during a single, brief clinical encounter.) Abstracting away from the particular case of eteplirsen, consider a hypothetical situation where only a small fraction of study subjects were benefitting from an experimental therapy, let's say because of some shared genetic factor not yet known to science. It's quite possible that for those few subjects, a statistical argument corresponding to Jenn's multivariate story could clearly identify them as 'responders', whereas multiple separate analyses of the faint signals contained in individual outcomes would each yield $p>0.05$, driving a 'null' summative conclusion. Achieving such evidence synthesis is the core rationale for multivariate outcomes analysis in clinical trials. Statistical Methods in Medical Research had a special issue a few years back [2] devoted to 'Joint Modeling' of multivariate outcomes. Olsen, Darcy.
