Dirt simple way to create a classifier: Hand read and bucket N example documents from the 100K into each one of your 10 topics. Generally, the more example documents the better. Create a Lucene/Sphinx index with 10 documents corresponding to each topic. Each document will contain all of the example documents for that topic concatenated together. To classify a document, submit that document as a query by making every word an OR term. You'll almost always get all 10 results back. Lucene/Sphinx will assign a score to each result, which you can interpret as the document's "similarity" to each topic. Might not be super-accurate, but it's easy if you don't want to go through the trouble of training a real Naive Bayes classifier. If you want to go that route you can Google for WEKA or MALLET, two good machine learning libraries.
