PyScripter - cannot termiate Run with KeyboardInterrupt

I write alot of small apps where I use try: print "always does this until I Ctrl+C" Except KeyboardInterrupt: print "finish program" I've just began to move away from using IDLE and booted up PyScripter. However CTRL+C no longer works. Is it possible to still send in a KeyboardInterrupt while using the built-in interpreter?
