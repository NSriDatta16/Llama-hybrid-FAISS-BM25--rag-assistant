Can we generate HPD regions from MCMC draws using convex hulls?

I thought of a procedure to generate high probability density regions with probability $1-\alpha$ from $n$ MCMC draws: Find the $\lfloor(1-\alpha)\cdot n\rfloor$ draws with the largest probability density; Take the confidence hull of these draws as an approximate HPD region. Is this procedure correct? I believe it only works when the distribution is convex (or maybe log-convex, I'm not sure). I think this is a more flexible approach than using Mahalanobis distance, since the resulting region is convex but not ellipsoidal, and requires less tuning than kernel density based methods. Thanks in advance!
