.NET: IsolatedStorageException

I'm building a Windows Phone 7 app in Silverlight. I'm having difficulty with IsolatedStorage . IsolatedStorageFile storage = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); if (!storage.FileExists(STORIES_FILE)) { storage.CreateFile(STORIES_FILE); } string contents; // fails here using (IsolatedStorageFileStream stream = storage.OpenFile(STORIES_FILE, FileMode.Open)) { using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(stream)) { contents = reader.ReadToEnd(); } } The exception is: "Operation not permitted on IsolatedStorageFileStream." System.Exception {System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageException} What could I be doing wrong here? MSDN says that this exception is thrown when the isolated storage is removed or disabled. Could that have happened? I'm experiencing this problem on the emulator. Update : This appears to only happen the first time I'm running the app on the emulator. After the app crashes, I run it on the emulator again, and this problem doesn't occur. Update 2 : Using FileMode.OpenOrCreate instead of FileMode.Open appears to have solved the problem.
