Magento Point of Sale Integration

I am currently building a Magento (Community Edition) site for a customer who needs Magento to sync with their inventory software, and I am having a very hard time figuring this out. I have searched everywhere and can not find an answer. So far the best I have found is that Magento can connect to Quickbooks using eCC. However, I have read that Quickbooks sucks and that eCC is a pretty poor program (as in, it sucks too). The client is willing to use any POS/RMS software. i.e. Microsoft Dyanimcs, Sage, etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
