There's a number of surveys of data science field. I like this one, because it attempts to analyze the profiles of people who actually hold data science jobs. Instead of using anecdotal evidence or author's biases, they use data science techniques to analyze data scientist DNA. It's quite revealing to look at the skills listed by data scientists. Notice the top 20 skills contain a lot of IT skills. In today’s world, a data scientist is expected to be a jack of all trades; a self-learner who has a solid quantitative foundation, an aptitude for programming, infinite intellectual curiosity, and great communication skills. UPDATE: I am a statistician, but am I a data scientist? I work on scientific problems so I must be a scientist! If you do PhD you're most likely a scientist already, especially, if you have published papers and active research. You don't need to be a scientist to be a data scientist, though. There are some roles at some firms, like Walmart (see below), where PhD is required, but usually data scientists have BS and MS degrees as you can see from examples below. As you can figure from the chart above, most likely, you'll be required to have good programming and data handling skills. Also, often data science is associated with some level, often "deep", of expertise in machine learning. You certainly may call yourself a data scientist if you have PhD in stats. However, PhD in computer science from top schools may be more competitive than stats graduates, because they may have quite strong applied statistics knowledge which is supplemented by strong programming skills - a sought after combination by employers. To counter them you have to acquire strong programming skills, so in a balance you'll be very competitive. What's interesting is that usually all stat PhDs will have some programming experience, but in data science often the requirement is much higher than that, employers want advanced skills, knowledge of algorithms and data structures, distributed computing etc. To me the advantage of having a PhD in stats is in the problem captured in the rest of the phrase "a jack of all trades" that is usually dropped: "a master of none". It's good to have people that know a little a bit of everything, but I always look for folks who know something deeply too, whether it's stats or computer science is not so important. What matters is that the guy is capable of getting to the bottom, it's a handy quality when you need it. The survey also lists the top employers of data scientists. Microsoft is on the top, apparently, which was surprising to me. If you want to get a better idea of what they're looking for, searching LinkeIn with "data science" in the Jobs section is helpful. Below is two excerpts from MS and Walmart's jobs in LinkedIn to make a point. Microsoft Data Scientist 5+ years of Software Development experience in building Data Processing Systems/Services Bachelors or higher qualifications in Computer Science, EE, or Math with specialization in Statistics, Data Mining or Machine Learning. Excellent Programming Skills (C#, Java, Python, Etc.) in manipulating large scale data Working knowledge of Hadoop or other Big Data processing technology Knowledge of analytics products (e.g. R, SQL AS, SAS, Mahout, etc.) is a plus. Notice, how knowing stat packages is just a plus, but excellent programming skills in Java is a requirement. Walmart, Data Scientist PhD in computer science or similar field or MS with at least 2-5 years of related experience Good functional coding skills in C++ or Java (Java is highly preferred) must be capable of spending up to 10% daily work day in writing production code in either C++/Java/Hadoop/Hive Expert level knowledge of one of the scripting languages such as Python or Perl. Experience working with large data sets and distributed computing tools a plus (Map/Reduce, Hadoop, Hive, Spark etc.) Here, PhD is preferred, but only computer science major is named. Distributed computing with Hadoop or Spark is probably an unusual skill for a statistician, but some theoretical physicists and applied mathematicians use similar tools. UPDATE 2: "It’s Already Time to Kill the “Data Scientist” Title" says Thomas Davenport who co-wrote the article in Harvard Business Review in 2012 titled "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century" that sort of started the data scientist craze: What does it mean today to say your are—or want to be, or want to hire—a “data scientist?” Not much, unfortunately.
