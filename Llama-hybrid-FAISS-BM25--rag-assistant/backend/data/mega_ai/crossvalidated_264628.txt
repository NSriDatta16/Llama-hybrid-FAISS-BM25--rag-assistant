Identifying multicollinearity of categorical variables in a logistic regression

I am doing a logistic regression where all of my independent variables are categorical variables. Where some of the assumptions that a linear regression model makes can be waived for a logistic regression model, multicollinearity is still something that is to be tested for the sample data. How do I quantify the multicollinearity between several categorical variables? I looked into the available questions/answers here regarding this, few suggesting trying to fit an ill-fitted linear regression and look at the VIF to decide. Would it be enough? Or, is there any other specific methods for this purpose? Any suggestion is highly appreciated. Thank you in advance.
