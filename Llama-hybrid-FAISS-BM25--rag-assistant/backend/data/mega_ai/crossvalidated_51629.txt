Multiple curves when plotting a random forest

I performed a random forest using the randomForest package. I know that if I plot the random forest using the plot() command, I should get back a graph with number of trees on the x-axis, and estimated error rate on the y-axis, but when I actually plot it, I get multiple curves, all of them start quite high, as expected and drop as the number of trees increase. Well, what do they mean? I assume they are just different measurements, e.g. one is the oob error rate , another is the misclass error rate and so forth, but how can I extract that information and/or filter the undesired curves?
