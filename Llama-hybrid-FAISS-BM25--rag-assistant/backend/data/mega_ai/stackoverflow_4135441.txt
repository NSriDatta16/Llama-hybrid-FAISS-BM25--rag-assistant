jquery sortable connected lists and selectable together?

I have 2 lists and I am using the sortable feature - works great. But I also need to be able to select multiple items and drag those to the connected list as well. I have 100's of items in a given list and dragging 1 at a time is a bit painful. Has anyone achieved this?
