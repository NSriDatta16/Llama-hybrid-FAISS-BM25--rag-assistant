Fade out and fade in not working in Opera

Please forgive me since I'm new to Jquery/Javascript. I've created a simple code that seems to work fine in: IE9, Firefox, Safari, Chrome. But for some reason its not working in Opera. The #loader div doesn't seem to fade away. This is the code: $(window).load(function () { $("#loader").delay(4000).fadeOut("slow"); $("p").delay(5000).fadeIn("slow"); }); The code functions as follows. Load page, (wait until all content/images are loaded before running function). Wait 4 seconds then fade out #loader div. Finally fade in paragraph after 5 seconds. Thanks in advance!
