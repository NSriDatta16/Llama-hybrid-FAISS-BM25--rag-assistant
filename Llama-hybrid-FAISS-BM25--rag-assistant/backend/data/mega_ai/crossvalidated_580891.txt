Implementing Logistic Regression using Ridge in R but getting negative outputs?

I am trying to implement some logistic regression using ridge in R for predicting company bankrupcy using a subset of this data but despite my best efforts and various lecture notes/online tutorials, the probability predictions it is outputting include some negative values. As far as I can see I am doing everything correctly to implement a logistic regression instead of a linear but I must be missing something. My code is below, I would really appreciate any ideas from anyone. #split to test and training data set.seed(42) s $class) y.test class) #apply ridge regression cv.ridge
