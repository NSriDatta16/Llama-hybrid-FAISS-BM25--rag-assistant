If you have plenty of examples of images combination, what you can do is using Deep Learning models with CNNs in order to assess if two images are compatible for combination or not: i.e. Supervised learning. The model would take two images as input and would output a probability of being combined together. It can be useful to find the most probable candidates for combining with a given image in a very big database
