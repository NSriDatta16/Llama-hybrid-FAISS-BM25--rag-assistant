you can set up one of them as ntp server which will broadcast its time on the local network and the others as slaves to listen on the local network edit: I missed the average part. well, in that case, you can probably write a script on the local server to collect times from all the slaves get the average and update own time with that value. You may even want to get rid of ntp in that case and just use the script to update time on all the servers
