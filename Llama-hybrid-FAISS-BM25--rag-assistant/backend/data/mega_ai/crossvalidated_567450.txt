Modelling the expected delay of a flight. Should I use logistic regression or linear regression?

I have a dataset of flight information such as carrier, data and hour of flight, I do not have weather on this dataset yet, but I am for an external source to add to it. The dataset contains info of a year, and about 6mi different flights. I want to predict the expected delay in minutes of a given flight. The delay column contains positive and negative delays (which means that the flight departed earlier). So my question is, should I simply apply a linear regression to predict the delay? Or should I maybe use a log. reg. to predict the probability of delay and a lin. reg. to predict the expected delay and multiply the probabilities?
