Sounds like you're trying to simulate a ToString method, although some of your terminology is a little confusing. You can simulate it like this: {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances, OverlappingInstances, FlexibleInstances, TypeSynonymInstances #-} class ToString a where toString :: a -> String instance ToString String where toString = id instance Show a => ToString a where toString = show However, as shown by the LANGUAGE pragmas, this is not very desirable. To really get a feel for what you're trying to do it would be easier if we had more context...
