Consider someone doing target practice with a shotgun, which shoots bursts of pellets in the direction of the barrel. Null Hypothesis: I'm a good shooter, and my barrel is perfectly on target. Not left, not right, but straight at it. My error is 0. Alternate Hypothesis: I'm a bad shooter, and my barrel is off target. Just left or just right of the target. My error is e>0 or e Since any measurement has a certain average error (i.e. standard error), a measurement that says "off target" is possible, even if I'm shooting straight. I'll need to not "hit" my target (at all, even with each shot being a burst/spread) a certain number of times, before you can call me a bad shooter and choose the Alternate Hypothesis.
