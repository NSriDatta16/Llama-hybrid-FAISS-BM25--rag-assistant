The Bayesian interpretation of probability is a degree-of-belief interpretation. A Bayesian may say that the probability that there was life on Mars a billion years ago is $1/2$. A frequentist will refuse to assign a probability to that proposition. It is not something that could be said to be true in half of all cases, so one cannot assign probability $1/2$.
