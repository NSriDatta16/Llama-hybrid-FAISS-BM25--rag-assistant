Getting RINGING response on SIP UAC without sending it from the other UAC

I hope this would be my last question about this SIP subject, I have managed to overcome the last issue I had by asking a friend to help me from a remote computer, I'm able to connect between the computers, but here is the thing, according to all the examples I saw, the Callee should invoke the Ringing response, but in my application case I didn't implement it yet, but I still receive on the Caller UAC a Ringing response, this is the SIP messages that are on the caller end: Outgoing Request 5: INVITE sip:320@hostName.hn SIP/2.0 Contact: "Client 310" From: "Client 310" Max-Forwards: 32 CSeq: 2 INVITE Call-ID: f8d171d3278788df9e03eb9cf3acba70@xxx.xxx.x.xxx Allow: INVITE,CANCEL,ACK,BYE,OPTIONS Content-Type: application/sdp Proxy-Authorization: Digest username="310",nonce="012afffb",realm="asterisk",uri="sip:310@hostName.hn",algorithm=MD5,response="d19ca5b98450b4be7bd4045edb8a3a2f" Via: SIP/2.0/UDP hostName.hn:5060 To: "Client 320" ;tag=as5a8fa200 Content-Length: 257 v=0 o=310 7108915969559970847 7108915969559970847 IN IP4 xxx.xxx.x.xxx s=- i=Nu-Art Software - TacB0sS VoIP information c=IN IP4 xxx.xxx.x.xxx m=audio 3312 RTP/AVP 0 8 101 a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000 a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000 a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000 Incoming Response 6: SIP/2.0 100 Trying Via: SIP/2.0/UDP hostName.hn:5060;branch=f8d171d3278788df9e03eb9cf3acba70-xxx.xxx.x.xxx-2-invite-hostName.hn-5060333732;received=79.181.6.233 From: "Client 310" To: "Client 320" ;tag=as5a8fa200 Call-ID: f8d171d3278788df9e03eb9cf3acba70@xxx.xxx.x.xxx CSeq: 2 INVITE User-Agent: Freeswitch 1.2.3 Allow: INVITE,ACK,CANCEL,OPTIONS,BYE,REFER,SUBSCRIBE,NOTIFY,INFO Supported: replaces Contact: Content-Length: 0 Incoming Response 7: SIP/2.0 180 Ringing Via: SIP/2.0/UDP hostName.hn:5060;branch=f8d171d3278788df9e03eb9cf3acba70-xxx.xxx.x.xxx-2-invite-hostName.hn-5060333732;received=79.181.6.233 From: "Client 310" To: "Client 320" ;tag=as5a8fa200 Call-ID: f8d171d3278788df9e03eb9cf3acba70@xxx.xxx.x.xxx CSeq: 2 INVITE User-Agent: Freeswitch 1.2.3 Allow: INVITE,ACK,CANCEL,OPTIONS,BYE,REFER,SUBSCRIBE,NOTIFY,INFO Supported: replaces Contact: Content-Length: 0 Call to: 320@hostName.hn is Ringing Incoming Response 8: SIP/2.0 183 Session Progress Via: SIP/2.0/UDP hostName.hn:5060;branch=f8d171d3278788df9e03eb9cf3acba70-xxx.xxx.x.xxx-2-invite-hostName.hn-5060333732;received=79.181.6.233 From: "Client 310" To: "Client 320" ;tag=as5a8fa200 Call-ID: f8d171d3278788df9e03eb9cf3acba70@xxx.xxx.x.xxx CSeq: 2 INVITE User-Agent: Freeswitch 1.2.3 Allow: INVITE,ACK,CANCEL,OPTIONS,BYE,REFER,SUBSCRIBE,NOTIFY,INFO Supported: replaces Contact: Content-Type: application/sdp Content-Length: 264 v=0 o=root 27669 27669 IN IP4 yy.yy.yy.yy s=session c=IN IP4 yy.yy.yy.yy t=0 0 m=audio 10914 RTP/AVP 0 8 101 a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000 a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000 a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000 a=fmtp:101 0-16 a=silenceSupp:off - - - - a=ptime:20 a=sendrecv Incoming Response 9: SIP/2.0 503 Service Unavailable Via: SIP/2.0/UDP hostName.hn:5060;branch=f8d171d3278788df9e03eb9cf3acba70-xxx.xxx.x.xxx-2-invite-hostName.hn-5060333732;received=79.181.6.233 From: "Client 310" To: "Client 320" ;tag=as5a8fa200 Call-ID: f8d171d3278788df9e03eb9cf3acba70@xxx.xxx.x.xxx CSeq: 2 INVITE User-Agent: Freeswitch 1.2.3 Allow: INVITE,ACK,CANCEL,OPTIONS,BYE,REFER,SUBSCRIBE,NOTIFY,INFO Supported: replaces Content-Length: 0 I do not respond to the invite, that is why all this is happening, but why am I getting a ringing if I'm not the one sending it. Thanks, Adam. Update: If you will notice the times that I get the responses: Incoming Response 7: 1275879030656 Ringing Incoming Response 8: 1275879038734 Session Progress Incoming Response 9: 1275879038781 Service Unavailable I don't understand the logic here, I have 8 sec from the first Ringing to the session progress, but from the Session Progress to the Service Unavailable I have 47ms? How does this makes sense? 50 ms to do what? time to analyze the response + time to open an RTP session + time to construct a response + time to construct SDP + time it takes the server to receive the message - the time it takes the 503 message to arrive to my UAC, isn't this cutting little close? at which point am I suppose to response to the server? Thanks again for all your help Wiz.
