html5 offline storage for Windows Mobile 6.1 or an alternative?

I understand that there are no browsers currently which support offline storage for mobile 6.1. I am trying to find a web form based solution avoiding the loss of data when my device has no connectivity. Have ruled out Gears and would like to avoid a win forms application as the forms change so often. Are there any other approaches that I should look at which are viable in C#? Are there any estimated dates for when we might see a browser for mobile 6.1 which can offer offline storage? Thanks
