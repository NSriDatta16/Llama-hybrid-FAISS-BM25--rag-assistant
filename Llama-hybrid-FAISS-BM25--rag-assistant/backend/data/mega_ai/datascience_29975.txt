How to deal with skewed imbalanced image dataset to work with CNN?

I am working on multi-class classification problem on an image dataset. There is one class with 80% of the images and rest 20% is divided into rest 6 remaining classes. If I have to apply the image-augmentation technique, what ratio of count of images between each class I have to maintain?
