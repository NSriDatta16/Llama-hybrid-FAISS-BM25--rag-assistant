I want to highlight the containing the 3rd radio button for each question. Use start with ^ selector with nth-child like this: $('p[id^="question"]:nth-child(3)').addClass('correct'); What ^="question" does is that it selects all paragraphs starting with question text in their ids and then nth-child(3) is used to select the third paragraph.
