Where can I download an earlier version of iOS for backwards compatibility testing?

Does anyone know where I can download iOS version 3.1.3? I've been searching on developer.apple.com but haven't been able to find anything. I know that it is possible to install earlier versions of iOS using organiser (I believe the file extension for the iOS images is ipsw)
