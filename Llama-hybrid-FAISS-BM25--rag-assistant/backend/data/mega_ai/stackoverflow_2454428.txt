The same way you convince other developers to follow any sort of best practice. This particular anti-pattern is a fairly common (and extremely painful!) one, but there's countless other examples of bad coding practices that are probably at least somewhat common among your team members. In order of difficulty in getting started, here's some recommendations I've seen used effectively in the past: Talking to the developer, pointing out the problem, and describing how it caused problems for you. The simplest solution - not always effective, and it will only work for that one developer, but it's better than doing nothing. Public shaming. I've worked in places where we had a "Wall of Shame" with various coding horrors from our project, along with the developer who wrote them. It's really important that this is done in a lighthearted way, and it's really something I wouldn't advise just starting without getting everyone on board, but it's a fun way to point out issues like this. Reading groups. If you have the means to get a lunchtime reading group started at your office, I highly recommend it. Coding issues like this would be addressed extremely well by a reading group going through "The Pragmatic Programmer". Code reviews. Again, not the simplest thing to get started if you're not a team lead, but it's absolutely worth a suggestion to yours if you aren't one. If you are a team lead, you should have started code reviews yesterday.
