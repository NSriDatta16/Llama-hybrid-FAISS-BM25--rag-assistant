you can create jar file in File System, something like File tempFile=TempFile.createFile("newJar",".jar"); and write Stream into it. After that you can construct your JarFile(tempFile) and handle it... Forget about it if program is running as unsigned applet/JNLP since you will not have right to create file in file system...
