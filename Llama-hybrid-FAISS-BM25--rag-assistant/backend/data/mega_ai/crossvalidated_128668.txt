Yes and no. It will stay the same. MSE is MSE, the method of estimation you used does not matter. The only difference is that in classical approach you get a point estimate and in Bayesian you get a distribution of likely values and if you want to compare both approaches using MSE, you need to decide on some kind of point estimate as well (e.g. mean, median, or mode of posterior distribution).
