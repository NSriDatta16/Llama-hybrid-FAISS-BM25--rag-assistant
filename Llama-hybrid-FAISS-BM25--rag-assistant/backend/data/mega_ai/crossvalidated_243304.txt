How to prove this regularized matrix is invertible?

So I'm taking Andrew Ng's course on machine learning (great course, only comment is that its lacking a lot of math) and we came across the analytical solution to a model using Normal equations with the regularization penalty. Andrew claims that it is possible to prove that the matrix below, inside the parentheses, is always invertible but I'm stuck wondering how to do it. $$\theta = (X^TX + \lambda [M])^{-1} X^Ty$$ where $M$ is an $(n+1)(n+1)$ matrix and $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter $$M = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
