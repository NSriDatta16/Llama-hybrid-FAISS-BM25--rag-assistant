This is a layman's answer, and not a 100% technically accurate description of the httpWebRequest object, and meant that way bcause of the amount of time it would take to post it. The first part of this answer is to clarify the final sentence. The httpWebRequest object basically acts as a browser that is interacting with web pages. It's a very simple browser, with no UI. it's designed basically to be able to post to and read from web pages. As such, it does not support a variety of features normally found in a browser these days, such as JavaScript. The page you are attempting to post to requires javascript, which the httpWebRequest object does not support. If you have no control over the page that the WebRequst object is posting to, then you'll have to find another wat to post to it. If you own or control the page, you will need to modify the page to strip out items that require javascript (such as Ajax features, etc). Added I purposely didn't add anything about specifying a user-agent to try to trick the web server into thinking the httpWebRequest object supports JavaScript. because it is likely that the page really needs to have JavaScript enabled in order for the page to be displayed properly. However, a lot of my assumptions prove wrong, so I would agree with @Andrew Hare and say it's worth a try.
