You will need to add an ActionListener to your button and in the actionPerformed method you can write the code to display a result in your JTextArea: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/events/actionlistener.html More info on buttons: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/button.html You can drag objects from a JList to another component (such as a JTextArea or JTable), but you would probably not drag them directly onto a JTabbedPane. You'll have to code this behavior with the DnD API: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/dnd/intro.html
