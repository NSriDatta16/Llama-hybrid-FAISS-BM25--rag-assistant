Telerik Grid - One Source Multiple Targets

After playing with the example code for the Telerik RadGrid drag and drop cabilities I'm at a loss at what to do next. Here's what I'm wanting to do. I have one grid that has many rows populated, this is my source grid. I want to have four empty grids that are going to be used as targets for this populated source grid. Now I want to be able to drag a row from the source grid and be able to drop it on any one of the four target grids. My question is this: Has anyone tried to do anything remotely like this? So far, all of the examples and threads that i've followed seem to have the one source to one target scenario. Any suggestions, examples or how to's would be greatly welcomed. Thanks all for your time.
