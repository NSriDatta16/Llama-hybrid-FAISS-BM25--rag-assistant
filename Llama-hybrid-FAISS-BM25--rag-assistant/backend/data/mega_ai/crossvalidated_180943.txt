Distance matrix for multiple compositional data

Each data point in my data set is a "multiple compositions" (I'm not sure if this is the correct word for this kind of data). For example: Data point $X_i = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3, c_1, c_2, c_3\}$ $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1,\ b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 1,\ c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 1$ $a_j, b_j, c_j > 0\ \forall j=1..3$ I want to do hierarchical clustering on this data, but I don't know how to define the distance matrix for it. The literature in compositional data seems to deal with single-composition data only (e.g., package $compositions$ in R). Could anyone help to suggest a solution for it please? EDIT : Some additional details on my case: I'm doing an analysis on behavior of optimization algorithms on a set of instances. For every pair of (algorithm A, instance I), a composition of three components (as ratios) is generated. Such a composition represents behavior of algorithm A on instance I. Now I would like to cluster these algorithms based on their behaviors on the instance set, using hierarchical clustering with average linkage method. May I just calculate the distance matrix for each composition based on Aitchison's distance, and sum them up for every algorithm pair?
