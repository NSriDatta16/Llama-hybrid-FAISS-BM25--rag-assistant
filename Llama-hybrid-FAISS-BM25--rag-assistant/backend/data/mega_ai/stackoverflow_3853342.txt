How to speed up data retrieval from Mysql database

I am working with c# windows form application and using mysql as back end. I have a table employee. In that I have more 2000 rows its just a example likely more record. When I'm retrieving and filtering the data from database my application is getting slow. Is there another way to retrieve database in good speed? Shall I achieve the speed by using Linq?
