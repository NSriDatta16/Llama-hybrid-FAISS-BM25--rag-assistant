In a logistic regression, are you sure you aren't using chi-square values instead of z-values? I've always seen Wald (if asymptotics are appropriate) and likelihood ratio chi-square values used to measure statistical significance in logistic regression. Either way, the p-value corresponding to a chi-square value for a logistic regression coefficient has the same interpretation as the p-value corresponding to an F-value for a linear regression coefficient. In logistic regression, the p-value corresponding to the calculated chi-square value is the probability of seeing a chi-square value at least as high as the calculated chi-square value for the equivalent model without that coefficient.
