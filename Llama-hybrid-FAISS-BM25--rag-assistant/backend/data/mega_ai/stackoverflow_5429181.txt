Sort by price not working in Magento Product List

I am unable to sort product by price in product list page. Sort by name works fine there. Any idea guys? I googled and tried some solution but they didn't solve my problem. I tried: System->Cache Management->Layered Navigation Indices->Refresh now Also tried this link: http://www.miromedia.co.uk/blog/300/fixing-the-magento-price-sort-issue.htm Magento version: 1.3.2.4
