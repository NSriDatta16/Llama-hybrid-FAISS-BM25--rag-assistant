The XSLTResult internally produces the XML to postprocess with the given template. If you use an XSLT file that doesn't actually transform anything, you get the raw result: I use this template for all my XML results. If this seems silly to you, I have to agree. I found a number of tutorials on the interwebs which said that you could just drop the location parameter from the result definition, but this led to the following error for me: javax.xml.transform.TransformerException: Operation not supported. - [unknown location]
