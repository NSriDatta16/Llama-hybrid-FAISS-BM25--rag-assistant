Time series modeling with R on weekly data

I am trying to do time series modeling and forecasting using R based on weekly data like below - biz week Amount Count 2006-12-27 973710.7 816570 2007-01-03 4503493.2 3223259 2007-01-10 2593355.9 1659136 2007-01-17 2897670.9 2127792 2007-01-24 3590427.5 2919482 2007-01-31 3761025.7 2981363 2007-02-07 3550213.1 2773988 2007-02-14 3978005.1 3219907 2007-02-21 4020536.0 3027837 2007-02-28 4038007.9 3191570 2007-03-07 3504142.2 2816720 2007-03-14 3427323.1 2703761 ... 2014-02-26 99999999.9 1234567 Regarding my data, as seen above, each week is labeled by first day for the week (my weeks start on Wednesdays and end on Tuesdays). When I construct my ts object, I tried: ts The problems I have are: Some years may have 53 weeks, so frequency=52 will not work for those years. My starting week / date is 2006-12-27 , how should I set the start parameter? Should I use: start=c(2006,52) or start=c(2007,1) , since week of 2006-12-27 really crosses the year boundary? Also, for modeling, is it better to have complete year worth of data (say for 2007 my start year if I only have partial year worth of data, is it better I should not use 2007, instead to start with 2008. What about 2014 since it is not complete year yet, shall I use what I have for model or not? Either way, I still have issue of whether or not to include those weeks in the year boundary like 2006-12-27, shall I include it as week 1 for 2007 or last week of 2006? When I use ts and then print it, I got results shown below, so instead of 2007.01, 2007.02, 2007.52, ... , I got 2007.000, 2007.019, ... which it gets from 1/52=0.019 , which is mathematically correct but not really easy to interpret. Is there a way to label it as the date itself just like data frame or at least 2007 wk1, 2007 wk2, ... ? ========= Time Series: Start = c(2007, 1) End = c(2014, 11) Frequency = 52 Amount Count 2007.000 645575.4 493717 2007.019 2185193.2 1659577 2007.038 1016711.8 860777 2007.058 1894056.4 1450101 2007.077 2317517.6 1757219 2007.096 2522955.8 1794512 2007.115 2266107.3 1723002 My goal is to model this weekly data, then try to decompose it to see seasonal component, it seems like I have to use ts() function to convert to ts object then I can use decompose() function, I tried xts() function, and I got error stating "time series has no or less than 2 periods" I guess reason is because xts() won't let me specify the frequency? xts I looked for the answer in this forum and other places as well, most of the examples are monthly, there are some weekly time series question, but none of the answers are straight forward.
