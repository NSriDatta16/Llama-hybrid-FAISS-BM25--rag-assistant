You should use 5.3. 5.2 in "security fixes only" maintenance mode and the recent release is probably the last one for 5.2 series. That means unless there's an outrageous gaping security hole discovered there will be no releases on 5.2 anymore and no bugfixes or improvements. 5.3 is the current maintained version of PHP. It is better than 5.2 in any respect, use it please :) 5.2 is maintained because some people are slow or reluctant to move to more recent version ("if it works, don't touch it"). However, the answer to the question "what is the current PHP version" is "5.3.4" (at least for today). 5.3 will probably the current version for at least couple of years, then it'd be either 5.4 or maybe 6. Oh, and the last but not least - all 5.2.x versions are binary and code compatible (i.e. you should not expect any issues upgrading), so are 5.3.x, but between 5.2 and 5.3 there are binary incompatibilities and may be source incompatibilities too, see upgrading guide .
