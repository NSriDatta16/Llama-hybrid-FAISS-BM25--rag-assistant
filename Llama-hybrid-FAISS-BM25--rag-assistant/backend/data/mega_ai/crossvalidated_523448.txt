Given a predictor that explains 10% of the variance in an outcome, how accurate can my prediction be for a person with a known score on the predictor?

Sorry if this is really elementary stuff, but I'm a stats noob trying to wrap my head around this. Intuitively, I'm imagining that a model with this information alone would be able to accurately predict the outcome, on average, in 10 tries. Is this one way of thinking about it or am I completely wrong?
