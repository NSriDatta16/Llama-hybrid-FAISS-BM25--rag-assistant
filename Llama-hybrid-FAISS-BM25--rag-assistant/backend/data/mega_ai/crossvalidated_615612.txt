What is the current status of Killeen’s probability of replication?

Killeen (1) published several papers about P-rep. It can be easily computed from a p-value (for a two-group comparison) and has an easy interpretation. It is the estimated probability that future repeat experiments (same sample size, same assumptions, only random sampling differs) will result in a difference that goes in the same direction (so the difference has the same sign). That includes all differences in the same direction, including tiny ones, so includes some future studies that result in a large p-value. Lecoutre (2) went further and improved the equations, and showed how P-rep fits in the Bayesian world. It seems like a useful way to think about reproducibility. It is a simple function of the p-value so can't provide additional information, but it seems like a useful way to interpret results. My question is whether this value (P-rep) has been used much in various fields (beyond psychology) and found to be useful. I can't find citations in the last decade. Do statisticians agree it is useful, or find that it is somehow incorrect or misleading? Another minor question is: Lecoutre et al mentioned a webpage with equations, code and an Excel file. But that URL no longer works. Please let me know if it can be found! Killeen, P. R. An Alternative to Null-Hypothesis Significance Tests. Psychol Sci 16, 345–353 (2004).
