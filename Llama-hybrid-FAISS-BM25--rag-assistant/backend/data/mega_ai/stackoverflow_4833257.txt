The older your project is the harder it can be to identify older versions of open source modules. What I've done is use the jar file's checksum as a search key into the public Nexus repositories. For example try the following REST URL: http://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/data_index?sha1=7999a63bfccbc7c247a9aea10d83d4272bd492c6 Returns the following response fragment, identifying version 1.2.16 of the log4j module: .. log4j log4j 1.2.16 .. Of course this approach will open identify those jars held in Maven central, but it's a great time-saver. Hope this helps, Good luck!
