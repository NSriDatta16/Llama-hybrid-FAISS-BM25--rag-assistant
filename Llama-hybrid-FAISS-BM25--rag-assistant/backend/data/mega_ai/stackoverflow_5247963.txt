android httpget read from a website to sqlite columns

I have this line of text: id:1234 dateandtime: 03/10/2011 14:30 firstnumber:2222 secondnumber:3333 centernumber: 4444 refrancenumber:5555 webaddress: www.example.com And I'm using this code to read it off my website that I have for testing //Encode and set entity postMethod.setEntity(new UrlEncodedFormEntity(nameValuePairs, HTTP.UTF_8)); //Execute and get the response - remove all html tag addressString = hc.execute(postMethod, res).replaceAll(" ",""); My problem is that this code reads it as one paragraph I want to separate them so I can insert each one of them in its own column in an sqlite database. Note: the 1234 , 03/10/2011 14:30 , 2222 , 3333 , 4444 , 5555 , and the www.example.com each will be stored in a separate sqlite column. Any suggestions?
