Should we center original data if we want to get principal component?

Suppose we have data matrix $X$ with shape $n*p$ , each row $x_i^T$ is a sample. By definition first principal component is $y_1 = e_1^T * x$ , where $e_1$ is unit eigenvector corresponding to largest eigenvalue of sample covariance matrix. But in sklearn, when using pca to transform $X$ to get principal component, it centers $X$ first in the function transform , why? from sklearn.decomposition import PCA pca = PCA() pca.fit(X) X_new = X - X.mean(axis=0) pca.tranform(X) == X_new @ pca.components_.T
