Generalized estimating equations (GEE) are a technique for estimating parameters. GEE is not a model on its own, much as maximum likelihood estimation is not a model. Thus, the way to create ROC curves for models estimated with GEE is the same as the usual approach: Decide on a model (such as a logistic regression) Estimate the model parameters from the data, using GEE as the estimation approach (instead of an alternative estimation method like maximum likelihood or minimization of the sum of squares) Make predictions using the fitted model Calculate the sensitivity and specificity at many thresholds That final step will be handled by standard software packages if you pass in the true and predicted outcomes, such as pROC::roc in R .
