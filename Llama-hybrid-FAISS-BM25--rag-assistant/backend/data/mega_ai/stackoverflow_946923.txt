If all you've ever used is object-oriented programming languages like C++ then it would be worthwhile to practice a little C. I find that many OO programmers tend to use objects like a crutch and don't know what to do once you take them away. C will give you the clarity to understand why OO programming emerged in the first place and help you to understand when its useful versus when its just overkill. In the same vein, you'll learn what it's like to not rely on libraries to do things for you. By noting what features C++ developers turned into libraries, you get a better sense of how to abstract your own code when the time comes. It would be bad to just feel like you need to abstract everything in every situation. That said, you don't have to learn C. If you know C++ you can drag yourself through most projects. However, by looking at the lower-level languages, you will improve your programming style, even in the higher-level ones.
