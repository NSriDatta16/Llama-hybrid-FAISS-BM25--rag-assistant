To change tabs into spaces and fill comments at the same time, you can use this command: (defun my-format-python-text () "untabify and wrap python comments" (interactive) (untabify (point-min) (point-max)) (goto-char (point-min)) (while (re-search-forward comment-start nil t) (call-interactively 'fill-paragraph) (forward-line 1))) Which you can bind to the key of your choice, presumably like so: (eval-after-load "python" '(progn (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "RET") 'newline-and-indent) (define-key python-mode-map (kbd " ") 'my-format-python-text))) Note the setting of the RET key to automatically indent. If you wanted to all tabs with spaces with just built-in commands, this is a possible sequence: C-x h ;; mark-whole-buffer M-x untabify ;; tabs->spaces To get the fill column and tab width to be what you want, add to your .emacs: (setq fill-column 79) (setq-default tab-width 4) Arguably, the tab-width should be set to 8, depending on how other folks have indented their code in your environment (8 being a default that some other editors have). If that's the case, you could just set it to 4 in the 'python-mode-hook . It kind of depends on your environment.
