I think I may have found my own elegant answer that doesn't require any code :) I am able to put validation on the Pages library by going to the Pages library settings > Validation Settings. If I use this in my formula field =LEN(Title) it does exactly what I want it to do. However there is still some weird behaviour with the add page dialog though where it shows an error but still creates the page in draft :/ I'll have to look in to that.
