KShape cluster centers offset?

I am using tslearn KShape to cluster time series data. I am generally happy with the results, as upon inspection, the clusters seem to make sense because of the similarity in shape and magnitude. I can see the general shape that emerges as seen in the figures below. What I find odd is the cluster centers using k_shape.cluster_centers_. There seems to be a significant shift from some of the clusters. I've included two figures illustrating my point. In Cluster 0, the cluster center is plotted as the red line, and there is a significant shift from where that shape actually emerges in the time series. In Cluster 4, the cluster center is much more centered, for lack of a better term. What could be contributing to the major offset seen in Cluster 0? What I find odd is that not all clusters have such a dramatic offset, and not all are offset to the beginning or the end of the time series. Any thoughts?
