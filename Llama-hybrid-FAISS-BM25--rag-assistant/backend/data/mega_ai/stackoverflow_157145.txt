If you want to take a data structure in Perl and turn it into XML, XML::Simple will do the job nicely. At its simplest: my $hashref = { foo => 'bar', baz => [ 1, 2, 3 ] }; use XML::Simple; my $xml = XML::Simple::XMLout($hashref); As its name suggests, its basic usage is simple; however it does offer a lot of features if you need them. Naturally, it can also parse XML easily. EDIT: I wrote this back in Oct 2008, 14 years ago this year. Things have changed since then. XML::Simple's own documentation carries a clear warning: The use of this module in new code is strongly discouraged. Other modules are available which provide more straightforward and consistent interfaces. In particular, XML::LibXML is highly recommended and you can refer to for a tutorial introduction. XML::Twig is another excellent alternative. These days, I'd strongly recommend checking those out rather than using XML::Simple in new code.
