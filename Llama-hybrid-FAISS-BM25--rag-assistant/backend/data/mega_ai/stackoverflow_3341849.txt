You need to make sure that the project is in your PYTHONPATH . Maybe try to output the sys.path variable at the top of your settings file: import sys print sys.path If this doesn't work with mod_python try to write it to a file: import sys file('/tmp/mysyspath.txt', 'w').write(repr(sys.path)) But even if that will work, here is a short warning: It's discouraged in the django community to use mod_python . It's no longer maintained by its creators and was never the best solution to deploy your django project. Please try mod_wsgi if its available for you on your server.
