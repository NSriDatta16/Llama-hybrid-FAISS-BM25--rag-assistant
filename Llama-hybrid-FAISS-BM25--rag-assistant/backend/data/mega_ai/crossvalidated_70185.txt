I am trained in frequentist statistics (econometrics actually), but I have never had a confrontational stance towards the Bayesian approach, since my point of view is that the philosophical source of this "epic" battle was fundamentally misguided from the start (I have aired my views here ). In fact I plan to also train myself in the Bayesian approach in the immediate future. Why? Because one of the aspects of frequentist statistics that fascinates me the most as a mathematical and conceptual endeavor, at the same time it troubles me the most: sample-size asymptotics. At least in econometrics, almost no serious paper today claims that any of the various estimators usually applied in frequentist econometrics possesses any of the desirable "small-sample" properties we would want from an estimator. They all rely on asymptotic properties to justify their use. Most of the tests used have desirable properties only asymptotically... But we are not in "z-land / t-land" anymore: all the sophisticated (and formidable) apparatus of modern frequentist estimation and inference is also highly idiosyncratic- meaning that sometimes, a laaaaaaaaa...aaaarge sample is indeed needed in order for these precious asymptotic properties to emerge and affect favorably the estimates derived from the estimators, as has been proven by various simulations. Meaning tens of thousands of observations -which although they start to become available for some fields of economic activity (like labor or financial markets), there are others (like macroeconomics) in which they will never do (at least during my life span). And I am pretty bothered by that, because it renders the derived results truly uncertain (not just stochastic). Bayesian econometrics for small samples do not rely on asymptotic results. "But they rely on the subjective prior !" is the usual response... to which, my simple, practical, answer is the following : "if the phenomenon is old and studied before, the prior can be estimated from past data. If the phenomenon is new , by what else if not by subjective arguments can we start the discussion about it ?
