2 databases, vs 1?

I have a database of all countries and cities, I would like to use ajax to use it to give suggesstions in the country cities fields in forms, I have a lot of tables in my db related to the inner workings of the site. Is it ok if I put this in a different database (just this world map database)? I rather put it in a different db so it's more organized and I wouldnt really be connecting to it on the same pages that I connect to the main database. basically a small php page that will suggest strings with json. I was wondering if a seperate db means sharing the db pooll and decrease of performance!?? I should add that these new tables are and sql script on geobytes.com and I don't know how good they are or if I am gonna use them down the path! I hope to find something better with a uptodate list of ip tables! like ip2location
