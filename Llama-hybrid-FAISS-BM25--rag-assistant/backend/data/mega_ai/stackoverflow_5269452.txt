Get the word/object dragged with cursor from a webpage using javascript

I was trying to create a simple addon for my firefox. What I want is to get the word into a variable when I select & drag that word onto an icon on the menubar in firefox. Is there anyway to get the url that word points to ? For making it clear, if i drag a url into the space of open new tab in firefox , that url webpage opens up in a new tab. Similarly I want that url/word to be stored into a variable.
