How can I exclude these elements from a jQuery selection?

My jQuery: $("ul.dropdown ul").slideDown("slow"); $("ul.dropdown ul ul").children().hide(); That causes the ones that match the second selector to display for a brief time. How can I exclude the second set from the first set, and only show the first set?
