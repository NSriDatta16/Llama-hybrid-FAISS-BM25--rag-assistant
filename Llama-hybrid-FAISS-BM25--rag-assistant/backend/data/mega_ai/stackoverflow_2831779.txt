Catch PyGTK TreeView reorder

I have a simple gtk.TreeView with a gtk.ListStore model and set_reorderable(True) , I want to catch the signal/event emited when the user reorder through drag&drop the list, but the documentation does not help much: "The application can listen to these changes by connecting to the model's signals" So I tried to connect the model (ListStore) signals... but surprise! ListStore has no signals, so you are dispatched to TreeModel signals, then I tried to connect with the TreeModel "rows-reordered" signal with no lucky. How should I catch the list reorder performed by the user?
