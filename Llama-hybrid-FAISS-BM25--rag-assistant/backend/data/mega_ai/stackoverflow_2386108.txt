Hibernate bug using Oracle?

I've got the problem, that I use a property in the persistence.xml which forces Hibernate to look only for tables in the given schema. Because we are using now 4 different schemas the actual solution is to generate 4 war files with a modified persistence.xml . That not very elegant. Does anybody know, how I can configure the schema with a property or by manipulation the JDBC connection string? I'm using Oracle 10g, 10_2_3 Patch. Thanks a lot.
