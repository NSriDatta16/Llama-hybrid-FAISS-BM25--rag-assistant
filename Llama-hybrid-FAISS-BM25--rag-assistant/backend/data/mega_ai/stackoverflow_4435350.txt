How do I access innerText of a specific XMLnode

Hi I have the following XML fragment: Andrew Walker 595848584.4 from a bigger XML file. I want to access the in C#. Currently I am doing the following: foreach (XmlNode customer in root) { i++; if(_AccNumber== Convert.ToInt32(customer.Attributes[0].Value)) { searchNode = CustNodes[(i - 1)]; string _firstName = searchNode.FirstChild.FirstChild.InnerText; } } When I view searchNode in the debugger I can see in the results view element [0] which has a localName CustomerInfo as you expect. So in the debugger first name has the following path: searchNode -> [0].[0].[0].value if that makes sense? Is there any better way of doing this? (without LINQ)? Apologies, if something isn't clear....its 2:30AM! Let me know and I'll explain myself better. Thanks!!
