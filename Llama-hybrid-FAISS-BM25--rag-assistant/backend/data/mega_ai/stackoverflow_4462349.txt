There is no consistent, cross-browser way to monitor for attribute changes. maksymko is right that what you're looking for are mutation events, but as he stated, they're not widely supported. The closest guarantee you have is to set up an API/method used by your code for any changes needing to be made to the input value. This is incomplete and future-fragile, but it's all you've got. Many libraries have some plumbing in place for this, such as jQuery or YUI 3.
