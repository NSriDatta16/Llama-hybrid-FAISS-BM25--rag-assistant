Flex - prevent dragging for certain items

how would you prevent dragging for some items of your List or DataGrid? Let's say I had a list with two items: 'Tom' and 'Jerry'. Only 'Tom' should be dragable, not 'Jerry'. Ideally I had a 'isDragEnabled(item:Object):Boolean' function, which is being queried by the drag source. My difficulties start with the fact that the 'dragStart' event handler has a null value for the dragSource, so right from the start I find it hard to find out what the drag-start is about.. Thanks in advance! PS There have been a few discussions on preventing or canceling a drop, but I haven't seen much about preventing the drag start, hence this question.
