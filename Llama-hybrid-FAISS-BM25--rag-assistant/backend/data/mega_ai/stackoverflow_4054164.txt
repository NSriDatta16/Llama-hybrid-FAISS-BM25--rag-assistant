How to use local storage to keep a users favorites list intact upon successive visits

So i have a web application I've developed using jquery and some jqtouch. I have javascript functions to clone list items to another "favorites" list if the user so chooses. My question is how can I use localStorage to keep their favorites in the list when they come back into the web application? I can't seem to find a straight forward answer.. Am I supposed to store the cloned values? or the original li elements? or the functions? I'm totally lost, so any help would be appreciated, cheers.
