What you have is almost exactly: $$ y = 0.5+ 2 x_1^2 + 0.5 x_2 - x_1 x_2.$$ You ned to apply your understanding of the subject matter to interpret the coefficients.* With such simple coefficients and small standard errors relative to the scale of your $y$ values, I suspect that there is some theoretical relationship underlying your model's results. Try rearranging or combining the terms in the above equation in a way that might make sense for your subject matter. Without knowing more about your subject matter, it's hard to provide more precise advice. *Technically these aren't called "hyperparameters". From Wikipedia : "In machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process." (Emphasis added.) The coefficient estimates in the model are results of the the learning/modeling process.
