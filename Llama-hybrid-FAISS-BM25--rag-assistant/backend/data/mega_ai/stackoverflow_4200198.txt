The JavaDoc of java.util.Queue already states the problem: Queue implementations generally do not define element-based versions of methods equals and hashCode but instead inherit the identity based versions from class Object, because element-based equality is not always well-defined for queues with the same elements but different ordering properties. So, you need to implement the logic on your own (or reuse some library) for your use-cases, if you want to do it based on the contained objects. E.g. for an ArrayList, you would just call ArrayList.equals() . For the queues, I would go for a pragmatic approach of converting them to an array using e.g. java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue.toArray() and then use Arrays.equals(queue1AsArray,queue2AsArray);
