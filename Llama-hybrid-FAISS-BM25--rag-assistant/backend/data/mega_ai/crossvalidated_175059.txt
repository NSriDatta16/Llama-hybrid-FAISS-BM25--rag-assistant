PCA unfortunately only makes sense with numerical data. For instance, if you have a variable that can take the values {'car', 'train', 'boat'}, it will be difficult to do arithmetic with them. If we replace them with $\{0, 1, 2\}$, we can do arithmetic, but that arithmetic will really not achieve what we want, because we'll be treating these labels like real numbers. As if (train + train = boat), or even train being closer to car than boat is. However we have another option, to create dummy variables , one variable for each value that this categorical variable can take, setting them equal to 1 or 0 accordingly. (Note: some people would use one less variable than the number of values, letting all 0 indicate the remaining variable, but geometrically this is troubling because the all-zero-variable is closer to all the other variables than they are to eachother, so I would not do that with PCA). These values can be rescaled and PCA can be applied. It may not be ideal, but at least it's not crazy! Edit: I had not noticed the word Likert in your post some how. Likert scales are ordinal , rather than categorical variables. In fact, typically one assumes Likert scales are interval , essentially meaning that the difference between 1 and 2 is the same as the difference between 4 and 5. Because of this scale absolutely makes sense! I have changed your title to use the word "ordinal" rather than "categorical."
