From Robin Dunn himself: First, a Refresh() by default will erase the background before sending the paint event (although setting the BG style or catching the erase event would have taken care of that.) The second and probably most visible problem in this case is that in your on_motion handler you are not offsetting the ClientDC by the scroll offsets, just the position in the buffer that you are drawing the line segment at. So when the buffer is flushed out to the client DC it is drawn at the physical (0,0), not the virtual (0,0). In other words, the flicker you are seeing is coming from drawing the buffer at the wrong position after every mouse drag event, and then it immediately being drawn again at the right position in the on_paint triggered by the Refresh() . You should be able to fix this by calling PrepareDC on the client DC before using it, like this: cdc = wx.CLientDC(self) self.PrepareDC(cdc) dc = wx.BufferedDC(cdc, self.buffer) However since you are doing a Refresh or RefreshRect anyway, there is no need to use a client DC here at all, just let the flushing of the buffer to the screen be done in on_paint instead: dc = wx.BufferedDC(None, self.buffer)
