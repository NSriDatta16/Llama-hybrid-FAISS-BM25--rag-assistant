Designing a website for which users can create themes? (ASP.NET/C#)

What is an elegant way to architecture an ASP.NET website in which end-users can create custom themes for their sites through a user interface? Would ASP.NET themes help me here? Should the UI allow users to write guided CSS files to disc and apply those? Any suggestions are welcome. Thank you in advance.
