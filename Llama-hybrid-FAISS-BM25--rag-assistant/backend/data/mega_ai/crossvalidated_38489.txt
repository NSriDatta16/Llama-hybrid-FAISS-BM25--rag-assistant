Is a Biplot suitable ? Domestic Violence VS Non-Violence data

I have a small data set that consists solely of counts. I have several variables. For example State, for each state (Mexican States), for example, Tamauplipas I have the counts of domestic violence and the counts of non-violence. For Age I have the same but for each age group... I would eventually have a table, for example, like this: I naturally have many more columns. What these people want to know (plot) is what levels of what variable are associated with Non-Violent and the same for Violent. I was told in work to do a biplot but have been trying and dont get nice results. I'm not sure this is the best idea. I tried with a regular PCA biplot... What do you guys think? any comments would be appreciated. Greetings! J.
