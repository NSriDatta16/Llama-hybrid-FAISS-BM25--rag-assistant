What is the implication of unit root of MA?

A ARMA(p,q) process is weakly stationary, iff the root of its AR part is not on the unit circle. So its weak stationarity doesn't depend on its MA part. But what can the positions of the roots of its MA part imply? In the unit root tests for ARIMA, a unit root of the MA polynomial indicates that the data were overdifferenced. Does it mean that the differenced time series is not weakly stationary? If yes, does it contradict to the earlier fact that the weak stationarity of ARMA doesn't depend on its MA part?
