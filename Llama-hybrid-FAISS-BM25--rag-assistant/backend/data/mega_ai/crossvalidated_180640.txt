Nice, exhaustive write-up! I want to propose an additional consideration or two. Most importantly, instead of building separate models for each payitem that you integrate the massively categorical nature of the payitems into a hierarchical modeling framework. This approach has several advantages: 1) by pooling the data, it would improve estimation for the sparsely populated payitems, 2) it would "shrink" the parameter estimates and their standard errors, and 3) would more appropriately account for the variability in the data versus building each model separately. Here's a paper that focuses on leveraging zip codes in a direct marketing modeling environment that describes a Bayesian approach to this: http://www.people.hbs.edu/tsteenburgh/articles/Steenburgh_Ainslie_and_Engebretson_(winter_2003).pdf But you aren't limited to a Bayesian approach. When this paper was written, hierarchical Bayesian frameworks offered significant advantages over the challenges traditional, closed-form or "frequentist" models faced in, e.g., inverting a massive cross-products matrix such as is required when evaluating ~35,000 zip codes at one time. However, that was then and this is now. Today, there are workarounds to the massive size of your data that have put "frequentist" approaches at parity with Bayesian techniques. These include so-called "divide and conquer" algorithms which, in essence, can be analogized to massive random forest-like approaches in that -- instead of just creating a thousand or so mini-trees (Breiman's original forests or ensembles) -- one builds tens of thousands of mini-models and aggregates the results on the back end. Here's a recent review paper on D&C: http://stat.rutgers.edu/home/mxie/RCPapers/split_and_conquer_rev1_final.pdf Of course, this method would be still be a challenge today on a single CPU or laptop as these techniques only really become an advantage on a multi-core platform. There's plenty of literature to review regarding hierarchical models... starting with Gelman and Hill's Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models . Otherwise, I'm agnostic as to the specific functional form the regression should take beyond a hierarchical one. It could be that exploring different approaches to analyzing one, two or a few of the payitems would provide direction towards answering that question.
