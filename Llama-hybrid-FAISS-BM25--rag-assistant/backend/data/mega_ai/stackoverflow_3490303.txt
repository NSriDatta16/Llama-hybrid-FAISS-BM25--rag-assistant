retrieving doubles in NSMutableArray converted with [NSNumber numberWithDouble:doubleVar]

I am looking for what is probably a simple answer to my novice question. I know that NSMutableArray can only hold objects, so when I put the double into the array I used the [myArray addObject:[NSNumber numberWithDouble:aValue]]; conversion method. What I need to do now is to pull the values out as doubles and average them. I believe I will use the fast enumeration method vs. FoR looping. I just need to know how to get the following to work. double total; total = [myArray objectAtIndex:i]
