sampling algorithm - standard distribution

I'm reading Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop (p526) and I've been trying to understand this: Suppose that $z$ is uniformly distributed over the interval $(0, 1)$, and that we transform the values of $z$ using some function $f()$ so that $y = f(z)$. The distribution of y will be governed by $$p(y) = p(z)|{dz \over dy}| $$ This doesn't make sense to me. Given the equation $y=f(z)$, we can say $p(y) = p(f(z))$. But from there I don't know how they got equation above.
