How to get odds ratio using glmnet?

I ran three regularization methods, lasso, ridge, and elastic net. Lasso was able to get the best accuracy, so I'm selecting it. Is there a way to calculate odds ratio from the coefficients? Does it make sense to do it in glmnet? I took the following steps: train.control Plot and predict the model plot(lasso_model$finalModel, xvar = "lambda", label = T) plot(lasso_model$finalModel, xvar = "dev", label = T) plot(varImp(lasso_model, scale = F)) p.lasso.pred Now, all tutorials that I've read stops at this point. I'm really confused as to whether to stop here, or take the features from lasso with coefficients > 0 and run logistic again to get the odds ratio for the coefficients. And I also did that. However, most of the variables are not significant (which is fine). Then should I select the variables that are significant and do the regular (step-wise - not sure if I should do this) logistic regression? or leave the model as is because lasso produced those features?
