Wow, what a big question! The short version of the answer is that just because you can represent two models using diagrammatically similar visual representations, doesn't mean they are even remotely related structurally, functionally, or philosophically. I'm not familiar with FCM or NF, but I can speak to the other ones a bit. Bayesian Network In a Bayesian network, the graph represents the conditional dependencies of different variables in the model. Each node represents a variable, and each directed edge represents a conditional relationship. Essentially, the graphical model is a visualization of the chain rule. Neural Network In a neural network, each node is a simulated "neuron". The neuron is essentially on or off, and its activation is determined by a linear combination of the values of each output in the preceding "layer" of the network. Decision Tree Let's say we are using a decision tree for classification. The tree essentially provides us with a flowchart describing how we should classify an observation. We start at the root of the tree, and the leaf where we end up determines the classification we predict. As you can see, these three models really have basically nothing at all to do with each other besides being representable with boxes and arrows.
