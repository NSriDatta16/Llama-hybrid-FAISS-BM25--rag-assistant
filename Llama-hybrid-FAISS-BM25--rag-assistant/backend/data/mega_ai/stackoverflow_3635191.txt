I'm not familiar with the Infragistics suite, but I suspect it's the same thing as with regular combo boxes: since you have a binding on SelectedItem, the Text cannot be set to an item that blatantly disobeys that binding; the Text IS a representation of the SelectedItem. If the SelectedItem is null, then the Text must also be a representation of null. I'm guessing (didn't try it and I may be just plain wrong) you could probably accomplish this with an IValueConverter that returns a custom string when the passed object is null (and returns the object unchanged otherwise), set on the SelectedItem binding.
