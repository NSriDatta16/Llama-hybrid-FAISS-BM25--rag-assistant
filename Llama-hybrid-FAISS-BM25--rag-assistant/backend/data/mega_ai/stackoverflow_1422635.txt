I am over with one set of interviews at my college just now... Every algorithm has its benefits, otherwise it wont exist. So, its better to understand what is so good with the algorithm that you are studying. Where does it do well? How can it be improved? I guess you'll automatically need to read various efficiency notations when you do this. Mind the worst case, and pay attention to the average case, best cases are rare. All the best for your interview.
