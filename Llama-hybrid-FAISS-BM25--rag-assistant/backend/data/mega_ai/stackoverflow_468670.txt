Take a good hard look at the compromises you are making, and if they aren't pushing you away from the core values of Scrum / Agile. For the longest time people here at my shop have been claiming we're Agile, but what they really mean is that requirements changes can be pushed to development at almost any time. We have all kinds of procedures and instructions to follow, and it's anything but "travel light". That's not necessarily a big issue if everyone is clear that we aren't really doing Scrum, XP or another truly agile methodology. It only gets dangerous when some things are introduced without adapting other core things - you end up trying to be agile in a system that will simply punish you for it. You try to fix a 4-week iteration but you get new top-priority requirements every week anyway, and you're not allowed to ignore them. You're asked for a detailed planning and get complaints whenever something slightly deviates from it during a sprint. Your best team members are constantly interrupted to help out other teams with their problems. That's not agile, and it won't work no matter how hard you try to call it agile. So maybe the reality of your situation is the same, and your organization just isn't really ready for it yet either.
