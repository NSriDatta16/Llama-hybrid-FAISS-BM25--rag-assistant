This shouldn't cause any problems at all if you are using a CNN. I made a CNN for recognizing faces, and since faces are usually around 70% as wide as they are tall, I used training images that are 80x100 pixels (a little extra width in case the head was at an angle). Your filters should still be squares though. All that changes would be that now you have to keep track of a width and a height for your activation/pooled maps instead of just one value that tells you the size. For example - Input image of 80 x 100 Apply 5 x 5 convolution filter gives a map of activations at 76 x 96 Apply 2 x 2 pooling gives a map of pooled activations at 38 x 48
