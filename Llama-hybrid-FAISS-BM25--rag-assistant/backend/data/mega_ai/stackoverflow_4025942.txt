You can use DataTable for table data storage or DataSet for multi-table data cache with relations, views and extra build in functionality. All depends of data structure which you want to manage. If data structure is simple - mayby best way is create your own specified data structure and manage it by linq or other code. DataTable and DataSet are not always lightweight but usually fast enough and easy to access and at last quite universal.
