The problem with having that many columns in a table is that finding rows using the clustered primary key can be expensive. If it were possible to change the schema, breaking this up into many normalized tables will be the best way to improve efficiency. I would strongly recommend this course. If not, then you may be able to use indices to make some SELECT queries faster. If you have queries that only use a small number of the columns, adding indices on those columns could mean that the clustered index will not need to be scanned. Of course, there is always a price to pay with indices, in terms of storage space and INSERT, UPDATE and DELTETE time, so this may not be a good idea for you.
