To learn machine learning which one is good?

Until now I have implemented linear and logistic regression myself. I have not used any library other than numpy and matplotlib . But in the internet every example is solved using libraries such as sklearn , pandas and etc. My question is, which one is good to learn for machine learning, implementing algorithm yourself or using libraries (sklearn or ...)? Thanks.
