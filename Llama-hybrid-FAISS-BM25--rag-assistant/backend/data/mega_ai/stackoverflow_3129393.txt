Execute JavaScript within responseHTML

When using responseHTML with XHR, Firefox executes the javascripts within the loaded responseHTML, chromium does not. if i add a script that will parse and execute the scripts, it will work on chromium but they result being executed twice in Firefox. Any idea how to know if browser will execute loaded scripts or not other than through agent sniffing? PS: I'm using a JS framework that IS NOT jQuery or Prototype or anything
