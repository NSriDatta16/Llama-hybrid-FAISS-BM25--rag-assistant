I really don't know, but I searched for all the files that have the word "cache" in them with file names of "Collection.php" and got a few results. The most promising example to look at might be Mage_Sales_Model_Entity_Quote_Item_Collection (_getProductCollection() method). Looks like Varien_Data_Collection (which is a parent class of any magento collection) has a few cache-related methods: initCache() and _getCacheInstance(). Can't say I have used them before but might be useful someday. Good luck.
