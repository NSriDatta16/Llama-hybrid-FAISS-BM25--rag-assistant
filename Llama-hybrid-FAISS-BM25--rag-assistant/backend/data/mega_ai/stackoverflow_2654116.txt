Parsing XHTML with inline tags

I'm trying to parse an XHTML document using TBXML on the iPhone (although I would be happy to use either libxml2 or NSXMLParser if it would be easier). I need to extract the content of the body as a series of paragraphs and maintain the inline tags, for example: Title Title Paragraph with inline tags I need to extract the paragraph but maintain the inline content with the paragraph, all my testing so far has extracted that as a subelement without me knowing exactly where it fitted in the paragraph. Can anyone suggest a way to do this? Thanks.
