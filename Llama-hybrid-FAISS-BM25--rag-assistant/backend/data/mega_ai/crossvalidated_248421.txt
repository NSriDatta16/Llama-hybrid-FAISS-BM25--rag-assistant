Testing association in meta analysis

I am doing a meta-analysis where I have the baseline and 2 months post-intervention measurement of a continuous variable (say a) for two groups (control and intervention). I also have measurements for another continuous variable (say b) at post-intervention. The idea is if (a) increases after the intervention, (b) should also be higher in the intervention group. Note that all measurements are in average (since this is a meta-analysis and each average belongs to one study). Is there any idea how could I test the association that an increment in (a) after the intervention will also increase (b)? Thank you so much in advance.
