How to un-link a JSlider's progress indicator from its thumb?

I'm using a JSlider to show progress in my application, so that it updates as a certain process computes. I want a user to be able to drag the thumb backwards to a tick mark in the past, but when this happens, I want the progress indicator to remain at its current position. // A dismal attempt at drawing the situation Progress: --------- Thumb: | // User drags backwards. What I have: Progress: --- Thumb: | // What I want instead: Progress: --------- Thumb: | Can anyone offer any guidance for how to best accomplish this? Thanks in advance for all help!
