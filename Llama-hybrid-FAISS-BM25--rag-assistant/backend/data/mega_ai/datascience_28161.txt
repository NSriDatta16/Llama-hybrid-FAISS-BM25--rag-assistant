Interactive plots in Jupyter

I'm looking for Jupyter extension to plot interactive graphs. For example I need to plot twenty time series lines with order to examine data. Only plugin which I've found is bqplot https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot but its documentation is too complicated. Could you advice some other free tool or help with bqplot? I can't plot lines with different colors. unitIds = commonSeries['UnitId'].unique() commonSeries = commonSeries.sort_values(by=['Date','UnitId'], ascending=True) commonSeries = commonSeries.set_index(pd.DatetimeIndex(commonSeries['Date'])) plt.clear() x_ord = OrdinalScale() y_sc = LinearScale() lines = [] for unitId in unitIds: timeseries = commonSeries.loc[commonSeries['UnitId'] == unitId] line = plt.Lines(x=timeseries.index, y=timeseries['Value'], scales={'x': x_ord, 'y': y_sc}, colors=['red','green','blue']) lines.append(line) plt.Figure(marks=lines)
