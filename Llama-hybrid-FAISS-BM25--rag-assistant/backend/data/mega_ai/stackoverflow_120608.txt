You don't need the type and language attribute when using to an external JavaScript file: Your browser will automatically figure out what to do, based on the extension of the file. You need type="text/javascript" when doing script-blocks, though. Edit: Some might say that this is awful, but these are in fact the words of a Yahoo! JavaScript evangelist (I think it was Douglas Crockford) in the context of website load-performance. Perhaps I should have elaborated a bit. Google was a great example of breaking standards without breaking the rendering of their website. (They are now complying to W3C standards, using JavaScript to render their pages). Because of the heavy load on their websites, they decided to strip down their markup to the bare minimum, and use depreciated tags like the dreaded font and i tags. It doesn't hurt to be pragmatic. Within reason, of course :)
