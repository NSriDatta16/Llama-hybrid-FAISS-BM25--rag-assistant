You could have a static StringBuilder that each enum constant appends its value to in the constructor, then in your default constructor just set the enum's string to the value of the StringBuilder. Note however that Java will prevent you accessing static variables directly from an enum's constructor (for good reason!) so you'll have to do the dirty work in another method and then call that from the constructor. For this to work though you'll have to make sure ALL is declared last. As a disclaimer though this is a truly horrible workaround and if you can at all, I'd encourage you to explore other possibilities here!
