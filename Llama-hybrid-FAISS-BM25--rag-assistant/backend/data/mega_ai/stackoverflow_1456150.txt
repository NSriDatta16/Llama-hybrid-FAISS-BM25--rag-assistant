Vertical text alignment in Crystal Reports?

In the Crystal Reports editor that comes with Visual Studio (2008) is it possible to align text to the center of a text box rather than to the top? I can't find the option anywhere and a Google search is not encouraging but I just can't bring myself to believe that they would not include such an obvious feature.
