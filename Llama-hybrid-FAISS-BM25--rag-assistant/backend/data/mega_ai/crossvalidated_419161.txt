This is more of an extended comment than an answer. One interesting perspective can be found in this blog post , a short citation: ... contends the word [significance] carried much less weight in the late 19th century, when it meant only that the result showed, or signified, something. Then, in the 20th century, significance began to gather the connotation it carries today, of not only signifying something but signifying something of importance. ... If this is correct then Fisher can have meant with significant rather something like worthy of taking a note (mental or in lab notebook), worthy for further investigation or replication. This psyarxiv paper proposing to reduce standard significance level (in psychology research) from 0.05 to 0.005 is further evidence that many see (rightly ...) that 0.05 is already a rather weak requirement.
