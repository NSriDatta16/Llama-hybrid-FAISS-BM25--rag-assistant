Why 1 trend and/or why not incorporate level shifts as part of the pre-filtering process ? Approaches like this , geared to pulling out the "within structure" in order to assess the ralationship between y and 1 or more x's are quite presumptive and should be studiously avoided. The correct approach to form "regression type models" between time series is to determine the filter by analyzing the autocorrelative structure within each time series. The resultant series are then examined for structure using OLS methods as the x's and their lafgs have been transformed to orthogonality.
