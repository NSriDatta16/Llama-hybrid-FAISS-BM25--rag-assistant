I've had a good experience with nginx ( https://nginx.org/ ), that said, when choosing a webserver, you should look closely at your requirements and make an informed decision as these things can be very application specific. You'll notice that in this question that a lot of people recommend g-wan, Webmachine, etc... these are all things you should look at and benchmark to see if they are faster for your use case. This is the kind of question that encourages cheerleading, there is no "right answer".
