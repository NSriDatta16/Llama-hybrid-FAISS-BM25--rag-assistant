You can customize the menu, for example if you add code like so to a standard module: Public gvarPasted As Boolean Function AssignVar() gvarPasted = True DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdPaste End Function You can set the Action property of Paste on the menu to this function using the customize option of the toolbar menu. You will also need to create your own shortcut menu (right-click menu) to use in place of the built-in menu. The shortcut menu can either be assigned for all forms or for just the form that requires it. It is also possible to turn off the shortcut menus for all forms.
