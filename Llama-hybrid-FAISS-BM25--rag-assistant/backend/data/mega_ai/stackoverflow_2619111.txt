There is actually only a single layer of containers. You can virtually create a "file-system" like layered storage, but in reality everything will be in 1 layer, the container in which it is. For creating a virtual "file-system" like storage, you can have blob names that contain a '/' so that you can do whatever you like with the way you store. Also, the great thing is that you can search for a blob at a virtual level, by giving a partial string, up to a '/'. These 2 things, adding a '/' to a path and a partial string for search, together create a virtual "file-system" storage.
