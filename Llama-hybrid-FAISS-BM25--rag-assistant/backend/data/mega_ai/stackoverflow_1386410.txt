You should first analyze what the actual bottleneck is. Is it really the object serialization/deserialization? If so, ask yourself, if all the objects need to be present on every request or if they can be reconstructed on demand. Then you could just store the key values to reconstruct those objects instead of the whole objects. But if you need all those objects though, use more performant storage location than the default (files in the file system), maybe the memory (memcache).
