Moving return of exponential moving average -- choice of alpha

I have a time series with an exponential moving average and I want to calculate a moving return of the EMA over the last m periods (something like a smoothed moving return). Let's say: Y(t) is the value of the time series at time period t S(t) is the value of an EMA of Y at time period t Now R(t) is the return of the EMA over the last m time periods: R(t) = S(t) / S(t-m) - 1 My question is: how many time periods should the EMA calculation use for a given m? Precisely, if the EMA is calculated using S(t) = alpha * Y(t) + (1-alpha) * S(t-1) and alpha is set by 2/(N+1), then how should N depend on m? I'm assuming that N should be sufficiently less than m to prevent 'overlap' of Y values that are used in the calculation of S(t) and S(t-m). Any theories or best practices about this?
