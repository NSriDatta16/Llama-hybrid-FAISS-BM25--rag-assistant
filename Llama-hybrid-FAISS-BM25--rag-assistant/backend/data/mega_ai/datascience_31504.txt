Machine Learning Design Document

I was trying to create a design document for a machine learning project. From a flow perspective, I know that I would have a training flow, a validation/test flow followed by a production flow. However, from a design document perspective, I was no able to find any sample template that details out the different sections / subsections that a design document for a Machine Learning project should contain. I believe that the design doc for a ML project should be different from a normal project. Also, what are the different documents that a ML project should have, from a process perspective? Any ideas in this direction would be helpful.
