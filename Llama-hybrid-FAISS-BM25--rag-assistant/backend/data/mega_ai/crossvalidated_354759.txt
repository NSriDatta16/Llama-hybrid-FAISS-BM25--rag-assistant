There are ${52}\choose{13,13,13,13}$ ways to distribution 52 cards among 4 people. There are 4! ways to distribute 4 lowest cards of a particular suit to 4 people, and there are 4 suits. On top of this, there are ${48}\choose{12,12,12,12}$ ways to organize the rest of the cards. In total, there are $4*4!*$${48}\choose{12,12,12,12}$ ways to distribute the cards such that the 4 lowest cards of a suit are distributed among 4 players. Therefore the probability in question is $\frac{$4*4!*{48}\choose{12,12,12,12}}{{52}\choose{13,13,13,13}}$ I get the same answer as MikeP but I'm not sure why this is inconsistent with the first answer and the numeric simulation...
