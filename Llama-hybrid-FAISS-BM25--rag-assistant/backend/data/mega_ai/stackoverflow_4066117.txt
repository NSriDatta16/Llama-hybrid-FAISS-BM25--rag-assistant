Java is the most portable / platform independent way of implementing desktop applications with GUIs. C# and .NET are Windows specific. Received wisdom Mono isn't really good enough yet. Objective-C and the Cocoa are thoroughly Mac specific. Qt and C++ code is portable in theory, but it requires a lot more care / attention to detail to achieve portability in practice. (Plus, C++ is a non-managed language so you have memory management and related stability issues to deal with.) For many applications a potentially more portable solution is to implement the GUI in a web browser. Certainly, this avoids the problem of installing applications on the desktop. However, you then have to contend with: people / organizations that don't update their browser platform, web browsers incompatibilities and bugs, security sandboxes, the problem of implementing browser plugins / extensions for multiple browsers, and installing said plugins / extensions.
