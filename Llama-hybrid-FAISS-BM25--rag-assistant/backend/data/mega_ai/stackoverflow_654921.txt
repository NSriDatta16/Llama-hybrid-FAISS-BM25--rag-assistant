How big can a user agent string get?

If you were going to store a user agent in a database, how large would you accomdate for? I found this technet article which recommends keeping UA under 200. It doesn't look like this is defined in the HTTP specification at least not that I found. My UA is already 149 characters, and it seems like each version of .NET will be adding to it. I know I can parse the string out and break it down but I'd rather not. EDIT Based on this Blog IE9 will be changing to send the short UA string. This is a good change.
