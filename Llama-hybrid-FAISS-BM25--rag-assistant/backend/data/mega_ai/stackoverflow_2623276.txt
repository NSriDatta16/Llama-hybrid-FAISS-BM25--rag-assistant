Magento SOAP API: fetching most sold products

I’m just learning Magento and its Web Services API for a new job. I’ve just managed to build some basic PHP scripts fetching products in specific categories. I now need to fetch the best-selling products, but am struggling to find good documentation on this. Any help, pointers, sample code or anything else really would be much appreciated... Thanks, Tom
