The answers here are good, but here are some more suggestions: don't set android:maxSdkVersion unless you are absolutely sure you need it. set android:minSdkVersion to 3 so Cupcake devices can run it. set android:targetSdkVersion to 4 to indicate the app has been tested on Donut. Your app should then work well on all >= Cupcake devices. If you have plans to provide high-density resources for high-density screens (Droid, Nexus One), there's a little more work you have to do. It'd be better to start another thread for this, but long story short, you'd put the high-density resources in a folder called drawable-hdpi-v4. Be sure to check out the uses-sdk doc.
