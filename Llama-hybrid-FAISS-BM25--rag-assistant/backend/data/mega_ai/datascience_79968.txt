According to me, you should check out the correlation heatmap of the parameters, and if the parameters are having a very little correlation with each other, you should go for deep learning models. Since in DL models, each independent parameter is fed into model parallelly, and updating each weight has a unique path in the back-propagation process. whereas in gradient boosting algorithm, weights are updated are sequentially.
