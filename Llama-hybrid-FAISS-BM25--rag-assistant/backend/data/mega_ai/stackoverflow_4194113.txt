You can disable specific warnings in the project or file options and this setting applies as the 'default' per those #pragmas at the relevant scope. Some of the warnings in VS2005 are so useless/annoying that this cleans up the output quite a bit, if using /W4 . This is in Properties under Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Advanced.
