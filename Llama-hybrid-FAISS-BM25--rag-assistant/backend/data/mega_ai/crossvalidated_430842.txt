Why does the marginal likelihood integral have no closed-form solution?

In Bayesian inference we end up with the formula: $$ P(\mathbf{w|t,X)}= \frac{P(\mathbf{t|w,X)}P(\mathbf{w)}}{\int P(\mathbf{t|w,X}) P(\mathbf{w}) d\mathbf{w}}$$ Assume the prior $P(w)$ is a Gaussian distribution with 0 mean and $\sigma$ as standard deviation. It is always said the integral has no closed-form solution. When the prior is a Gaussian distribution, is this related to the fact that the indefinite integral $\int e^{-x^2}dx$ can not be expressed with elementary functions? What if I choose an ad-hoc prior distribution? Is there any case when the integral has a closed-form solution?
