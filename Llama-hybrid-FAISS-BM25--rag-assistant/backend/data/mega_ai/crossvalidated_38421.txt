Subjective Bayesians might disagree, but from my perspective, the prior is just a part of the model, like the likelihood. Changing the prior in response to model behavior is no better or worse than changing your likelihood function (e.g. trying different error distributions or different model formulations). It can be dangerous if it lets you go on a fishing expedition, but the alternatives can be worse. For example, in the case you mentioned, where your model blows up and you get nonsensical coefficients, then you don't have much choice but to try again. Also, there are steps you can take to minimize the dangers of a fishing expedition somewhat: Deciding in advance which prior you'll use in the final analysis Being up-front when you publish or describe your analysis about your whole procedure Doing as much as possible with either simulated data and/or holding out data for the final analysis. That way, you won't contaminate your analysis too much.
