" If you have multiple User tables , one for each company, it might make some sense." Why only then? "~/Organization/10/User/5/Edit" ... gives me the organization context at all times. I didn't say so in my first question, but I've written an action filter that authorizes according to the rule that the logged on user must belong to the organization of the current action (hence not being able to see/edit/whatever user(s) of another organization). I'm not saying that it's the best solution, but if not implementing this cross-cutting concern (aspect) as an action filter knowing the org id (via the action params), how would you solve the authorization issue elegantly? As I initially stated, I'm new to the world of MVC and very excited about the answers.
