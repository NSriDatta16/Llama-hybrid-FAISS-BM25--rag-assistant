Changing the onclick event delegate of an HTML button?

How do you change the JavaScript that will execute when a form button is clicked? I've tried changing its onClicked and its onclicked child attributes like so: $('mybutton').onClick = 'doSomething'; and $('mybutton').attributes["onclick"] = 'doSomething()'; Neither seem to work. My other options are: To have two buttons and hide one and show the other. To have it directed to a function that evals a string and change the string to the function I want to execute. Neither seem very elegant. I'm using Prototype as a js library so it that has any useful tools I can use them.
