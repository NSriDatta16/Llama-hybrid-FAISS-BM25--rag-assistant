How can I do a one vs all classification (binary classifier) with a neural network

I have a set of images that belong to a particular class. Then, I have another set of images that do not contain any image of the above particular class. So, effectively I have two sets of images viz. one that belongs to a class and another that does not belong to the class. I need to design a neural network that can model the positive class. What I am doing is the following using Theano in python: A multiple layers neural network with convolutional layers at the beginning. Use a mean squared error as loss function. Use a single sigmoid neuron at the output. My question is whether using a single sigmoid neuron is the right approach or not. Otherwise, should I use two separate sigmoid neurons at the output for this scenario. Any recommendations is appreciated. Thanks
