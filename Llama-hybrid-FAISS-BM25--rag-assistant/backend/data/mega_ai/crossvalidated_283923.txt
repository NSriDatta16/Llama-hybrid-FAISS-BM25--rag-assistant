I would use one-hot encoding to map the gender of the word as follows: male --> [1, 0, 0] female --> [0, 1, 0] other --> [0, 0, 1] This tells your logistic regression that the input maps to 100% of that class of the output. Once you train your logistic regression algorithm, your predictions will be of the following form after passing through the final Softmax function: [0.1, 0.9, 0.1] Indicating that the word is female with 90% probability.
