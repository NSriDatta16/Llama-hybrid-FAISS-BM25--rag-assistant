Causation is a murky subject and probably the easiest area in all of statistics to arrive at wrong answers. To go to your example, say we find in the data that $A$ products only succeed when they are released during period $C$ as well. But to causally interpret that to mean $A$ products need $C$ to succeed, we at least need to know that whether or not an $A$ product is released during $C$ is effectively random with regards to "hotness". But you could very well be saving your best $A$ products for $C$ (say, a holiday period) and you're simply picking up on that and not the genuine effect of $C$ , so that's a tough condition to swallow. I'd follow Ott Toomet's advice and start with a logistic regression (depending on your data, I think you could definitely overfit with a decision tree) and see what you can tease out. But ultimately, you need a heavy amount of domain knowledge of the area to carefully understand the results and even then, you're getting suggestive evidence, not conclusive. If you want to more solidly understand causality, you'd need to do something like a randomized experiment (i.e. randomly pick half your $A$ products to be in $C$ and half not in $C$ and then compare). Wish I had better answer, but causality is extraordinarily hard absent experimental data.
