Imports and extends provide different functions. By importing a package you have the ability to utilize any public class and public method within that package. Extending a class provides a much closer relationship to the class in question. You will be able to access protected members, as well as override members to modify or improve their functionality. The extending class is also considered a type of the original class. For example, assume if I have a Finance package that contains a EuropeanBanker class. This class has public methods that Add, Subtract, and report the balance of Euros and Pounds. Let's assume that these operations are very complicated to implement (exchange rates, transaction fees, whatever). By importing the Finance package I can utilize the Banker class to keep track of any Euros that I have. However, I will not be able to modify the Banker class. I cannot, for example, use the Banker class to keep track of dollars, pesos, or yen. But if I extend the EuropeanBanker class to create a UniversalBanker, for example, then I have a much deeper access to the class. I could add methods to allow transactions in dollars, yen, pesos, or any other currency. This could all be done leveraging the functionality that already exists in EuropeanBanker. I may be able to take advantage of protected methods for currency exchange rates, transaction fees, etc. Therefore, importing a package I can utilize existing functionality. But by extending a class I can add new functionality or override existing functionality.
