I agree the question is not well defined at present; you haven't defined what the model is with respect to the new parameter $\phi$, so it doesn't make sense to ask about ML estimates. We can ask about ML estimates of parameters that don't completely specify the model when we know what the model is (think ML estimate of Gaussian mean) and even parameters we don't directly observe (latent variables) using techniques such as the EM algorithm . We can also talk of constrained parameters, although I would argue in this case you would be better using a Bayesian approach. What we can't do is ask about parameters of some unknown model. From the looks of it, you're half way to defining some sort of hierarchal model; you need to specify what role $\phi$ plays in your model, then you can ask about its ML estimate.
