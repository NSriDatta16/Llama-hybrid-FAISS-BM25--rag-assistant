If you get no successes in (say) $n = 100$ trials, then you might use a Jeffreys Confidence interval for the true binomial $p.$ This style of CI has very good frequentist properties, but its motivation is in terms of a Bayesian argument using the non-informative prior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(.5,.5).$ For $n = 100$ it gives the 95% CI shown in the R code below, which amounts to $(0.000, 0.025).$ qbeta(c(.025,.975), 0+.5, 100+.5) [1] 4.898073e-06 2.474527e-02 If you want a one-sided CI (essentially 95% upper bound) then the the bound is 0.018. qbeta(.95, 0+.5, 100+.5) [1] 0.01897689 Notes: (1) I have never been a fan of the 'rule of three', even less nowadays when computation of more realistic intervals is so easy, using R. It seems that the rule of three is based on a kind of CI that has been shown not to have the claimed coverage probability. (2) With no successes at all, there may be philosophical difficulties centering on whether the true success probability may be $0,$ so that no legitimate CI exists. In about 35 years of organized listening at various radio frequencies for messages from extraterrestrials, no such messages have been confirmed. Maybe there are no extraterrestrials with radio transmitters beamed in our direction. Addendum re Comments: For given $n$ , it is almost always possible to cherry-pick individual values of $p.$ for which any style of CI has poor coverage probability. If $n=100, p=0.021,$ then a "95%" Jeffreys CI has about 98% coverage probability, as computed in R below. The discreteness of the binomial distribution implies swings in coverage probability for nearby values of $p.$ The idea is to pick a style of CI that does not get "too far" from 95% coverage for "most" of the values of $p$ of interest. I am not claiming that Jeffries CIs are always best, only that I prefer them to the 'Rule of 3'.
