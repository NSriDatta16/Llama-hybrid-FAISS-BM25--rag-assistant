I suggest you to take a look at the performance of mainstream taggers first. Namely: spacy , nltk , stanfordnlp . Check how good they are on finding the right set of names on your Test set. Alternatively, you must make your own tagger. Any NER tagger is fundamentally a classifier with RNN or CNN layers that process input text. The output, Dense layer has as many nodes as classes avilable. Another option is to download some pretrained model. For example, Huggingface's transformers library lets you download lots of Transformer-based architectures (like BERT), that you can then fine tune for your specific task. However, building your own model is a lot of work. If you find that mainstream classifiers do a pretty good job, and you don't have too much time, then go with those tools. Good luck!
