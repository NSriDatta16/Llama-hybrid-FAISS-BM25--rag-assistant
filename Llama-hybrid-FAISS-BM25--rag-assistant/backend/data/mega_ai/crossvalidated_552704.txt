The code you show seems to fit some kind of generalized linear model (see the method="glm" bit, perhaps a logistic regression with a logit-link function) to the data and picks hyper-parameters / evaluates based on 10-fold cross-validation. It's not clear to me what metric is being optimized (per binary log-loss, perhaps accuracy, perhaps AUC). In contrast, "AUC" is not a model. It means area under the curve and usually refers to in this context to the area under the receiver-operator curve . I.e. it's a metric of performance for binary classifiers (but there's ways of looking at it with more categories than two) that is different from accuracy, which is just the proportion of cases that is correctly classified (i.e. number correctly classified divided by total number of cases).
