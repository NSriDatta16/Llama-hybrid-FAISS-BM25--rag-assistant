Learn a mapping between two datasets using Neural Network

I have two matrices $A_1$ of size $N\times K$ and $A_2$ of size $M\times K$ which contain data and every row has a corresponding label $y \in {1, 2, 3}$. I want to learn a mapping between those two matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$. Is it possible to do it using some machine learning technique? For example can I learn a Neural Network given the input of $A_1$ and output $A_2$ for the each of the labels? Is it possible to create such kind of ANN?
