Use PyInit_embedded_hello instead of initembedded_hello for Python 3. Works for me with msvc9. Apparently quickstart\embedding.cpp has not been updated for Python 3. Take a look at pyhon/test/exec.cpp, which is similar and up to date. Msvc10 uses a different C runtime library than Python, which might lead to runtime crashes. The recommended compiler for building Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.2 extensions is msvc9, or a compiler that links against vc90crt.
