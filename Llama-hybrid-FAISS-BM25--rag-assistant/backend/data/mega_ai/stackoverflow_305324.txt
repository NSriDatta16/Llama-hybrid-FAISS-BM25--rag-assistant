What would you build using a multiway search tree.

I am currently teaching myself about various data strutures and am a little frustrated with the various types of trees. I can understand the purpose of organizing something into binary search trees but don't see any practical application of multiway search trees. Can someone please give some examples of problems they've implemented using multiway search trees?
