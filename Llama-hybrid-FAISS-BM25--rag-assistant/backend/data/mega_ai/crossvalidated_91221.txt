Find minimum number of batteries to last a week with 95% probability given mean and sd of lifetime

A TA needs a very important program on his computer but his power cable is missing. Luckily, he happens to have 100 batteries lying around and a contraption that can store batteries to use one at a time. From his understanding, the average lifetime of a battery will last 2 hours for his computer with a standard deviation of 30 minutes. How many batteries will he need to place in the contraption to keep his computer continuously running for the next 7 days (168 hours) with at least a 95% probability? I'm trying to approach this question using confidence intervals, but i'm confused what the sample proportion would be, would it be 84 batteries? cause u need 84 to run the computer for 168 hours, assuming each battery lasts exactly 2 hours. Would my standard error just be the standard deviation given? Or is there another way to approach this question
