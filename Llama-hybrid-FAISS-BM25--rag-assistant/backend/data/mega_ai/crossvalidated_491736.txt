Random forest hyperparameter to control misclassification

May I know what hyperparameter to tune for random forest classifier to control misclassification? I'm doing a 5-class classification problem and it turns out that most classes are been misclassified for the major class. Currently, I set the following hyperparameters model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200,max_depth=7, max_features=.4, min_samples_leaf=2) In total, I have 40 features, so 40% of the features ( 16-features ) are used to build the trees.
