WPF touchScreen ListBox control design

I need to allow the user to select the item in a listbox on mouse down and when the user drags up or down i need to scroll the items in listbox, since the user interacts with the listbox touch touch screen, i want some thing like the ipod behaviour. User should be able to touch/grab the item and drag it up or down to scroll the listbox.
