Estimating X based on Y values in neural network

Let's say I have a trained neural network model, preferably with couple of dense layers. It has learned to estimate Y values based on X values. Can I somehow use the same trained model and find approximation of X values that result in a specific Y values? In other words, I have some Y values, I'd like to find out X values which if I feed to the same model, result those Y values.
