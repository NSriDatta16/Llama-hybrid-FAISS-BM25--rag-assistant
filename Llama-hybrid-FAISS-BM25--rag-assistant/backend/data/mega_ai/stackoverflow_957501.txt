Property getters and setters can go by whichever naming convention you desire, or that your organization has standardized. A good naming convention is simply one that is common among those who will use/see it. That said, most in the Java community use 'getSomething/setSomething' as the naming convention on getters and setters. Base constructors are called automatically, just like C#.
