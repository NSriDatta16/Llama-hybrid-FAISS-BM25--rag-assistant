I could find a way to debug dynamic library in Xcode. Build Make a library, I'll call this arith library. Debug build to make libarith.dylib. Make a project to use the library, I'll call this usearith. For userarith, Project->Add To Project, and add the arith library. Open Project info, and open the Build tab. Go to Search Paths/Library Search Paths, drag and drop the arith library. You should remove the library name as you need only specify the path. Specify the header directory with 'Header Search Paths'. Go to Linking, set Other Linker Flags, add -larith Running Now, you should be able to link the execution binary to the library. For running, you need to copy the dynamic library to the directory where the execution binary is located. Debugging You need to set the breakpoints both arith/usearith. You can run debugger in arith and use the step into to debug the code in a arith project.
