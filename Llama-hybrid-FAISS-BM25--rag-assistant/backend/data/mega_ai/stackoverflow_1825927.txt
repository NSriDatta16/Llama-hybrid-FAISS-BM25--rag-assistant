Following code in the window procedure seems to handle the case of user dragging the window edge/corner: case WM_SIZING: RECT &rc = *(LPRECT) lParam; RECT windowRect; GetWindowRect(hwnd, &windowRect); rc = windowRect; return 0; I did not find anything yet to prevent the system from resizing the window when tiling/cascading windows. I hoped following might do the trick, but it seems it does not: case WM_SIZE: return TRUE; I guess I can find similar measure for other cases, but at least I would need to know the exhaustive list of messages which can result in a window changing its size. Also, while this really prevents the window from resizing, I would rather prevent the user from even initiating the resize, than apparently letting him to resize and then refusing to do so.
