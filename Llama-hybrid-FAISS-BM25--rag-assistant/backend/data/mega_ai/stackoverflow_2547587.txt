It really depends on the timing and load of the warehouse operations that will affect on your OLTP. For example, if you have major number crunching that takes a lot of resources, but you do it in the night / at a time when the OLTP is not used much, you should be fine. If you use proper indexing and put aggregate tables in place so that you do not crunch much at report data retrieval time, then the resource utilization of the OLAP is fairly low. The biggest thing you should do is denormalize, denormalize, denormalize. Make the reporting structures as flat as possible and then build good index structure to support your queries. A lot of implementations already share resources between OLAP and OLTP. Just don't let counting beans get in the way of making beans, and vice versa and you should be OK.
