There's no concept of web/browser session (whatever that means to you) in iOS. iOS applications are just launched when a user touches the icon, and are quit when the user quit them. Typically you require the user to input the login id and the password when the app is launched, and you create a web/server/browser session by accessing the web server. You can keep the id and the password securely inside in the storage of the iPhone, so that the user doesn't need to input them again and again whenever the program is launched.
