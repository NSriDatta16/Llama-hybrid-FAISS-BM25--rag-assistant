Please refer to below article for more information about mailto: protocol sytax http://www.ianr.unl.edu/internet/mailto.html The MailTo command can do more than enter a single e-mail address in the "Send To" field while activating your e-mail program. It can also: Feature Syntax Address message to multiple recipients , (comma separating e-mail addresses) Add entry in the "Subject" field subject=Subject Field Text Add entry in the "Copy To" or "CC" field cc=id@internet.node Add entry in the "Blind Copy To" or "BCC" field bcc=id@internet.node Add entry in the "Body" field body=Your message here Within the body use "%0A" for a new line, use "%0A%0A" for a new line preceded by a blank line (paragraph), see example below. Notes: " " (beginning and ending double quotes) are necessary if any spaces are used Mailto parameter should be preceded by "?" for the first or only parameter and "&" for second and subsequent parameter. I doubt about Attachments. I dont think you can apply attachments with mailto links. But still lets see if some one knows about this.
