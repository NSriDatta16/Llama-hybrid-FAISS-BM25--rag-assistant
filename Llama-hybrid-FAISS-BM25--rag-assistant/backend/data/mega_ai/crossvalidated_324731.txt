I don't think it does make sense in this case to have a seasonal AR component at lag of 2 periods but not 1. The interpretation would be that somehow the unemployment this quarter is impacted on unemployment in the same quarter two years ago, but not by unemployment last year. This seems unlikely. I suspect you've got as far as you can with this dataset as a univariate time series. My preference, based on KPSS tests and AIC, would be an ARIMA(1,1,0) model (this is what Hyndman's auto.arima comes up with) ie differenced, but no seasonality. However, the forecasts from ARIMA(1,1,0), ARIMA(1,0,0) and SARIMA(1,0,0)(2,0,0) all look very similar, with big chunks of uncertainty about the predictions. I would say that this data: is difficult to model well or predict with any precision shows mild evidence of non-stationarity (ie against your assumption, noted in the previous question, that unemployment is just hovering around the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) and appears to be secularly increasing; but more evidence needed to be really sure doesn't show evidence of seasonality (this is a bit surprising - are you sure you're not working with figures that have already been seasonally adjusted? Maybe link to the original). An interesting feature of this data is that it shows signs of being less volatile as it gets bigger; basically because of the down and up during the global financial crisis. Some kind of ARCH model might be useful, depending on your purpose.
