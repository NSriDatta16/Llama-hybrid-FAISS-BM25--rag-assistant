The distribution of the sum of independent random variables is the convolution their distributions. As you have noted, the convolution of two Gaussians happens to be Gaussian. The distribution of a mixture model performs a weighted average of the RV's distributions. Samples from (finite) mixture models can be produced by flipping a coin (or rolling a die) to decide which distribution to draw from: Say I have two RVs $X,Y$ and I want to produce an RV $Z$ whose distribution is the average of $X$ and $Y$ If I flip a coin, let $Z=X$. if I land tails, let $Z=Y$.
