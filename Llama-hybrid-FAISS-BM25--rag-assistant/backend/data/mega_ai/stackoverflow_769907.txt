Testing! (unit testing, integration testing, fixtures, mock objects, ...) And not a programming skill, but surely a development skill: using revision control, and learning to commit sets of changes that handle one (or a few related) requirement, or bugfix, and will always result in a source tree that compiles without errors. This will teach you to organize your work :-) And last but not least: English... :-) Again, this is not a programming skill, and I know some may disagree, but I feel that any programming language that uses English keywords, should also be programmed in English. So: use English variable names, and so on. I'd even say that the code comments should be in English, but I am sure even more people would disagree about that... So: learn how others describe their code, and adhere to that.
