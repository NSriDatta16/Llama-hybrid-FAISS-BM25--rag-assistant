Working with Covid-19 Dataset in R, Checking Data Assumptions Through Model Fitting

Im working on a dataset of individuals with the covid-19 infection. The dataset consist of 2010 individuals and four columns: deceased : if the person died of corona (1:yes, 0:no) sex : male/female age : age of the person (ranging from 2 to 99 years old) country : which country the person is from (France, Japan, Korea, Indonesia) The dataset can be loaded with the following code: id = "1CA1RPRYqU9oTIaHfSroitnWrI6WpUeBw" d.corona = read.csv(sprintf("https://docs.google.com/uc?id=%s&export=download",id),header = T) Im trying to answer the following questions: Is age a greater risk factor for males than for females? Is age a greater risk factor for the French population than for the Korean population? It seems like the French population is at much higher risk of dying from Covid-19 than the other countries (just from inspecting data). Does this seem like a valid result, or could it be influenced by the way the data were collected? I was thinking it would be a good idea to fit some appropriate models to answer the questions. I already fit a logistic regression model with glm but I don't see how I could use that to answer these specific questions. For the very last question I believe the mean age in France is significantly higher than in the other countries, which would explain why it seems like the probability of dying from the virus is higher in France based on the data. But Im sure there could be a better explanation.
