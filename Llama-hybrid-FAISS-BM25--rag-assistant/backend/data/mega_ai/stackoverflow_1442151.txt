When I copied your routine, I did get a white space / tab error error. Check your tabs. You were indexing into the URL string incorrectly using your loop counter. This would have also messed you up. Also, you don't really need to control the loop with a counter. This will loop for each line entry in your CSV file. #Python v2.6.2 import csv import urllib2 import re urls = csv.reader(open('list.csv')) for url in urls: response = urllib2.urlopen(url[0]) html = response.read() print re.findall('td7.*?td',html) Lastly, be sure that your URLs are properly formed: http://www.cnn.com http://www.fark.com http://www.cbc.ca
