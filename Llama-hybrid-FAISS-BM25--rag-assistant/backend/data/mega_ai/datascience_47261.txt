Yes, it pass every new point (separately) through every tree in the trained model, and then runs the exact same splits with the exact same original subset data (plus this single new point), to determine the number of steps (anomaly score) until this new point gets isolated. Then it will average the path length computed from all the trees for that test instance and this would be the final anomaly score which is then normalized in the range 0-1.
