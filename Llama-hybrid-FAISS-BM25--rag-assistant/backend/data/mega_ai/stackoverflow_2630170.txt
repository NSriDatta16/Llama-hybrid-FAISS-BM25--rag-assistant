You can create a CS file and a custom partial class. public partial class myClass And, see if you can place associations there. I haven't worked with custom associations in this way but it looks like it is applied to the property. You can cut and paste the property into the partial class and this will build. public partial class Parent { [Association(Name = "Parent_Child", Storage = "_Childs", ThisKey = "ParentKey", OtherKey = "ChildKey")] public EntitySet Childs { get { return this._Childs; } set { this._Childs.Assign(value); } } }
