The standard approach is to monitor the rate of fluctuation, and pick some threshold small enough to be considered 'steady state'. Using a provided mean value is fragile because it hard-codes the absolute value of the solution you're looking for. I would just calculate the standard deviation for a window of points, say the last 50, and declare the steady state reached when that deviation falls below an acceptable minimum (you do have to pick the minimum deviation yourself, because this is your definition of 'steady state'). This is roughly equivalent to accepting the answer when the wiggles in your graph become small enough for some sustained time.
