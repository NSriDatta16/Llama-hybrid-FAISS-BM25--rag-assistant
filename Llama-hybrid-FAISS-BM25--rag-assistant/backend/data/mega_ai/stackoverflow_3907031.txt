Creating readable list output in PHP/Wordpress

I'm trying to figure out how best to get this PHP statement $wpdb->get_results("SELECT verb, display_name AS organization, inline_the FROM userorganizations U, organizations O WHERE U.org_id = O.ID AND U.user_id=$author_id", OBJECT); To spit out something like the following: John works for Initech, owns John's Tasty Pastry, and writes for the New York Times I can do almost everything except figure out a good way to insert the bolded "and" up above: I don't know how to iterate through to just before the final row, do something special, then run the final row.
