Average of a financial ratio: which average

A financial ratio, like e.g., return on equity (ROE) is a division of two numbers ROE=return/equity. If I analyse a whole sector then one can compute the ROE for each company in that sector and thus the distribution of ROE for that sector. If I want to 'summarise' the distribution then I have the choice (ao) to (1) take the average of all ROE or (2) take (sum of all returns) / (sum of all equities). Which one is preferable?
