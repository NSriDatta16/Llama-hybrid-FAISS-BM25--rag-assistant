From the syntax reference you can see that either var or varReader is The name of a scoped attribute to store the result of the fragment invocation in So I am afraid the sample code contains an error. If you need to write the result of jsp:invoke directly to the page you do not need to assign it to a var. Can you try leaving out the "varReader" attribute?
