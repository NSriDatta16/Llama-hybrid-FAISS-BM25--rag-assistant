There are two things you could do (separately or in combination) Model the tail One is to model the tail of the distribution using a parametric distribution. Power laws are known to fit the distribution of wealth well, so you try a Pareto distribution. You would either fit that distribution by maximum likelihood, that is, by finding the parameters which best represent your sample. Or better, you could put a Bayesian priors on the parameters, and compute the full posterior. Unfortunately, power laws are very sensitive to parameters, and without many large datapoints in your sample, there will be a lot of uncertainty about the exponent. The estimated number of billionaires will be sensitive to this parameter, but much less than the average wealth of billionaires, so the situation isn't too bad. Importance sampling The other one is to change the way you collect your sample. Suppose that you suspect (as you should) there are more billionaires per capita in Monaco or Zurich than in Mogadishiu. If you know the population of each of these cities, you could collect a larger sample in the cities where you expect to see more billionaires, and a smaller one in the others. So say Zurich has 400,000 people and Mogadishu 1,400,000 and we want to poll 9,000 people. We're interested here in the number of millionaires, not billionaires. A unbiased sample would select 2,000 people in Zurich and 7,000 in Mogadishu. However, we'll bias the sample by sampling seven fold more often from Zurich. So we'll "pretend" that Zurich has 2,800,000 people and adjust later. This means we'll poll 6,000 people in Zurich instead of 2,000 and 4,000 in Mogadishu. Say we count 21 millionaires in our Zurich sample, and only 1 in our Mogadishu sample. Since we over sampled Zurich 7 fold, we would only count it as 3 millionaires. This procedure will decrease the variance of your estimator. It can also be used in conjunction with the first method, in which case you will be adjusting for the importance sampling when fitting a parametric distribution.
