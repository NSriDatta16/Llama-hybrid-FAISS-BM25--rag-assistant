Suitable regression model for limited, discrete dependent variable

I have data where the dependent variable is discrete and lies between 20 and 40 (possible values are 20, 20.5, 21, 21.5, ..., 39, 39.5, 40). The variable measures some results from a game which can be between 20 (lowest achievable value) and 40 (highest). After some hours of research on the web, I could not find a regression model that ideally fits those characteristics of the described dependend variable. Given what I found, maybe a multinomial logistic regression fits best although my dependent variable is not nomial. I would be very thankful if you could propose me a regression model that fits my problem best according to your consideration. Thanks a lot!!! :)
