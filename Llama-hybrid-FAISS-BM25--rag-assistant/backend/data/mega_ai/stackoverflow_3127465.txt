When you say the UDP socket closes, what exactly do you mean? You try send and it fails? For SCTP, can you collect wireshark or pcap traces at the time these I/O operations runs (preferably run wireshark on the peer)? My guess is (an educated guess without looking at the code), when these I/O operations comes into the picture, your process gets starved for CPU time. The other end sends SCTP Heartbeat messages to which it gets no replies. Or if data was flowing, the peer end is not receiving any SACKS as they have not yet been processed by the SCTP stack at your end. The peer, therefore, aborts the association internally and stops sending you data (since it sees all the paths as down ergo does not send ABORT. In such a case, your SCTP stack will still think Association is alive). Try to confirm what are the values for Heartbeat timeout, RTO timeout,SACK timeout, maximum Path retransmission & max Association retransmission at the peer end. I haven't worked with Kernel SCTP but sysctl should be able to give you those values. Either ways, collecting pcap traces when you observe this problem would give us much better insight to what is going wrong. I hope it helps.
