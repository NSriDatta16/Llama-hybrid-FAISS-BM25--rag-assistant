Is there a onselect event for non-form elements?

Say I want to hide a span when the user highlights a bit of text containing that span, with the intention of copying that text on to his clipboard. For example: The dragon a large, mythical beast belched fire at St. George. I have found that in Firefox Mac, span.tooltip will disappear from view (in accordance with my CSS declarations) but will show up in the clipboard when it's copied there. I figured (wrongly?) that if I said "onHighlight, hide tooltip," maybe this wouldn't happen.
