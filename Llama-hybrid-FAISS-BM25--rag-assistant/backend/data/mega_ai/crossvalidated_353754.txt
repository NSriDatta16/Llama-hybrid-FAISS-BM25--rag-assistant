depending on the use case, exactly what you are trying to achieve and the outcome there are a few methods you could use to approach this problem. Mixed effects models allow you to model fixed and random effects (time and measurement) with respect to some outcomes and other random effects (age etc).You can then use this as a predictive model to predict in unseen data. In a more "machine learning" approach, LSTMs/RNNs can use sequence analysis to predict an outcome or for forecasting. These (generally) require that your sequences are of equal length.
