There aren't any big flaws in ZIPs password. There are tools that can crack a zip file password but they have to do it using brute force, usually starting with a dictionary attack. For protecting files locally or on a network, it should be fine as long as you pick a long enough password. I'd suggest using a phrase like 'givemelibertyorgivemedeath' or whatever. Long enough to make brute force attacks unfeasible but short enough to keep from being a pain to type everything you need to unlock a file.
