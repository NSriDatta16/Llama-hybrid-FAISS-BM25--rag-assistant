You need to ensure that the FacesServlet is mapped in web.xml and that the request URL (which appears in browser address bar) matches the of the FacesServlet . E.g., if you have a simple.jsp file in webcontent and the FacesServlet is mapped on an of *.jsf , then you need to open it by http://localhost:8080/contextname/simple.jsf . facesServlet javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet 1 facesServlet *.jsf Unrelated to the concrete problem: why would you ever prefer the legacy/discouraged JSP over its modern successor Facelets which is the standard view technology since JSF 2.0?
