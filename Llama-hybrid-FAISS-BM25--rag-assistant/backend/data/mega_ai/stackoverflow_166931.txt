Personally, I'd put 'How can worker threads update the UI' right under entry-level. Mid-level, if you really need to. If an entry-level programmer can understand the difference between the logical tree and the visual tree, they should understand how to update the UI from a background thread. At my organization, we do a lot of WPF development without Blend. I don't particularly like Blend, so I'm a bit biased, but Blend skills should be a nice-to-have, I think.
