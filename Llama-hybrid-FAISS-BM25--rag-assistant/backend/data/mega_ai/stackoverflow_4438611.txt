I usually write junit tests for accessors. It doesn't add much when they're written, except to keep coverage statistics pretty. But if someone adds "sufficient logic" later to the production code, the tests will already be in place to catch any mistakes. Also it is the work of moments to write a test to check the value returned by a getter.
