Determine best model for variable selection process

When we do variable selection, theoretically we fit a model for each selected subset of variables. We can then compare all models and select the best. There are various statistic to help selecting best model, such as Bayesian information criterion, adjusted R2. My question is that why can't we just use the RSE or R2 that are statistics used for model accuracy?
