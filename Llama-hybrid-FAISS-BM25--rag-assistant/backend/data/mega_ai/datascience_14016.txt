You could pick a few time windows at specific times since the post and try to regress on that. Since it is count data the obvious choice would be to model the outcome as a Poisson counting process. There are multiple models that are able to do this natively, some generalized linear models but also Neural Networks with a certain loss function. Another option is to model the fraction of followers that will like the post. This is likely easier to generalize however a small portion of the posts goes 'viral' beyond their own followers. This will be tricky to model anyway and you could clip these instances to a fraction of 1.
