How to interpret extreme small coefficient for all predictors in logistic regression model?

I am trying to build a prediction model of outcome of intervention. I used the logistic regression model, and Calibration and discrimination was confirmed very well. but the final model shows very small coefficient for all predictors. How can I interpret them? Are they not associated with outcome? My sample is only 90 samples. Call: glm(formula = outcome_m6 ~ lesion_size + index_cat.x + pain_score.x, family = binomial, data = data_prediction_model_lesion_size_NA) Coefficients: (Intercept) lesion_size2 lesion_size3 index_cat.x2 index_cat.x3 1.954e+01 -2.025e+01 -2.167e+01 -3.694e+01 -1.885e+01 pain_score.x1 pain_score.x2 pain_score.x3 pain_score.x4 pain_score.x5 -1.830e+01 2.115e+01 1.410e+00 1.816e+00 4.113e-01 pain_score.x6 pain_score.x7 pain_score.x8 pain_score.x9 pain_score.x10 5.722e+01 2.028e+01 2.014e+01 -2.533e-11 2.170e+01
