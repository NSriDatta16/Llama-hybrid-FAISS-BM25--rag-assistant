Your first example doesn’t make much sense: pages is an array whose elements are objects but there are no key-value pairs. Your second example makes more sense: pages is an array where which element is in turn another array containing a list of objects. Note that neither of your examples is valid JSON. As explained in the previous paragraph, your first example has objects with no key-value pairs. Furthermore, in both examples the strings aren’t quoted. In JSON, every string must be quoted, be it a key or a value.
