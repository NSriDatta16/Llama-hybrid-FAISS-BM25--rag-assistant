Managed OleDB provider written in C#

An OleDB provider is a binary implementing COM interfaces provided by Microsoft. From that it seems to be possible to create a provider using C#. Is that correct? Is there a sample demonstrating that? If not, would you discourage me from doing that? I see that there are multiple unmanaged samples but I can't find any managed.
