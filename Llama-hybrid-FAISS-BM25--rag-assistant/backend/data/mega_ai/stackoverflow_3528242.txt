Thanks 'Stegeman' and 'smoove666'. It indeed seemed that the alphabetical autoloading of models was causing my issues. The generated models ended up in a directory structure as follows: ./models/Aguy.php ./models/Pguy.php ./models/Zguy.php ./models/generated/BaseAguy.php ./models/generated/BasePguy.php ./models/generated/BaseZguy.php Thus any class name starting with a letter before 'g' would "crash" as the Base* models in the generated folder had not yet loaded (ie. Aguy.php would "crash" but Pguy.php and Zguy.php would work) Moving all the Base* models out of the generated folder into the models directory partially solved this problem. Now any class starting with a letter > 'b' would work (ie. now classes starting in C to F would not crash as Base* models had autoloaded loaded prior). To completely get the solution working, I placed all Base* models into a directory called _generated as _ comes before 'a' alphabetically. The directory structure now looks like: ./models/_generated/BaseAguy.php ./models/_generated/BasePguy.php ./models/_generated/BaseZguy.php ./models/Aguy.php ./models/Pguy.php ./models/Zguy.php Problem solved - little hair left. Thanks for your input. edit: A more elegant solution to this problem can be found at: Why can't I create a Doctrine model named 'Album' The problem can be solved by telling Doctrine explicitly the loading order of the directory containing the models Doctrine::loadModels(array(APPPATH.'/models/generated', APPPATH.'/models')); Credit to Sander Versluys
