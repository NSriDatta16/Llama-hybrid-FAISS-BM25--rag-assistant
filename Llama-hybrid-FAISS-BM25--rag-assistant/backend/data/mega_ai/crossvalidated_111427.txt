I have seen statements like "We pick representative samples...". This is an absurd statement... I agree with you on this. And I don't think representative sampling is what they do (anymore). My understanding is that they analyse big data with distributed computing, using technology like Hadoop, Spark , and MLLib . I am sure they write their proprietary and complex machine learning / analysis libraries on top of these. The algorithms for these "distributable" systems are coded differently than how you and I would code them in e.g. R, Matlab or Python. They need to be scalable and parallelisable, which is an issue for some algorithms. MLLib, for instance, currently only supports some very basic algorithms (list available on their website).
