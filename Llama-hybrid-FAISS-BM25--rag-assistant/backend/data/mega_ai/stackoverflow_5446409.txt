Reading from a network stream: packet fragmentation

I got a server that is managing two clients through NetworkStream.Read . Application protocol is: ClientMessage [128 Bytes] â†’ Response from Server [128 Bytes] Now at server-side: Is it possible, that MyTcpClient.GetStream().Read() returns only I guess that such a client message is short enough to fit into one packet on the tcp/ip layer - but could there be some kind of fragmentation or random although? Is NetworkStream.DataAvailable the right attribute to defend against this? After running smoothly for hours, i sometimes get strange errors and connection losses, that point to something like that. Thanks in advance.
