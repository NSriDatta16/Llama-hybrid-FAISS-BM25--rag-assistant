This seems to be the surprising answer: For each Xalan implementation use a seperate classloader, and add a file in META-INF\services\ called javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory Edit it and put it's only content the Xalan implementation the class loader will use, e.g.: com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl NOTE: The nice thing here is that as opposed to the regular class loading delegation, META-INF\services is being searched in the current class loader first , where as classes are being search in the parent, then system, and only then in the child classloder
