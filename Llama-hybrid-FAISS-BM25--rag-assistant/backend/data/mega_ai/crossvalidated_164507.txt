Log of Average v. Average of Log

I am constructing a dataset of monthly averages based on daily data. This dataset will be used for standard regression analysis. I anticipate wanting to transform the dependent variable, which has an approximately log-normal distribution. My question is whether it is more appropriate to transform the data before or after taking the monthly average.
