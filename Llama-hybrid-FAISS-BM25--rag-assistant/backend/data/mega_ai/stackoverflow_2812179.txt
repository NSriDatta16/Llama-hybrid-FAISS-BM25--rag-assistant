Magento: What is the best way to extend Magento to add a class that is called on every page load

I am looking to create some new functionality to Magento. I am going to be looking to the url and grabbing a parameter. The issue is, this can be on any page. So I can't just extend a Catalog or Checkout Module. I thought about extending the session classes but I wasn't sure it really fit. Basically I want to grab a parameter from the url and from there add some functionality if it is set or not. I don't think a class will get auto loaded unless it is instantiated somewhere else with a getModel method, am I wrong? How can you add a module that doesn't have a url path for controller and what not, but doesn't fit extending one of the core modules? I looked for a generic event but didn't really see one like before_page_load or something
