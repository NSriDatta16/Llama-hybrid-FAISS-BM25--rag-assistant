How to Create a Zend_Navigation Dummy Node - Zend Framework 1.11.4

i'm trying to create a node in the Zend_Navigation tree that is just used for organizing the links within it. therefore it would NOT require an anchor tag when rendered and not show up in the breadcrumb. anyone know how to make this happen?
