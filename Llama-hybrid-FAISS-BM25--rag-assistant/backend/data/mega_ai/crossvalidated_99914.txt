Is f-measure synonymous with accuracy?

I understand that f-measure (based on precision and recall) is an estimate of how accurate a classifier is. Also, f-measure is favored over accuracy when we have an unbalanced dataset. I have a simple question (which is more about using correct terminology than about technology). I have an unbalanced dataset and I use f-measure in my experiments. I am about to write a paper which is NOT for a machine learning/ data mining conference. Hence, can I refer to f-measure synonymously with accuracy in this context. For eg, I have a f-measure of 0.82, then can I say my classifier achieves 82% accurate predictions?
