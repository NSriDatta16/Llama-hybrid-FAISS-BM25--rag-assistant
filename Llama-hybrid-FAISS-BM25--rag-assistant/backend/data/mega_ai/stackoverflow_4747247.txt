My suggestion would be to look into the customer import api and build out a script using the methods from the code base, using the API will be slower so since you will be running the script on your server you can build it using the actual methods. So you can look at this folder for the customer api classes and methods /app/code/core/Mage/Customer/Model/Customer and then here for the address api classes and methods /app/code/core/Mage/Customer/Model/Address/ You would probably need to export your data to CSV and get it in the right format to import into Magento. 30k isn't that much so you can even try out the normal import process that is default Magento. We haven't had good luck with that but we have been importing hundreds of thousands of customers. Even then we break the file down into small chunks of customers at a time.
