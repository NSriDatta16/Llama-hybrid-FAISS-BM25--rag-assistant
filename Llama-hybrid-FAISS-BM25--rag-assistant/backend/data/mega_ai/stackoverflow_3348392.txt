Monitoring TeamCity build process

Is there a way to see exactly the output of the TeamCity build agent? I suspect that one of the build steps shows a dialog which causes the build process to stop. But logging in to the build agent computer remotely does not give any hints as to what is currently happening. The build log shows the command that executes before the process stops, but it doesn't show any error message. The actual command is an invocation of sigcheck.exe (from SysInternals). (I tried running this command locally, and it caused a Windows dialog to be shown. I think it contained some license information.)
