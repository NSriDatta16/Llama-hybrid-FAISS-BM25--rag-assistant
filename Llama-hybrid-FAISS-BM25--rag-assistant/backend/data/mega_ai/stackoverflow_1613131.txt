The answer to that is "maybe". It's possible the file retrieval may be fine, but if you need to do any maintenance on the folder, it would be a huge headache as processes attempt ot enumerate the directory listings. What would improve the situation would be a number of sub directories under the images folder (or two levels, depending on how many images you're looking at storing), so you have a hierarchy like this: siteroot -- uploads ---- a ---- b ---- c : ---- z ...and then store files based on their first letter (so all images with names starting 'a' go into the folder 'a'). You could have this as a two or three letter suffix (aa, ab, ac, ad ..., ba, bb, bc ..., zx, zy, zz) and possibly have a hierarchy under that as well so you split files across a number of folders dependent on the first four characters of the name. If files are then assigned a random alpha-numeric name then this would ensure files are spread evenly across all the folders (given a large enough sample size). You might want to consider a mix of your option (1) and splitting images over a hierarchy as I've described above. That would ensure that if a single user does upload lots of files, then you're covered. Similarly, if you're looking at a lot of user directories, the same principle applies to ensure you don't have 1,000,000 user directories under a single parent.
