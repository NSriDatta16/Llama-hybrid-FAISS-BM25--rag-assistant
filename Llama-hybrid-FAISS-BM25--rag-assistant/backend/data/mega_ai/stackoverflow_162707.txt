Yes, provide a different API for getting different versions. Either a single methodcall for doing a retrieval of a particular item of a particular revision, or a methodcall for getting a 'view' of a particular revision, which you could then access like a normal dict, depending on whether such a 'view' would see much use. Or both, considering the dict-view solution would need some way to get a particular revision's item anyway: class RevisionView(object): def __init__(self, db, revid): self.db = db self.revid = revid def __getitem__(self, item): self.db.getrev(item, self.revid)
