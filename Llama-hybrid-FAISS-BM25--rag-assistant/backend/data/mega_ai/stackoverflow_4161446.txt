SQL Server equivalent of SQL Azure DBCOPY ("AS COPY OF")

SQL Azure has a really handy command for copying databases: CREATE DATABASE NewDatabase AS COPY OF ExistingDatabase Is there anything similar in SQL Server 2008 R2? I just want a command to do a simple local copy without any DTS, SQL Server Agent, etc. Ideally, I'd like to create multiple copies efficiently.
