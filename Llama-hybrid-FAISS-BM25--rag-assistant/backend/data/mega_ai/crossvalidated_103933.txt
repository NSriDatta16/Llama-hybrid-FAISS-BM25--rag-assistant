This "random variable" is similar to the idea of having a flat prior on the entire real line (your second example). To show that there can be no random variable $X$ such that $P(X=q)=c$ for all $q\in \mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ and constant $c$, we use the $\sigma$-additive property of random variables: the countable union of disjoint events has probability equal to the (possibly infinite) sum of probabilites of the events. So, if $c=0$, the probability $P(X\in\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1])=0$, as it is the sum of countably many zeros. If $c>0$, then $P(X\in\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1])=\infty$. However a proper random variable taking values in $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ must be such that $P(X\in\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1])=1$, so there is no such random variable. The key here, as you may already be aware, is that if the space is composed of finitely many points, then we can use $c>0$ and have no problem with the sum, and if the space has uncountably many points you can have $c=0$ and the $\sigma$-additivity isn't violated when integrating over the space because it is a statement about countable things. However you're going to problems when you want a uniform distribution over a countably infinite set. In the context of a Bayesian prior, though, you can of course just say that $P(X=q)\propto 1$ for all $q\in \mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ if you're willing to use the improper prior.
