First application of ncvTest reports that there is no heteroscedasticity, as it should. The second is not meaningful, since your dependent random variable is random walk. Breusch-Pagan test is assymptotic, so I suspect that it cannot be readily applied for random walk. I do not think that there are tests for heteroscedasticity for random walks, due to the fact that non-stationarity poses much more problems than the heteroscedasticity, hence testing for the latter in the presence of the former is not practical.
