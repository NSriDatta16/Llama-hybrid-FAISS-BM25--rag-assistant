I have been impressed with the flexibility and power of KnowledgeTree 's permission system. It's roughly organized as follows: Business Units -> Groups (and subgroups) -> Roles -> User KT is a document management system but all permissions are assigned at the directory level, not on assets themselves. Each asset and sub-directory inherits the permissions from its parent. This allows you to set pretty broad permissions on a group basis and really narrow it down by setting more explicit permissions on a role. Users are then assigned to roles on an as-needed basis; user A might be assigned to an Editor role for directory X but not to Y. Those permissions would layer on top of whatever group user A is already in. My one complaint is that there's no real way to define specific permissions to a user directly. If I want user B to have certain access to all directories, I either have to add them to a group or assign them to a role (which in turn must be created or assigned to directories). TYPOlight webCMS kind of rectifies this problem although it's not nearly as robust. Each user in the CMS may use their group permissions (only), extend their group permissions with individual permissions, or use individual permissions (only).
