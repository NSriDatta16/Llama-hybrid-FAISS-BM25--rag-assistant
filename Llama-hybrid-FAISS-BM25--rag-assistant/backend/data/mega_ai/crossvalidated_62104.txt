The solution method is mentioned in the title: recursion. The expected number of rolls $e$ is the sum of: $1$ for the first roll and The expected number of subsequent rolls if the first roll is a 2 . In the latter case, the expected number of subsequent rolls is $2e$ because the whole process is started over twice (independently). Because the latter case occurs with probability $1/3$, we obtain the recursive relationship $$e = 1 + (1/3)\times (2e)$$ whose solution is $e=3$. For the generalizations of this question, similar recursive equations will be obtained (although they might be a little more complicated) and are almost as easy to solve. For the sceptical--and everybody should be when it comes to probability questions :-)--here's R code to simulate the experiment. roll Sample output: user system elapsed 14.82 0.04 14.86 [1] 2.994785 3.009526 3.024267 The simulation average is $3.01$, which is reasonably close to $3$. (I use three standard errors to assess the precision because the distribution is highly skewed: draw a histogram as hist(x) to see.)
