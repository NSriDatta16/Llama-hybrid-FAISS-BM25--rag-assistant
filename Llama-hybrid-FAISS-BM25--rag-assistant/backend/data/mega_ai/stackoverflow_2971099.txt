Okay, where to begin? First I would challenge the party that wrote this blurb/ question to review the Adobe website for more than a Steve Jobs Fan-boy perspective on web publishing technology and RIA developement. NVIDIA, Google (Android OS), RIM, PalmOne (now HP), Nokia, and a laundry list of OEMs have all joined the OPEN SCREEN Project. This organization and it's various partners have all joined forces to ensure that ADOBE FLASH (10.1) and AIR (2.0) is optimized for mobile devices primarily through hardware acceleration. The iphone came out in 2007 and WOW (past tense). Now as we prepare to enter a new decade the technology that drove iphone sales is current tech (see: old news). Soon all of the Jobs-Fanboys will be the only ones without FLASH or AIR (note: WIRED ipad publication isn't FLASH, if that wasn't already obvious.) Additionally for the record Adobe does make HTML5 tools. It was never Flash VS HTML5. To imply that you either have to choose FLASH OR HTML is just plain silly and shows how well your apple branded mind-conditioning and propaganda has over come you. I won't invest the time to address the folly you posted about JavaScript and user disabling it.
