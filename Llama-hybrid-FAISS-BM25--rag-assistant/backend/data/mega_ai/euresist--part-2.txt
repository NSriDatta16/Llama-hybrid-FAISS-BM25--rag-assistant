fect on the amount of HIV in the blood. The EuResist system was tested and compared with its predecessors by feeding it with historical data on patients for which treatment results are known. In one study in 2011 conducted by the British HIV Association, with a modest sample size of 15 treatment successes and 10 treatment failures, it was found that EuResist performed "comparably to or better than human experts". History EuResist started in 2006 as a consortium funded by the European Union as part of the Virtual Physiological Human FP-6 framework. The partners of this consortium were: IBM Haifa Research Laboratory (Israel) Informa S.r.l. (Italy) Karolinska Institutet (Sweden) Kingston University (United Kingdom) Max Planck Institute for Informatics (Germany) MTA Wigner Fizikai Kutatóközpont Részecske- és Magfizikai Intézet (Hungary) University of Siena (Italy) Universitätsklinikum Köln (Germany) The consortium completed its commitment to the European Union in late 2008, at which time the EuResist system became available on line. The first five partners mentioned above continued to form a non-profit organization that maintains the system, expands the database with new clinical and genomical records and updates the prediction engines accordingly. As of mid-2010, an average of 600 queries are submitted to the EuResist system every quarter. In 2010, it was reportedly the first decision support system of its kind to be available for free use online for customised highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV. Awards On June 1, 2009, EuResist received a Computerworld honors program laureate award, a global program honoring individuals and organizations that use information technology to benefit society.
