Bayesian approach and ML approach for distributions

Suppose that we have two sets of discrete random variables X ~ f(θ), Y ~g(θ) where X and Y are independent, and the parameter θ is the same in both cases. We are interested in predicting Y on the basis of observations of X . Describe the maximum likelihood approach to predicting features of the distribution of Y based on observing that X = x obs Describe the Bayesian approach to computing the posterior distribution Pr{ Y = y | X = x obs}
