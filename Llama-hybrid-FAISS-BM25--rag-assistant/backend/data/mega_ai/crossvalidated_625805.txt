Demeaning binary variable

I was confused regarding fixed effects regression model. Suppose I have a panel dataset with data on firms across several years. Introducing firm fixed effects and estimating deviations from means (average of each firm across time period) is algebraically the same. But what if one of my predictors in a binary variable. In case I want to see this equivalence by running the regression in STATA, how do I demean the binary variable?
