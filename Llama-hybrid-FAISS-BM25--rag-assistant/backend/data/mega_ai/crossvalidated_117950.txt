How can I interpret a plot of trimming percentage vs. trimmed mean?

For part of a homework question, I was asked to calculate the trimmed mean for a dataset by deleting the smallest and largest observation, and to interpret the result. The trimmed mean was lower than the untrimmed mean. My interpretation was that this was because the underlying distribution was positively skewed, so the left tail is denser than the right tail. As a result of this skewness, removing a high datum drags the mean down more than removing a low one pushes it up, because, informally speaking, there are more low data "waiting to take its place." (Is this reasonable?) Then I began to wonder how the trimming percentage affects this, so I calculated the trimmed mean $\bar x_{\operatorname{tr}(k)}$ for various $k = 1/n, 2/n, \dotsc, (\frac{n}{2}-1)/n$. I got an interesting parabolic shape: I'm not quite sure how to interpret this. Intuitively, it seems like the slope of the graph should be (proportional to) the negative skewness of the portion of the distribution within $k$ data points of the median. (This hypothesis does check out with my data, but I only have $n = 11$, so I'm not very confident.) Does this type of graph have a name, or is it commonly used? What information can we glean from this graph? Is there a standard interpretation? For reference, the data are: 4, 5, 5, 6, 11, 17, 18, 23, 33, 35, 80.
