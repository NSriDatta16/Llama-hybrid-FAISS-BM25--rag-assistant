Magento customer webservice / api

I need some sort of way to handle Magento's customer login, customer account creation and order checkout via some kind of webservice to be used for Flash, preferably XML. As far as I know the Magento API doesn't have these features. I found the Mammoth Webservices extension but it seems that the project is inactive judging from heir site. Any thoughts? Thanks!
