Tough call, without a good global answer. I’d like to agree with the two previous postings and say yes, but my Second Law of Static Analysis says that defects will congregate in parts of the organization where the software engineering process is most badly broken. A corollary is that engineers who are forced to change their code in a hurry to make the warnings go away, are the ones most likely to introduce new problems when they do so; I’ve seen depressingly many such bugs. I think it’s better software engineering to do the false-positive marking outside the code, as in, e.g., Coverity and Klocwork, and do your enforcement based on that. It goes without saying that your main point about tracking such new defects, as loudly as possible, and dedicating time promptly to avoiding technical debt, are excellent ideas.
