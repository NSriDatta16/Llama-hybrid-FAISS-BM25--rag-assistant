It's my understanding that EFA and CFA are essentially very similar, but differ in whether a solid theoretical foundation or researcher's arguments for a set of factors that is related to studied phenomena. Being a beginner and planning to perform EFA, CFA and SEM analyses for my dissertation, I collected a lot of resources. Below I will share some of them, which I think are relevant to your question. http://www.jvank.nl/PP/down/BeamerFASEM.pdf (The best presentation on EFA that I've seen so far! I just love the detective/judge analogy!) Unfortunately, CFA explanation in this document is not comprehensive. The following slides do a better job at that and complement the first set of slides: http://people.ucsc.edu/~zurbrigg/psy214b/09SEM6a.pdf ; http://courses.ttu.edu/isqs6348-westfall/images/6348/Exploratory_Factor_Analysis_in_R.pdf ; http://www.statpower.net/Content/312/R%20Stuff/Exploratory%20Factor%20Analysis%20with%20R.pdf ; http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.com/2009/10/factor-analysis-in-r.html ; Resources on James Gaskin's StatWiki: http://statwiki.kolobkreations.com/wiki/Exploratory_Factor_Analysis , http://statwiki.kolobkreations.com/wiki/Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis ; James Gaskin's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-O-OcJPCe8 (This is just for EFA, check other videos in his SEM Series there); https://personality-project.org/r/#factoranal ; http://tgmstat.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/computing-and-visualizing-lda-in-r (Dimension reduction using PCA and (!) LDA); Somewhat "unusual", top-down method, called Bass-Ackwards technique: http://projects.ori.org/lrg/PDFs_papers/Goldberg_2006_BassAckwards_JRP.pdf (description), http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/2013/11/25/openness-to-experience-and-creative-achievement (example of application); On selection of estimators for CFA: http://redfame.com/journal/index.php/ijsss/article/viewFile/27/29 ; http://www.r-bloggers.com/structural-equation-modeling-separating-the-general-from-the-specific-part-ii (CFA) 'qgraph' R package for PCA/EFA/CFA/SEM analysis and visualization: http://sachaepskamp.com/qgraph (details), http://www.jstatsoft.org/v48/i04/paper (more details); 'semPlot' R package for SEM visualization: http://sachaepskamp.com/semPlot CFA and SEM can also be performed by using 'plspm' R package. Details on PLS-PM and some other PLS-based CFA methods are available in free book by plspm's author Gaston Sanchez: http://gastonsanchez.com/PLS_Path_Modeling_with_R.pdf ; A nice book, integrating various multivariate techniques into a coherent description. After reading "inside", I concluded that it should be good for a beginner like me. I went ahead and ordered it - looking forward to learning from this book: http://www.amazon.com/The-Essence-Multivariate-Thinking-Applications/dp/041587372X . I might update this answer with other materials I will run across. Hope it helps!
