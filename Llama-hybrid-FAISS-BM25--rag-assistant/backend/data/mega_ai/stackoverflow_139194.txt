There is some per-request overhead, so in total you will improve performance by combining it all into a single file. It may, however, slow down load times on the first page a user visits, and it may result in useless traffic if some user never require certain parts of your js. The first of these problems isn't quite as problematic, though. If you have something like a signup page that everyone visits first and spends some time on (filling out a form, etc.), the page will be displayed once the html has been loaded and the js can load in the background while the user is busy with the form anyway. I would organize the js into different files during development, i. e. one for general stuff and one per model, then combine them into a single file in the build process. You should also do compression at this point.
