Recall, random forests (RF) assigns split values for each feature, which is not the same as correlation. Fundamentally, RF, is a decision tree type classifier which identifies the best value of each feature to split on. Correlation and RF is very different -- and there should be little expectation for similar results. Within RF at run-time, each feature is randomly selected for splitting a parent node (in the tree) into two daughter nodes, and the value of the feature where the split occurs depends on the objects in the parent node which need to be partitioned. Within these objects, there can be any combination of classes (dependent variable values), because of the previous object split histories of parent nodes in the splits above. In other words, when a feature is randomly selected for making a split, only parts of the feature's values are used because only part of the objects are in the parent node. You'll rarely have all the objects that you ran correlation on within a parent node. Even when you start RF, you're doing CV training/testing, so you'll only have objects for all of the training folds in the first parent node. The training set is also a bootstrap, so there can be multiple copies of the same objects in any node.
