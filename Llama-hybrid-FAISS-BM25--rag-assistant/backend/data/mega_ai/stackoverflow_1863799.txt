The best way to approach this is probably to use an irregular time series object (see the time series view on CRAN ). You have several good options (e.g. timeSeries, its, fts, xts), but the most popular of these is the zoo package . You can create a time series like so: library(zoo) x.Date Then, to see the difference in time between each event, you can just use the diff function to create a difftime object: > diff(index(x)) Time differences in days [1] 2 4 2 5 You can analyze these time difference just like you would any other variable, for instance: > summary(diff(index(x))) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 2.00 2.00 3.00 3.25 4.25 5.00 Similarly, to find the most common time difference, you can use any other standard approach such as table() : > table(diff(index(x))) 2 4 5 2 1 1
