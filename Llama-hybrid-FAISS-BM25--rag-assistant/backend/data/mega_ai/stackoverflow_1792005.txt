Drying up code for two models with similar data types

Lets say I have a wine and beer model/controller along with a wine_review and beer_review model with a has many relationship. Each table has near identical data types, for example, wine_review and beer_review each has a rating and comment column. Wine and beer each, have names. How can I dry up my code so they can both share the same views. Right now I have two views doing the same thing, once for beer and once for wine. .... .... What I would really like to do is something like Where beverage would be replaced with wine or beer depending on what I'm rendering at that time but I can't figure out how to do that. I can't pass beverage as a local to a partial as review.beverge will break. Thanks.
