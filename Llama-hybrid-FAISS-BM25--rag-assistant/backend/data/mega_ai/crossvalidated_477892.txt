The most common types of data transformation are: log (natural) transformation log(10) transformation squared transformation (second order polynomial) cubic transformation (third order polynomial) square root transformation cubic root transformation Among the most important reasons, we may cite: a) strategy to produce a normal distribution (not needed for regression, since what matters most is the linearity of the residuals) b) strategy to re-scale values c) strategy to include polynomial terms so as to improve a given model. Caveat: some transformations must take in consideration the existence of zero (e.g. logarithm) or negative values (e.g. square root) beforehand. With regard to Machine Learning, the most common transformations are: a) normalization (z-score) b) median normalization (using the difference from the median - instead of the mean - in the z-score) c) min-max (select a pattern of distribution within a range, whose limits are the selected minimum and maximum value) The main reason is to provide a similar scale to different features. Hopefully that helps.
