Calculate covariate-adjusted means and 95%CIs for treatment and control group separately for simple 2-arm trial

I have data for a simple 2-arm RCT, that looks as follows: library(wakefield) df I am estimating the average treatment effect using linear regression: lm(income ~ treatment + age + female, data = df) What I want to do is present a coefficient plot that has the covariate-adjusted means, along with 95%CIs, for the treatment and control group plotted separately. Using R, how do I calculate the covariate-adjusted mean and 95%CI when (a) treatment = 1 and (b) treatment = 0, so that the difference between those means gives the same as the estimated average treatment effect with the covariate adjustment?
