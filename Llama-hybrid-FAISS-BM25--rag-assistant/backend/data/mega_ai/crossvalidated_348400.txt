Overfitting is best evaluated by k-fold cross validation, looking at how it performs on your validation set with chosen metric (like accuracy). It is data specific and not easy to predict using rules of thumb. In Random Forest the more important hyperparameter is usually the number of trees used, as the averaging across many trees reduces overfitting. Often the max_depth is left at infinite. Use gridsearch with cross validation on your problem and find out how it works for your particular problem.
