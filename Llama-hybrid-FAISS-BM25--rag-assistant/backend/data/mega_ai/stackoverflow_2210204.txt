Is there a better way to write this SQL than using WHERE ... IN (subquery)?

is there a better way to write this SQL than using WHERE ... IN (subquery)? SELECT device.mac, reseller.name, agent.name FROM device LEFT JOIN global_user ON device.global_user_id = global_user.id LEFT JOIN agent ON global_user.id = agent.global_user_id LEFT JOIN reseller ON global_user.id = reseller.global_user_id OR agent.reseller_id = reseller.id WHERE device.global_user_id IN ( SELECT global_user_id FROM reseller WHERE id = '200' ) OR device.global_user_id IN ( SELECT global_user_id FROM agent WHERE reseller_id = '200' ); im trying to get a list of all of the devices, with some reseller/agent details, under a particular reseller. this would include devices assigned directly to the reseller and devices assigned to agents under the reseller. reseller.id is unique. it will be executed on postgresql database. devices are assigned to both agents and resellers. agents are assigned to resellers. this query works, but i haven't often used an OR in a JOIN and i usually try to avoid subqueries. this query concept will be used often, so i'd like to make sure i haven't overlooked something. thank you for any feedback.
