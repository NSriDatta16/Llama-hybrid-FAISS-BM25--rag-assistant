How are neural networks used when the number of inputs could be variable?

All the examples I have seen of neural networks are for a fixed set of inputs which works well for images and fixed length data. How do you deal with variable length data such sentences, queries or source code? Is there a way to encode variable length data into fixed length inputs and still get the generalization properties of neural networks?
