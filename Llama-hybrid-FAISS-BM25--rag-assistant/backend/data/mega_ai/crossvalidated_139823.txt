Technical term for special case of averaging

The special case I'm considering is the following. Suppose that from a population of size n , we add together only the non-zero values. Now, to find the average, suppose we divide the sum of the non-zero values by the number of non-zero values, instead of n . From my elementary understanding of statistics, I believe this is a special case of averaging, because we should normally divide by n . So my question is: what is the term for describing this type of averaging?
