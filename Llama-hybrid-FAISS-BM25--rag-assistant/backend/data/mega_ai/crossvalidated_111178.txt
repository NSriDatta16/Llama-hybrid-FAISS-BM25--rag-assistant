A feature of models in which the dependent variable is a rate per unit of population is that they are likely to be subject to heteroscedasticity . Other things being equal, smaller populations are likely to be associated with greater variability in rates. An easy way to see this is to compare the rates for one student and for a large population of students, making the simplifying assumption that no student has more than one instance of academic dishonesty in any one month. The rate for the one student must be either 0 or 1. Within the population, however, it is likely that some students are honest and some dishonest, so that the rate will be between 0 and 1. A larger population allows for more averaging out than a smaller one. Although heteroscedasticity does not lead to bias in regression coefficients estimated by OLS, it does imply that the conventionally calculated standard errors of those coefficients are unreliable. This would mean, in particular, that a test of significance of the estimated coefficient of your demographic characteristic would be unreliable. The above is not intended to suggest that you should avoid using rates. However, if you do use rates and you intend to apply hypothesis tests or calculate confidence intervals, then you need to consider how you will address heteroscedasticity arising from different population sizes. Three approaches you might consider are: OLS with robust or heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors. Weighted least squares, giving a higher weighting to larger populations since they are expected to be associated with lower rate variability. Calculating your regression on a sub-sample of your data selected so that the populations are fairly similar. This is unlikely to be helpful unless you have data for a very large number of universities. All these approaches have their pros and cons. One of many sources which consider in general terms the relative merits of 1 and 2 above is here .
