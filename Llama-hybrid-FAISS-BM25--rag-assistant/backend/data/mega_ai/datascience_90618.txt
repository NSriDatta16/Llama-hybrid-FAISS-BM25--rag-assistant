Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) within the context of Machine Learning often refer to the hardware requirements, design considerations, or level of parallelization for implementing and running various machine learning algorithms. Due to the size of various data sets and complexity of many cutting-edge learning techniques (Deep learning, Reinforcement Learning, Neural networks) applied to various use cases (Audio, Video, Signal Processing), GPUs are often required to carry out these computations. External GPUs processing power can often be accessed through third party cloud based platforms such as Google Colab or Amazon Web Services.
