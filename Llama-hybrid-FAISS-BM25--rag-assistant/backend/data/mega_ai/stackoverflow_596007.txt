just to offer an alternative: if you only need minute-level resolution, and you don't cross date boundaries (month/year) and your messages are sequential with guaranteed delivery then you can store the timestamp as an offset from the timestamp of the last message. In this case, you only need enough bits to hold the maximum number of minutes between messages. For example, if you emit messages at most 255 minutes apart, then one byte will suffice. Note, however, that the very first message may need to include an absolute timestamp in its payload, for synchronization. [i'm not saying this is a good solution - it's fairly fragile and makes a lot of assumptions - just an alternative one]
