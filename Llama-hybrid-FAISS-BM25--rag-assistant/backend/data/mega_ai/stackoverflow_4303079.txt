In my project I have my EF in a domain layer and my UI in a seperate layer. The UI contains the webconfig file which in turn has the connection string that EF uses. So yes it's completely acheivable. My webconfig will superseed the app.config setting. My suggestion it terms of layering your app would be to look at some DDD. I'm using EF4 in conjuction with MVC and the repository pattern, which seems an elegant fit. I'm not saying you need to use MVC, but it's certainly worth looking at having a domain layer for ef4. This is the application I've used as my guide. Note this is based around mvc, but the domain aspect could be true of any application http://mvcsamples.codeplex.com/
