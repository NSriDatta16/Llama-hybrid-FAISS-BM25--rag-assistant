I started with this book: Relational Database Design Clearly Explained (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems) (Paperback) by Jan L. Harrington and found it very clear and helpful and as you get up to speed this one was good too Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation and Management (International Computer Science Series) (Paperback) I think SQL and database design are different (but complementary) skills.
