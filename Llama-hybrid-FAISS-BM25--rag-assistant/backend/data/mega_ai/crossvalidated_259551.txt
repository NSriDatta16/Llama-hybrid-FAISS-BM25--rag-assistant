Does the image size for convolutional neural networks have to be small?

I'm new to Caffe. I'm trying to understand the rules of using convolutional neural networks. And my questions are: is it mandatory for the images to be small for training? is it mandatory for the images to be squared? I'm asking this because the biggest example of images used I found is 512 x 512. Would it be counter-intuitive to use for example HD size images?
