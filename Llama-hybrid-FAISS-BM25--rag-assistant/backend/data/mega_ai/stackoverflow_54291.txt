Lets have a look at each option: Write up a bug-report and associate the refactoring with it. If you feel that, in your opinion, the original code poses a security risk or potential for crashing or instability. Write a small bug report outlining the danger, and then fix it. Write up a feature-request and associate the refactoring with it. It might be harder to reactor code based on a feature request. But you could use valid feature request to do this which leads me onto the next point... Sneak in the refactorings while working on code that is associated with a bug-report/feature-request. If there is a valid bug or feature, state that function x had to be change slightly to fix the bug or add the feature. Just don't do any refactoring. This seems to suggest the self development through improving an application is not allowed. Developers should be allowed, if not, encourage to explorer new techniques and technologies. Other Perhaps you could discuss your improvement at relevant meeting, giving convincing reasons why the changes should be made. Then at least you will have management backing to the change without having to sneak in the code through another method.
