I'm sorry, when I saw 100-200 simultaneous connections, I immediately thought you meant intranet. We average 300-450 concurrent users on our apps, so we do not consider it a internet based app until you look at a possible 5,000+ users. The design criteria for such a system is very different than a system with under 1000 users. When you approach such a system, you are looking at a cloud configuration. As our company is a telecommunications company, and we are required by law to meet 5-9's service for our customers, we use firebird in all our back end processes. Although we have used DB2, Oracle and other products in the past, Firebird has either been more reliable or outperformed the others. With the about to be released Firebird 2.5 (now in rc 2 if you wish to play with it), you can use firebird as it's own middle tier, with one database connecting to multiple other databases to perform both DML and DDL actions. You can have one Firebird database that has no tables whatsoever, just stored procedures, views etc. That database can then surface the data from multiple sources without the client application knowing. As the connection can be dynamically built within the stored procedures, you can have the backend databases change as needed without changing any front end code. This allows you to load balance, have multiple web servers share a single cluster of databases etc. So, I since Morfik supports Firebird intrinsically, I would say that yes, Morfik can scale well to a larger environment without trouble. As for Firebird support, it has one of the most active user communities on the web. From the point of view of Morfik, morfik is a great way to generate a web based UI while leveraging your existing developer base without having to learn a series of new languages. But, it currently lets the developer use the tools for n-tier development without getting in the way. I like that. I do not want a tool that tries to be everything and in turn, does nothing well. best regards Dalton Calford Distributel Communications
