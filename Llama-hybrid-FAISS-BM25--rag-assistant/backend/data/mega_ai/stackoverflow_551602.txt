Filling width in (iPhone) UIWebView landscape orientation?

I'm using a UIWebView with text in it. When the iPhone is rotated to landscape, text doesn't fill the now wider UIWebView width. I'm using P (paragraph) tags, which should not affect content filling landscape's width. The line breaks that are visible in portrait remain the same in landscape. In Interface Builder, I haven't changed anything. In the IB Inspector, Web View Size has all solid bars under AutoSizing, which means it should fill to the landscape width right?
