Yes, I think it happens quite often. Let's say you could have a model estimating GDP growth (as the dependent variable) using two independent variables: change in national home prices and change in the S&P 500. That model may have good explanatory power. It may have a high R Square. The two independent variables may have the correct positive sign and be very statistically significant. And, most important the model's explanatory power could be very well supported by economic theory (Hyman Minsky's credit cycles associated with home prices, etc.). But, when you test this model using Hold Out sample it may not perform that well. It may not be predictive. In other words, change in home prices and the stock market can explain a significant percentage of economic growth (after all that is one of the meanings of R Square). But, such a model may be mediocre at actually predicting the future path of the economy. That's almost a summary of the quasi-tragedy of a large body of econometrics models. Many are or appear to be very good at "explaining", so far I am not sure we have found many or any that are good at "predicting."
