No, in linear models the transformation is not (or ought not) be done to have maximum correlation with the dependent variable. It should be done to either a) Meet model assumptions about the residuals or b) Have a more sensible explanatory variable; that is, one that makes sense, substantively. As @Andy points out, this may not be sufficient. But, in that case, I'd then look for an alternate method of regression (see below) rather than take some weird transformation. E.g. a model such as $Y = b_0 + b_1x_1^{.21} + b_2x_2^{.73}$ is going to be a mess to explain. In logistic regression (at least, in dichotomous logistic) there are fewer assumptions (and none about the residuals, as far as I know), so only b) applies. Even for linear models, I'd favor using b). And then, if the assumptions aren't met, using some other form of regression (could be robust regression, could be a spline model, could be polynomials).
