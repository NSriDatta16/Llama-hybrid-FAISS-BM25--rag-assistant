Why is there no more work done on convergence diagnosis of MCMC?

Most of the relevant papers and reviews date all the way back to 2003 or 1998. I can barely find anything newer. What makes it losing interest among researchers? I thought monitoring convergence for MCMC is truly important in stochastic modelling and simulation? Or have my Google-fu skill been incompetent in finding relevant ones?
