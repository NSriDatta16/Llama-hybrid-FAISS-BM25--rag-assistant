Not knowing can be an indication as well, for a kaggle competition i once just put in a column unknown age, the reason was not knowing their age could be because of a reason. The reason in your case might be truly forgotten, or don't want to tell (privacy), or the number was to low to remember. Maybe they buy goods they rather not tell about, and maybe thats typical for these people as well. People who spend money and cannot remember might be high-value customers (if you run a casino). You might group by similar people and then by similar spendings, then take that average. or / and them to a certainly not remembering boolean. (let the neural net find out itself, how valuable such a column would be).
