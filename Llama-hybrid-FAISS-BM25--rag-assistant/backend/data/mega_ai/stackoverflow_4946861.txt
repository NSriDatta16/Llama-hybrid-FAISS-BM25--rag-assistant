Storage projects with eclipse

Regularly develop projects in PHP using Dreamweaver but I would start using Eclipse. I have my machine in a directory where they are armaezandos projects, but also a place where projects are published in apache. In Dreamweaver in the project settings I map the local directory, setting to perform the sending of files to the apache automatically after you save them. I wonder what the correct way to develop with Eclipse. If I map the project directly in the apache directory (thus having only one copy of the project) or if the Eclipse has some configuration to achieve the same functionality I have in Dreamweaver. Another problem is that when mapping the project directly in Eclipse are created folders and files .settings, .buildpath and .project. Note: Keep copies of two projects (one local and one in apache) for the purpose of tests not send files, uploads, etc. in memoento that you publish the project, and sending only the project folder location. I use Eclipse Helios.
