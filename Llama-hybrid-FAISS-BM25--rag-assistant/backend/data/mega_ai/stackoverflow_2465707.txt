How to let an average user design a boolean expression graphically

In our application there's a list of customers, and a list of keywords (among other things). Each customer can have a number of keywords, but it's not mandatory. So for instance, one customer can have the keywords "retail" and "chain", one can have only "contractor" and a third can have none at all. I want to let the user make a selection of customers based on these keywords, but not having to write (retail AND chain) or contractor and not wholesale I would like to make it as user-friendly as possible, and ideally with only "simple" controls, like checkboxes, comboboxes etc. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to design this? Or maybe some examples of applications where there is a similar functionality?
