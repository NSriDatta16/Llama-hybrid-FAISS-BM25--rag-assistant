@JimBaldwin, For the problem of index i, you are correct. Today I compared $ c_{k} $ with $d_{k} $ , the coefficients of squared terms $X_{k}^{2}$. With the help of Jim and careful rearrangement, we have $c_{k}$=$(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n^2})a_{0}^{2}+(\frac{2k}{n^2}+\frac{2-4k}{n^3})a_{0}a_{1}+(\frac{k^2+k-1}{n^3}+\frac{-4k^2+4k-1}{n^4})a_{1}^{2}$; $d_{k}$=$(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n^2})a_{0}^{2}+(\frac{2k+2}{n^2}+\frac{-4k}{n^3})a_{0}a_{1}+(\frac{k^2+3k}{n^3}+\frac{4k^2}{n^4})a_{1}^{2}$; It can be shown that that $\sum_{k=1}^{n}c_{k}X_{k}^{2}-\sum_{k=1}^{n}d_{k}X_{k}^{2}=o_{p}(1)$, under one of my assumption that $X=O_{p}(n^{\frac{1}{3}})$ Next step is left to show the same relationship holds for the cross terms. I am still trying to combine the cross term in $F_{1}(X)$ in terms of $\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\sum_{i=k+1}^{n}c_{ki}X_{k}X_{i}$ in this elegant manner.
