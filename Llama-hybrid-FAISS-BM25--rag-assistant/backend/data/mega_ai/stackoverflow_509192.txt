Well, I guess, I would try to do something like this: bind to the top-level first (that's LDAP:// create the first OU then recursively bind to the container just created add the next level down repeat until you're done Something like this (untested - I don't have a server here to check it out): String strOUs = container.Substring(0, container.IndexOf(@",DC=")); int dcIndex = container.IndexOf("DC="); string dcSubString = container.Substring(dcIndex); //dcSubString = DC=Internal,DC=Net string[] strOUArray = strOUs.Split(new Char[] { ',' }); // create a bind path which we'll build up string ldapPath = dcSubString; // bind to the top-level container DirectoryEntry workEntry = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://" + ldapPath); // loop through all sub-OU's to create foreach(string currentOU in strOUArray) { // add the next OU below the current entry objOU = workEntry.Children.Add(currentOU, "OrganizationalUnit"); objOU.CommitChanges(); // bind to the newly created OU ldapPath = currentOU + "," + ldapPath; workEntry = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://" + ldapPath); } There's one catch I see: if you create a new OU, you might not be able to bind to it right away - sometimes it takes a moment to propagate into the directory. Does this help? Marc
