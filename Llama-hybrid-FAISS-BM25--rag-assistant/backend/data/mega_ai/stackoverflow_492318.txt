Sounds like a cheap-and-cheerful way to discourage users from fiddling with GET parameters. I know I fiddle with GET parameters to get what I want. What seems odd, though, is that GET requests sent from Javascript would have to encode URLs, too. That'll make it difficult to make the site interactive, in an AJAX-y way. At that point, it seems actively harmful to have the system in place. If I had a vote, I'd vote to; rewrite the URL-parsing mechanisms so they accept both encrypted and non-encrypted strings, mark the URL-encryption function as [Obsolete] gradually remove the encryption system.
