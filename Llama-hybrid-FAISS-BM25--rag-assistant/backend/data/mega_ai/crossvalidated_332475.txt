Change of states identification

Here I have a time series (the dots represent measured data, and the line connecting the dots was just added by excel) https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9FYw.png It clearly goes across 3 different states First is approximately linear, with some noise Then goes oscillatory Then turns into a smooth curve (all with noise) The question is, what kind of mathematical tools would be appropriate to detect the changes of state? I want to automate (code) the detection of the points were the changes of state occur. I do not want to assume previos knowledge about what the time series represent, to avoid bias.
