About Epochs and how many of it?

I'm pritty new to the machine learning world, and I ws trying to figure out how many epochs should I run my training CNN model on the MNIST dataset (which has 60,000 training images and 10,000 validation images). Now, if I undestand correctly, an epoch is defined such: how many times I train my model with the WHOLE dataset and I have seen many tutorial blogs showing that they ran 25 epochs on the whole MNIST dataset. isn't it causing overfitting? shouldn't the model train on the whole data only once? I would appreciate an explanation on it, because there are many other parameters such as "steps_per_epoch", which I dont know how to set becuase I can't figure out what should I expect when I train a model (like, when can I tell that i'm doing way too many epochs and such).
