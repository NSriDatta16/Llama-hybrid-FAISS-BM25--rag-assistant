I found an option to dismiss missing fonts globally for opened FLA files, you can tick / untick this one which is not an elegant solution, but should work fine for you. I haven't found any references in the JSFL docs about setting this option from code, but maybe possible, I have to look on it :D! I can't upload any images here, but I added a screenshot of my Preferences panel so you can see where to find it: http://bit.ly/hO5uWT Hope it helps, happy new year :D Rob
