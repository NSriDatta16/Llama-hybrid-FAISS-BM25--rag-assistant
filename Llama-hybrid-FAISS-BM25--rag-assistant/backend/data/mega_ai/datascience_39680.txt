What you are trying to estimate is the average treatment effect (ATE), i.e. the average effect of showing a random sample of people a picture of a cake on the likelihood that they choose to eat a cake later. There will be people who will eat cake anyway and people who will never eat cake in both treatment and control groups if your group assignment is sufficiently randomized. But that is OK for ATE, which is the effect (or no effect) you should expect to see when you take the treatment to a larger general population. The confound you are concerned about fundamentally change your research question. If you want to know the treatment effect of showing a picture of cake to people who will not eat cake, on the likelihood that they choose to eat cake later, you will need more control. One way I can think of is to study a well separated survey on participants' diet routine to see how likely each participant will eat a cake in any random day. Include that as a control variable on the RHS of your regression model could potentially be helpful. However, there is no perfect control for anything. You need to make assumption and build argument around it. I think you will see very similar estimation results from linear regression and logistic regression (in terms of the relative size and direction of the coefficients). What I have seen in my field (social science) is that linear regression (or linear probability model, LPM) is often preferred due to its ease of interpretation. It's always a pain to explain in odds ratio for a logistic regression model. Linear model rules most research fields where interpretation is more important than anything else. You can fit your data with sophisticated, nonlinear model to any arbitrarily degree. But when you require interpretation, or more importantly causal interpretation , linear model is your best chance.
