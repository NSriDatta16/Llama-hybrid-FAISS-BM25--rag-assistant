I often work with people who treat 'Machine Learning' with a sort of mystical reverence. It doesn't need to be mysterious at all. I like to describe machine learning as "Extreme curve fitting". Just like any line of best fit in Excel, except the amount of data is huge, the number of dimensions is often large, and the mathematical 'shapes' available to the algorithm to fit the data to are plentiful. Practically speaking, machine learning takes Data , invokes a bunch of functions or shapes that may be used to describe the data, and jiggles them around using some from of gradient descent until the shapes approximate the data as closely as possible (as defined by some loss function).
