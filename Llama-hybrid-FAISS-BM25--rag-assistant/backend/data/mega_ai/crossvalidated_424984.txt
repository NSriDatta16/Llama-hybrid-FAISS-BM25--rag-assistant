I took your 18 values and identified a 5 parameter model (shocking to some ! ) of the form with Actual/Fit and Forecast here . All models are wrong .. some models are useful ... The reason for auto.arima getting confused is perhaps due to the presence of the untreated downwards level shift at reading 11 and the unusual value at period 17. In general I followed a more general (iterative ) paradigm https://autobox.com/pdfs/ARIMA%20FLOW%20CHART.pdf closely following the model identification process suggested by Box and Jenkins extended to simultaneously consider the impact of latent deterministic structure as suggested here http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html . What follows is an excellent example case of what is referred to as Exploratory Data Analysis where hypothesis are found that are the least defensible such as "There is no level shift in the series at any point in time" leading to a model modifcation suggesting an optimal alternative hypothesis "There is a level shift in the series at point 11". The original acf.pacf is here and the suggested model was an AR(1) OR (1,0,0)(0,0,0)4 . The residuals from this model were examined to suggest possible model revision yielding the suggestion that 3 dummy indicators might be helpful ( a pulse .. a level shift and a seasonal pulse ) Note well that a simple review of the plot of the series would have suggested this level shift which AUTOBOX found iteratively. yielding this augmented model . Residual diagnostic checking of this model uncovered the need for a seasonal ar term thus the tentative model is now (1,0,0)(1,0,0)4 Parsimony suggested deleting the now non-significant ar(1) term and reducing it to the final model with statistics here Model identification with 18 values including a level shift and possible seasonal structure can't be handled with a simple search solution based upon a set of pure arima ( no pulses, no level shifts , no seasonal pulses , no local time trends ) as these factors often are present in the data we analyze. The formal reason came from @ADAM0 here Interrupted Time Series Analysis - ARIMAX for High Frequency Biological Data? where he highlighted that untreated deterministic structure CONFUSES pure memory driven solutions. I used a piece of software called AUTOBOX which I have helped to develop to automatically reduce the 18 observations to signal and noise . as the OP had requested these are the forecasts for the next 15 periods and here . To be compared to the much higher auto.arima forecasts -0.17272289, -0.18657458, -0.20042626, -0.21427794, -0.22812963, -0.24198131, -0.255833 , -0.26968468, -0.28353636, -0.29738805, -0.31123973, -0.32509141, -0.3389431 , -0.35279478, -0.36664646]
