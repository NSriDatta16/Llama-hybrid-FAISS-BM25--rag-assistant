I have answered the questions posted, in order. Yes, these are opinionated. [Do you have this as a study somewhere? It would be interesting to see. Just vague references and quantifiers aren't very exciting.] Perhaps the code was written for fun, learning, work-for-profit at the time, because "it could be done", or for some other motivational reason. It served a purpose; perhaps the purpose is gone -- as well as the incentives behind. It takes effort to find old code, publish old code, and answer silly emails or questions about old code. (And for some, it takes effort to not care about what others think.) I would be hesitant to jump on the idea that the code kept hidden "violates IP". This is an unfair and unfounded assumption without better proof. Encouraged? Perhaps. Forced? No. Code is a creation and, like any art, is is a product of the creator. Unless they have alright assigned away the rights, it is the authors work. Perhaps it is deemed to be awful and forever buried away -- so be it. The same happens to other forms of art all the time.
