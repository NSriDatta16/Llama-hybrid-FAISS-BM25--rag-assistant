You have apparently found a strong positive linear relationship. Assuming you're using some linear model for your prediction, this is excellent news(congratulations). It's quite intuitive that length would be strongly correlated with weight. Body volume times average body density would be even more so (and even more closely predictive-- exactly so). As with all predictions, the pitfalls you face are many and varied, depending on your specific model and purposes. Make sure you didn't sample snakes to predict the weight of elephants (metaphorically or literally).
