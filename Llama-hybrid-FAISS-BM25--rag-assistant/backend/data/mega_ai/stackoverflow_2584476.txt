A simple hack is to add username and password to the push url in your project's .hg/hgrc file: [paths] default = http://username:password@mydomain.com/myproject (Note that in this way you store the password in plain text) If you're working on several projects under the same domain, you might want to add a rewrite rule in your ~/.hgrc file, to avoid repeating this for all projects: [rewrite] http.//mydomain.com = http://username:password@mydomain.com Again, since the password is stored in plain text, I usually store just my username. If you're working under Gnome, I explain how to integrate Mercurial and the Gnome Keyring here: http://aloiroberto.wordpress.com/2009/09/16/mercurial-gnome-keyring-integration/
