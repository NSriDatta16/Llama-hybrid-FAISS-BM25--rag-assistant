hibernate mapping problem

i have an object named party and three other objects inherit from this object, using hibernate az orm i have a problem with casting the party to ine of these objects. although i'm using not.lazyload() feature, but i see partyProxy want to be casted to department object , not exact party object . so i see: Unable to cast object of type 'PartyProxybc26f81f729145c49bc14594bb84cb57' to type 'Domain.OrganizationStructure.Department' this problem wont happen to those 2 other objects which are inherited from party object. what could be my problem
