How to determine if I should use repeatedcv or oob in RandomForest?

In the trainControl documentation it said ""oob" (only for random forest, bagged trees, bagged earth, bagged flexible discriminant analysis, or conditional tree forest models), However, I saw a lot if examples of RF examples and most of them used either cv or repeatedcv. How can I determine which one to chose ?
