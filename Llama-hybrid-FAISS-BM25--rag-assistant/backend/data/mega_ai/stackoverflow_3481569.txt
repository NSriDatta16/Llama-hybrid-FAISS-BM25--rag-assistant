How to manage file path when accessing from different directory location?

I have few web pages sitting in different directories and my goal is to have some sort of organized structure so that I can access to js or css files without hardcoding the path. For instance, the directory structure is: root --- js --- some.js | |--css --- some.css | |---pages ---- main.jsp | |---other----foo---- foo.jsp | |--bar --- bar.jsp Then main.jsp and foo.jsp tries to reference some.js but has to have different path. ( main.jsp ) ( foo.jsp) This is not ideal if I want to change the location of main.jsp or foo.jsp, I have to come back to each files and change the path manually. I am thinking to have factory class that has full path for each files so that it would look something like: > In this case, I can still move files freely and not have to come back to each file. Can I get some opinion to my approach? Is there other way to solve this?
