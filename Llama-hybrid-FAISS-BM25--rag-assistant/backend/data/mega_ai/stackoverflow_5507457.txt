Connect the button to the NSWindow's orderFont: action. I haven't got Xcode 4, so I can't tell you how to do it in there, but for Xcode 3, open the xib in Interface Builder. While holding the control key, click and drag a line from the button to another window in the nib (drag over the title bar if the window is opened up, otherwise drag it onto the icon in the xib project window). In the menu that pops up, choose " orderFront: " or " makeKeyAndOrderFront: " (depending on the required behaviour). If the window is in another nib, you'll need to use an approach like Stephen's.
