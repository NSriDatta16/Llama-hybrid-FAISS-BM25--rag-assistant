GStreamer may just use the dejitter buffer to smooth out the packets on the way to the (audio) output. This wouldn't be unusual, its the bare minimum definition of dejittering. It may go so far as reordering out-of-order packets or deleting duplicates, but packet loss concealment (your scenario) can be quite complex. Basic implementations just duplicate the last received packet, whilst more advanced implementation analyse and reconstruct the tone of the last received packets to smooth out the audio. It sounds like your application performance will depend on the exact implementation of loss concealment, so even if GStreamer does do "something", you may have a hard time quantifying its impact on your results unless you understand it in great detail. Perhaps you could try a pcap with a couple of out-of-order and duplicate packets and check if GStreamer at least reorders/deletes them, that would go someway to clarifying what is happening.
