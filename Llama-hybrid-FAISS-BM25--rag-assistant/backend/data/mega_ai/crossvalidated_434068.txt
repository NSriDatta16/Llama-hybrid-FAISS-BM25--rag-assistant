If you have average starting conditions, they will be pretty bad. A rough approximation of the gradient is usually good enough to do a step towards improvement. SGD only needs to compute the gradient for over batch to do they next step, while full gradient decent would need to proofread the entire data (which may not even for into your main memory). Is a lot about stepping faster down the gradient, not computing it to maximum precision (probably your floating point of not even accurate enough).
