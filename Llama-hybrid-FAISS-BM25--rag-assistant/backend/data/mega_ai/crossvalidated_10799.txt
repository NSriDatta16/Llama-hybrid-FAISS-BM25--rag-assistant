You can always choose one or several real valued functions of the categorical variables and look at the auto-correlation for the resulting sequence(s). You can, for instance, consider indicators of some subsets of the variables. However, if I understood your question correctly, your sequence is obtained by an MCMC algorithm on the discrete space. In that case, it may be more interesting to look directly at the convergence rate for the Markov chain. Chapter 6 in this book by Br√©maud treats this in details. The size of the second largest absolute value of the eigenvalues determines the convergence rate of the matrix of transition probabilities and thus the mixing of the process.
