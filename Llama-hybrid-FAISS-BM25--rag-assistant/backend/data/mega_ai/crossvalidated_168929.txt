Logistic regression is predicting all 1, and no 0

I am running an analysis on the probability of loan default using logistic regression and random forests. When I use logistic regression, the prediction is always all '1' (which means good loan). I have never seen this before, and do not know where to start in terms of trying to sort out the issue. There are 22 columns with 600K rows. When I decrease the # of columns I get the same result with logistic regression. Why could the logistic regression be so wrong? **Actual from the data** 0 : 41932 1 : 573426 **Logistic regression output** prediction for 1 when actually 0: 41932 prediction for 1 when actually 1:573426 A**s you can see, it always predicts a 1** **Random forests does better:** actual 0, pred 0 : 38800 actual 1, pred 0 : 27 actual 0, pred 1 : 3132 actual 1, pred 1 : 573399
