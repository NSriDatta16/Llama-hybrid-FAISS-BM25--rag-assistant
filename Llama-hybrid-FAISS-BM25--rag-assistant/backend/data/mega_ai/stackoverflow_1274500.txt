Having been a while since I've used Visio, but if I recall correctly packages in Visio are the same as namespaces in .NET. Classes in Visio are the same as classes in .NET. I'm not sure if this is what you were asking? However, speaking of Visio and .NET. Certain versions of Visio/Visual Studio allow you to reverse engineer your Visual Studio project and automatically generate a class diagram in Visio. To do this: Highlight your project in Visual Studio In the toolbar choose Project -> Visio UML -> Reverse Engineer Visio will not generate a detailed class diagram based on your Visual Studio project UPDATE to answer comment: Normally you'd show a package - class relation ship like this in UML: This is just an example, but it shows a package (or namespace) containing two classes. This however does not seem to be possible in Visio. What you can do is add a package to your diagram in Visio. Right click on this package in the tree-view, and select New > Class. Then you can drag this class to your diagram which will now look something like this: Also, take a look at this link which has some helpful answers for modeling UML diagrams in Visio (you'll want to look under static structure diagrams). Hope this answers your question.
