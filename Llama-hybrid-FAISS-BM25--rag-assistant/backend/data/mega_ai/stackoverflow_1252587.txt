itoa(value, output_buffer, base); If you use 2 for base, you'll get the binary version in the string. Note that I'm only answering " Is there a better way ", not any other component of the question. EDIT: Also, you may want to look at popular implementations of itoa to see how they did the multi-base conversion without requiring math functions (from -lm). I know a lot of itoa's I've seen are quite small and elegant and still quite powerful.
