MSTest & CruiseControl.Net

I am trying to get MSTest working with CruiseControl.Net. I currently have it working prefectly for unit tests, but I would like to see my code coverage. When I run MSTest and export it to an XML file (using /resultsfile:"C:\output\results.xml") it seems that no Coverage information is exported. However when I run MS test and open the result TRX file, it contains all of the code coverage information. What am I missing?
