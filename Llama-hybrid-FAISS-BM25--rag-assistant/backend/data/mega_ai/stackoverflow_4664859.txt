EDIT: I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for I think what you want to do is this (you can't have WHERE in the SELECT section): INSERT INTO Table2 (respondent,1,2,3-1,3-2,3-3,4,5) SELECT respondent, Iif(question = 1, answer, 0), Iif(question = 2, answer, 0), Iif(answer = 'text 1' AND question = 3, answer, 0), Iif(answer = 'text 2' AND question = 3, answer, 0), Iif(answer = 'text 3' AND question = 3, answer, 0), Iif(question = 4, answer) Iif(question 5 NOT IS NULL, longanswer) FROM Table1 GROUP BY respondent; I think the question 5 one will work but not totally sure, I think that's correct. You should be able to replace the 0 with NULL if that's what you prefer.
