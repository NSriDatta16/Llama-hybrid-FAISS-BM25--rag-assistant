"I do backend work, not frontend" will quickly end the conversation, and along with it my opportunity for work. This is not necessarily a bad thing. It's generally a good idea to be honest with prospective clients, and if they do not understand exactly what your job entails up front, then they may end up expecting too much from you when the job is done, or for future projects. If you do really want to push your services on them, you could always try to point out exactly what kinds of benefits you will be offering to them. Make a point in explaining how much value can be added to the end-product by using your expertise. A car may look great on the store floor, but if its powered by a lawn mower engine held down with duct tape and chewing gum, the only thing it's going to be doing is looking pretty and collecting dust in your garage.
