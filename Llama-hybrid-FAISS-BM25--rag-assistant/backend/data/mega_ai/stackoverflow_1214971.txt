I would think that the best solution would be to change the structure of your existing repository then move that over to the dev server. First, set up the structure (using the SVN Move... items in the right drag context menu) to be what you want. Once that is done, copy the repository over from your local machine to the dev server. Finally, perform a Relocate on your working copies to point to the appropriate path on the dev server.
