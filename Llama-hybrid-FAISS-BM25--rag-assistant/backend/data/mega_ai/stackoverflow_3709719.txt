Just run a simple test: $ts_o = microtime(true); for($i=0;$i Versus: $ts_a = microtime(true); for($i=0;$i And calculate the he results. echo 'Object: ' . $total_object . ' / Array: ' . $total_array; Results: Object: 0.002635 / Array: 0.001243 As you can see that Arrays are faster in regards to speed, average 46.6% infact. But when you start adding variables they suddenly turn around: $ts_o = microtime(true); for($i=0;$i booleon = true; } $total_object = microtime(true) - $ts_o; unset($var); $ts_a = microtime(true); for($i=0;$i New Results: 0.0037809 / Array: 0.0046189 There's a few test you would have to do then find your mean / mode at the end of the test to find the one that truly is the better entity. You can do a test on memory by doing a memory_get_usage : http://php.net/manual/en/function.memory-get-usage.php with the same principles.
