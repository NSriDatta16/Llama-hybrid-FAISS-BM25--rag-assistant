Unnormalized Log Probability - RNN

I am going through the deep learning book by Goodfellow. In the RNN section I am stuck with the following: RNN is defined like following: And the equations are : Now the $O^{(t)}$ above is considered as unnormalized log probability. But if this is true, then the value of $O^{(t)}$ must be negative because, Probability is always defined as a number between 0 and 1, i.e, $P\in[0,1]$ , where brackets denote closed interval. And $log(P) \le 0$ on this interval. But in the equations above, nowhere this condition that $O^{(t)} \le 0$ is explicitly enforced. What am I missing!
