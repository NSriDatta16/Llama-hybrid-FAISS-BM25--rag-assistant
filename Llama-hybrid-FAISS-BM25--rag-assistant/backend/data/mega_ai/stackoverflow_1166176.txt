I think this is what you are looking for, you can also do it in one line: body { background: url('http://www.libertyseguros.pt/Images/repeat.jpg') top repeat-x #3F8AAA; } I'd replace the image url with a local one, but you should get the idea. After this, your other markup will go on top of your body etc.
