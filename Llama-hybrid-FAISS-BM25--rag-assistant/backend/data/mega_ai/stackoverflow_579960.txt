You will want to do this without a browser, using HTTP POST requests. A scripting language such as Perl, Python etc. would be a good choice in terms of simplicity - in this case the actual code would probably take no more than 30-so lines. You would essentially have to: potentially issue one initial (setup) POST (username+password) to simulate a human agent logging in then, read a set of parameters from the input file issue a first POST with the first form's subset of parameters (e.g. action type) read applicable tags from the POST reply, if any issue a second POST with the second form's subset of parameters (e.g. payment type), as well as any name=value pairs read from the POST reply in the step immediately above read applicable tags from the POST reply, if any issue a third POST with the third form's subset of parameters (e.g. fine type), as well as any name=value pairs read from the POST reply in the step immediately above etc. repeat for the next set of parameters from your input file You may also have to instruct your HTTP library not to throw cookies away, if not configured as such by default/already.
