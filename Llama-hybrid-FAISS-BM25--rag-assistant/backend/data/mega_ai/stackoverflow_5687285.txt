which storage is suitable to store many sets of tables of same schema?

I use a table to store various classifications of all words in the dictionary. It looks like this: word category origin-language ------- --------- --------------- happy adjective English bonjour greeting French ... from a set of classifications, I am able to produce a number. I want to find a set which produces a minimum, so I want to store many sets of such classifications (each is a table) together with their respective numbers in a storage. What kind of storage is suitable for this task? I don't think relational database is suitable, since there is no datatype for tabular data.
