trouble in prediction in neural network classifier

I am training a 4-class neural network classifier. The details of my data are: featurelength = 280 training testing --------------------------------------------- no. samples 438 250 samples class1 203 135 samples class2 19 10 samples class3 16 5 samples class4 200 100 After I train the neural network. The confusion matrices are as follows: 203 0 0 0 19 0 0 0 16 0 0 0 200 0 0 0 Similarly for test data too. All the data is predicted to be of class 1. How can I debug this issue? What is the reason behind such performance? In addition to this, no. of samples for class 2 and class 3 are very less. How can I make sure that they are not dominated?
