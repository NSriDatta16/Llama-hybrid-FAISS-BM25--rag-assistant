It's all explained in the Chromium Desktop Notifications API Specification where it's clearly said that: If a user agent implements createHTMLNotification, it should show HTML notifications as independent browsing contexts which are equivalent in functionality to any other HTML web page, except with the following properties: The notification cannot be navigated . The Location attribute of the window object in the notification context should be readonly. All links should open in new, non-notification browsing contexts. If close() is invoked on the window object in the notification context in response to a user gesture, the user agent should proceed as if the user closed the notification, including all required event processing.
