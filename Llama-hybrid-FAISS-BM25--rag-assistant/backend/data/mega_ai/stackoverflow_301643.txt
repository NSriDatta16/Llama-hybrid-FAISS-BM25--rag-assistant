GC is provided by the CLR C# is everything that the language spec states, and no more. Some of the more-interesting things that are actually C# features: iterator blocks [yield return] anonymous methods / closures / lambdas [the syntax, not to be confused with expression trees] But anything that relates to the code you type, but which isn't directly provided by either the CLR or the framework is a language feature. Other languages may implement them too, of course... using [try/finally/Dispose] lock [Monitor.Enter/try/finally/Monitor.Exit] foreach [GetEnumerator()/while/[Dispose]] extension method resolution query syntax ["where pred" to .Where(x=>pred) etc] (these are just a few examples of course; and again - other languages are at liberty to also provide these features!)
