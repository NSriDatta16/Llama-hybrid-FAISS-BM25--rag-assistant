Your quote from Perl Best Practices is not quite right. Specifically, bare vstrings of the form our $VERSION = v1.0.3; are discouraged. In the latest version of version.pm, the recommendation is to use true strings: use version 0.77; our $VERSION = qv("v1.2.3"); # shorthand This functionality has been added to aid readability, while specifically avoid the traps of bare strings described here . As the doc page you linked to says, you can use versions without the pre-pending 'v' using built-in logic in Perl 5.10: If you have a module that uses a decimal $VERSION (floating point), and you do not intend to ever change that, this module is not for you. There is nothing that version.pm gains you over a simple $VERSION assignment. So the answer to your question is: use the new "v1.0.3" syntax if you are writing new code that uses version.pm. Stick to a plain number if that is how your old code was written, or if you don't want to depend explicitly on module.pm.
