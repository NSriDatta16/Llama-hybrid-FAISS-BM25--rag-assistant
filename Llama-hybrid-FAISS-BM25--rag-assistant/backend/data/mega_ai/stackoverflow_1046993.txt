What are the major differences between Sql Server 2005 and Sql Server 2008?

Possible Duplicate: Advantages of SQL Server 2008 over SQL Server 2005? What are the major differences between Sql Server 2005 and Sql Server 2008? How could I convince my organization to invest in Sql Server 2008? For me, one major aspect that I see is that they have a good framework to programmatically generate SSIS packages with the use of ezAPI. I want to know your reasons. Thanks.
