What you are seeing is called quasi-complete separation in the context of binomial and logistic regression. In essence, at least one of the levels of one of your independent categorical variables is perfectly correlated with your response variable. Complete separation is when each level of at least one or more categorical independent variables is perfectly correlated with each level of the binary response. Since there is no variation in the response for the level that is quasi-separated, one level of a categorical independent variable can explain one of the levels of the binary response deterministically. Numerically, quasi-complete separation results in a parameter diverging to infinity during log-likelihood optimization. Hence that parameter cannot be estimated. This means that the maximum likelihood estimates(MLEs) do not exist. NOTE: Collinearity is a separate and distinct phenomenon, only exhibited by independent variables in your model. A model has collinear variables when the independent variables are highly correlated.
