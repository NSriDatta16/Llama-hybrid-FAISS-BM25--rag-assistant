You could try to protect the Silverlight application in many ways but in the end you cannot trust the client. A couple of guidelines I use: Protect the wire: use ssl to protect communication between SL and the back-end (perhaps even issue custom tokens to be able to invalidate a connection) Do not rely on secrets in the Silverlight application (private keys, custom encryption methods, isolated storage) because they are easily broken Put all important logic and security checks on the server. Always check authorization when a receiving a (service)call; you never know who is calling unless you check. I only use authorization on modules to reduce the download; if you are not authorized to use a module why download it?
