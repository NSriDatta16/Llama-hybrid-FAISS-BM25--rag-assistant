This question is part CrossValidated ("what's the proper statistical analysis?"), part Stack Overflow ("how do I do it in R?") Short answer: you're looking for something like library(nlme) lme(response~spotType,random=~1|probe/spotType,data=myData) where spotType is a factor (categorical variable) with levels S and B and probe is a factor with a different value for each probe (assuming there are 6 observations per probe, 3 S and 3 B ). Alternatively, you should be able to average the 3 S values and the 3 B values for each probe and run a simple t-test, something like myData (these don't give absolutely identical answers, I haven't quite figured out why ...)
