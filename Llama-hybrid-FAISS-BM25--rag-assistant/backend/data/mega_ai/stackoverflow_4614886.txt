If you are already dealing with an Exchange server as the mailbox host I would suggest leveraging that via IMAP (preferred) or POP access. Recently I developed a solution that accesses a specified mailbox via AfterLogic's MailBee.NET IMAP component which I think is worth the recommendation. They have a standard trial version and reasonable pricing. Also if you go this route either POP or IMAP automation is flexible enough to work with almost any mailbox server platform; It doesn't have to be limited to Exchange environments. There are also free .NET IMAP components out there that may do the job as well. In my limited research I found that the free alternatives didn't quite meet all of my requirements or were not as easy to learn but your situation may differ. For completeness, here is a list of alternative / free IMAP libraries I considered before deciding to spend the money on MailBee: ImapX - http://hellowebapps.com/products/imapx/ LumiSoft.Net Imap Client - http://www.lumisoft.ee/lswww/download/downloads/Net/ InterIMAP - http://interimap.codeplex.com/ To address the 2nd part of your question... The implementation in my recent project involved writing a very simple console application that references the MailBee.NET IMAP library. The console application has a standard config file and accepts command line arguments as parameters. We define Windows scheduled tasks to run the console application according to our process needs. I am sure you could do this any number of other ways but this was the simplest approach for our needs.
