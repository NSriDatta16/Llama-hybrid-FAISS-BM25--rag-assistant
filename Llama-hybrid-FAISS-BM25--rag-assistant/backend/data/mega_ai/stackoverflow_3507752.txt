Azure differences between local fabric and cloud handling of datatypes

We recently spent the afternoon debugging our Azure application after trying to move the storage from the local store to the cloud storage -- the first step in moving the entire thing to the cloud. We came across a problem in where the local fabric storage was letting us store improperly initialized DateTime objects (initialized to DateTime.MinValue, or "0") to an Azure storage table, but the Cloud storage would throw a "value out of range" exception when the value was committed to the table. Is there a way to have the local storage throw the same exceptions as the cloud? Failing that, is there a list of these things? I found an MSDN page on some differences , but it didn't list anything like this.
