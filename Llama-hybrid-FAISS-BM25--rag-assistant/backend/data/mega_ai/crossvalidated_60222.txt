Insignificant VAR coefficients

I am not quite familiar with vector autoregression (VAR). I am thinking of using VAR/IRF (impulse response functions) to illustrate the relations between some time series variables. However, most of the coefficients are not significant. One note I found says it is rare to report the coefficients. I am kind of confused here. To my purpose, is it a big problem if the coefficients are not significant? Thanks.
