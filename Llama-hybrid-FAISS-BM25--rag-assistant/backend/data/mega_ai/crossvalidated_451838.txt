I must disappoint you: current economic theory cannot explain why people keep showing up in elections, because it appears to be irrational. See a survey of literature on this subject on pages 16-35 of Geys, Benny (2006) - "‘Rational’ Theories of Voter Turnout: A Review" . The voter turnout is a percentage of voters that showed up at the poll of a total voting eligible pool. In layman's words it appears that indeed your vote won't make a difference. As in @whuber answer the analysis is closely related to the probability of casting a pivotal vote, i.e. making or breaking a tie. However, I think @whuber is making the question look simpler than it is, and also suggesting much higher probability of pivotal vote than US and European election data analysis suggests. A voter turnout is a paradox indeed. It must be zero according to theory, yet it's in close to 50% range in USA. The answer cannot be derived from pure statistics point of view in my opinion. It belongs to behavioral aspects of human actions, which rational choice models explore, albeit in unsatisfactory way because people keep voting while the theory says they shouldn't. Instrumental Voting The instrumental voting approach that I mentioned earlier (see earlier reference) is the idea that your vote becomes tie breaking, and thus deices whether you gain benefits from electinng your favorite candidate. It is described with an equation for the expected utility R: $$R=PB-C>0$$ Here, P is the probability your vote is tie breaking, B benefits you get from you candidate and C associated with voting. The costs C vary and are split into roughly two categories: research of candidates and things dealing with voter registration, driving to polling stations etc. People looked at these components and came to conclusion that P is so low that any positive cost C outweighs the product PB. Probability P has been considered by many researchers, e,g, see the authorative treatment by Gelman here : Gelman, A., King, G. and Boscardin, J. W. (1998) ‘Estimating the Probability of Events That Have Never Occurred:When Is Your Vote Decisive?' You can find a calculation similar to the setup in @whuber's answer here in NBER paper: THE EMPIRICAL FREQUENCY OF A PIVOTAL VOTE, Casey B. Mulligan, Charles G. Hunter. Note, that this is the empirical research of voting bulletins. However, they have the independent binomial voter setup in theoretical part, see Eq.3. Their estimate is drastically different from @whuber, who came up with $\sim 1/\sqrt{n}$ while this paper derives $P=O(\frac 1 n)$ , which renders very low probabilities. The treatment of probabilities is very interesting, and takes into account many non obvious considerations such whether a voter realizes what are the tie probabilities or not A simple intuitive explanation follows, from Edlin, Aaron, Andrew Gelman, and Noah Kaplan. " Voting as a rational choice: Why and how people vote to improve the well-being of others ." Rationality and society 19.3 (2007): 293-314. Let f(d) be the predictive or forecast uncertainty distribution of the vote differential d (the difference in the vote proportions received by the two leading candidates). If n is not tiny, f(d) can be written, in practice, as a continuous distribution (e.g., a normal distribution with mean 0.04 and standard deviation 0.03). The probability of a decisive vote is then half the probability that a single vote can make or break an exact tie, or f(0)/n. The assumption here is that an exact tie vote will be decided by a coin flip. Empirical results Empirical results suggest that for 20,000 voters, the probability of a tie is $\frac 1 {6000}$ , which is significantly lower than @whuber's model results $\frac 1 {2\sqrt{20000\pi}}=\frac 1 {500}$ Another empirical study is Gelman, Andrew, Katz, Jonathan and Bafumi, Joseph, (2004), Standard Voting Power Indexes Do Not Work: An Empirical Analysis, British Journal of Political Science , 34, issue 4, p. 657-674. Its main conclusion was first cited in @user76284's answer . Authors show that $O(1/\sqrt{n}$ doesn't fit the reality. They analyzed a massive amount of electoral data, election held on many different levels in USA and outside. For instance, here's the plot from US presidential elections, 1960-2000, state vote data. They show the square root n fit vs. lowes (non-parametric) fit. It's clear that square root doesn't fit the data. Here's another plot which also includes European election data. Again square root of n relation doesn't fit the data. Section 2.2.2 in the paper explains the basic underlying assumption of square root result, which helps understand @whuber's approach. Section 5.1 has theoretical discussion.
