You definitely want to use MyISAM for the storage engine. But you say you expect 100 GB and it will only contain a short-ish string value. You definitely want to use a 64-bit int for your identity/primary key. But my real question is. Are you using this to store session information from the web site? If so you want want to use memcache instead of MySQL.
