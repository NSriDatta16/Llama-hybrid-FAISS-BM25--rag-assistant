Including header files style - C++

I have a project which has the following directory structure. root --include ----module1 ----module2 --src ----module1 ----module2 So a file say foo.cpp in src/module1 has to include like, #include "../../include/module1/foo.hpp" This looks messy and tough to write. I found writing include like #include and providing include file search path to root/include when compiling looks neat. However, I am not sure that this style has got any drawbacks. Which one do you prefer and why? Also do you see any problems in organizing files in the above way?
