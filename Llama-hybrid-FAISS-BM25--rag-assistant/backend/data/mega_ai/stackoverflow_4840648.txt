Of the two, only Ninject provides this functionality. It is a useful feature but Autofac excludes it to prevent fragility in other Autofac-specific features that rely on the dependency being unaware of the dependent component. If you have a scenario that would benefit from this kind of behaviour in Autofac, feel free to post it and I'll have a shot at translating it into Autofac's way of doing things :) Hope this helps, Nick
