you need to pay attention to three locations. First have a look at your ext_localconf.php file. For each plugin (by plugin i mean Frontend Plugin) there is a line similar to this one: t3lib_extMgm::addPItoST43($_EXTKEY, 'pi1/class.tx_yourext_pi1.php', '_pi1', 'list_type', 1); To disable the cache you need to set the last value to zero, like this. t3lib_extMgm::addPItoST43($_EXTKEY, 'pi1/class.tx_yourext_pi1.php', '_pi1', 'list_type', 0); Within the Plugin's PHP file (e.g. pi1/class.tx_yourext_pi1.php) you need to ensure that the following line is either deleted, commented out or changed to "false" $pi_checkCHash = true; At last, add this line to your main() function (somewhere below the rest): $this->pi_USER_INT_obj = 1; That should do it. cu Roman
