The way you have it is fine but you could create a set of extension methods to make "a more elegant way to check for the 'NOT' instance." public static bool Is (this object myObject) { return (myObject is T); } public static bool IsNot (this object myObject) { return !(myObject is T); } Then you could write: if (child.IsNot ()) { // child is not an IContainer }
