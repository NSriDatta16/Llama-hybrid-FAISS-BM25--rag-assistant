So build some block elements with a border-bottom . Those will look like underlines and you can play with colors, thicknesses and whatnot. A pragmatic solution: I would make each line a 2-column table, give the left column (with the text) a width of 0% (which will expand to the minimum needed) and the right column (empty with underline) a width of 100% (which will take up the remaining space); and I'd put an empty block with a bottom border into that right table cell. This design of mine violates some ideals held by many other Web designers. I'm not saying this is a fantastic or very standards-compliant design, I only claim it's simple and it works.
