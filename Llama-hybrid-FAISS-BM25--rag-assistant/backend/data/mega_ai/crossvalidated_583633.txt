How to interpret the coefficients of polynomial predictors of logistic regression (summary in R)

I'm performing a logistic regression using polynomial predictior for the first time. I would like to have an explanation on how to intepret the polynomial coefficient of this logistic regression: Context: the target variable (presence) is a dichotomous variable that can be thought as suitable/unsuitable. Here's the summary: Call: glm(formula = presence ~ poly(bio3, 2) + poly(bio8, 2) + poly(bio9, 2) + poly(bio14, 2) + poly(bio15, 2) + poly(bio18, 2), family = "binomial", data = data, weights = weights) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -5.0625 -0.7191 -0.4772 -0.1345 5.6488 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.9112 0.2603 -7.342 2.10e-13 *** poly(bio3, 2)1 0.7902 4.6616 0.170 0.865401 poly(bio3, 2)2 18.4565 5.2450 3.519 0.000433 *** poly(bio8, 2)1 -108.8864 29.1761 -3.732 0.000190 *** poly(bio8, 2)2 -33.3462 16.9549 -1.967 0.049211 * poly(bio9, 2)1 200.5550 21.8391 9.183 I'll use the bio18 (last 2 lines of coefficients section) as an example. I interpret the estimate of poly(bio18, 2)1 as it was bio18^1. So the negative estimate of this predictor (-40.91) tells me that on average the higher is the value of bio18 the more the target is "unsuitable" because it should be a linear relationship. But how can I interpret the estimate of poly(bio18, 2)2 ? I'm very confuse about it. Of course I can't use the same reasoning.
