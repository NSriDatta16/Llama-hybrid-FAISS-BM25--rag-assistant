Alice, Or you can use dynamic PDF documents, which can be integrated with Document Library as content types. Have a look at this product: it allows submitting Pdf forms using Adobe Reader (no Reader Extensions are necessary). Disclaimer: I am using this product and happy with it. It has some limitations but nothing drastic. Robert
