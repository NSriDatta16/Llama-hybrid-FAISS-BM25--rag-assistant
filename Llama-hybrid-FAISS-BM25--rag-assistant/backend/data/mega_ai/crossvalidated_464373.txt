So far just some ideas. According to this paper , also referenced in this book by Frank Harrell , the Mann-Whitney test is equivalent (in some sense) to ordinal logistic regression. In the case of two groups, that is the Wilcoxon test is equivalent to logistic regression. This is somewhat approximate, the equivalence is not with the likelihood ratio test which are usually used, but with the score test. An idea is to exploit this in the case with repeated measures (since repeated measures modeled via mixed models do not have problems with missing observations in some groups.) So use a logistic repeated measures model, the usual one if you have two groups, or proportional odds LR in case of more groups. I can try to flesh that more out if you can give some more details. As a test of the equivalence, I did some simulations in R: k Chi)`[2] c(pval.wilcox=pval.wilcox, pval.glm=pval.glm) }, simplify=TRUE)) Looking at the results, the p-value from wilcox.test is newer smaller than the p-value from logistic regression, but the largest difference is $-0.005$ . So this seems to work well!
