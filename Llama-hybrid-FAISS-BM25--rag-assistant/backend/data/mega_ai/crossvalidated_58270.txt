How to estimate true value and 95% bands when distribution is asymmetrical?

I have a set of results of independent measurements of some physical quantity. As an example I give here real expermental data on methanol refractive index at 25 degrees Celsius published in scientific literature from 1960 to 2011: data={{1960, 1.32652}, {1961, 1.32662}, {1963, 1.32650}, {1963, 1.32750}, {1968, 1.32698}, {1968, 1.32890}, {1970, 1.32657}, {1970, 1.32660}, {1971, 1.3260}, {1971, 1.32610}, {1971, 1.32630}, {1971, 1.3350}, {1972, 1.32640}, {1972, 1.32661}, {1973, 1.32860}, {1975, 1.32515}, {1975, 1.32641}, {1976, 1.32663}, {1977, 1.32670}, {1980, 1.3250}, {1983, 1.32850}, {1985, 1.32653}, {1991, 1.32710}, {1995, 1.32621}, {1995, 1.32676}, {1996, 1.32601}, {1996, 1.32645}, {1996, 1.32715}, {1998, 1.32820}, {1999, 1.32730}, {1999, 1.32780}, {2001, 1.32634}, {2006, 1.32620}, {2011, 1.32667}}; The first number is the year of first publication, the second is the published value. The authors do not always provide their own estimate for error of the published value and even when they do this, the published estimate is often not accurate. It is easy to see that the distribution is asymmetrical (other datasets I work with are even more asymmetrical). Here is a density histogram with bins selected by hands: bins = {1.325, 1.3259, 1.3261, 1.3263, 1.3265, 1.3266, 1.3267, 1.3269, 1.3275, 1.328}; Histogram[dataFirst[[All, 2]], {bins}, "PDF"] Because of asymmetric feature of the distribution I cannot use the mean as an estimate for the true value of methanol refractive index. The fact is that the probability to get smaller value than the true value in general is not equal to the probability to get higher value. This means that the median in general is also unsuitable. It may be assumed that each invidual measurement has normal distribution for the instrumental error of the measurement. Additional sources of error are impurities in methanol. The most common impurity is water which increases the refractive index, but authors usually dry methanol before measurement. Probably this is the reason why the density is higher for low values: other impurities such as some common organic solvents (benzene) and (possibly) diluted gases (methane, carbon oxide, carbon dioxide) lower the refractive index. From the other hand alcohols, aldehydes and ketones which may present in industrial methanol and some organic solvents (CCl4) increase the refractive index. So there at least two sources of error: one (instrumental) may be assumed normally distributed and even equal for the all measurements and the second (impurities) is probably asymmetrical (and may be even bimodal) and depends on how methanol was obtained and purified. What is the best way to estimate the true value and its 95% confidence bands for the measured quantity in such cases? P.S. References for relevant scientific papers will be appreciated. P.S.2. The above code is for Mathematica system.
