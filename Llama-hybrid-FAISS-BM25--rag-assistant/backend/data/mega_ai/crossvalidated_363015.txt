Does Regularized Logistic Regression Produce Calibrated Results?

It has been asked and addressed here that logistic regression modelling is calibrated already and there is no need for calibration of it. To me it seems the argument provided there does not follow when there is a regularization involved. Can somebody please tell me if indeed it is the case that a regularized logistic regression model is not calibrated?
