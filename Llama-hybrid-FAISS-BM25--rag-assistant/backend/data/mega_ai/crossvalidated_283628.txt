Ranking, rating things based on a set of metrics

I need to rank a set of things belonging to different kind (models) based on a list of performance metrics. For thing of each model, I have the aggregated value ( mean) of let's say 4 metrics and each metric of the same importance (weight). So I have the aggregated results for each model for each metric over many experiments like in the below table. +--------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------+ | model | metric1 | metric2 | metric3 | metric4 | metric5 | +--------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------+ | A | 0.14 | 0.10 | 18.9 | 0.78 | -92.1 | | B | 0.02 | 0.01 | 17.6 | 0.52 | -94.7 | | C | 0.00 | 0.01 | 10.1 | 1.28 | -94.2 | | D | 0.03 | 0.02 | 19.2 | 0.64 | -95.1 | +--------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------+ I need to use this to rank the models - A to D. All metrics are equally important. For all metrics, higher the value, the better the rank. The ranking should capture the relative differences for each metric - meaning, for a metric, a model should be heavily rewarded or penalized depending on the direction. One approach I was thinking was to use z-score standardization - for each metric compute the z-scores across models via standardization ( (x- mean) / std_dev ) - subsequently take linear average of the z-score to come up with final score so as to rank the things. Why would it work or not work ? Are there alternate and/or better approaches.
