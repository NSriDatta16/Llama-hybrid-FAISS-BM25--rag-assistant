Data Transfer Speeds: NFS vs HTTP

Am currently considering using REST access to Nirvanix online storage to store/download files. However, Nirvanix also offers NFS access to the network storage. I was wondering if there are any known benchmarks or protocol-specific reasons for choosing REST over NFS?
