Where is business logic situated in MVC pattern?

I use Zend framework and Doctrine. In many projects, business logic is built into the controller . This approach seems wrong as me. The best setup I ever saw it is used service layers , and this is where the business logic was written. All I had to do was create a form, validate it, and use some business logic in service layer. Result validation, business logic and work with one method (for example: newProduct($postData)). What is the right way to organize my business logic in MVC? Maybe I need to read some books, or see some examples of source code.
