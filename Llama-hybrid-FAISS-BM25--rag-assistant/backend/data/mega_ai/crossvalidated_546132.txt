You cannot express it in "do" notation! The conditioning event $X = 1$ would conflict with $do(X = 0)$ . Indeed, the ATT is an example of a counterfactual/"rung 3" causal query that is strictly "deeper" than just an interventional "do"-query. See Pearl, Judea. "The seven tools of causal inference, with reflections on machine learning." Communications of the ACM 62.3 (2019): 54-60.
