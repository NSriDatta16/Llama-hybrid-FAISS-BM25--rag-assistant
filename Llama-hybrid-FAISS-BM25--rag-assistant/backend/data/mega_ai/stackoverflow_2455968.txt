A problem with jQuery draggable with a selector handle

I have a problem where I have code like ... ... ... and JavaScript such that $('#table').draggable(handle: '#table > tr:eq(0) > td:eq(0)'); but for some reason the entire table becomes the handle. It works when I set the td to have an identifier, but does not seem to work with selectors. Am I doing something wrong here?
