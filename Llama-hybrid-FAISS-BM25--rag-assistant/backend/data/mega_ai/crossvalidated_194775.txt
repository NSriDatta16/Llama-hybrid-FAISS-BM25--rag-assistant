You'll likely want some sort of Roll Forward Cross-Validation. Roll-forward works like regular cross validation, only it stipulates that the testing data will always be immediately following the training data. Think of testing known observations by applying the model to a subset of your data that ends at a certain point, and then comparing the model results to a subset of your data that begins immediately after the point you ended your training on. Robert Hyndman has an excellent blog post on implementation of this is R here .
