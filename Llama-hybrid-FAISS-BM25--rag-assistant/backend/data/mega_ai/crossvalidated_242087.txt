Concordance of logistic regression and Cox ph?

I am new to survival analysis and have a very basic question regarding some preliminary results I have produced. Using a dataset with a binary outcome, time to that outcome, as well as a continuous variable of interest I find that the variable of interest is strongly associated with the outcome using logistic regression, but is not associated with survival using Cox regression. The sample is around 1000 with around 150 outcomes. Any thoughts are more than appreciated. Thanks.
