Difference between these WebKit ASP:Menu fixes

I know there are a ton of posts on the ASP:Menu vs. WebKit issue in general, but I cannot find one that answers my question. I frequently see people recommending two different methods to fix the problem with ASP:Menu s in Apple WebKit browsers (i.e., Chrome, Safari). But which is actually better? What is the difference between these two actions besides the targeted user agent? The only difference I found is that the second will also work on the Page_Load event. I assume one is objectively superior to the other, but I do not know the difference between them. How do each of them work? Both go in the Page_PreInit() method of the base page. 1. Clear the browser adapters. if (Request.UserAgent.Contains("AppleWebKit")) { Request.Browser.Adapters.Clear(); } 2. Change the client target. if (Request.UserAgent.Contains("Safari")) { Page.ClientTarget = "uplevel"; } The default user agent for Google Chrome is as follows. It contains both Safari and WebKit, so I doubt the targeted user agent is a significant difference. Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/0.X.Y.Z Safari/525.13.
