Neural Network data type conversion - float from int?

In case of image classification with 0-255 pixel values of integer type, is it necessary/recommended to convert the values into float with Neural Networks? This conversion seems me unnecessary (moreover, float slows down matrix operations) but several implementations follow this practice. Why?
