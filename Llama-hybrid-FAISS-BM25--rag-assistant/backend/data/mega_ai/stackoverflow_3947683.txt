Looks right except make sure you have a constant: public static final String PREFS_COUNT = "MyPrefsFile"; declared at the beginning of your activity. It's all right here in Google's documentation: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#pref Should work fine if you follow that exactly.
