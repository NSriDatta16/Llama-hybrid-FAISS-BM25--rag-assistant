Intra- and inter- observer error, and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)

I have 3 observers, who each perform multiple observations in which they count a phenomenon. I'm trying to quantify both inter- and intra- observer error for this study. I'm new to this and am finding the analysis options quite confusing. Someone recommended using the ICC. I've mocked up some data below with "number of words" on a page as the count variable - this mimics my data structure. I read Shrout and Fleiss (1979), and since I want to generalize to a population of observers it looks like I want the Two-way random effects model, ICC(2,1). My issues are: for intra-observer error (or agreement), should I only include one observer per ICC? In other words, get the ICC for the repeated observations within observers? for inter-observer error (or agreement), should I include all observers and the repeated observations, or should I aggregate the repeated observations so that there is only one for each observer? I'm also not clear on whether I'd want the ICC for a single observation or averaged observations [i.e., ICC(2,1) vs ICC(2,k)]. Code: # data with repeated observations dat
