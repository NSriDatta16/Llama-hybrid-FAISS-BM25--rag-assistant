I would recommend two books if you are interested in smoothing techniques, especially in density estimation and regression (rather than in tests that don’t require classical normality assumptions, which are often based on ranks rather than the raw data): Nonparametric and Semiparametric Models by Härdle, Müller, Sperlich, and Werwatz Li and Racine's Nonparametric Econometrics: Theory and Practice The first is much slimmer, a bit more introductory, with lots of examples and illustrations. It covers histograms, nonparametric density estimation, nonparametric regression, semiparametric and generalized regression models, single index models, generalized partial linear models, additive models and their marginal effects and generalized additive models. The second tome covers nonparametric kernel methods, semiparametric methods, consistent model specification tests, nonparametric nearest neighbor and series methods, and some time series, simultaneous equations, and panel data models at the end. There is not too much about QR in this book. Koenker's QR would make a nice supplement. It is also worth mentioning some other books. While comprehensive and worth reading later, I found Pagan and Ullah to be a difficult first introductions to this material. I have heard good things about Yatchew's Semiparametric Regression book , but I have not read it myself.
