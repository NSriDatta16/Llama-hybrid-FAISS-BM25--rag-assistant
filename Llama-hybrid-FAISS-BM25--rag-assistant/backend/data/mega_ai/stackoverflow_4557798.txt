If you want a database that has fast in-memory access, and persists behind the scenes from time to time, then use a real data store, rather than trying to build your own, which would be quite a big job. Redis and MongoDB are two good options, but there are many others. You can find Clojure libraries at https://github.com/ragnard/redis-clojure and https://github.com/somnium/congomongo for Redis and Mongo, respectively.
