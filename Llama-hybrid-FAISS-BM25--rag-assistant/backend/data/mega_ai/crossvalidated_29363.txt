Is it possible to extrapolate a percentage from given logistic regression coefficients?

If I have done a (binomial) logistic regression. Is it then possible from the coefficients to calculate a percentage of how much each of the variables affects the dependent variable. Say that we have for example var1: 0.635, var2: 0.245, var3: 1.243. If we know that the depends variable Y in the data is 1 at 0.64 of the time. Can we then use this to calculated something a long the lines of: Variable 1 has a 25% effect on Y, Variable 2 15%, and Variable 3 60%?
