YASnippet is cool, and I use it, but it's the wrong tool for this job. The solution to this question is to use a template framework. There are several within emacs. I don't remember all the template systems I evaluated before I set upon defaultcontent.el . It's basically an automated way of performing Thomas Matthews' approach . I tried SkeletonMode, but felt it was too un-templatey to be a template package. With defaultcontent.el, I define the template for each file type, in a template file. There's no elisp necessary. And YASnippet? It's for embedding snippets of code - stuff that appears 1-n times in a module. Examples: for loops, method definitions, class definitions, case statements. In contrast, the file template holds stuff that goes into EVERY FILE, every time. The snippet is something I choose to add to a file or not, depending on the coding requirement.
