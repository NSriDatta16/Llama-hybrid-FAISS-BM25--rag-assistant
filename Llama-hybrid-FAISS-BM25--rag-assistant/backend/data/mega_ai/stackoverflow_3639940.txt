Is -loadImagesForOnscreenRows being called anywhere else? It looks like you started from the LazyTableImages sample code. I could only get that sample project to invoke -loadImagesForOnscreenRows when scrolling ended (or at the end of a drag). Scrolling fast was irrelevant in that project, since the visible rows aren't asked for until scrolling stops. I only tried the LazyTableImages code on the simulator, not a device. YMMV.
