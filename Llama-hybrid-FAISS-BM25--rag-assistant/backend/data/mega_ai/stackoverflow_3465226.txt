Can anyone decipher why this OpenGL Hello World draws a black window?

Please excuse the length (and the width; it's for clarity on an IDE) but I thought of showing the full length of the code since the purpose is a simple Hello World in modern VBO and GLSL. It was initially based on http://people.freedesktop.org/~idr/OpenGL_tutorials/02-GLSL-hello-world.pdf The main point is no single error message or warning is printed - and you can see the printfs are a lot (actually, almost all of the code is attempted to be caught for errors). The compilation is done on -std=c99 -pedantic -O0 -g -Wall (with no warnings) so no much room for compiler error either. I have pin pointed my attention to glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, 0, 4); and glVertexAttribPointer(0, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, BUFFER_OFFSET(0)); (the latter is the only part of the code I don't fully understand yet; most obscure func 'ever') The info log does not print anything and it does print a healthy text normally if the shaders are purposely made invalid. Hence it's neither the shaders string assignment or their compilation. Can you see something that could make it print a blank screen? It does print a single dot in the middle if glDrawArrays is used with GL_POINTS and it does change color if glClear is preceded with an appropriate glClearColor. #include "SDL.h" // Window and program management #include "Glee.h" // OpenGL management; Notice SDL's OpenGL header is not included #include // C99 bool void initGL(void); void drawGL(void); int main (int argc, char **argv) { // Load the SDL library; Initialize the Video Subsystem if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)
