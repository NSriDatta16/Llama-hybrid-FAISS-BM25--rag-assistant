Remove chars in a string until numeric is found in ASP and VB

I am trying to add to a page that someone else has written. I need to take a string that is formated with either 3 or 4 alpha characters followed by a series of numbers. I need to remove these alpha characters so that only a string of numbers is left. Example: What I'm string with is TrailerNumber = "CIN0012345" and I need the result to be TrailerNumberTrimed = "0012345" This is a web application written in an ASP (to be clear not ASPX) and VB page. This code will have to run on the server because it is being used as a search value in a database.
