You're probably not on a Macintosh, and I can't tell if you mean you want to use system copy rather than vim's yank. But if you are both those things, you can use option-drag to select text. This creates a 2d box over the text, selecting things that are under it. It should be functionally the same as 'take columns x1 to x2 of rows y1 to y2'.
