segfault when copying an array to a vector in Linux

I'm trying to debug a legacy code written for Linux. Sometimes the application gets a segfault when it reaches the memcpy call in the following method: std::vector _storage; size_t _wpos; void append(const uint8 *src, size_t cnt) { if (!cnt) return; if (_storage.size() The values are as follows: _storage.size() is 1000 _wpos is 0 *src points to an array of uint8 with 3 values: { 3, 110, 20 } cnt is 3 I have no idea why this happens since this method gets called thousands of times during the application's runtime but it sometimes gets a segfault. Any one has any idea how to solve this?
