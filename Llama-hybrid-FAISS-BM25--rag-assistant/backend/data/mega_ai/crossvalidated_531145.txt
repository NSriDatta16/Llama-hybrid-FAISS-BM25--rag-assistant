Speed up Nearest Neighbour classification in highly duplicated data

I have a classification problem on a data set with 3 features and 2,000,000 examples. I have decided that I want to use K-Nearest Neighbors. Is there a way I can leverage the fact that the data only has 5000-ish unique values to speed up the training and prediction step. By this I mean there are multiple repeated rows. I assume I can modify the weights parameter on SKLearn, but I don't actually know what I would need to do?
