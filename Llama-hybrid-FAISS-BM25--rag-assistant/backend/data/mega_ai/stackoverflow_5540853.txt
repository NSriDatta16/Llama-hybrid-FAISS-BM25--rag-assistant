view.invalidate() not working to redraw imageview

Ok guys, this may sound dumb, but I have been banging my head against the keyboard for some time now trying to figure out why this will not refresh. the basics: I have a little sample app that i am testing to see if i can rotate an image around a point a X amount of degrees, and show it one degree at a time to make a smooth animation. So I have a great sample i found that works great with a slider bar, basically setting the images rotation to a point on the slider bar, great! but.... when i try and create a for loop with a random number and use my for variable updating the image along the way every degree... it does nothing... and all i get is the updated image at the end... but when i drag my finger on he slider bar the graphic is updated instant as me spinning it... I cant figure out what i am doing wrong here... here is the code with the slider... i don't have my piece that creates the random number and draws it but essentially i did it behind a button click essentially if you look at this piece i did the same behind a button again but it doesnt do it "real time". i called view.invalidate() and view.postinvalidate() to try to force it but no go... @Override public void onProgressChanged(SeekBar seekBar, int progress, boolean fromUser) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub curRotate = (float)progress; drawMatrix(); } private void drawMatrix(){ Matrix matrix = new Matrix(); matrix.postScale(curScale, curScale); matrix.postRotate(curRotate); Bitmap resizedBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(bitmap, 0, 0, bmpWidth, bmpHeight, matrix, true); myImageView.setImageBitmap(resizedBitmap); }
