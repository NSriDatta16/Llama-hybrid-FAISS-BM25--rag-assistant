Sorting 2nd array based on first array - strings, c#. Suggestion please

I have two arrays First array has large number of words, i have 2nd array smaller to first array and has some words that are occuring in first array. I need to sort 2nd array based on the order of words in first array. Ex:- firstarray = ["a","c","b"...]; 2ndarray = ["b","c"...]; 2ndarrayaftersort = ["c","b"]; First array is a feature vector and 2nd array is weight vector in SVM classification. Or i need to sort a string of characters...like "0 35:1 44:1 10:1 45:1 46:1 4:1 47:1 18:1 48:1 49:1 50:1 51:1 52:1 53:1 54:1 55:1 56:1 57:1 58:1 59:1 60:1 61:1 62:1 6:1 63:1 64:1 65:1 66:1 67:1 19:1 68:1 69:1 70:1 71:1" In the string above we can see that 10:1 is occuring after 44:1 and so on...i need to see that features are sorted or else Libsvm will not classify correctly. Thanks.
