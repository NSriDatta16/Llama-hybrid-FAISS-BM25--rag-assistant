XPath: generate a relative expression from a root node to a specified node?

How can I generate the required XPath expression to traverse from a given root node to a specified node down the xml structure? I will receive HTML fragment of a table at runtime. I have to find the desired node based on some criteria and the form an XPath string from the table root node to that node and return that. The HTML table structure is not known beforehand. Is there any API in Java that returns the XPath string given the root node and the child node?
