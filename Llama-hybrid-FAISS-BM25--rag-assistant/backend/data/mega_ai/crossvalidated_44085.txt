The following article : Component retention in principal component analysis with application to cDNA microarray data by Cangelosi and Goriely gives a rather nice overview of the standard rule of thumbs to detect the number of components in a study. (Scree plot, Proportion of total variance explained, Average eigenvalue rule, Log-eigenvalue diagram, etc.) Most of them are quite straightforward to implement in R. In general if your scree plot is very inconclusive then you just need to "pick your poison". There is no absolute right or wrong for any data as in reality the number of PCs to use actually depends on your understanding of the problem. The only data-set you can "really" know the dimensionality of is the one you constructed yourself. :-) Principal Components in the end of the day provide the optimal decomposition of the data under an RSS metric (where as a by-product you get each component to represent a principal mode of variation) and including or excluding a given number of components dictates your perception about the dimensionality of your problem. As matter of personal preference, I like Minka's approach on this Automatic choice of dimensionality for PCA which based on a probabilistic interpretation of PCA but then again, you get into the game of trying to model the likelihood of your data for a given dimensionality. (Link provides Matlab code if you wish to follow this rationale.) Try to understand your data more. eg. Do you really believe that 99.99% of your data-set's variation is due to your model's covariates? If not probably you probably don't need to include dimensions that exhibit such a small proportion of total variance. Do you think that in reality a component reflects variation below a threshold of just noticeable differences? That again probably means that there is little relevance in including that component to your analysis. In any case, good luck and check your data carefully. (Plotting them makes wonders also.)
