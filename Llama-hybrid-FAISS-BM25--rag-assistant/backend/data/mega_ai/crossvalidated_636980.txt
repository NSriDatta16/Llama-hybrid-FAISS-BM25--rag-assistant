I am no kind of expert on this topic, but I would be very leery of dichotomizing the results into correct and incorrect when you have a more precise measure available. In particular, I'd be mindful of the quote from George Box (although he made it long before neural networks were available): All models are wrong, but some are useful. The question is how useful each model is, and that's not a yes/no question (except, perhaps, for some that are totally useless).
