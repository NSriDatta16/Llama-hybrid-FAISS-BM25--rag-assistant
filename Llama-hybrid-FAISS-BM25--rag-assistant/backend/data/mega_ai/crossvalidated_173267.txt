How to get prediction from a neural network since its output is standardized?

This is probably a silly question, however, I'm using a neural network in R ("neuralnet" package) to predict a continuous variable from a series of 10 continuous predictors. Using the model without standardizing the data leads to dreadful results, most of the times the training algorithm won't converge and when it converges the model has a very poor fit. To avoid this problem I chose to standardize the training and testing set. This is working very good so far, MSE is lower than the one of a linear model and the net seems to perform good on the testing set. However, the output of the network set is standardized and therefore I face the following problems: How should I get back the original value (i.e. not standardized)? For instance: the net outputs $z_1$ as a prediction for the test set, how do I get $y_1$? ($z_1$ is the standardized prediction for $y_1$.) Right now I am doing this $$ y_1 = z_1 \cdot \text{sd}(data) + \text{mean}(data) $$ where $data$ is the entire dataset. Needless to say that this approach seems not that great (although I get good results within the testing set). Furthermore, if I had to predict new data, using the formula above would probably not be a good idea, right? What should I do?
