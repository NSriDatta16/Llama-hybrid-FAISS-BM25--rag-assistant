Aggregation Estimation Issues

I'm analyzing the effect of a law enforcement measure over time on reported violence for districts in a city. If I consider the city as a whole I have access to a lot of possible control variables (e.g., unemployment, poverty, police expenditures) that I donâ€™t have at the more dis-aggregate district level. I'm wondering what I lose by eschewing a panel analysis (with the possibility of fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity and cross sectional variation) compared to the time series city analysis.
