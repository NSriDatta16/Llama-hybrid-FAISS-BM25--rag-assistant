Correlation between categorical variable and binary variable?

Given a categorical ordered variable with more than two categories (e.g. education) and a binary variable (e.g. gender). Is it reasonable to use correlation as a measure of how both are related? My concern is that it would only take a handful of extreme datapoints (in terms of the categorical variable) to significantly alter the correlation value Edit: I have two groups, one that listens to a certain information source and one that does not. Each of these groups exhibits a certain behavior a number of times on average, between 0 and 10. I’m trying to determine whether individuals who get their information from that one source present a different behavior than the ones who don’t
