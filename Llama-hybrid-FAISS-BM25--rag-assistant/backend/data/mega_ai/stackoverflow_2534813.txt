It really looks like a good idea to separate actual date retrieval and computation of that date from each other, but this could not hold in every situation, e.g. when you want to pre-compute more values and you can do it more efficiently computation method by computation method than customer by customer. This will also allow for future addition of new methods (biweekly delivery, different delivery schema during holidays...). It could be dangerous to have value with semantics dependent on other value. You also want to avoid errorneous data, maybe using enums as suggested, especially for days in a week (don't forget, that not every month has the same length, you would need some Date class with checking rather than just an enum). However if you are looking for the simplest solution, try two variables - day in a year and a day multiplier (but don't forget, that not every year has the same amount of days...).
