Moving folder in SVN, having a bit of trouble

I have a project on codeplex and I'm trying to reorganise the tree structure so it makes a bit more sense and is easier to work with. This is my current layout: TopLevel |-->src |--->ProjectA //This is where all the files are held |-->Core //plus three more folders |-->MyProject.Core |--->trunk |-->src // I want to move all the folders and files in ProjectA into here So I want to move all folders and files under ProjectA to ProjectA.Core/Trunk/src. I checkout the whole source tree and right-clicked dragged the folders under ProjectA folder and selected "move versioned files here" into the src folder, that marked the folders in Project for deletion but the new files in src still had the green tick next to them and not the blue plus button. After I commited the changes I had a look in the repo browser and saw that the folders hadn't been moved and were still in the ProjectA folder. How can I move folders and the files in those folders to a different folder in subversion? Without loosing version history. I'm using TortoiseSVN. EDIT: Turns out it must have been codeplex, I moved my project to google code and everything works fine.
