Calculating precision and recall for LDA

As I understand from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, it produces two matrices- one for document-topic assignments, and one for topic-terms assignments. LDA is unsupervised machine learning algorithm, how could I calculate the accuracy of the output of that algorithm? Is there any common way to calculate precision and recall for topic assignments?
