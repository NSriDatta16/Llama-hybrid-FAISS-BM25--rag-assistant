Universal function approximation with fixed values (as vector or matrix)

I was thinking about way to represent/approximate universal function and came up with the idea that a plain fixed numbers could be used to represent pretty much any function on a fixed interval. I wonder how such approach called. And if it's used in logistic regression, genetic algorithms etc.? The good thing is that it's universal, you can extend it to multiple dimensions and you don't have to make any assumption about function if it should be polynomial or trigonometric etc. I would like to know more about it. But can't find much.
