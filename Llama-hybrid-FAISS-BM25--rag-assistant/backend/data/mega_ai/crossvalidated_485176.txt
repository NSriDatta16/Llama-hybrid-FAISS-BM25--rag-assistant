Let's specify that we are speaking about simple linear regression, $y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+\epsilon_i$ . If Residual = y(i) - yHat(i) and going by my assumption that \epsilon is also = y(i) - yHat(i) The error is $\epsilon_i=y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1x_i$ , the residual is $e_i=y_i-\hat\beta_0-\hat\beta_1x_i=y_i-\hat{y}_i$ . They are not equal. Isn't the formula of RSE just computing the "root(squared mean)" of \epsilon ? You can't compute the root squared mean of $\epsilon$ because you can't observe $\epsilon$ . In other words, you don't know, and will never know, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ , so you can't calculate $y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1x_i$ . What I don't understand here is definition of RSE as " Standard deviation of \epsilon " . Pay attention! Your book says that "The RSE is an estimate of the standard deviation of $\epsilon$ ": since you can't observe $\epsilon$ , the best you can do is using residuals to get an estimate of errors' standard deviation.
