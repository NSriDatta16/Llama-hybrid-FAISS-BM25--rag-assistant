Iâ€™ve used several different types of bug tracking systems over the past 10 years including nothing, a word document, FogBugz, Bugzilla, and Remedy. FogBugz is by far the best one. At that job anyone was allowed to enter bugs, and anyone could assign a bug to anyone else. I found that this worked well especially if I found a small bug in my code. Instead of spending an hour writing e-mails and filling out forms and getting several other people involved, I could quickly log that I found and fixed a bug. This encouraged me to enter all the bugs I found and fix them quickly. If a bug required a lot of work then I would assign it to my manager so he could prioritize it with my other work. At the job where I used Bugzilla, every time a bug was created, assigned, or changed an e-mail was sent to all the developers and managers. This had the opposite effect, it discouraged me from finding and entering bugs in the system.
