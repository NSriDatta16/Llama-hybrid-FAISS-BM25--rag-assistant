oH mY!! I found out what the problem was.. The JNLP file which was generated by a servlet which was copied from an existing program, supplied port-nr arameters. But the port-numbers weren't corrected.. The supplied port was an (Existing) Secure Socket.. my app used a Non-Secure Socket !! What an awfull mistake
