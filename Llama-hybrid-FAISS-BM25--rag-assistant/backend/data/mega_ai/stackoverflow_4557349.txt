This is really no different that looping through one file as long as you pay attention to a few of Perl's tricks. For one file it is common to use use strict; use warnings; use English qw(-no_match_vars); my $filename = 'foo'; open my $file, ' ) { # work with $line } close $file; This can be expanded to two files by opening both and changing the loop conditional to only end when both files are done reading. But there is a catch, when Perl sees a simple read from a file handle as the conditional for a while loop it wraps it in defined() for you, since the conditional is now more than a simple read this needs to be done manually. use strict; use warnings; use English qw(-no_match_vars); my $filename1 = 'foo'; my $filename2 = 'bar'; open my $file1, ' ; $line2 = ; defined($line1) || defined($line2) } ) { # do what you need to with $line1 and $line2 } close $file1; close $file2;
