Mainframes used to just give programmers a number of 'devices' to use. The device corresponsed to a drive or a partition thereof and the programmer was responsible for the organisation of all data on it. Of course they quickly built up libraries to help with that. The only OS I think think of that does use the common hierachical arrangement of flat files (like UNIX) is PICK . That used a sort of relational database as the filesystem.
