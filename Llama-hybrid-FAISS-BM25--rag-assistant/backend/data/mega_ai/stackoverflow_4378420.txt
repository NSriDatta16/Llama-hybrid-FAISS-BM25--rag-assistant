I'm not sure there is enough information to really explain it. If you are modifying a managed entity, the changes should be picked up when the transaction commits or flush is called. So, is the existing entity managed in the current EntityManager context? Does the following work? ManagedEntity oe = em.find(ManagedEntity.class, id); NodeType nt = new NodeType(id); oe.getCnNodeTypes().add(nt); nt.getOtherEntityCollection().add(oe); em.flush(); You could also try calling merge on your managed entity to have it cascade to the new entity instance.
