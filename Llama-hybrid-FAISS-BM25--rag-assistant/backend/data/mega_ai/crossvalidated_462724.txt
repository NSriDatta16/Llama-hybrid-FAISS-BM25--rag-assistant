It is difficult to give a smooth answer without having the data and all required subject knowledge at hand. Still I can throw in some comments. Your validation strategy is fine as long as you decide everything by cross validation and not by the test data (but see 5.). If your best solution picks value at the border, then this is usually not a good grid. It happens for several of your parameters. For such small data, tree depth 5+ seems too much. XGBoost has important additional regularization parameters like l1 and l2 penalties. Usually these need to be tuned as well. Are the rows really independent or are there clusters of rows that invalidate your validation strategy?
