SQL Server 'Login failed for user' not recorded in error log

The following exception is returned to our code during the following: m_cnn = new SqlConnection(); m_cnn.ConnectionString = sxCnn; m_cnn.Open(); ---EXCEPTION INFORMATION--- Exception: in OpenEx. Msg=OpenEx failed. Errors: Index #0 Message: Login failed for user 'xyz'. LineNumber: 65536 Source: .Net SqlClient Data Provider Procedure: Number: 18456 State: 1 The problem I am having is that I cannot find this entry in the SQL error logs in order to look-up the state. For instance, we saw this exception at 11:43am today and when I go to the logs, there is no entry for that time. Is there something that we need to do in order to enable this logging? We have the 'Failed logins only' option selected in the database properties under Security | Login auditing. Yet, we see nothing in there for this issue. Any help is much appreciated.
