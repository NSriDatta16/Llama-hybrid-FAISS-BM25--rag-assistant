Computation differences of RBMs and CNNs

CNNs often surpass RBMs in most computer vision tasks in terms of classification accuracy. However, has there been any analysis comparing the following factors: Hyper-parameter sensitivity Amount of training data required Computational power/time required Note that I do understand that RBMs and CNNs are two completely different algorithms, as covered in this question . However, they can and often are, both used for classification. Even though in classification, the RBM is mostly just used as a feature extractor for an SVM .
