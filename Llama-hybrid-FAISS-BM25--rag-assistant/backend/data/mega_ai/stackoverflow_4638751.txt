JQuery UI: is it possible to know where an object has been dropped?

what I want to do is to know where (not in terms of position (x, y), but a reference to the DOM element) an object was dropped. I have a grid made up with divs where you can drop various items and I need to know which div on the grid was the item dropped on (getting its id would be fine). The callback function function(event, ui) { //code here } has just that ui object who doesn't apparently contain any information about this, but only about the draggable item or its helper.
