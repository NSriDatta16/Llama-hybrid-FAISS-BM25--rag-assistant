KO3 Routing with directory

Have a problem with creating route for my controller. I'd like to organize controllers in directories and I put one controller into users directory. However I have no idea how to access it. There's 127.0.0.1/login/index and I want it to look like this 127.0.0.1/users/login . I moved controller into users directory however have no idea how to force my route to work correctly. Following route is not working: Route::set('users', 'users(/ (/ ))') ->defaults(array( 'controller' => 'login', 'action' => 'index', ));
