Starting iPhone development

I have just started to work as a freelance iPhone developer. Earlier I used to work under an organization so I dont know what exactly things are required for iPhone development. I have knowledge about the things but all things are scattered in my mind. So I am having some questions regarding iPhone development . Is it necessary for me to have a developer certificate before starting developing for iPhone? If I am developing an application for some client , then is it necessary for the client to register as developer so as to post app to the app store? What If post the app using my developer certificate? What I get in return after I pay 99$ to Apple to run the app on my phone? My question may seem wierd but I am so much confused over all these things. Kindly bear with me.
