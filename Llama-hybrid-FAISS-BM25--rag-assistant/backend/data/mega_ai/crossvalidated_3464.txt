I am not sure about which area of science you are referring to (I'm sure the answer would be really different if dealing with biology vs physics for instance...) Anyway, as a biologist, I will answer from a "biological" point of view: How much effort should we put in to understand the application area? I tend at least to read the previous papers from the same authors and look for a few review on the subject if I am not too familiar with it. This is especially true when dealing with new techniques I don't know, because I need to understand if they did all the proper controls etc. How much time should I spend on a report? As much as needed (OK, dumb answer, I know! :P) In general I would not like someone reviewing my paper to do an approximative job just because he/she has other things to do, so I try not to do it myself. How picky are you when looking at figures/tables. Quite picky. Figures are the first thing you look at when browsing through a paper. They need to be consistent (e.g. right titles on the axes, correct legend etc.). On occasion I have suggested to use a different kind of plot to show data when I thought the one used was not the best. This happens a lot in biology, a field that is dominated by the "barplot +/- SEM" type of graph. I'm also quite picky on the "materials and methods" section: a perfect statistical analysis on a inherently wrong biological model is completely useless. How do you cope with the data not being available. You just do and trust the Authors, I guess. In many cases in biology there's not much you can do, especially when dealing with things like imaging or animal behaviour and similar. Unless you want people to publish tons of images, videos etc (that you most likely would not go through anyways), but that may be very unpractical. If you think the data are really necessary ask for the authors to provide them as supplementary data/figures. Do you try and rerun the analysis used. Only if I have serious doubts on the conclusions drawn by the authors. In biology there's often a difference between what is (or not) "statistically significant" and what is "biologically significant". I prefer a thinner statistical analysis with good biological reasoning then the other way around. But again, in the very unlikely event that I were to review a bio-statistics paper (ahah, that would be some fun!!!) I would probably pay much more attention to the stats than to the biology in there.
