I think the way you're thinking about this is a bit confused, let's analyse a few of the things you say: Now let's say I draw a random sample from A such that it contains only members of B If you draw a truly random sample from A, then given you know how A is distributed, you know the true distribution of the mean of the random sample. If you draw a sample from A such that it contains only members of B, and B turns out to be a biased sample of A, then it's usually pretty unlikely you were genuinely sampling at random from A. This is a classic problem in, for example, election polling. Pollsters try to sample from the voting population (voting distribution A), but reach a biased subset (e.g. digitally and politically engaged urban voters, or B). They make inferences about the general population based on their sample assuming random error, but their sampling method means they were not randomly sampling in the first place so they get their inference wrong. I think what you might be trying to ask, or at least a (albeit perhaps not the only) sensible question to ask, might be something like the following: I draw a sample from A, and I want to know whether my sampling method is truly random, or whether I've obtained a biased subset. (note that if B is sampled from A, but you find that "B's mean differs from A", this is equivalent to saying that the sample was not truly random in the first place). One way of doing this is by calculating the p-value of obtaining the sample mean you obtained. You do need to know the details of the population distribution A you were sampling from, it isn't clear to me either from your question whether this is known or not. Likewise, the Bayesian method would be to assume an underlying distribution for B. If you know that A is normally distributed with known mean and variance, you could assume that B is also normally distributed with the same variance, assume a prior which is centred around the mean of A, and do an inference on the mean of B using Bayes Theorem. Then you could calculate the confidence you have that the mean of B is within $\pm x$ of the mean of A. If your confidence is high that the mean of B within $\pm $ of the mean of A, where x is pretty small, you can conclude that your sampling method is likely to be "not very biased". If your sample sizes are small, then this method becomes very sensitive to your prior, something some people find dis-satisfactory about Bayesian methods.
