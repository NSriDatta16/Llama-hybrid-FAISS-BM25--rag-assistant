Start reading a bit of everything, investigate problems and solutions people propose, see what interests you more. There are some papers comparing different algorithms in some tasks, I find these the most entertaining to read. I started working with LDA and KNN in college, for example. When I couldn't really achieve my goals with it I moved onto trees and then to kernel methods, which really interest me to this day. All the while I studied a lot on resampling and optimization strategies, evaluation metrics and heuristics, as this has a lot to do with kernel selection in SVMs and other associated methods. I never touched some really popular topics, like neural networks. If I were to start again, I'd like to have a good understanding of PCA and ICA and, above all, proper cross-validation procedure.
