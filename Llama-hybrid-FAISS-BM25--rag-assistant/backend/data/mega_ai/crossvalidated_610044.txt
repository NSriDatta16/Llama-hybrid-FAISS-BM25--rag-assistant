Is the multiple correlation coefficient $(R)$ undefined in the case of negative determination coefficients $(R^2)$ - Neural network models?

I noticed that in some low performance models of neural networks, the value of $R^2$ (coefficient of determination) can be negative. That is, the model is so bad that the mean of the data is better than the model. The question is: in linear regression models, the multiple correlation coefficient $(R)$ can be calculated using the root of $R^2$ . However, this is not possible for a model of neural networks, for example, that presents a negative $R^2$ . In that case, is $R$ mathematically undefined?
