The short answer is: you would not expect the summing of two percentages which have two different denominators to have any particular meaning. Hence, the approach to take an average measure such as F1, F2 or F0.5. The latter retain at least the property of a percentage. What about their meaning though? The beauty of Precision and Recall as separate measures is their ease of interpretation and the fact that they can be easily confronted with the model's business objectives. Precision measures the percentage of true positives out of the cases classified as positive by the model. Recall measures the percentage of true positives found by the model out of all the true cases. For many problems, you will have to choose between optimizing either Precision or Recall. Any average measure looses the above interpretation and boils down to which measure you prefer most. F1 means either you don't know whether you prefer Recall or Precision, or you attach equal weight to each of them. If you consider Recall more important than Precision, then you should also allocate a higher weight to it in the average calculation (e.g F2), and vice versa (e.g F0.5).
