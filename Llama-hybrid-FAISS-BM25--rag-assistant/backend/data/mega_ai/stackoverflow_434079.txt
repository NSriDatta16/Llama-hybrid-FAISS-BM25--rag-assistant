It sounds like you have already decided on a document format, which is HTML based on MediaWiki markup. Also you should generate Entity-Relationship Diagrams which are useful additions to database documentation (though ERD's don't tell the whole story either). Do you mean document organization, i.e. what headings and content should be included in each page? Here are some suggestions: Table Structure Column names, data types, constraints Meaning and usage of each column Extra logical constraints in triggers and application code Indexes defined Relationships to other tables Tables dependent on this one Tables this one depends on Notes on special or implicit relationships, that have no enforcement through database constraints Usage of table Usage in stored procedures Usage in application code Usage in views Who has read and/or write access; SQL privileges of each user or role There are other questions at StackOverflow that are very close to this one. " How to document a database " is a very similar question to yours, since it's specifically about wiki documentation solutions. " What are the best ways to understand an unfamiliar database " may give you some good tips, as you are creating documentation that would help someone in that situation. " How do you document your database structure? " is related but not as closely, because it's about putting documentation into the metadata itself.
