How do I know when I've stopped scrolling a TScrollBar?

I've used some programs with scroll bars that update the linked content while you're still dragging the "thumb", and others that don't until you release the mouse. This implies that there are different types of Windows messages involved here. But all I can find from TScrollBar is an OnScroll event which fires continually while you're dragging. It also doesn't have a OnMouseDown or OnMouseUp event. Is there any way to set up an "OnEndDragging" notification for a TScrollBar?
