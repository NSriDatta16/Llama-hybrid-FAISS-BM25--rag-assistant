Embedding a swfs with the same class structure

Hello I am an Indie programmer that is using flash develop. I am trying to make a AS3 app that holds a collection of games. I tried embedding the swf file (the game) into a program that has a similar class structure. When I run the program it loops every time i try to run the game. Am i going about this wrong or should i go a different route.
